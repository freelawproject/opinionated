Whether the Circuit Court was authorized to order, through a preliminary injunction, Appellants to reinstate medical benefits to Appellees, as prescribed under the Medical Assistance Program, both retrospectively from 26 October 2005, the date the original Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction were filed, back to 1 July 2005 and prospectively from 26 October 2005 until final disposition of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">In its written memorandum opinion explaining why it issued the preliminary injunction, the Circuit Court summarized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>relevant factual and legislative background as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Based solely on the original Complaint filed on October 26, 2005, the Plaintiffs are comprised of Flor Perez and Ana Perez (by their father and next friend, Fidel Perez); Brayan Herrera, Osyaldo Herrera, and Leslie Herrera (by their mother and next friend, Martha Herrera); and Gabriel Ntitebem, Henry Anu, and Vitalis Aternafac (by their mother and next friend, Ajong Pamela Nkahinjo). They have filed their original Complaint against the Defendants, who are comprised of the Governor (Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr.), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (S. Anthony McCann), and the Treasurer (Nancy Kopp) for one count of Violation of Maryland Declaration of Rights. On the day of the scheduled hearing for the Request for a Preliminary Injunction, the Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, identifying five additional Plaintiffs. However, for purposes of this Preliminary Injunction, the Court viewed the case in light of the facts as set forth in the original Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Generally, the Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint alleges that the State of Maryland, through Governor Ehrlich\u2019s budgetary authority, discriminated and otherwise unconstitutionally denied certain persons living in the State access to health care [under \u00a7 15-103, called the Medical Assistance Program]. The Plaintiffs[ ] further contend that the State relied upon the classification of \u201calienage\u201d in making their decision to deny health care coverage of these individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">On April 7, 2005, the General Assembly enacted the fiscal year 2006 Budget. In mid-June, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene mailed a notice to all resident alien recipients, including the Plaintiffs named herein, to inform them that their current benefits would end starting June 30, 2005 as a result of the Governor\u2019s decision to eliminate such funding. The notice provided for a right to appeal the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>termination of coverage to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH).[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] The notice also informed the recipients that there were alternative options for publicly subsidized health care coverage. Specifically, the recipients were advised to apply to their local health department for Maryland Children\u2019s Health Program (MCHP) coverage if they are under 19 years of age. The Department also notified the local health departments in each jurisdiction that funding for this coverage group had been eliminated from the fiscal year 2006 Budget and thereby instructed the local departments to assist persons in this group with finding similar care wherever possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Despite the Department\u2019s efforts, Plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, have been precluded as a result of their own indigence. Coupled with their inability to pay, most of these programs are unable to provide such necessary services that were previously covered under the Medical Assistance Program. Often times these alternative programs are simply closed to new patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\n<em>LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In order to thoroughly understand the issues at hand, it is imperative that this Court outline the Federal and State statutory programs upon which the Plaintiffs previously relied for their health care services.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">A. FEDERAL PROGRAMS</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">i <em>Medicaid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Medicaid is a federal program established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396v. \u201cCongress has authorized grants to states for the purpose of enabling each state, as far as practicable under the conditions in such state, to furnish medical assistance to persons who are eligible thereof.\u201d 81 C.J.S. Social Security and Public Welfare \u00a7 247. Eligible individuals include certain indigent persons, such as the \u201caged,\u201d \u201cblind\u201d and \u201cdisabled.\u201d Medicaid also provides coverage for pregnant women and children who fall below a certain income threshold, in addition to covering medically needy persons, such as elderly persons who are confined to nursing homes and whose medical expenses have exhausted their other assets. If a state chooses to take part in the federal Medicaid program, it must comply with the requirements set forth in Title XIX and its implementing regulations in order to receive federal matching funds. In Maryland, the federal matching fund is about 50% of the total expenditures. <em>See </em>Federal Matching Shares for Medicaid, 68 Fed. Reg. 67676 (Dec. 3, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">\n<em>ii. Federal Welfare Reform Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">On August 22, 1996, Congress enacted legislation that significantly impacted Medicaid coverage for select individuals residing in the U.S. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, generally know as the \u201cWelfare Reform Act,\u201d was a program designed to further the national immigration policy of \u201cself-sufficiency.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(1). The statement of national policy concerning welfare and immigration reads, in part: \u201cIt is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Act ultimately rendered non-qualified aliens ineligible for Federal Medicaid benefits, while also creating two categories for qualified aliens. <em>Ali[e]ssa v. Novello, </em>96 N.Y.2d 418, 426[, 730 N.Y.S.2d 1], 754 N.E.2d 1085 (2001); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613. The language states: \u201cAn alien who is a qualified alien (as defined in section 1641 of this title) and who enters the United States on or after August 22, 1996, is not eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the alien\u2019s entry into the United States with a status within the meaning of the term \u2018qualified alien.\u2019 \u201d 8 U.S.C. 1613(a). Among the provisions of the Welfare Reform Act was the elimination of all benefits for illegal immigrants and other \u201cnon-qualified aliens,\u201d with a few limited exceptions such as emergency medical care. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1613. In doing so, Congress divided the two qualified alien categories into two subcategories: (1) qualified aliens who have resided in the U.S. since a time prior to August 22, 1996. <em>Id. </em>Some states were required to provide funding to the first subcategory of qualified aliens. <em>Id. </em>However, a period of five years residency in the U.S. was required for the second subcategory. <em>Id. </em>Congress then authorized the States to enact any law <em>after </em>August 22,1996, should they choose to compensate this newly designated class of ineligible aliens, provided they use only State funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">B. MARYLAND STATE PROGRAMS</p>\n<p id=\"Az2\">\n<em>i. Maryland\u2019s Welfare Innovation Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\u201cState participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but if a state participates, it must comply with the federal statutes and regulations governing the programs. However, there is no legal prohibition preventing a state legislature from awarding medical assistance benefits on its own, independent of federal reimbursement.\u201d 81 C.J.S. Social Security and Public Welfare \u00a7 247; <em>see also San Lazaro Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Connell, </em>286 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 878, 123 S.Ct. 78, 154 L.Ed.2d 133 (2002); <em>Westside Mothers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>v.

In 1997, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 593, the \u201cWelfare Innovation Act,\u201d adding Health-General Article \u00a7 15 \u2014 103(a)(2)(viii) to the Maryland Annotated Code. This addition thereby authorized the state to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201c[s]ubject to the limitations in the State budget and any other requirements imposed by the State, comprehensive medical care and other health care services for all legal immigrant children under the age of 18 years and pregnant women who meet Program eligibility standards and who arrived in the U.S. on or after August 22, 1996, the effective date of the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Md. Ann. Code, Health-General Article \u00a7 15-103(a)(2)(viii). The [statutory provision] provides for medical assistance to this newly excluded class of alien, pregnant women and children deemed ineligible for non-emergency, Federal Medicaid benefits. Although the Maryland State Medicaid program, along with federal matching funds, provides the same medical services as available under the Welfare Innovation Act to both citizens and resident aliens who meet the five-year residency requirement, this new provision is limited to those aliens for whom federal Medicaid eligibility was eliminated by the Welfare Reform Act. Therefore, it is funded entirely with state funds. Here, the State used the authority granted by Congress under the Welfare Reform Act. [The benefits established by the adoption of \u00a7 15-103] became known as the Medical Assistance Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">C. THE MARYLAND STATE BUDGET</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Every year in Maryland, the Governor submits a proposed budget bill to the General Assembly containing the proposed budgetary measures for the State government for the following fiscal year. Unlike a \u201cgive and take\u201d relationship between the Legislative and Executive branches ..., the General Assembly is free to reduce the Governor\u2019s budget<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ary proposals, but it may <em>not </em>increase or amend. <em>See </em>MD Const., Art. 3, \u00a7 52(6).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">Except as expressly mandated by the Constitution or statutes, the Governor has complete discretion over the inclusion of appropriations in the Budget and the amount for the executive branch. The constitutional mandates relate to funding the public schools, redemption of the State debt, the payment of certain salaries. With the consent of the General Assembly, the Governor can amend or supplement the Budget Bill prior to its passage. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the General Assembly has express power only to strike or reduce appropriations in the Budget Bill. However, this express power includes the implied power to condition or qualify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adg\">Richard E. Israel, Archives of Maryland Online, \u201cMaryland\u2019s Budget Process,\u201d [] www.mdarchives.state.md.us/ megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/html/budget.html (last visited December 29, 2005). Despite its ability to \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201cqualify\u201d the revisions in the proposed Budget, the General Assembly is precluded from deciding that a particular appropriation is under funded. Maryland\u2019s Legislative branch is powerless to realign the Governor\u2019s proposed spending like[, for example,] the legislatures in New York and Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\n<em>iv. The Fiscal Year 2006 Maryland Budget: The \u201cCarve-Out\u201d Provision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Recently, the fiscal year 2006 Budget as proposed by the Governor eliminated funding for the Medical Assistance Program. This budget cut essentially carved the aforementioned category of legal, resident aliens out of the State\u2019s final Budget Bill. There are currently no funds available in the budget for the women, who were not pregnant, and children, both who were in this program at the beginning of the current fiscal year \u2014 however, [\u00a7 15-103] remains in force. Despite their ability to condition or qualify certain budgetary measures, the Maryland General Assembly never had the option to restore funding to the program, as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>would have resulted in the General Assembly overstepping its Constitutional boundaries!.] [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">On 12 January 2006, the Circuit Court issued a written memorandum opinion and order granting Appellees\u2019 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. In its opinion, the Circuit Court explained its view that Appellees satisfied the four requisite elements for issuance of a preliminary injunction. Specifically, the trial court determined that: the balance of convenience clearly favored Appellees because they suffered great harm as a result of the State\u2019s budget cut; Appellees were irreparably injured as a result of the State\u2019s action because they were unable to afford health care without the unfunded State assistance; the public interest \u201cis best served if the [State is] required to provide benefits to [Appellees] for which they are currently entitled [under \u00a7 15 \u2014 103(a)(2)(viii)];\u201d and, finally, Appellees demonstrated that they likely would succeed on the merits of their Article 24 equal protection claim. It is this latter determination to which most of the parties\u2019 attentions are directed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">With regard to the likelihood of success on the merits, the Circuit Court explored the principles of equal protection under Article 24. While acknowledging that Appellees are \u201cappropriately classified as \u2018aliens,\u2019 \u201d the court determined that the allegations pertained to the denial of Appellees\u2019 equal protection right \u201cbased on their status as individuals who are legally entitled to State funding [under \u00a7 15-103(a)(2)(viii) ] \u2014 not as a suspect class.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, rather than focusing upon the \u201c \u2018alien-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>age\u2019 classification\u201d to determine the appropriate standard of review to apply to the State action, the court looked to the \u201cGovernor\u2019s decision to cut funding to a legally entitled group of individuals.... \u201d Recognizing that, in considering equal protection challenges, a rational basis standard of review generally applies to examining State action with regard to economic and social welfare issues, the Circuit Court determined that the \u201cimpact on [Appellees] ... is far too disparate to ignore \u2018alienage\u2019 as an underlying classification.... \u201d Therefore, the court reviewed the constitutional claim as to the budget cut under a strict scrutiny standard. The court then concluded that the State failed to advance a sufficient basis \u201cas to how [its] budgetary interest was compelling enough to overcome strict scrutiny.\u201d The court noted that \u201ccutting welfare funds to legally entitled individuals is certainly not narrowly tailored enough to overcome strict scrutiny.\u201d Consequently, the Circuit Court reasoned that the State failed to meet its burden and determined that Appellees likely would succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The Circuit Court ordered \u201cthat the benefits payable under the Health-General Article \u00a7 15-301, <em>et seq. </em>previously denied to [Appellees] be ... retroactively reinstated\u201d and further ordered \u201cthat the benefits payable under the Health-General Article \u00a7 15-301, <em>et seq. </em>be ... reinstated until final disposition of this action.\u201d Appellants filed with the Circuit Court a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, an Answer, and a Motion for Stay Pending Appeal on 19 January 2006. Appellees filed an opposition on 23 January 2006. That same day, the Circuit Court issued a separate order staying the part of the preliminary injunction that ordered payment of retrospective benefits, but denied a stay in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The Court of Special Appeals issued an order on 7 February 2006 staying the judgments entered on the Circuit Court\u2019s orders, pending appeal, without prejudice to the right of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>current Appellee, at that time, to seek from the Circuit Court \u201cappropriate limited relief from the stay upon a full and complete showing that (1) in order to avoid a serious risk to his or her health, the Appellee must receive particularized medical treatment prior to April 7, 2006, (2) the Appellee would have coverage for this treatment if the Orders of the circuit court had not been stayed by this Order, and (3) the Appellee will not be provided with necessary treatment unless the circuit court grants appropriate relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">After Appellants\u2019 brief on the merits was filed in the intermediate appellate court, but before further action could be taken by that court, we issued a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals on 9 March 2006. <em>Ehrlich, </em>391 Md. at 577, 894 A.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">General Standards Applicable to the Review of the Grant of Injunctive Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">\u201cOur review of a preliminary injunction is limited because we do not now finally determine the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments.\u201d <em>LeJeune v.

The four factors that the trial judge examines when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>considering the appropriateness of granting a preliminary injunction include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; (2) the \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d determined by whether greater injury would be done to the defendant by granting the injunction than would result from its refusal; (3) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\"><em>Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 404-05, 474 A.2d at 197 (citing <em>State Dep\u2019t v.

The party seeking the preliminary injunction has the burden of adducing facts necessary to satisfy these factors. <em>Fogle, </em>337 Md. at 456, 654 A.2d at 456. The \u201cfailure to prove the existence of even one of the four factors\u201d precludes the grant of injunctive relief. <em>Id. </em>With regard to the factor of the likelihood of success on the merits, \u201cthe party seeking the interlocutory injunction must establish that it has a real <em>probability </em>of prevailing on the merits, not merely a remote <em>possibility </em>of doing so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Yet, \u201ceven with respect to a discretionary matter, a trial court must exercise its discretion in accordance with correct legal standards.\u201d <em>LeJeune, </em>381 Md. at 301, 849 A.2d at 459 (Citation omitted).

[is] appropriately classified as [a] question[ ] of law, we review the issue[] <em>de novo\u201d). </em>Consequently, we apply the <em>due novo </em>standard to that factor, but the more deferential abuse of discretion standard to the trial judge\u2019s determinations as to the remaining three factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The Parties\u2019 Main Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"AMAD\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Level of Judicial Scrutiny to be Accorded to the Appellants\u2019 Action in the Equal Protection Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Appellants assert that the Circuit Court erred in granting the preliminary injunction because Appellees lacked a real probability of prevailing on the merits of their Article 24 claim. Appellants contend that their failure to appropriate funds for medical benefits to a subcategory of legal aliens who, by virtue of congressional action under PRWORA, were ineligible to receive federal medical benefits is subject to rational basis review under the Supremacy Clause and withstands Appellees\u2019 equal protection challenge under that standard. Under the Supremacy Clause, Appellants contend, consideration of Appellees\u2019 state constitutional claim requires judicial deference to Congress\u2019 plenary power over naturalization and immigration policy. Relying on <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), and <em>Fiallo v. Bell, </em>430 U.S. 787, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977), Appellants argue that Congress\u2019 power over the admission and naturalization of aliens is complete and broad such that Congress\u2019 actions are subject to narrow judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Although conceding that the State may not exercise independently a like power over aliens, Appellants maintain that, in adopting the Welfare Reform Act, Congress prescribed a uniform rule for the treatment of an alien sub-class in regard to the provision of medical benefits, which Maryland could follow, citing as support <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2396 n. 19, 72 L.Ed.2d 786, 800 n. 19 (1982), <em>Toll v. Moreno, </em>458 U.S. 1, 102 S.Ct. 2977, 73 L.Ed.2d 563 (1982), <em>DeCanas v. Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 358 n. 6, 96 S.Ct. 933, 47 L.Ed.2d 43 (1976), and <em>Graham, v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971). It is necessary to apply this relaxed standard of scrutiny to both federal and state laws that follow a federal classification because \u201c[i]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>would make no sense to say that Congress has plenary power in the area of immigration and naturalization and then hold that the Constitution compels the states to refrain from adhering to the federal guidelines [when a state denies state-funded welfare benefits to certain aliens],\u201d quoting <em>Sudomir v. McMahon, </em>767 F.2d 1456, 1466 (9th Cir.1985) (applying rational basis review in rejecting equal protection challenge to the State\u2019s denial of State-funded welfare benefits to a sub-class of aliens).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Appellants offer that the reason for the Maryland budget cut was to achieve a cost savings of seven million dollars (equal to the amount of funds appropriated in the Medical Assistance Program in Fiscal Year (\u201cFY\u201d) 2005, inclusive of the estimated number of individuals of the legal alien sub-class to which Appellees belong) of the four billion dollar budget appropriated for medical assistance health care costs generally. They maintain that Congress provided a \u201csufficient showing of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason\u201d to discriminate against the relevant alien sub-class in the provision of federal Medicaid benefits, by including legislative findings in the Welfare Reform Act. These legislative findings provide that the provisions of the Welfare Reform Act were necessary to achieve the national immigration policy of encouraging self-sufficiency and removing incentives for illegal immigration. The Act\u2019s findings also provide that a State choosing not to provide non-emergency medical benefits to aliens excluded from federal benefits by the Welfare Reform Act, as Maryland did in the FY 2006 Budget, \u201cshall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy,\u201d quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(7). Appellants argue that the Supremacy Clause restrains Maryland State courts from disregarding Congress\u2019 direction in this area of immigration policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Finally, as to the correct standard of review to be applied to the Article 24 challenge, Appellants assert that the Welfare Reform Act grants Maryland the ability to determine whether and to what extent it will use State funds to provide non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>emergency medical benefits to resident aliens who do not meet the five-year residency requirement, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1622(a), 1624(a), provided that any prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed by Maryland are not more restrictive than the prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed under comparable federal programs, see 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1624(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Appellees, on the other hand, maintain (as Appellants seem to concede) that the budget cut of State-funded medical assistance to certain resident aliens was a classification based upon alienage, and is therefore a suspect classification, relying on <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992), and <em>Graham, supra, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534. Appellees argue that, because Appellants used a classification based on alienage in cutting State-funded medical assistance to the relevant sub-class of legal aliens depending on their length of residency in the United States, a court reviewing the State action must apply the strict scrutiny standard, see, e.g., <em>Graham, </em>403 U.S. at 370-76, 91 S.Ct. at 1851-54, 29 L.Ed.2d at 540-44, <em>Nyquist v. Mauclet, </em>432 U.S. 1, 8, 97 S.Ct. 2120, 2125, 53 L.Ed.2d 63, 70 (1977), and <em>Takahashi v. Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n., </em>334 U.S. 410, 418-22, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 1142-44, 92 L.Ed. 1478, 1486-89 (1948). Appellees and Appellants agree that if Congress prescribed a truly uniform rule or standards for the treatment of aliens and a State abided by that rule or applied properly those standards when it chose to discriminate against or between resident aliens within its territory, a reviewing court should apply a rational basis scrutiny to determine whether the State action violated equal protection rights. The parties part ways thereafter. Appellees assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>that PRWORA provides no uniform rule or evaluative standards with regard to decisions involving State-funded medical assistance programs because PRWORA leaves unbridled discretion to the individual States to decide how each will treat the class of resident aliens that immigrated to the United States on or after 22 August 1996 and therefore have not resided in the United States for five years. Thus, Appellees argue that the appropriate standard of review of the State action here is strict scrutiny. Furthermore, Appellees contend that Appellants\u2019 reason for the budget cut (cost savings) is not a sufficiently compelling state interest to justify its discrimination against an alien sub-class when fashioning its medical assistance plan budget, citing, e.g., <em>Graham, </em>403 U.S. at 374, 91 S.Ct. at 1853-54, 29 L.Ed.2d at 543 (\u201c[A] State\u2019s desire to preserve limited welfare benefits for its own citizens is inadequate to justify ... making noncitizens ineligible for public assistance benefits ... and restricting benefits to citizens and longtime resident aliens.\u201d), and <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Appellees bring to our attention that a similar medical assistance funding restriction adopted in New York, based on alienage, was found to be unconstitutional, under state and federal equal protection guarantees, in <em>Aliessa v. Novello, </em>96 N.Y.2d 418, 730 N.Y.S.2d 1, 754 N.E.2d 1085 (2001). The Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Aliessa </em>concluded that, in contrast to the federal government, States may only discriminate against immigrants in State-funded programs if the federal government has prescribed by uniform rule what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien sub-class, citing language from footnote 19 in <em>Plyler v. Doe. Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1096 (discussing <em>Graham). </em>The court concluded that, by enacting PRWORA, Congress did not establish a uniform rule for States regarding the provision of medical assistance to legal immigrants because Congress left to the States\u2019 discretion the development of their own individualized policies regarding the provision of State-funded medical assistance to legal immigrants. <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1098. Because New York\u2019s termination of State-funded bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>fits to resident aliens was not pursuant to a uniform federal rule or set of criteria, our sister high court reviewed the State action under the strict scrutiny test, concluded that it did not pass that review, and held that the State action violated the Equal Protection guarantees of the federal and New York constitutions. <em>Id. </em>The legal reasoning applied by the court in <em>Aliessa </em>applies, it is submitted by Appellees, with equal force to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Judicial Action Possibly Implicating State Budget Appropriations Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Appellants claim that the Circuit Court lacked the authority to issue a preliminary injunction requiring expenditure of State funds to pay for medical benefits that were not appropriated in the FY 2006 Budget. Appellants\u2019 argument is based on the contention that Maryland law does not permit constitutional and statutory requirements governing public expenditures to be overborne by a violation of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Appellants characterize the Circuit Court\u2019s order as an illegal order for the expenditure of unappropriated funds, in contravention of Article III, \u00a7 32 of the Maryland Constitution (which provides that State funds must be appropriated through the comprehensive executive budget procedure pursuant to Article III, \u00a7 52); <em>see also Md. Act. for Foster Child, v. State, </em>279 Md. 133, 148, 367 A.2d 491, 499 (1977); <em>Judy v. Schaefer, </em>331 Md. 239, 250, 627 A.2d 1039, 1044-45 (1993); <em>Dorsey v. Petrott, </em>178 Md. 230, 242, 13 A.2d 630, 636 (1940); <em>Philip Morris v. Glendening, </em>349 Md. 660, 681, 709 A.2d 1230, 1240 (1998). Maryland Code (1985, Repl. Vol. 2006), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7\u00a7 7-205, 7-234(a) and (c) likewise prohibits the expenditure of State funds not appropriated properly by law and provides for the removal of any State officer or employee who violates that prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Appellants contend that the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201cdeparture from the requirements of the Constitution\u201d in granting the prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>nary injunction is not justified by a likely equal protection violation under Article 24 because the Maryland Declaration of Rights would not trump the express demands of the Constitution. Rather, Appellants posit that if there exists a conflict between Article 24 and the specific provisions of the Maryland Constitution governing budget and appropriations requirements, then the specific provisions prevail, relying on <em>Commission on Medical Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 410-11, 435 A.2d 747, 757-58 (1981), and <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>306 Md. 597, 602 n. 2, 510 A.2d 583, 585 n. 2 (1986). By expressly providing that the prohibition against unappropriated expenditures applies to \u201cany order,\u201d Article III, \u00a7 32 forecloses the possibility that the constitutional provisions establishing budget and appropriations requirements may be suspended or evaded by the expedient of a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Characterizing the Circuit Court\u2019s preliminary injunction order as an appropriation of funds from the State Treasury, Appellants maintain that the constitutional prerequisites for a lawful expenditure of State funds are not satisfied here and that there has been no appropriation for the benefits that the preliminary injunction orders be paid. Thus, Appellants argue, the payment of funds may not be ordered or made from the State Treasury to satisfy the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Appellees counter that the Circuit Court possessed the authority to fashion the preliminary injunction as it did. First, Appellees assert that the Governor\u2019s budgetary authority, although far-reaching, is subject to fundamental constitutional limitations, including Article 24. This Court can give both Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7\u00a752 and 32 of the Maryland Constitution full effect, as part of an integrated document, by requiring the Executive not to violate the Declaration of Rights in the course of exercising his budgetary authority, a reading that Appellees posit is required by both the history of the Budget Amendment and its subsequent interpretations by this Court. Appellees also contend that Article III, \u00a7 32 pertains to legislative orders, not judicial orders, relying on <em>Dorsey, supra, </em>178 Md. at 237, 13 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>634, and Philip B. Perlman Debates of the Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The Circuit Court did not order the direct expenditure of specific funds; rather the injunctive order \u201cwas designed to remedy a constitutional violation and protect [Appellees] from irreparable harm, while leaving the mechanism for rectifying the constitutional violation entirely up to Appellants.\u201d Appellees argue that because the Budget Bill provides for a lump sum appropriation, of which some small portion is restricted for specific purposes (for example, the FY 2005 budget provided for a total of approximately $4 billion for medical care provider costs, of which some portion is used for medical assistance), the general language of the appropriation leaves significant leeway to the DHMH to move funds within broad categorical appropriations in order to satisfy the court\u2019s order. Appellees also highlight that, in recent years, when the State\u2019s medical assistance expenditures exceeded budget projections, Appellants did not deny coverage to eligible recipients, but instead, routinely included in the annual Budget Bill amounts to cover the prior year\u2019s deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We consider first whether the failure to fund as to Appellees (and the sub-class of legal aliens of which they are a part) the Medical Assistance Program for FY 2006, i.e., the budget cut, violates the principles of equal protection embodied in Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 24 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are in pan <em>materia, </em>and we generally apply them in like manner and to the same extent. <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 640, 458 A.2d 758, 781 (1983). Although the two are capable of divergent application, \u201c[w]e have, however, long recognized that decisions of the [U.S.] Supreme Court interpreting the equal protection clause of the federal constitution are persuasive authority in cases involving the equal treatment provisions of Article 24.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 704-05, 426 A.2d 929, 940-41 (1981), and <em>Bureau of Mines v.

Consequently, even though Appellees ground their equal protection challenge solely on Article 24, we shall consider the argument in light of both cases interpreting and applying the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Differing standards have evolved for reviewing classifications challenged under the equal protection guarantees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">In most instances when a governmental classification is attacked on equal protection grounds, the classification is reviewed under the so-called \u201crational basis\u201d test.

In <em>Mathews v. Diaz, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 84, 96 S.Ct. at 1889, 48 L.Ed.2d at 492, the Court upheld a federal statute that conditioned an alien\u2019s eligibility for participation in a federal medical insurance program on continuous residence in the United States for a five-year period and admission for permanent residence. The Court noted the broad power over naturalization and immigration pursuant to which Congress regularly enacts rules governing aliens. <em>Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 79-80, 96 S.Ct. at 1891, 48 L.Ed.2d at 489-90. The Court also acknowledged that decisions regarding the relationship between the United States and aliens may implicate our country\u2019s relations with foreign powers \u2014 an arena more appropriately left to the federal legislative and executive branches of government than to the federal judiciary. <em>Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 81, 96 S.Ct. at 1892, 48 L.Ed.2d at 490-91.

Appellees counter by asserting that, because Congress left complete discretion to the States, we should apply the strict scrutiny standard to the State\u2019s action because the federal statute did not provide a \u201cuniform rule\u201d to which the States are required to adhere in exercising that discretion.

As noted previously in this opinion, courts apply a relaxed standard of review when examining the validity of a <em>federal </em>statute that distinguishes between citizens and aliens (and sub-classes of aliens) in the distribution <em>o\u00ed federal </em>medical benefits because Congress is said to possess plenary power to regulate aliens. While it is clear that the federal government possesses authority to regulate national immigration policy, the question of whether and, if so, under what conditions and terms, the federal government may delegate that authority (or any portion of that authority) to the States, such that courts reviewing a resultant State action will apply a relaxed standard of review, is less apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>In conjunction with recognition of the exclusive power of the federal government to regulate aliens, the Supreme Court also expressed, on numerous occasions, reservations about Congress delegating that authority to the States. In 1889, the Supreme Court articulated generally those reservations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">The power of exclusion of foreigners being an incident of sovereignty belonging to the Government of the United States, as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the Constitution, the right to its exercise at any time when, in the judgment of the Government, the interests of the country require it, cannot be granted away or restrained on behalf of anyone. The powers of Government are delegated in trust to the United States, and are incapable of transfer to any other parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><em>Chae Chan Ping v.

Thompson, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 641, 89 S.Ct. at 1335, 22 L.Ed.2d at 619, the Court articulated more specifically that \u201cCongress may not authorize the States to violate the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d The Court noted additionally that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqN\">[pjerhaps Congress could induce wider state participation in school construction if it authorized the use of joint funds for the building of segregated schools. But could it seriously be contended that Congress would be constitutionally justified in such authorization by the need to secure state cooperation?

Rather, Congress has provided discretion to the States with regard to their decisions whether to provide State-funded medical benefits, on the basis of alienage, to those resident aliens who do not meet the requirements for federal medical assistance. The grant of discretion, without more, is not a uniform rule for purposes of imposing only a rational basis test. The unbridled discretion afforded by Congress prevents us from characterizing the material provisions of PRWORA as \u201cuniform.\u201d In suggesting that a \u201cuniform rule\u201d principle exists, the U.S. Supreme Court unhelpfully declared only a one element requirement \u2014 that the rule prescribed by Congress be uniform. In <em>Plyler v.

Novello, supra, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1098, \u201cin administering their own programs [under PRWORA], the States are free to discriminate in either direction \u2014 producing not uniformity, but potentially wide variation based on localized or idiosyncratic concepts of largesse, economics and politics.\u201d <em>See also Truax, </em>239 U.S. at 42, 36 S.Ct. at 11, 60 L.Ed. at 135. This laissez faire federal approach to granting discretionary authority to the States in deciding whether to continue State-funded medical benefits for resident aliens who do not meet the five-year residency duration requirement does not prescribe a single, uniform or comprehensive approach. \u201cIf the rule were uniform, each State would carry out the same policy under the mandate of Congress \u2014 the only body with authority to set immigration policy.\u201d <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1098.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, a State\u2019s decision to eliminate the funding of a State-only funded Medical Assistance Program to a sub-class of lawfully admitted resident aliens who are ineligible for federal medicaid benefits was not carried out in compliance with a single, uniform policy prescribed by the federal government.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Recent decisions from state and federal courts lend support for this conclusion. In <em>Aliessa, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York adopted a similar position on the \u201cuniform rule\u201d principle. <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1098. The court determined that a provision of the New York Medicaid statute, which denied State-only medical benefits coverage to otherwise eligible per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>sons permanently residing in the United States under color of law and lawfully admitted permanent residents based on their status as aliens, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of both the U.S. and New York Constitutions. <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1098-99. Under the equal protection challenge,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the court first established that State actions based on alienage classifications should be strictly scrutinized. <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1094. Noting that the State did not attempt to justify its action under the strict scrutiny standard of review, the court next addressed the State\u2019s contention that the State statute \u201cimplements [PRWORA\u2019s] Federal immigration policy and should therefore be evaluated under the less stringent \u2018rational basis\u2019 standard[]\u201d because, the State argued, PRWORA provided a uniform rule which States could choose to follow. <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The New York high court compared State and Congressional authority with regard to immigration and naturalization. <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1095-96. Acknowledging the authority of the federal government, and the sources of that authority, with regard to immigration and naturalization issues, the Court stated that \u201cover no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.\u201d <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1096 (quoting <em>Oceanic Steam Nav.

Citing <em>Mathews, </em>the court noted Congress\u2019 ability to distinguish between aliens and citizens when allocating federal welfare benefits. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that \u201cwhen Federal welfare programs are jointly administered with the States, Congress may direct the States to implement national immigration objectives as long as the \u2018Federal Government has by <em>uniform </em>rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien sub-class.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. at 2396 n. 19, 72 L.Ed.2d at 800 n. 19). With regard to \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>[PRWORA] can constitutionally authorize New York to determine for itself the extent to which it will discriminate against legal aliens for State Medicaid eligibility,\u201d <em>Id., </em>the Court determined it could not because \u201c[PRWORA] does not impose a uniform immigration rule for States to follow.\u201d <em>Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1098<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; <em>see also Teytelman v.

The court rejected the challenge that the State\u2019s decision not to provide welfare benefits to the plaintiffs, who were aliens that had applied for, but not yet received, political asylum, under a cooperative federal-state assistance program, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1457. The court, however, determined that the State\u2019s action was constitutional because \u201cCongress ha[d] enacted a <em>uniform </em>policy regarding the eligibility of asylum applicants for welfare benefits.\u201d <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1466.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The Court in <em>Sudomir </em>distinguished its material facts from those in <em>Plyler </em>on the basis that the \u201cState [in <em>Plyler] </em>had employed the federal classification \u2018for <em>its own </em>discriminatory poliey[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1466 (quoting <em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 226, 102 S.Ct. at 2399, 72 L.Ed.2d at 805). The court noted also that the outcome in <em>Plyler </em>might have been different had \u201cthere been an articulable federal policy\u201d and emphasized the following language from <em>Plyler: </em>\u201c[b]ut if the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Government has by uniform rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien subclass, the States may, of course, follow the federal direction.\u201d <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1466 (quoting <em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 226, 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. at 2399, 2396 n. 19, 72 L.Ed.2d at 805, 800 n. 19). Turning back to its own case, the court concluded that \u201cthe [Sjtate employed both a federal classification <em>and </em>a uniform federal policy regarding the appropriate treatment of a particular sub-class of aliens.\u201d <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1466. Specifically, with regard to the uniformity of the federal policy at issue in that case, the court noted that the federal law <em>required </em>the denial of benefits to the specified alien sub-class. <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1466.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court, therefore, concluded that the lower court correctly applied the relaxed scrutiny standard to the State law upholding the denial of benefits to asylum applicants. <em>Sudomir, </em>767 F.2d at 1466.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Because we conclude that PRWORA does not provide a \u201cuniform rule\u201d for subsequent State actions,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>employ a strict scrutiny standard of review in our consideration of the State action here that, in effect, discriminated in the provision of State-funded medical assistance benefits based on an alienage classification or sub-classification. <em>See also Kurti v.

It could not, for example, reduce expenditures for education by barring indigent children from its schools. Similarly, in the cases before us, appellants must do more than show that denying welfare benefits to new residents saves money. The savings of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\"><em>Shapiro, </em>394 U.S. at 633, 89 S.Ct. at 1330, 22 L.Ed.2d at 614 (Footnote omitted). <em>See also Graham, </em>403 U.S. at 376, 91 S.Ct. at 1854, 29 L.Ed.2d at 544 (noting that \u201cthe justification of limiting expenses is particularly inappropriate and unreasonable when the discriminated class consists of aliens\u201d) (Citation omitted) (Internal quotations omitted). Although <em>Shapiro </em>was assessing the right to travel in its equal protection analysis, this distinction does not make less compelling for our analytical purposes the Court\u2019s conclusion that preserving the fiscal integrity of a State benefits program is not, by itself, a sufficient basis to satisfy strict scrutiny review. Accordingly, we agree with the Circuit Court that Appellees demonstrated a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their equal protection challenge under Article 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">With respect to the remaining three factors to be considered in acting on a preliminary injunction request, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in resolving them in favor of Appellees. First, considering Appellees\u2019 personal interests and the burden to the State, the trial court determined that the relative cost to Appellees of searching for other medical coverage was substantial, but the cost to the State to maintain the cancelled program was relatively minimal. The balance of convenience, it was concluded, favored Appellees. Second, Appellees provided suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cient factual averments, if proven at trial, of their on-going medical needs and inability to obtain alternative health care, without State assistance, for the Circuit Court to find reasonably that Appellees likely would suffer irreparable injury unless the requested preliminary injunction was issued. Third, in light of the public policy goals of the Welfare Innovation Act, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the public interest was best served by requiring the State to provide benefits to \u201csome of the most vulnerable segments of its population.\u201d Consequently, the Circuit Court generally acted within the permissible range of its discretion in deciding to grant preliminary injunctive relief in favor of Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We consider next whether the court properly ordered Appellants to reinstate medical benefits to Appellees, as prescribed under the Medical Assistance Program. The Circuit Court\u2019s order of 12 January 2006 provided that the medical benefits be reinstated as of 1 July 2005. Additionally, the Circuit Court ordered that the medical benefits be reinstated prospectively from 26 October 2005, the date the original Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction were filed, until final disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">As we have noted previously, \u201cinjunctive relief is a preventive and protective remedy, <em>aimed a,t future acts, </em>and is not intended to redress past wrongs.\u201d <em>El Bey v.

Moreover, a preliminary injunction is designed to \u201c \u2018preserve the court\u2019s ability to render a meaningful decision on the merits\u2019 \u201d by sustaining the status quo. <em>State Dep\u2019t v.

Here, the court\u2019s order for retrospective reinstatement of medical assistance benefits was not a preservation of the status quo. Rather, it was, in effect, an award of past damages to Appellees. Damages, if any, may be awarded only upon disposition of the case upon the merits, not through the grant of a preliminary injunction. In the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Circuit Court effectively awarded damages to Appellees in the form of undetermined retrospective medical assistance benefits without either a final adjudication on the merits of liability or a determination of actual damages, if any, suffered by Appellees. <em>See Benson v. State, </em>389 Md. 615, 631, 887 A.2d 525, 534 (2005). We vacate that part of the Circuit Court\u2019s order reinstating medical benefits to Appellees, as prescribed under the Medical Assistance Program, retrospectively from 26 October 2005 (the date suit was filed) back to 1 July 2005. We affirm, however, that portion of the Circuit Court\u2019s order which compels medical benefits to Appellees, as prescribed under the Medical Assistance Program, prospectively from 26 October 2005, the date the original Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction were filed, until final disposition. As noted, <em>supra, </em>Appellees satisfied the four requisite factors for issuance of a preliminary injunction. Because this relief is designed to preserve the status quo from future acts so as not to undermine the final disposition of the case on the merits, the portion of the Circuit Court\u2019s order that enjoins affirmatively and prospectively Appellants to provide medical assistance benefits to Appellees shall stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Appellants contend that the court lacks the authority to order the executive and legislature branches prospectively to reinstate medical assistance benefits to Appellees. Appellants arguments are misplaced. First, Appellants characterize the Circuit Court\u2019s order as an illegal appropriation of funds. While Appellants note correctly that Article III \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 52 of the Maryland Constitution provide a comprehensive executive budgetary procedure for appropriating monies, the order prospectively reinstating medical benefits to Appellees in the present case does not operate as an order directing the appropriation of specific funds.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Rather, the order serves as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>a judicial determination that Appellants\u2019 action warranted the issuance of a preliminary injunction because there is a likelihood that Appellants\u2019 action was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Second, Appellants argue that the Declaration of Rights does not overbear the express terms of the Constitution. If there were a conflict between Article 24 and the budget provisions of the Constitution, the more specific budget provisions would prevail. It is unclear to us why Appellants advance this argument when no issue has been presented that questions the validity of the budget and appropriations provisions of the Maryland Constitution. Assuming, as we do, that Appellants actually mean to argue that the equal protection guarantees of Article 24 do not apply to the budget appropriation process, we reject the argument because the executive and legislative budget authority is subject to the constitutional limitations of the Declaration of Rights. <em>See, e.g., Judy, </em>331 Md. at 266, 627 A.2d at 1053 (applying a standard of review to a governor\u2019s reduction to a budget appropriation that examined whether the governor and an executive board acted within their legal boundaries). Indeed, to hold otherwise would create a \u201clegal\u201d means for State government to employ invidious classifications that violate the equal protection guarantees of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (as well as other constitutional guarantees) by adopting budgets rather than by enacting laws, which we have long recognized is subject to constitutional constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Third, and related to their second argument, Appellants contend that by providing expressly that the prohibition against unappropriated expenditures applies to \u201cany order,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Article III, \u00a7 32 invalidates the Circuit Court\u2019s preliminary injunction. Article III, \u00a7 32, however, pertains to legislative orders for the appropriation of funds. <em>Dorsey, </em>178 Md. at 237, 13 A.2d at 634 (stating that the effect of Article III, \u00a7 32 is to \u201cexclude a legislative order or resolution from the category of an appropriation within the meaning of the provision\u201d); <em>Baltimore v. O\u2019Conor, </em>147 Md. 639, 644, 128 A. 759, 761 (1925) (stating the purpose of the Budget Amendments was to remedy the uncorrelated system in which the General Assembly caused deficits). Article III, \u00a7 32 does not pertain to a court\u2019s preliminary injunction order that enjoins affirmatively and prospectively Appellants to provide medical assistance benefits to Appellees until the disposition of the merits of the case; nor would Article III, \u00a7 32 apply to a court order to remedy a constitutional violation. <em>See Marbury v.

Neither the trial court nor the parties explicated the origin of this apparent opportunity to litigate an administrative appeal of Appellants\u2019 action. <em>See Furnitureland v.

While Appellees note in a footnote of their brief that one of the persons who sought to join the case as a Plaintiff in the First Amended Complaint filed in the Circuit Court did pursue an administrative appeal, we could find nothing else in the record transmitted in the present litigation to suggest such an administrative appeal was pursued by any of the Appellees named in the original complaint. Even if an opportunity for an administrative remedy existed, judicial consideration of the present action would not be barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies because the \"constitutional exception\u201d to the general rule applies in the present case. <em>See Montgomery County v.

This \"constitutional exception\" permits an aggrieved litigant to proceed immediately to court to seek a declaratory judgment or equitable remedy, regardless of the existence of an available administrative appeal, where the sole contention raised in the court action is based on a facial attack on the constitutionality of the governmental action. <em>See, e.g., PSC v.

Although the court expressed the view that \"alienage is not a suspect class,\u201d it later relied upon <em>Nyquist v.

Consequently, the court in <em>Doe </em>applied a rational basis standard of review and upheld the validity of the State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Applying a similar rationale, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in <em>Soskin, </em>determined that \"[a] state\u2019s exercise of the option to include fewer aliens in its aliens-only program [under the provisions of PRWORA] ... should not be treated as discrimination against aliens as compared to citizens.

Thus, the court in <em>Soskin </em>\u201dfollow[ed] the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s <em>Doe </em>decision in applying rational-basis review to such distinctions.\u201d <em>Soskin, </em>353 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Rather, <em>Graham </em>and <em>Nyquist </em>make clear that discrimination among sub-classes of resident aliens remains a suspect classification and thus a State's discriminatory action will be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\">. The Court stated further that \u201c[d]ivision by a State of the category of persons who are not citizens of that State into subcategories of U.S. citizens and aliens has no apparent justification, whereas, a comparable classification by the Federal Government is a routine and normally legitimate part of its business.\" <em>Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 85, 96 S.Ct. at 1894, 48 L.Ed.2d at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Regarding discrimination in the treatment of aliens by a State, the Court stated that \"whereas the Constitution inhibits every State\u2019s power to restrict travel across its own borders, Congress is explicitly empowered to exercise that type of control over travel across the borders of the United States.\u201d <em>Mathews, 426 </em>U.S. at 85, 96 S.Ct. at 1894, 48 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>at 493 (Footnote omitted).

No party in the present action suggests the unconstitutionally of Congress' enactment of PRWORA itself. Thus, we focus our examination on the State's action.

We note that there is some basis for limiting the federal government's authority to effectuate national immigration policy to only certain areas, which basis does not include regulating the guidelines used by States when providing solely State-funded medical assistance benefits to aliens. In <em>Plyler v.

Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 377, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1854, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), the Court stated that \u2018\u2018Congress has not seen fit to impose any burden or restriction on aliens who become indigent after their entry into the United States.\u201d This seemingly leaves the door ajar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\">. An example of the divergence among States acting on maintaining coverage of medical assistance benefits for aliens ineligible for federal Medicaid is seen by the treatment in New York's and Maryland\u2019s current coverage. <em>See Aliessa, </em>754 N.E.2d at 1092.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">. It matters not to our analysis that Maryland chose to exercise the discretion purportedly accorded by PRWORA in 1996 to continue to extend medical benefits to the relevant sub-class of aliens not covered by federal medical benefits until FY 2006 when it recanted those benefits. The State may not act independently in a discriminatory manner with regard to distributing State-funded medical benefits to lawful resident aliens unless it survives a strict scrutiny standard of review. The purported discretionary authorization of PRWORA does not reduce that standard of review of the State's action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">.

To support its conclusion of requiring uniformity in the federal directive before it will apply relaxed scrutiny to a State action, the Court of Appeals of New York relied upon <em>Graham, supra, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534, <em>Plyler, supra, </em>457 U.S. at 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. at 2396 n. 19, 72 L.Ed.2d at 800 n. 19, <em>Mathews, supra, </em>426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478, and <em>Hampton v.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has viewed more narrowly this uniformity requirement for applying a relaxed scrutiny standard. In <em>Soskin v. Reinertson, </em>353 F.3d 1242, 1256 (10th Cir.2004), the court stated in dicta, see <em>supra </em>n. 12 discussing the holding in <em>Soskin, </em>that \"we reject the argument that the PRWORA's authorization to the states to provide or deny Medicaid benefits to certain aliens runs afoul of the uniformity requirement of the Constitution\u2019s Naturalization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Clause.\" Examining <em>Graham, </em>the court in <em>Soskin </em>concluded that, because \u201cCongressional power over aliens derives from more than just the Naturalization Clause,\u201d the \u201cuniformity requirement is imposed only on a 'Rule of Naturalization.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soskin, </em>353 F.3d at 1256. We, however, do not view the requirement so narrowly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">. Additionally, we do not find the reasons provided in PRWORA to justify denying eligibility for federal benefits (promoting self-sufficiency and discouraging illegal aliens) to meet the strict scrutiny standard of review applied to the State\u2019s action in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b764-5\">. As we stated in <em>State Department v. Baltimore County, </em>281 Md. 548, 558, 383 A.2d 51, 57 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">[I]t is quite clear from our cases that a preliminary injunction will lie when it is necessary to preserve the status quo. <em>Tyler v.

Union, </em>206 Md. 256, 258-260, 111 A.2d 462, 463 (1955) (in suit to enjoin union from expelling plaintiffs, alleging threat of loss of jobs and other property rights, chancellor should have issued a preliminary injunction pending a decision on his own jurisdiction in order to preserve status quo); <em>Kahl v. Con. Gas, El. Lt. &amp; Power Co., </em>189 Md. 655, 658, 57 A.2d 331, 332-33 (1948) (no abuse in refusing preliminary injunction in view of defendant's stipulation and agreement to maintain the status quo); <em>Martin v.

State, </em>279 Md. 133, 367 A.2d 491 (1977), is not helpful to Appellants\u2019 cause. In <em>Foster Child., </em>we concluded that a statute requiring equal funding levels to parents of foster children was not an appropriation because it did \u201cnot purport to appropriate money out of the State Treasury or direct the Comptroller, Treasurer, or anyone else to make payments of money.\u201d <em>Foster Child., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>279 Md. at 139, 367 A.2d at 494. We found that same statute did not require the Governor to fund payments to foster child parents at a particular level because to do so would frustrate Article III, \u00a7 52 where the funding level at issue was at the discretion of the Governor, and not bound by a constitutional duty. <em>Foster Child., </em>279 Md. at 148-53, 367 A.2d at 499-502. In contrast, the order here is a judicial determination that a State action is likely a violation of Article 24 of the Constitution, and thus it is appropriate to order that the status quo of the controversy be reinstated prospectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
