We hold that the witness in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Jeffrey Smith, received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney disclosed the nature of his advice to Smith and his opinion regarding the application of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Smith also seeks review of the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the merits of his Fifth Amendment claim and the procedures used by the trial judge to impose sanctions for the direct criminal contempt. We conclude that the trial judge committed multiple errors with respect to her determination that Smith did not have a valid basis for asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the procedures that she adhered to when she imposed sanctions for Smith\u2019s contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">On November 7, 2003, while the Petitioner, Jeffrey Smith, was serving a sentence for several drug violations, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney in Baltimore City had Smith brought from prison to court to testify as a prosecution witness in a case in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, <em>State v. Morgan, et al., </em>case number 102235018-21. When Smith was called to the stand, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">[THE STATE]: Mr. Smith, do you live in Baltimore City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">[THE STA.TE]: How long have you lived in Baltimore City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">[SMITH]: About thirteen, fourteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">[THE STATE]: And in what district do you live in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">[SMITH]: Eastern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-14\">[THE STATE]: Eastern District?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-15\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-16\">[THE STATE]: Which part of the Eastern District?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-17\">[SMITH]: East Side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-18\">[THE STATE]: I understand that. Can you tell us the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-20\">[SMITH]: No, I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-21\">[THE STATE]: Are you refusing to answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-22\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>[THE STATE]: Are you familiar with the 27 hundred block of East Monument Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">[THE STATE]: Have you been there before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">[THE STATE]: How often?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">[SMITH]: Excuse me, I\u2019m not even with this program. I would like to plead the 5th.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] I don\u2019t want to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">[THE COURT]: Mr. Smith, there is no Fifth Amendment\u2014 how often have you been to the 27 hundred block of East Monument Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">[SMITH]: If I live there, how many times can I say I been there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">[THE COURT]: So, you live in the 27 hundred block of East Monument Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">Next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">[THE STATE]: What is your date of birth? What\u2019s your date of birth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">[SMITH]: I\u2019m exercising my right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-15\">[THE COURT]: There is no Fifth Amendment privilege to your date of birth, Mr. Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-16\">[SMITH]: I want to remain silent, period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">The trial judge stopped the proceedings and sent the jury to lunch, at which time the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He\u2019s not charged in this case. The question is, does he have a legitimate Fifth Amendment privilege with regard to this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-19\">[THE STATE]: No, he does not. He has never been a suspect or has ever been charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>[THE COURT]: That\u2019s your view. It\u2019s his rights, not your rights. Unless you give him immunity, which guarantees him he\u2019s not going to be prosecuted\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">[THE STATE]: I\u2019m in no position to do that. But the State believes he is not implicating himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">[THE COURT]: You may not believe that, but it is his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>permitted the prosecutor to meet with Smith to discuss the Fifth Amendment issue. After a lunch break, the Circuit Court reconvened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">[THE COURT]: I want to put on the record that over the luncheon hour, the Court contacted the Office of the Public Defender and asked ..., who I understand is in charge today, if he could send counsel over and he graciously agreed ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">[Speaking to Counsel for Smith], have you had an opportunity to speak to Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">[SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">[THE COURT]: Is Mr. Smith ready to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">[SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes. Also, prior to speaking with Mr. Smith, I spoke with counsel for the State ... to get a background on what the case was all about and what Mr. Smith\u2019s potential involvement might be regarding his Fifth Amendment privilege and, as far as I can determine, after speaking with [the prosecutor] and speaking with Mr. Smith, I have advised him that I could not find any constitutional basis for his pleading the Fifth Amendment in this case. I also advised him of the potential consequences of his continuing to make that plea and disobey any orders from the Court to testify in spite of his wishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">The trial judge informed Smith that if she determined that he could not properly invoke the Fifth Amendment, he could be imprisoned for contempt. Smith indicated that he under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>stood. The State then proffered the testimony of the lead detective in the underlying action that Smith was not a suspect in the case nor was there any evidence against him in the case. The trial judge declined to hear the detective\u2019s testimony and engaged in the following discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">[THE COURT]: [Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s in a better position than anybody to know that and [Smith\u2019s counsel] advises he does not, in your view, have a Fifth Amendment privilege?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae5\">[SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct, based upon everything he told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [Smith\u2019s counsel] is acting as his counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">[THE COURT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And as a friend of the Court for these purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">[THE COURT]: Yes. The Court appointed counsel to represent Mr. Smith for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If he is evaluating him, he should be qualified as an expert in his capacity of an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">[THE COURT]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">The State recalled Smith, who continued to refuse to respond although without explicitly invoking the protections of the Fifth Amendment. The trial judge then asked Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOH\">[THE COURT]: You\u2019re invoking your Fifth Amendment privilege?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">[SMITH]: Refusing to say anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">[THE COURT]: Well, I want to be clear because it makes a difference, Mr. Smith. Are you saying that you believe you have a Fifth Amendment privilege and you are not going to answer on the grounds the answers may tend to incriminate you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-16\">[SMITH]: I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just not a witness. I\u2019m not saying anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-17\">[THE COURT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>You understand that the Court has examined and heard the testimony and it does not believe that you have the right to not be with the program or invoke your Fifth Amendment, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">[SMITH]: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">[THE COURT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">[SMITH]: I\u2019m not going to say anything. I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m not saying anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">[THE COURT]: I understand that, and I\u2019m telling you that the Court has determined that you have no right to not \u2014 to invoke your Fifth Amendment privilege, and I\u2019m ordering you to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">[SMITH]: I refuse to say anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">[THE COURT]: You under stand that, in light of the fact that I\u2019ve ordered you, that you would be in contempt of Court if you refuse to answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">[SMITH]: Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">[THE COURT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">Counsel, approach. Is there something that you want to say, [defense counsel]? Come to the Bench. The jury can hear everything you say when you stand out there. (Whereupon, the parties approached the Bench and the following proceedings ensued on the record:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Keeping it succinct \u2014 and I apologize to the Court \u2014 I thought you wanted to make an inquiry whether or not he had a Fifth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">[THE COURT]: I did make the inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I thought that was the purpose of having him questioned. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-17\">[THE COURT]: Let me explain to you that he has to invoke the Fifth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-19\">[THE COURT]: Until this moment, he has not invoked the Fifth Amendment. He said I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then you made the determination that he didn\u2019t have the Fifth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[THE COURT]: Based upon the proffer that the State gave me and on [Smith\u2019s counsel]\u2019s statement, I determined that he did not have a Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">Is there something that you want to bring to the Court\u2019s attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Just note an objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">[THE COURT]: Objection to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That even though the State made a proffer and he had counsel, the State was trying to elicit information whether or not he had a Fifth Amendment right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">[THE COURT]: I don\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m saying, you made a determination that he did not have a Fifth Amendment right and that was based upon what took place at the Bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">[THE COURT]: I just said it was based upon the proffer from the state and [Smith\u2019s counsel]\u2019s statement that, after consulting with his client, he didn\u2019t believe he had a Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have nothing further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">[THE COURT]: Let the record reflect that Mr. Smith refuses to answer the questions properly put to him by the State, that his contempt has interrupted the order of the Court by refusing to answer the lawful order of the Court by refusing to answer the lawful order to testify, that Mr. Smith has no Fifth Amendment privilege and, therefore, the Court will find him guilty of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-15\">Now, Mr. Smith, I\u2019m going to hold sentencing in this matter sub curia. If you change your mind and decide to testify, I will consider that as a factor in sentencing you. Otherwise, at the conclusion of this trial, you\u2019ll be sentenced for contempt of court, you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>[Speaking to Counsel for Smith], I will let you know when we get closer to sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">[SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think the witness stated on the record his answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">[THE COURT]: I didn\u2019t hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The witness didn\u2019t answer on the record to your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">[THE COURT]: He just nodded. I don\u2019t know what you are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He just nodded yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">[THE COURT]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">(Emphasis added). The trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">On November 12, 2002, two days after the conclusion of the case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the same trial judge conducted a separately docketed hearing and imposed a five-month sentence for direct criminal contempt upon Smith. Six days after that hearing, the trial judge issued an order, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">Having found Jeffrey Smith in direct criminal contempt for failing to testify in the case of <em>State v. Anthony Morgan </em>and Carlos Woods, 102235018-21, it is this 18 day of November 2003, by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Part 30 hereby ORDERED that Defendant be sentenced to a period of Five (5) Months to the Division of Corrections to be served consecutively to any sentence Mr. Smith is now serving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Smith thereafter filed his notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, determined that the trial judge made an adequate independent determination of the validity of Smith\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the trial judge\u2019s deferral of sanctions until a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>separate hearing did not change the summary nature of the proceedings. The Court of Special Appeals declined to reach the issue of whether Smith was denied effective assistance of counsel because it determined that the issue should be presented in a post conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On December 6, 2005, Smith filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court and presented the following questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">1. (A) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in refusing to address Petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, where Petitioner had no available post conviction remedy, and where the record contained all of the facts necessary to decide the claim? (B) Whether a witness is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel where the witness is held in contempt as a result of his attorney\u2019s unauthorized disclosure of privileged and confidential information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">2. Where a non-immunized witness invoked the Fifth Amendment and refuses to testify, must a trial court independently assess the merits of the Fifth Amendment claim, or may a court rely on nothing more than a prosecutor\u2019s assertion and a public defender\u2019s unauthorized disclosure of conclusory legal analysis protected by the attorney-client privilege to hold a witness in contempt for refusing to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">3. Whether Maryland Rule 15-204 applies where a court promptly finds that direct contempt has been committed, but declines to impose sanctions until a separately docketed hearing after the conclusion of the proceeding during which the contempt allegedly was committed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We granted the petition and issued the writ. <em>Smith v. State, </em>391 Md. 114, 892 A.2d 477 (2006). We determine that Smith received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney disclosed the nature of his advice to Smith and advised the trial judge as to his opinion regarding the application of the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, we conclude that the trial judge committed multiple errors with respect to her determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that Smith did not have a valid basis for asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the procedures that she adhered to when she imposed sanctions for Smith\u2019s contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Smith argues that his criminal contempt conviction should be vacated because he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. As a threshold matter, Smith asserts that, although post-conviction proceedings generally are the preferred mechanism for pursuing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record was adequately developed below for this Court to address the issue on direct appeal. According to Smith, there is no dispute that Smith\u2019s counsel was appointed by the trial court to represent him and counsel him concerning his Fifth Amendment rights. Nor, in Smith\u2019s view, is there any dispute that Smith\u2019s counsel disclosed legal advice and opinions that were protected by the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, he concludes that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Smith also contends that the trial judge in the present case failed to consider all of the relevant circumstances when she concluded that he was not entitled to invoke the protections of the Fifth Amendment. He further asserts that the trial judge was required to conduct an independent inquiry into whether his assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was valid under the circumstances, which did not occur in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">As his final argument, Smith further asserts that the trial judge did not summarily impose sanctions following her determination that he was guilty of direct criminal contempt and that, therefore, his contempt conviction must be vacated because the trial court failed to comply with the applicable Maryland Rules governing contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Conversely, the State asserts that Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is improperly raised on direct appeal. It contends that such a claim is more appropriately brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>post conviction proceedings. The State also argues that the trial court properly found Smith in contempt of court based on his refusal to testify when called as a witness. The State contends that the record below demonstrates that the trial court made a thorough inquiry into whether Smith was entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and that it appropriately relied upon the representations made by the prosecutor and Smith\u2019s appointed counsel in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The State also asserts that Smith\u2019s appointed counsel did not disclose any privileged communications because the trial court appointed him to advise Smith concerning the applicability of the Fifth Amendment to his situation as well as the consequences of refusing to testify where the court has determined that the Fifth Amendment does not apply. Therefore, according to the State, the disclosure of any communications between Smith and his counsel were authorized under the circumstances because he was required to inform the court on the record as to whether Smith was entitled to assert his privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">With respect to Smith\u2019s argument that the trial court did not follow the proper procedures when it imposed sanctions for contempt, the State counters that the trial court\u2019s decision to defer the imposition of sanctions until after the conclusion of the shooting trial did not alter the summary nature of the sanctions. Thus, the State argues that the trial judge complied with the applicable Maryland Rules and there is no basis for disturbing her ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">We have repeatedly held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel generally should be raised in a post-conviction proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Austin v. State, </em>327 Md. 375, 394, 609 A.2d 728, 737 (1992); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 434-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>35, 439 A.2d 542, 559 (1982); <em>see also In re Parris </em>W., 363 Md. 717, 726, 770 A.2d 202, 207 (2001) (observing that post-conviction proceedings have generally been the preferred mechanism for addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims). The main justification for the rule is that, generally, the trial record does not provide adequate detail upon which the reviewing court could base an assessment regarding whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance because the character of counsel\u2019s representation is not the focus of the proceedings and there is no discussion of counsel\u2019s strategy supporting the conduct in issue. <em>In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. at 726, 770 A.2d at 207; <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 434-35, 439 A.2d at 559. In <em>In re Parris W., </em>we noted that the general rule, however, is not \u201cabsolute and, where the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of the claim, there is no need for a collateral fact-finding proceeding, and review on direct appeal may be appropriate and desirable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, 770 A.2d at 207. <em>See also Harris v. State, </em>299 Md. 511, 517-18, 474 A.2d 890, 893 (1984); <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>149 F.3d 747, 748 (8th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>146 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Gwiazdzinski </em>141 F.3d 784, 789 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v.

Aulet, </em>618 F.2d 182, 185-86 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Austin, </em>327 Md. at 394, 609 A.2d at 737; <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 435 n. 15, 439 A.2d at 559 n. 15; <em>People v. Tello, </em>15 Cal.4th 264, 62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134, 1135-36 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Smith argues that the record in the present case is adequately developed so as to permit the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel to be addressed on direct appeal; whereas the State contends that post-conviction proceedings should be undertaken. Moreover, the State asserts that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>error was not so blatant or egregious that direct review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Smith\u2019s claim arises out of disclosures in which his counsel revealed allegedly privileged information to the trial court and upon which the judge repeatedly stated that her determination concerning Smith\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights \u201cwas based upon the proffer of the state and [Smith\u2019s counselj\u2019s statement that, after consulting with his client, he didn\u2019t believe he had a Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d As we noted in <em>Newman v. State, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004), \u201conly the client has [the] power to waive the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 863 A.2d at 334. We have defined waiver as \u201cthe intentional relinquishment of a known right.\u201d <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 138, 345 A.2d 830, 840 (1975), quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 1466 (1938). Intrinsic to the definition of \u201cwaiver\u201d is the recognition that the client must be informed of both the scope and nature of the right being relinquished as well as the consequences of so doing. In the present case, as we have determined <em>infra, </em>Smith\u2019s counsel had an inherent conflict of interest between his duties to Smith and his asserted duties to the trial court. As such, Smith\u2019s attorney could not impartially advise him regarding any waiver of the attorney-client privilege because the trial court had an interest in learning counsel\u2019s advice to Smith. Thus, regardless of whether Smith waived his attorney-client privilege either expressly or implicitly, the waiver would be ineffective. Moreover, we can conceive of no circumstances that would require Smith\u2019s counsel to reveal the substance of his advice to the court, as such a disclosure could only inure to his client\u2019s detriment. Therefore, we conclude that a collateral evidentiary hearing concerning Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s disclosure would be superfluous. Our refusal to address Smith\u2019s claim on direct appeal would constitute a waste of judicial resources. <em>See In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. at 727, 770 A.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Because Smith\u2019s assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel is premised on an alleged violation of his attorney-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>client privilege, which only arises after the creation of an attorney-client relationship, we must first examine whether a client-lawyer relationship existed at the time that Smith\u2019s counsel advised him regarding his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Huester v. Clements, </em>252 Md. 641, 646, 250 A.2d 855, 859 (1969) (noting that \u201c[o]nce the relationship of attorney and client was established, a fortiori, the communication was confidential, and inadmissible in evidence.\u201d). We have previously noted that \u201c[w]hat constitutes an attorney-client relationship is a rather elusive concept.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shaw, </em>354 Md. 636, 650, 732 A.2d 876, 883 (1999), quoting <em>Folly Farms I, Inc. v. Trustees, </em>282 Md. 659, 670, 387 A.2d 248, 254 (1978). In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 821 A.2d 414 (2003), we adopted the following test for determining whether an attorney-client relationship exists:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">A relationship of client and lawyer arises when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(1) a person manifests to a lawyer the person\u2019s intent that the lawyer provide legal services for the person; and ... (b) the lawyer fails to manifest lack of consent to do so, and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide the services ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 174, 821 A.2d at 425, quoting Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 14 (2000). We noted, however, that an attorney-client relationship may be formed without an express agreement between the parties. <em>Brooke, </em>374 Md. at 173, 821 A.2d at 424, citing <em>Shaw, </em>354 Md. at 650-51, 732 A.2d at 883. As such, \u201c[tjhe relationship may arise by implication from a client\u2019s reasonable expectation of legal representation and the attorney\u2019s failure to dispel those expectations.\u201d <em>Brooke, </em>374 Md. at 175, 821 A.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In the present case, the parties do not dispute that an attorney-client relationship existed between Smith and his appointed counsel at the time that the attorney advised Smith regarding the validity of his invocation of the Fifth Amendment. After Smith\u2019s initial assertion of his Fifth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>right against self-incrimination, the trial judge contacted the Office of the Public Defender, which appointed counsel for Smith, who immediately upon arriving at the court met with Smith to advise him regarding Smith\u2019s refusal to testify under the Fifth Amendment. During the proceedings, the trial judge reaffirmed appointed counsel\u2019s role as Smith\u2019s counsel in response to an inquiry by one of the defense lawyers. Moreover, Smith consulted with counsel concerning his rights under the Fifth Amendment and his attorney rendered legal advice on that issue. Therefore, we find that an attorney-client relationship existed when Smith and his counsel conferred about the validity of Smith\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Because we have concluded that an attorney-client relationship existed between Smith and his appointed counsel at the time that the attorney advised Smith regarding his rights under the Fifth Amendment, we must determine whether disclosing such advice constituted a violation of the attorney-client privilege. As we observed in <em>Lanasa v. State, </em>109 Md. 602, 71 A. 1058 (1909), \u201c[t]o make the communications privileged, they ... must relate to professional advice and to the subject-matter about which the advice is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 71 A. at 1064. Moreover, we have stated repeatedly that \u201c[o]nl,y the client has [the] power to waive the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>384 Md. at 308, 863 A.2d at 335, citing <em>Parler &amp; Wobber v.

Exxon Corporation, </em>65 F.R.D. 26, 37 (D.Md.1974) (stating that \u201c[t]he privilege further extends to the attorney\u2019s legal advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and opinions which encompass the thoughts and confidences of the client.\u201d); <em>United States v. Kendrick, </em>381 F.2d 110, 115 (4th Cir.1964) (Sobeloff, C.J.concurring) (\u201cThe lawyer\u2019s observations were inextricably intertwined with communications which passed between him and his client----The fact that a lawyer may be in a position to give enlightening testimony is not itself sufficient reason for relaxing the client\u2019s privileges. In many cases the client may have confessed his guilt to the lawyer, who would then be in an excellent position to give effective testimony, but our tradition forbids such disclosure.\u201d); <em>Gunther v. United States, </em>230 F.2d 222, 223-24 (D.C.Cir.1956) (holding that \u201c[i]f trial counsel in a criminal case could be called by the Government and asked to give an opinion as to the accused\u2019s competency and ability to assist in the defense, he could necessarily also be asked for the factual data upon which he premised is opinion.... Such revelations would be a violation of the attorney-client privilege and would also invade an accused\u2019s right to counsel in the trial of the criminal charge.\u201d); <em>State v. Meeks, </em>263 Wis.2d 794, 666 N.W.2d 859, 870 (2003) (\u201cWe agree with the jurisdictions that hold that an attorney[\u2019]s opinions, perceptions, and impressions ... are protected by the attorney-client privilege.\u201d); <em>State v. Adams, </em>277 S.C. 115, 283 S.E.2d 582, 586 (1981) (stating, \u201cWe believe that the spirit of this policy [the attorney-client privilege] dictates that not only is the conversation protected but the entire setting of the confidential conference must be protected as well. To lend privilege to the words spoken but to allow disclosure of professional impressions drawn from the manner of their delivery all but destroys the substance of their privilege.\u201d). Because an attorney\u2019s advice is necessarily tailored to the information communicated by his or her client, any disclosure of the advice given by the attorney is an implicit revelation of the statements and position of the client. Therefore, we agree with those jurisdictions that have concluded that to permit an attorney to reveal the substance of his or her advice or opinions derived from consultation with the client would violate the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In the present case, Smith\u2019s counsel specifically referenced Smith\u2019s communications to him as providing the basis for his opinion that Smith did not have a valid basis for invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when he responded to the trial judge\u2019s inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">[THE COURT]: [Smith\u2019s counsel]\u2019s in a better position than anybody to know that and [Smith\u2019s counsel] advises he does not, in your view have a Fifth Amendment privilege?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR_\">[SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct, based upon everything he told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s advice was derived from statements made by Smith and, as such, indirectly revealed to the trial court the substance of those communications, specifically, that Smith could not articulate a valid basis for seeking Fifth Amendment protection. Therefore, Smith\u2019s lawyer\u2019s disclosure to the trial court was made in violation of that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Upon our determination that Smith\u2019s attorney violated the attorney-client privilege when he discussed his assessment of the status of Smith\u2019s Fifth Amendment assertion, the issue becomes whether this disclosure was an \u201cerror[] so serious that counsel was not functioning as \u2018counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693 (1984).

Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693, addressed the question of how an individual may prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In that case, the Supreme Court determined that a defendant must prove that counsel\u2019s performance failed to satisfy an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel\u2019s performance resulted in prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>As we noted in <em>Mosley, </em>\u201c[t]his two-pronged test serves to correct the adversarial process when it has failed to render a reliable trial result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 836 A.2d at 683, citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693 (stating that \u201c[u]nless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d). Thus, when a defendant is denied effective assistance of counsel, \u201cit is the integrity of the adversarial process that is compromised.\u201d Mosley, 378 Md. at 557, 836 A.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The assessment of counsel\u2019s performance is based on a comparison to \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>In re Parris, </em>363 Md. at 725, 770 A.2d at 206; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694; <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 79, 741 A.2d 1162, 1184 (1999). These \u201cnorms\u201d determine what comprises reasonably effective assistance and require that all of the circumstances surrounding counsel\u2019s performance be considered. <em>Mosley, </em>378 Md. at 557, 836 A.2d at 683, citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 698, 496 A.2d 1074, 1081 (1985), we noted that courts must give great deference when evaluating counsel\u2019s performance and that courts must presume, until proven otherwise, that counsel\u2019s conduct was reasonable within his or her professional judgment and that the conduct was part of a trial strategy. Concerning the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 696. Thus, for the defendant to prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, he or she must also establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">After conferring with Smith, Smith\u2019s counsel informed the trial judge, when asked whether Smith intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Yes. Also, prior to speaking with Mr. Smith, I spoke with counsel for the State, ..., to get a background on what the case was all about and what Mr. Smith\u2019s involvement might be regarding his Fifth Amendment privilege and, as far as I can determine, after speaking with [the prosecutor] and speaking with Mr. Smith, I have advised him that I could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>not find any constitutional basis for his pleading the Fifth Amendment in this case. I also advised him of the potential consequences of his continuing to make that plea and disobey any orders from the Court to testify in spite of his wishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">(Emphasis added). Smith asserts that this disclosure to the trial court violated his attorney-client privilege and that, as a result, he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Smith\u2019s counsel was asked by the trial judge whether \u201cMr. Smith [was] ready to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d Smith\u2019s counsel initially responded, \u2018Yes.\u201d Had his answer ended there, Smith\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would be without basis. When, however, Smith\u2019s counsel proceeded to disclose his legal advice to Smith based, in part, on his discussions with Smith, he was putting his client in peril of being held in contempt. Absent a waiver of his attorney-client privilege by Smith, his attorney was not empowered to make such a disclosure. Moreover, there could be no circumstance that could justify Smith\u2019s counsel making a disclosure inuring only to Smith\u2019s detriment. Furthermore, the attorney for one of the defendants on trial recognized the impropriety of Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s disclosure and questioned the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [Smith\u2019s counsel] is acting as his counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">[THE COURT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And as friend of the Court for these purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">[THE COURT]: Yes. The Court appointed counsel to represent Mr. Smith for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Smith\u2019s counsel could not represent Smith as required under the Sixth Amendment, Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and the Maryland Public Defender Act, Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-14, and simultaneously act as an advisor to the trial judge, who was considering whether to hold Smith in contempt. As we noted in <em>Sinclair v. State, </em>278 Md. 243, 363 A.2d 468 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>An attorney at law who has one been retained and received the confidence of a client, is thereafter disqualified from acting for any other person adversely interested in the same general matter, however slight such adverse interest may be. Nor does it matter that the intention and motive of the attorney are honest. This rule is a rigid one, and designed not alone to prevent the dishonest practitioner from fraudulent conduct, but as well to preclude the honest practitioner from putting himself in a position where he may be required to choose between conflicting duties, or be led to an attempt to reconcile conflicting interests, rather than to enforce to their full extent the rights of the interest which he alone represents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 363 A.2d at 474-75, quoting <em>Derlin v. Derlin, </em>142 Md. 352, 364, 121 A. 27 (1923). The conflict of interest presented to Smith\u2019s counsel was thus simply put: advise Smith and respond to the court that he had done so, or advise the trial judge that Smith was eligible for contempt because he had no valid Fifth Amendment privilege. Smith\u2019s counsel could not act both as a friend of the court and as an advocate on behalf of Smith without rendering his representation outside of any prevailing professional norm within the <em>Strickland </em>rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">With respect to the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>we have defined prejudice in the context as \u201ca substantial possibility that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of his proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. at 727-28, 770 A.2d at 208. Certainly there was explicit reliance on Smith\u2019s counsel\u2019s representation by the trial judge when she declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">Based upon the proffer that the State gave me and on [Smith\u2019s counselj\u2019s statement, I determined that he did not have a Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Moreover, the trial judge, in fact, iterated her reliance on more than one occasion and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">I just said it was based upon the proffer from the state and [Smith\u2019s counselj\u2019s statement that, after consulting with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>client, he didn\u2019t believe he had a Fifth Amendment privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Therefore, we conclude that Smith has established a violation of his right to effective representation under the Sixth Amendment under the <em>Strickland </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We further determine that the trial judge in the present case erred when she required the attorney for Smith to act both as an advocate for Smith and as a friend to the court. It was impossible for Smith\u2019s counsel to fulfill both roles without compromising his duty of loyalty to Smith. Smith was entitled to representation free of conflict of interest, and it was improper for the trial judge to create a scenario that infringed upon Smith\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Independent Evaluation of the Existence of the Fifth Amendment Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Smith also argues that the trial judge did not properly conduct an independent evaluation of his entitlement to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege against self-incrimination is guaranteed under both Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Gray v.

The State does not contest the fact that an independent inquiry was required, but rather, counters that the examination that occurred in the case <em>sub judice </em>was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951), the United States Supreme Court announced that \u201c[i]t is for the court to say whether [the defendant\u2019s] silence is justified ... and to require him to answer if \u2018it clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 71 S.Ct. at 818, 95 L.Ed. at 1124, quoting <em>Temple v. Commonwealth, </em>75 Va. 892, 899 (1881). The Court further explicated that \u201c[t]he trial judge in appraising the claim \u2018must be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Ex parte Irvine, </em>74 F. 954, 960 (C.C.S.D.Ohio 1896). Examining what circumstances should be considered in ruling on a claim of Fifth Amendment privilege, the Supreme Court stated that the court should recognize the fact that \u201cthe chief occupation of some persons involves the evasion of ... criminal law;\u201d and that \u201cone person with a police record summoned to testify ... might be hiding or helping to hide another person of questionable repute sought as a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 71 S.Ct. at 819, 95 L.Ed. at 1125. Ultimately, the Court observed that for the trial court to determine that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply, it must be \u201c <em>\u2018perfectly dear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such a tendency\u2019 to incriminate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Temple, 75 </em>Va. at 898 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>We addressed the appropriate procedure for determining whether a witness\u2019s assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege is proper most recently in <em>Bhagwat, supra. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">And \u2018because the privilege is not a prohibition of inquiry, but is an option of refusal,\u2019 [t]he witness should first be called to the stand and sworn. <em>Midgett v. State, </em>223 Md. 282, 289, 164 A.2d 526, 529 (1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 853, 81 S.Ct. 819, 5 L.Ed.2d 817 (1961). Interrogation of the witness should then proceed to the point where he [or she] asserts his [or her] privilege against self-incrimination as a ground for not answering a question. <em>Shifflett v. State, </em>245 Md. 169, 173-74, 225 A.2d 440, 443 (1967). If it is a jury case, the jury should then be dismissed and the trial judge should attempt to \u2018determine whether the claim of privilege is in good faith or lacks any reasonable basis.\u2019 <em>Midgett v. State, supra, </em>223 Md. at 289[, 164 A.2d at 530]. If further interrogation is pursued, then the witness should either answer the questions asked or assert his [or her] privilege, making this decision on a question by question basis. <em>Royal v. State, </em>236 Md. 443, 447, 204 A.2d 500, 502 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 271-72, 658 A.2d at 247-48 (alterations in original), quoting <em>Richardson v. State, </em>285 Md. 261, 265, 401 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1979). This procedure, however, need not be followed strictly where \u201cthere is a clear indication, reflected on the record, that the witness intends to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination if called to the witness stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 658 A.2d at 248. In that scenario,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At2\">if it is a jury trial, \u2018[t]he mechanical procedure of first calling the witness before the jury\u2019 should be omitted. In other words, the witness should be called and sworn, but without the jury being present, and questioned before or by the court. In this way, the court is enabled to perform its function of determining whether the privilege has been invoked in good faith or has a reasonable basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 273-74, 658 A.2d at 248-49 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In the present case, the trial judge, when Smith refused to respond to a question asking for his date of birth, summarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>responded that the Fifth Amendment privilege did not apply to that information without considering the totality of the circumstances prior to making such a pronouncement as required under <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 819, 95 L.Ed. at 1125. Although ordinarily an individual\u2019s date of birth is not protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, there may exist circumstances in which the revelation of a person\u2019s date of birth is incriminating. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 592-93, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 2645-49, 110 L.Ed.2d 528, 546-51 (1990) (holding that based on the circumstances in that case the defendant\u2019s response to a question asking for the date of his sixth birthday was incriminating due to the defendant\u2019s demeanor and the content of the answer). Moreover, the trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>failed to make any inquiry of Smith regarding his invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to any other information solicited by the prosecution\u2019s questions. The trial judge should have examined each question that the prosecution and defense intended to ask of Smith with the intention of determining whether the question might elicit an incriminating answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Moreover, the trial judge claimed to have relied solely on a proffer by the prosecutor and the legal conclusions espoused by Smith\u2019s counsel to find that Smith had no Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to <em>any </em>subject raised in questioning. As we determined <em>supra, </em>the disclosure made by Smith\u2019s counsel violated Smith\u2019s attorney-client privilege. As such, the disclosure was not admissible evidence upon which the trial judge could rely to reach her conclusion regarding the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Newman, </em>384 Md. at 317, 863 A.2d at 340; <em>Huester v. Clements, </em>252 Md. 641, 646, 250 A.2d 855, 859 (1969) (stating that \u201c[ojnce the relationship of attorney and client was established, a fortiori, the communication was confidential, and inadmissible in evidence\u201d); <em>Tillinghast v. Lamp, </em>168 Md. 34, 42, 176 A. 629, 632 (1935) (holding that privileged communications between an attorney and her client are inadmissible). Therefore, the trial judge erred in basing her determination that Smith did not have valid grounds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination upon the disclosures made by Smith\u2019s attorney in violation of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>The Imposition of Sanctions for Direct Criminal Contempt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Smith also asserts that the trial judge did not follow the required procedures when she imposed the sanction for his direct criminal contempt. Specifically, Smith argues that because the sanction was meted out in a separately docketed proceeding, it cannot be considered to have been imposed summarily and as such, the trial judge\u2019s actions did not comply with the appropriate Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The parties do not dispute that the trial judge found Smith to be in direct criminal contempt. The issue, rather, is whether the trial judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>summarily imposed sanctions under Maryland Rule 15-203, or whether the imposition of sanctions should have been governed by Maryland Rules 15-204,15-205, and 15-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Maryland Rule 15-203 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">(a) Summary imposition of sanctions. The court against which a direct civil or criminal contempt has been committed may impose sanctions on the person who committed it summarily if (1) the presiding judge has personally seen, heard, or otherwise directly perceived the conduct constituting the contempt and has personal knowledge of the identity of the person committing it, and (2) the contempt has interrupted the order of the court and interfered -with the dignified conduct of the court\u2019s business. The court shall afford the alleged contemnor an opportunity, consistent with the circumstances then existing, to present exculpatory or mitigating information. If the court summarily finds and announces on the record that direct contempt has been committed, the court may defer imposition of sanctions until the conclusion of the proceeding during which the contempt was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Both the State and the Court of Special Appeals rely upon language in the Committee Note to Maryland Rule 15-203 for their conclusion that the contempt proceedings remained summary in nature despite the fact that the trial court imposed sanctions during a separately docketed hearing. The Committee Note to Maryland Rule 15-203 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Sanctions may be imposed immediately upon the finding of the contempt, or, in the court\u2019s discretion, may be deferred to a later time in the proceeding. Deferral of a sanction does not affect its summary nature. The sanction remains summary in nature in that no hearing is required; the court simply announces and imposes the sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Both the plain language of Maryland Rule 15-203(a) and the commentary contained in the Committee Note contemplate a deferral of sanctions until later in the proceedings in which the contempt occurred or immediately upon the conclusion of the proceedings. The term \u201csummary\u201d generally connotes an immediate action undertaken without following the usual formal procedures. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1476 (8th ed.2004). The procedures implemented in the case <em>sub judice </em>were neither immediate nor without the usual formalities of a hearing. The fact that the court held an independently docketed proceeding in which to dispense sanctions is entirely inconsistent with the concept of summary proceedings. Moreover, the trial judge engaged in an involved colloquy with Smith, permitted his attorney to present a mitigating argument, and solicited sentencing recommendations from the State and Smith\u2019s counsel. This case provides a stark contrast to <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>320 Md. 756, 580 A.2d 196 (1990), in which the trial court summarily imposed sanctions for Mitchell\u2019s contempt during his sentencing proceeding immediately after imposing the sentence for the underlying crime. Thus, circumstances of the present case lack the hallmarks of summary imposition of sanctions under Maryland Rule 15-203(a). Because the trial judge did not summarily impose sanctions for Smith\u2019s direct criminal contempt, Maryland Rule 15-204 governs the imposition of sanctions, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>In any proceeding involving a direct contempt for which the court determines not to impose sanctions summarily, the judge, reasonably promptly after the conduct, shall issue a \u25a0written order specifying the evidentiary facts within the personal knowledge of the judge as to the conduct constituting the contempt and the identity of the contemnor. Thereafter, the proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to Rule 15-205 or Rule 15-206, whichever is applicable, and Rule 15-207 in the same manner as constructive contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ\">Therefore, the trial judge erred in characterizing the imposition of sanctions in the present case as summary in nature and should have followed the procedures delineated in Maryland Rules 15-204,15-205,15-206, and 15-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In the present case, Smith cannot be retried on the direct contempt because we have concluded that the trial judge\u2019s determination that Smith could not invoke his Fifth Amendment right was based on an improper disclosure by Smith\u2019s counsel without an independent inquiry. As a result, if we were to remand this case for further proceedings, the trial judge would have to make an independent inquiry on the record regarding Smith\u2019s right to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which is a legal impossibility because the proceeding in which the direct contempt arose has concluded and cannot be reopened. As we noted in <em>Archer v. State, </em>383 Md. 329, 859 A.2d 210 (2004), \u201cDirect contempt is committed in the presence of the trial judge or so near him or her as to interrupt the court\u2019s proceedings, while constructive contempt is any other form of contempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 859 A.2d at 219, quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>382 Md. 329, 338, 855 A.2d 339, 344 (2004) (internal citations omitted). Further proceedings in the present case concerning whether Smith\u2019s refusal to testify constituted contempt would be inconsistent with the purpose of empowering the trial court to sanction direct contempt, which is to \u201cassurfe] the efficiency and dignity\u201d of the judiciary. <em>State v. Roll, </em>267 Md. 714, 726, 298 A.2d 867, 875 (1973). Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct that court to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with direction to dismiss the contempt action.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
