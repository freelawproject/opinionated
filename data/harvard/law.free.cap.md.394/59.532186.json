Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-904(g)(2) and 5-113(b) to determine whether the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applies to toll the limitations period for filing wrongful death and survival actions relating to an occupational disease. In the present case, both the wrongful death and survival actions were filed more than three years after the injured person\u2019s death. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City determined that both actions were barred by the statute of limitations and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. On appeal, however, the intermediate appellate court concluded that although the survival action was barred, the wrongful death action was not barred by limitations. For reasons to be explained in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On May 25, 1997, Robert L. Benjamin, Sr. (Mr. Benjamin) died of mesothelioma, a type of cancer in which a high percentage of cases are caused by asbestos exposure. On March 20, 2003, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Mrs. Elsie Benjamin (\u201cMrs. Benjamin\u201d), as personal representative of the estate of the decedent, Mr. Benjamin, filed a survival action against various defendants, including Georgia Pacific Corporation (\u201cGP\u201d) and Union Carbide Corporation (\u201cUC\u201d). In the same complaint, Mrs. Benjamin and Mr. Benjamin\u2019s two surviving children, Robert L. Benjamin, II, and Carol Jeffers (collectively \u201cthe Benjamins\u201d), filed a wrongful death action against the same defendants. Both UC and GP moved for summary judgment on the ground that both actions were barred by limitations. As to both motions, the trial court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On June 21, 2004, only Mrs. Benjamin, in her individual capacity and as personal representative for Mr. Benjamin, appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. On May 3, 2005, the Court of Special Appeals filed its opinion, in which it affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ment. In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, the intermediate appellate court held that Mrs. Benjamin\u2019s survival action was haired by limitations. The court reversed as to the wrongful death action. It held that, as to that action, the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to constitute inquiry notice. We granted the petition for <em>certiorari </em>filed by GP, UC, and Mrs. Benjamin. <em>Georgia-Pacific v. Benjamin, </em>388 Md. 404, 879 A.2d 1086 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that application of the judicially developed discovery rule is consistent with the language contained in \u00a7 3-904(g)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Specifically, in cases involving workplace exposure to toxic substances, like asbestos, a claimant, including a wrongful death claimant, is on inquiry notice of the causation element of a cause of action to recover injuries resulting from an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d e.g., mesothelioma when the claimant has knowledge that (1) the person whose injury forms the basis for the claim has been diagnosed with mesothelioma, and (2) the injured person was exposed to asbestos in the workplace. Further, we hold that in a survival action, if the decedent\u2019s knowledge is sufficient to satisfy the discovery rule, the decedent\u2019s knowledge is enough to trigger the running of the limitations period for the survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We adopt, in large part, the facts as set forth by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">In the complaint and in answers to interrogatories, [the respondents][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] assert[ ] that the decedent was employed as a laborer and carpenter while (1) in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1945, (2) work[ed] for the L.H. Benjamin Co. from 1946 to 1961, and (3) work[ed] for the R.L. Benjamin Lumber Co. from 1961 to 1971. According to [the respondents], the decedent was exposed to asbestos containing products at various times throughout his employment, including while working for the Benjamin companies, which stocked and sold several products containing asbestos. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>decedent was diagnosed with mesothelioma in early 1997, and he died on May 25, 1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><em>Benjamin v. Union Carbide, </em>162 Md.App. 178, 180, 873 A.2d 463, 467 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Mr. Benjamin\u2019s death certif\u00edcate indicated that the cause of death was \u201ccancer (metastatic mesothelioma).\u201d The respondents testified, as revealed in the affidavits and deposition testimony filed in these proceedings, that they discovered the nexus between asbestos exposure and cancer in late 2001 to early 2002, after the decedent\u2019s daughter, Carol Jeffers, read an article that stated that a high percentage of mesothelioma cases were caused by asbestos exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In <em>Benjamin, </em>the Court of Special Appeals summarized the evidence, as stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Summary of medical reports, depositions, and affidavits</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">A medical report, dated January 27, 1997, indicates that the decedent was referred to Dr. M. Jesada because of an abnormal chest x-ray and CAT scan. The report states that the decedent had periodic chest x-rays prior to December 1996, which were normal. As a result of a fall in November 1996, the decedent had various tests. The test included a chest X-ray, which was abnormal, and which was followed by a CAT scan, which was abnormal. According to the report, the decedent advised the physician that he had a history of asbestos exposure. Dr. Jesada\u2019s impression was possible mesothelioma, and a biopsy was recommended. Records from Harford Memorial Hospital reveal that the decedent was admitted on February 7, 1997, for a biopsy. An oncology report dated February 28, 1997, by Dr. Promila Suri, reflects a diagnosis of probable mesothelioma. The report indicates that the decedent stated that he had a history of exposure to asbestos in the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">A report dated March 4, 1997, by Dr. Viroon Donavanik, indicates that the decedent was admitted to the Medical Center of Delaware on March 4. The report contains a confirmation of a diagnosis of mesothelioma and a recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>mendation that decedent be treated with radiation and chemotherapy. The report again reveals that the decedent disclosed a history of asbestos exposure while working in a machine shop. The report further noted that decedent worked in the roofing and siding business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">[Mrs. Benjamin], in her affidavit, stated that she routinely attended medical appointments with the decedent in the spring of 1997, and that neither she nor the decedent was informed of the causal connection between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. [Mrs. Benjamin] stated that she first learned of the connection ... [as late as] 2002, when her daughter read an advertisement which referenced the connection and told [Mrs. Benjamin] about it. [Mrs. Benjamin] testified that she never made any inquiries about the cause of mesothelioma prior to that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">At the first motions hearing held on November 25, 2003, the court denied [these] motion[s] [by GP and UC and the other defendants] for summary judgment without prejudice, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201cWell ... I think the motion may be premature. And the reason I say that is that Mrs. Benjamin has not been deposed, and I gathered that from reading the papers, and I think that that ought to be done, because I don\u2019t want to make a decision in this case based upon an affidavit.\u201d Following the hearing, [Mrs. Benjamin] was deposed on December 23, 2003. The pertinent testimony is as follows: Q. Do you remember your husband telling Dr. Jesada that he had some exposure to asbestos in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">A.

Benjamin, II, testified [at the] deposition that he had no knowledge of the connection between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma until advised by his sister at \u201cthe end of 2001, early 2002.\u201d He also testified that he knew the decedent had cancer before death but he did not know it was mesothelioma until his sister told him in late 2001. There is no evidence that Robert L.

[Mrs. Benjamines sole argument [on appeal] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that neither she, the other beneficiaries, nor the decedent had sufficient actual knowledge to place them on inquiry notice so as to charge them with the knowledge that a reasonable investigation would have revealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 180-186, 878 A.2d at 467-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">After the deposition of Mrs. Benjamin, petitioners moved for summary judgment, contending that the action was barred by limitations, and the trial court granted the motion. The court held that respondents were on inquiry notice in 1997 when Mr. Benjamin was diagnosed with mesothelioma and was aware of his exposure to asbestos. Therefore, the three-year statute of limitations period expired as to both the wrongful death and survival actions in 2000, three years after Mr. Benjamin\u2019s death. Thereafter, on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The trial court properly grants a motion for summary judgment if the motion and the response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2-501; <em>Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 504, 801 A.2d 148, 152 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">If a motion for summary judgment relates to an issue involving the discovery rule and \u201cthere is any genuine dispute of material fact as to when the [claimants] possessed that degree of knowledge [of the circumstances which would cause a reasonable person in the position of the claimants to undertake an investigation which, if pursued with reasonable diligence, would have led to knowledge of the alleged cause of action], the issue is one for the trier of fact to resolve.\u201d <em>Bank of New York v. Sheff </em>382 Md. 235, 244, 854 A.2d 1269, 1275 (2004) (citing <em>O\u2019Hara v. Kovens, </em>305 Md. 280, 301-02, 503 A.2d 1313, 1323-24 (1986)). Conversely, \u201c[i]f there is no such genuine dispute ... and the question of whether the [claimants] were on inquiry notice more than three years before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>their suit was filed can be determined as a matter of law, summary judgment on that issue is ... appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">[i]n reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this Court must consider the facts reflected in the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and affidavits in the light most favorable to the non-moving parties, the [claimants]. Even if it appears that the relevant facts are undisputed, if those facts are susceptible to inferences supporting the position of the party opposing summary judgment, then a grant of summary judgment is improper. This Court has noted that the purpose of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the case or to decide the factual disputes, but to decide whether there is an issue of fact, which is sufficiently material to be tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Summary judgment unquestionably is an important device, within our court system, for streamlining litigation and ensuring the application of limited judicial resources to potentially meritorious claims. Additionally, it saves the parties expense and the delays of protracted and non-meritorious litigation. Nonetheless, dismissal of the case deprives the parties of a trial and the opportunity to develop their claims and present them to a jury. This Court has therefore been careful to restrict application of summary judgment to cases that present no material facts that may reasonably be said to be disputed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\"><em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 533-34, 836 A.2d 655, 669-70 (2003) (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">THE DISCOVERY RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the \u201c[q]uestion in this case is when [did the Benjamins\u2019] causes of action against the manufacturers of asbestos containing products accrue [ ].\u201d <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 191-92, 873 A.2d at 474. In order to answer that question, we begin by stating the general rule that a cause of action is said to accrue at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>time of the wrong. In <em>Hecht v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>333 Md. 324, 334, 635 A.2d 394, 399 (1994), this Court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">[historically, the general rule in Maryland was that a cause of action accrued on the date the wrong was committed. <em>Waldman v. Rohrbaugh, </em>241 Md. 137, 139, 215 A.2d 825 (1966); <em>Hahn v. Claybrook, </em>130 Md. 179, 182, 100 A. 83 (1917). Whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the wrong was not considered in determining accrual. This \u201cdate of the wrong\u201d rule did not differentiate between the plaintiff who was \u201cblamelessly ignorant\u201d of his potential claim and the plaintiff who had \u201cslumbered on his rights,\u201d <em>Harig [v. Johns-Manville Products, </em>284 Md. 70,] 83, 394 A.2d 299, [306 (1978) ]. It wrought harsh consequences in cases where plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred, not only before they were able to perceive any harm, but before it was possible for them to learn that the negligence had taken place, such as in situations involving professional services where the plaintiff was not qualified to ascertain the injury. <em>Waldman, supra, </em>241 Md. at 140, 215 A.2d 825, quoting <em>Developments in the Law, Statute of Limitations, </em>63 Harv. L.Rev. 1177, 1201 (1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, because of the \u201cunfairness inherent in charging a plaintiff with slumbering on rights not reasonably possible to ascertain, this Court adopted what is known as the discovery rule, which now applies generally in all civil actions, and which provides that a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff in fact knows or reasonably should know of the wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Our first recognition of the discovery rule was in the early 1900s in a medical malpractice case. <em>Hahn, </em>130 Md. at 187, 100 A. at 86 (recognizing that the cause of action, although barred in that case, did not accrue until an injury was discoverable). <em>See Harig, </em>284 Md. at 83, 394 A.2d at 306 (\u201cIn situations involving the latent development of disease, a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrues [under the discovery rule] when he ascertains, or through the exercise of reasonable care and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>diligence should have ascertained, the nature and cause of his injury.\u201d). Thus, the discovery rule was adopted to resolve unfairness and injustice. <em>Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 665, 464 A.2d 1020, 1026 (1983). The rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">requires that the plaintiff must have notice of a claim to start the running of limitations. We defined such notice in <em>Poffenberger </em>as \u201cexpress cognition or awareness implied from \u2018knowledge of circumstances which ought to have put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry [thus charging the individual] with notice of all facts which such an investigation would in all probability have disclosed if it had been properly pursued.\u2019 \u201d 290 Md.

The petitioners maintain that the triggering event was ultimately Mr. Benjamin\u2019s death. Further, they contend that it is immaterial that the Benjamins did not become aware, until 2001, that prior asbestos exposure caused the mesothelioma. The premise for this argument is that Mr. Benjamin died in 1997 as a result of cancer, and his death was the event that triggered the running of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In addition, UC maintains that in <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 57, 626 A.2d 353, 355 (1993), this Court held that under the wrongful death statute an action commences on the date of the injured person\u2019s death. Therefore, the discovery rule does not apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Alternatively, UC argues that even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>discovery rule applies, the family was on notice when Mr. Benjamin died of mesothelioma in 1997, and should have investigated further at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Benjamins assert that the Court of Special Appeals did not err when it held that there was no evidence in the record that the beneficiaries had any express knowledge, prior to late 2001, that Mr. Benjamin\u2019s death was linked to an occupational disease. Therefore, because summary judgment was inappropriate, their claims, although filed more than three years after Mr. Benjamin\u2019s death, should not be time barred. In addition, we note that a question of whether the beneficiaries had any knowledge as to the nature of the mesothelioma, other than that it was a form of cancer, is a question for the trier of fact and not for the court to decide on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The trial court held that the Benjamins were on notice when Mr. Benjamin was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Further, the trial court found that the Benjamins were aware of Mr. Benjamin\u2019s exposure to asbestos when he relayed that information to his doctors during the course of his medical diagnosis and treatment. The only reference, however, to the family\u2019s alleged communication with Mr. Benjamin\u2019s doctors was contained in a footnote in the trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion which indicated that Mrs. Benjamin accompanied her husband on doctor and hospital visits. Neither the son nor the daughter were mentioned in the opinion. Additionally, Mrs. Benjamin testified that either she was never told or did not recall any discussions with the doctors about Mr. Benjamin\u2019s previous asbestos exposure or the link between the mesothelioma and that exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The intermediate appellate court held that in a wrongful death action, \u201c[i]f the decedent does not have knowledge sufficient to satisfy the discovery rule, the [beneficiaries are] the determinative parties]....

In <em>Waddell, </em>we held that the limitations period prescribed in \u00a7 3-904(g) is a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Waddell, </em>an adult filed a wrongful death action approximately seventeen years after her father died from injuries sustained when his car collided with a tractor trailer. <em>Id. </em>at 54, 626 A.2d at 354. At the time of her father\u2019s death, the daughter was a minor. <em>Id. </em>The defendants moved to dismiss the wrongful death claim because it was filed more than three years after the decedent\u2019s death. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>On appeal the daughter argued, among other things, that the 1971 changes to \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(g)(1), amending the statute from a two year limitations period to three years, changed the time period of the statute from a condition precedent to a statute of limitations. We disagreed and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">In <em>[State v.

The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone. It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all.. .. Time has been made of the essence of the right and the right is lost if the time is disregarded.

The statutes were enacted in an effort to balance the competing interests of potential plaintiffs, potential defendants, and the public.

The Legislature stated that before 1986, under the wrongful death statute, occupational disease involved \u201clatent or dormant\u201d phases that may be undiscoverable beyond \u201cthe 3-year <em>statute of limitations.\u201d </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Summary of Committee Report, S.B. 864 at 1 (Md.1986) (emphasis added). The legislative purpose of the revisions was that the <em>\u201cstatute of limitations </em>[would start to run] ... [from] the discovery of facts from which it becomes known or reasonably should become known that the occupational disease was a cause of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Unfortunately, the General Assembly did not define the phrase \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d before or after its revisions, however it acknowledged that the wrongful death statute \u201cruns from the date [of death]....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. No outward declaration was made that \u00a7 5-101 would apply to the wrongful death statute, thus we presume that the Legislature meant that the limitations period provided within \u00a7 3-904(g)(2) would apply. <em>See supra </em>at note 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We were faced with the same issue in 1971, when the Legislature changed the time period to bring a wrongful death action from two years to three years, and used the phrase \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d in the preamble. <em>Waddell, </em>331 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>61, 626 A.2d at 357; 1971 Md.

It also noted that the Legislature created a different time period in which to bring a wrongful death claim for deaths caused by occupational disease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">Prior to 1986, subsection (g) provided only one time period in which to bring a wrongful death action. In that year, the Legislature amended that subsection to include what is now paragraph (2), <em>providing a different time period </em>in which to bring a wrongful death action when the death is alleged to have been caused by occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 63, 626 A.2d at 357 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">No sound reason has been advanced for us to now change our prior interpretation of \u00a7 3-904(g)(2). The limitations period prescribed in \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(g)(2) is a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action when death is alleged to have been caused by occupational disease. The limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>period prescribed in \u00a7 3-904(g), providing that an action \u201cshall be filed within three years after the death of the injured person,\u201d is similarly a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action for wrongful death in all other cases. Further, we hold that because the Legislature, pursuant to \u00a7 3-904(g), provided a different time period for the commencement of a wrongful death action, the general statute of limitations specified in \u00a7 5-101 does not apply. Our holdings herein are consistent with our observations in <em>Waddell. </em>Aside from our conclusion that the limitations period prescribed by this statute is a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action, our construction of \u00a7 3-904(g)(2) alone, pursuant to the rules of statutory interpretation, is consistent with the notion that the Legislature intended to \u201cincorporate[ ] the discovery rule as judicially developed.\u201d <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 197-98, 873 A.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Interpretation of \u00a7 3-904(g)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Most of the language in \u00a7 3-904(g) is not at issue. There is no dispute as to the plain meaning of subsection (g)(1) that a wrongful death action must be filed \u201cthree years after the death of the injured person[ ]\u201d unless a claimant falls under an exception provided under subsection (g)(2) of the statute. The provisions in section 3-904(g)(l) are a condition precedent to bringing a cause of action. The language of (g)(1) provides that an exception to the general rule exists. Before the 1986 revision, however, no exception was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Subsection (2)(I) defines \u201coccupational disease\u201d as \u201ca disease caused by exposure to any toxic substance in the person\u2019s workplace and contracted by a person in the course of the person\u2019s employment.\u201d Subsection (g)(2)(ii) provides that \u201cif an occupational disease was the cause of a person\u2019s death\u201d a wrongful death action shall be filed \u201c1. [wjithin 10 years of the time of death; or 2. [wjithin 3 years of the date when the cause of death was discovered, whichever is shorter. The Legislature set a mandatory ceiling on how long a claimant has to file a wrongful death action. If a claimant discovers, ten years and four months after death, that the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>person\u2019s death was ultimately caused by asbestos exposure, the claimant is barred from bringing an action under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Subsection (2)(ii)(2) does not specify the meaning of the phrase \u201cwhen the cause of death was discovered.\u201d The drafters provided no definition in either the statute itself, or within the Subtitle, for the phrase \u201ccause of death.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-901 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings. <em>See </em>Title 3, Subtitle 9 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings. In Mr. Benjamin\u2019s case, the term \u201ccause of death\u201d could mean mesothelioma, as indicated in the death certificate; or the term could mean, exposure to asbestos which caused or contributed to the mesothelioma. The term \u201ccause of death\u201d is therefore ambiguous. Notwithstanding the ambiguity within the statute itself, we have had occasion to interpret the word \u201cdiscovered\u201d as used in other limitations statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cdiscovered,\u201d or in the present tense \u201cdiscover,\u201d is \u201cto make known (something secret, hidden, unknown, or previously unnoticed). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 647 (2002). In <em>Piselli v. 75th Street Medical, </em>371 Md. 188, 193-94, 808 A.2d 508, 510-11 (2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit presented to this Court a certified question as to whether the word \u201cdiscovered\u201d within the meaning of the medical malpractice statute of limitations incorporated the discovery rule. The language of the statute provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">(a) <em>Limitations. </em>\u2014 An action for damages for injury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render professional services by a health care provider ... shall be filed within....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u2756 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">(2) Three years of the date the injury was <em>discovered. </em>Md.Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-109(a)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In construing the term \u201cdiscovered,\u201d we held that the \u201cunambiguous language of \u00a7 5-109(a)(2) does embody the traditional Maryland \u2018discovery rule\u2019.... \u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 203, 808 A.2d at 517. Application of the discovery rule involves a two-prong test. The first prong, \u201csufficiency of the actual knowledge to put the claimant on inquiry notice,\u201d concerns the nature and extent of actual knowledge necessary to cause an ordinarily diligent plaintiff to make an inquiry or investigation that an injury has been sustained. <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 193-94, 873 A.2d at 475. <em>See O\u2019Hara, </em>305 Md. at 302, 503 A.2d at 1324; <em>Pennwalt v. Nasios, </em>314 Md. 433, 453, 550 A.2d 1155, 1165-66 (noting that a plaintiff must have notice of the nature and cause of his or her injury). For inquiry notice, a person must have actual notice, either express or implied. Express knowledge is direct, whether written or oral, from sources \u201ccognizant of the fact[s].\u201d <em>Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. at 636-37, 431 A.2d at 681 (citation omitted). Implied notice occurs \u201cwhen a plaintiff gains knowledge sufficient to prompt a reasonable person to inquire further.\u201d <em>Pennwalt, </em>314 Md. at 447, 550 A.2d at 1163. Constructive notice or knowledge will not suffice for inquiry notice. <em>See Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. at 637, 431 A.2d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Pennwalt, </em>we discussed that actual notice was necessary to satisfy the first prong of the discovery rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">We stated in <em>Poffenberger </em>that a \u201ccause of action accrues when the claimant in fact knew or reasonably should have known of the wrong.\u201d The defendant conceded that the plaintiff did not have express knowledge of the wrong ... but instead argued that the plaintiff should have known of the wrong at th[e] time [of the injury]. In particular, the defendant argued that the plaintiff had constructive knowledge of the defendant\u2019s breach and negligence.... We rejected this argument holding that constructive notice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>insufficient to give a plaintiff knowledge of the wrong. Instead, we ruled that actual knowledge, either express or implied, is necessary. We defined implied actual knowledge as that knowledge that would in all probability have resulted from a reasonably diligent investigation pursued upon awareness of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to investigate. We remanded the case to the trial court in order to resolve a factual dispute regarding whether ... the plaintiff possessed knowledge from which actual notice could be inferred. In other words, it was debatable whether the plaintiff had knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a reasonable person to investigate further. In sum, <em>Poffenberger </em>extended the ameliorative effects of the discovery rule ... and set the stage for future discussions regarding the function of implied knowledge in relation to the workings of the discovery rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">314 Md. at 442-43, 550 A.2d at 1160 (citation omitted) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The second prong, \u201cthe sufficiency of the knowledge that would have resulted from a reasonable investigation,\u201d requires that after a reasonable investigation of facts, a reasonably diligent inquiry would have disclosed whether there is a causal connection between the injury and the wrongdoing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 193, 873 A.2d at 475; <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>305 Md. at 302, 503 A.2d at 1324. <em>See Pennwalt, </em>314 Md. at 452, 550 A.2d at 1165; <em>Baysinger v. Schmid, </em>307 Md. 361, 367-68, 514 A.2d 1, 4 (1986). The requirement for inquiry notice is that if a person investigates diligently, the causal connection would be revealed. <em>In Re Klein Moffett Co., </em>28 F.2d 523, 525 (D.Md.1928) (\u201c[N]otice of facts which would incite a person of reasonable prudence to inquire is notice of all facts which reasonably diligent inquiry would develop.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In <em>Lumsden v. Design Tech Builders, Inc., </em>358 Md. 435, 444, 749 A.2d 796, 803 (2000), this Court applied the discovery rule to a real property statute. The statute, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">(d) <em>Limitations of actions. </em>\u2014 Any action arising under this subtitle shall be commenced within two years after the defect was <em>discovered or should have been discovered </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU\">Md.Code (1974, 1996 RepLVol, 1999 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-204(b)(3)(d) of the Real Property Article (emphasis added). The Court in <em>Lumsden </em>interpreted the term \u201cdiscovered\u201d to mean that the cause of action accrued upon discovery of the wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 749 A.2d at 799 (\u201cSection 10-204(d) mandates that the period for a cause of action under this subtitle commences when the cause of action was discovered or should have been discovered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In the present case, petitioners contend that because the word \u201caccrue\u201d was omitted from \u00a7 3-904(g)(2)(ii)(2), and from the survival statute \u00a7 5-113(b), the discovery rule does not apply to either statute. In answering this contention, we find the analysis of the Court of Special Appeals in this case most persuasive. The intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">In 1987, the 5-year period that was in the original enactment was changed to the current 10 years. Also in 1987, the legislature enacted section 5-113.... In 1988, the enactment was amended to add \u00a7 (c), defining proximate cause. While the language in the two limitations/repose provisions is not the same, <em>i.e., </em>section 5-113(b) provides that a claim has to be \u201cfiled within 3 years of the discovery of facts from which it was <em>lenoum or reasonably should have been known </em>that an occupational disease was the proximate cause of death,\u201d and section 3 \u2014 904(g)(2)(ii)(2) provides that a claim has to be filed \u201c[wjithin 3 years of the date when the cause of death <em>was discovered,\u201d </em>we conclude that, in each instance, the legislature incorporated the discovery rule as judicially developed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\"><em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 197-98, 873 A.2d at 477 (citations omitted). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>In our view, the Legislature incorporated the discovery rule into the wrongful death statute, \u00a7 3 \u2014 904(g)(2), by using the phrase \u201cwhen the cause of death was discovered.\u201d This implies that the person maintaining a claim for wrongful death has a duty to discover the wrongful act (asbestos exposure) and the antecedent disease leading to the decedent\u2019s death (mesothelioma). This interpretation of the statute is consistent with the notion that the prescribed limitations period will commence when the claimants (beneficiaries) obtain knowledge of the injury and the cause of that injury which resulted in the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Further, our investigation of the legislative intent reveals that the 1986 preamble to Senate Bill 864, now codified as \u00a7 3-904(g)(2)(ii), states that \u201c[a]s a matter of fundamental fairness, a cause of action should not be deemed to have accrued until the date that knowledge of the wrong upon which the action is based is discovered or should be discovered.\u201d Ch. 374 of the Laws Maryland 1986. Consistent with our interpretation of the statute in <em>Waddell, </em>we review the language contained in the preamble and conclude that the Legislature intended that an occupational disease-related wrongful death action accrues when \u201cknowledge of the wrong upon which the action is based is discovered or should be discovered.\u201d <em>Waddell, </em>331 Md. at 62, 626 A.2d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The legislative intent is further clarified in the Senate committee report, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">Under this bill, the statute of limitations would not begin to run until facts are discovered from which it becomes known or should become known that the occupational disease was the cause of death....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\"><em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">The [legislative] intent of this bill is to provide that the 3-year statute of limitations in a wrongful death action for a death caused by an occupational disease does not begin to run until the discovery of facts from which it becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>known or reasonably should become known that the occupational disease was the cause of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Summary of Committee Report, S.B. 864 at 1-2 (Md.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Further, the Senate Bill Analysis stated that the amendment, \u201c[r]equires that a wrongful death action be filed within 3 years after the death of the injured person or the date the dependents know or should have known of the wrongful act, whichever date is later.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Bill Analysis, S.B. 864 at 1 (Md.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The Legislature intended that the discovery rule apply to \u00a7 3-904(g)(2), in cases of wrongful death caused by occupational disease, as indicated in the language of the preamble, the bill analysis, and the committee report. Finally, we review the decisions of other jurisdictions that have determined that the discovery rule applies to wrongful death statutes on the theory that the injury was discovered after the expiration of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The federal district court questioned whether the discovery rule applied to the Illinois wrongful death statute, which provided that an action \u201cshall be commenced within two years after the death.\u201d In the <em>Johns-Manville Asbestosis </em>Cases, 511 F.Supp. 1235, 1236 (1981). The longstanding rule in Illinois was that the limitations period prescribed in the wrongful death statute constituted a condition precedent, thus was a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">\u201ccondition of liability, and operate[d] as a limitation of the liability itself, and not the remedy alone.\u201d They are grounded on the fact that the wrongful death action is considered \u201cwholly statutory\u201d \u2014 a cause of action created by the General Assembly where none existed at common law. So the time period specified in [the wrongful death statute] is considered \u201ca condition attached to the right to sue and ... not merely a statute of limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">In <em>Johns-ManviMe, </em>several plaintiffs filed wrongful death actions seeking damages after the two-year limitations period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>had run, and argued that the discovery rule should apply because the injury was discovered after the limitations period. <em>Id. </em>The defendants asserted that application of the discovery rule would be at odds with the statutory directive and the statute should be strictly construed. <em>Id. </em>at 1237. The court in <em>Johns-Manville </em>discussed several cases, including two Illinois wrongful death cases in which the discovery rule was applied after the two-year limitations period had expired. <em>Id. See Fure v. Sherman Hospital, </em>64 Ill.App.3d 259, 21 Ill.Dec. 50, 380 N.E.2d 1376, 1385 (1978) (holding that the discovery rule should not be barred for wrongful death, if allowed for \u201cmere wounding or injury\u201d); <em>Praznik v. Sport Aero, Inc., </em>42 Ill.App.3d 330, 355 N.E.2d 686, 690 (1976) (\u201cWhile a wrongful death action is a right created by statute, and ... may not be ignored, we are not convinced that in all cases the two-year period must begin to run at the moment of death.... \u201d). The Court in <em>Johns-Manville </em>considered the latent disease factor and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201c[w]e are of the opinion that in a case such as this, where the injury occurred over a long period of time and not as a result of one sudden traumatic event, the preferred rule is that the cause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows or should know of an injury and that injury was probably caused by the wrongful acts of another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1238 (citation omitted); <em>Eisenmann v. Cantor, </em>567 F.Supp. 1347, 1354 (1983) (holding that although the Illinois wrongful death statute was a condition precedent to liability, the discovery rule applied); <em>White v. Johns-Manville, </em>103 Wash.2d 344, 693 P.2d 687, 693 (1985) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding, in a case involving mesothelioma, asbestos exposure, a condition precedent to the wrongful death statute and the discovery rule, that the \u201cwrongful death action \u2018accrues\u2019 at the time the decedent\u2019s personal representative discovered or should have discovered the cause of action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a person bringing a wrongful death action under \u00a7 3-904(g)(2) has ten years from the time of the decedent\u2019s death to bring an action, or three years from the time the claimant(s) discover or should have discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that an \u201coccupational disease\u201d contributed to or caused the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Further, sufficient evidence existed to generate a genuine dispute as to the material facts. The evidence submitted was that Mrs. Benjamin, Carol Jeffers, and Robert Benjamin, III, were on inquiry notice for the first time in 2001 when Carol Jeffers discovered the connection between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. Mrs. Benjamin\u2019s knowledge of her husband\u2019s cancer diagnosis and the asbestos exposure are matters in dispute and are not subject to resolution by summary judgment. Thus, we affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the trial court erred when it granted the petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">SURVIVAL ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Mrs. Benjamin, personal representative on behalf of the Estate of Robert L. Benjamin, Sr., contends that the intermediate appellate court erred when it held that sufficient evidence existed to imply that Mr. Benjamin was on inquiry notice. According to Mrs. Benjamin, simply because Mr. Benjamin discussed his previous asbestos exposure with his physicians and he had express knowledge of the mesothelioma, does not equate to notice sufficient for a reasonable person to conduct an investigation to find a link between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma. Mrs. Benjamin maintains that the decedent did not have actual notice that the mesothelioma was caused by his exposure to asbestos. Therefore, she concludes that the first prong of the discovery rule was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The trial court determined that evidence in Mr. Benjamin\u2019s medical report indicated specific examples and several references to asbestos exposure and the diagnosis of mesothelioma. The trial judge found that the evidence was sufficient to put Mr. Benjamin on inquiry notice, and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">[w]hen a patient volunteers information about his condition there can be no explanation other than he believes it is significant. The proffered facts may or may not be relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to the patient[\u2019]s disease \u2014 but he has a duty to investigate. He cannot raise the issue then ignore it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reviewed the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the survival action and held that Mr. Benjamin had express knowledge of his mesothelioma and asbestos exposure, and the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find that the decedent was on inquiry notice prior to his death in 1997.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Benjamin, </em>162 MdApp. at 205, 873 A.2d at 481. The court held that a reasonable person would have investigated and discovered a causal connection between mesothelioma and asbestos exposure by the state of general knowledge of occupational diseases and asbestos exposure at the time. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Under the survival statute, if an occupational disease was the proximate cause of a claimant\u2019s death, damages can be claimed \u201cwithin three years from the date\u201d the action accrues \u201cbut not later than 10 years from the date of death.\u201d Md. Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-113 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings. Maryland has applied both the discovery rule and the statute of limitations to survival claims for close to a century. <em>See Geisz, supra, </em>313 Md. at 306, 545 A.2d at 660 (and cases cited therein). <em>See Trimper, supra, </em>305 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>35-36, 501 A.2d at 457-58 (holding that the statute of limitations applies to survival actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Mr. Benjamin\u2019s express knowledge of his exposure to asbestos products, coupled with his express knowledge of his diagnosis of mesothelioma, was sufficient to put him on inquiry notice during his lifetime. <em>See O\u2019Hara, supra, </em>305 Md. at 302, 503 A.2d at 1324 (noting that a plaintiff is on notice when he has \u201cknowledge of circumstances which would cause a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff! ] to undertake an investigation which, if pursued with reasonable diligence, would have led to knowledge of the alleged [tort].\u201d). We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, given the state of the general knowledge of occupational diseases and asbestos exposure in 1997, \u201c[a]ll of the facts necessary to make a claim were in existence at the time of the diagnosis of mesothelioma, and a reasonable inquiry would have disclosed a cause of action.\u201d <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 204, 873 A.2d at 481; <em>See Globe American, supra, </em>76 Md.App. at 534, 547 A.2d at 658 (noting that in a survival action, the cause of action accrues during the victim\u2019s lifetime); <em>Trimper, </em>305 Md. at 52, 501 A.2d at 457-58 (\u201c[I]nvolving latent development of disease, any cause of action of the injured person accrues either (1) when he ascertains, or through the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have ascertained, the nature and cause of his injury, or (2) at death, whichever first occurs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The decedent\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries accrued in 1997, during his lifetime, when he was placed on inquiry notice. The survival action was not filed until 2003. The personal representative\u2019s cause of action, filed on behalf of Mr. Benjamin, under the survival statute, is barred by limitations because the claim was brought more than three years after the date of accrual. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment concerning the survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

UC also relies on <em>Trimper v. Porter-Hayden, </em>305 Md. 31, 501 A.2d 446 (1985). Its reliance is misplaced. In <em>Trimper, </em>two widows filed wrongful death and survival actions, more than three years after their husbands\u2019 deaths, alleging that their husbands died as a result of asbestos exposure. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 501 A.2d at 447-48. In that case, we acknowledged that wrongful death claims are governed by \u00a7 3-904(g). In that regard, we refused to extend the application of the discovery rule to wrongful death actions because the legislature created the cause of action and imposed a time limit, \u201cwithin three years after the decedent\u2019s death,\u201d for filing a wrongful death action. <em>Id </em>at 35-36, 501 A.2d at 449.

[The action arises] only [by] the actual death of the victim.\u201d <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 202, 873 A.2d at 480 (citations omitted); BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1644 (8th ed. 2004) (A wrongful death action is defined as \"[a] lawsuit brought on behalf of a decedent\u2019s survivors for their damages resulting from a tortious injury that caused the decedent's death.\u201d). <em>See also Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Maryland's general statute of limitations is applicable to most civil actions and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">A civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. The petitioners argue that the plain language of the statute states that the cause of death in this case is mesothelioma, and as such, one does not have to look further for a definition. To the contrary, the Benjamins contend that the plain language of the statute means that the latent cause of death was asbestos exposure. As a result, they were not on notice as to the link between mesothelioma and the asbestos exposure until 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">. The issue of whether the second prong of the discovery rule was satisfied, <em>sub judice, </em>was not raised on appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. Other than a preliminary introduction, the issue will not be discussed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. The Court of Special Appeals also addressed the issue of whether the survival suit could be brought by Mrs. Benjamin in 2001, since Mr. Benjamin died in 1997. <em>Benjamin, </em>162 Md.App. at 190-91, 873 A.2d at 473. \"[Mr. Benjamin] discovered his cause of action in early 1997 and died in May of the same year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, at the time of decedent\u2019s death, the statute of limitations had not yet run on his claim. <em>Id. </em>Mrs. Benjamin, as personal representative, brought the decedent\u2019s action for personal injuries when she discovered the causal connection between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, more than three years after her husband\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>If Mr. Benjamin had lived, the last date on which he could have brought a claim against the defendants for personal injuries relating to his occupational disease would have been early 2000. Accordingly, we agree with the intermediate appellate court that Mr. Benjamin's survival action accrued before his death, \"because the claim [arose] out of personal injuries sustained by the decedent during his lifetime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 873 A.2d at 480. Thus, the knowledge obtained by Mr. Benjamin during his lifetime cut short the limitations period which continued to run following his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
