The juvenile charges were based upon an incident which occurred on August 26, 2002. On that date, Antoine M. allegedly trespassed upon property owned by Jillian and Jerry Keene in Hagerstown, Maryland, and used by the Keene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>family as their residence. The alleged trespass occurred two months after Antoine M. was notified in a writing that he was not to come upon the property owned by the Keenes for any reason, and that, if he did so, charges would be filed against him. The notice was delivered to him by a police officer of the Hagerstown Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">At the juvenile delinquency hearing on the charges, the State presented Mrs. Keene\u2019s testimony regarding the trespass. Mrs. Keene testified that she wrote a no-trespassing letter in June 2002, informing Antoine M. that he was not welcome on the property owned by the Keenes and that, if he came upon the property, she intended to file charges. She stated that, after that letter was delivered to Antoine M., he continued to come upon the Keene property. Mrs. Keene testified that Antoine M. was never given permission to come upon the property by her or Mr. Keene and that they did everything in their power to discourage this behavior. Mrs. Keene testified that on August 26, 2002, the date of the alleged trespass, she had no knowledge of anyone in her home giving Antoine M. permission to be on the property. Mrs. Keene stated that, from the date that the no-trespassing letter was issued to Antoine M. until the date of the alleged trespass, Antoine M. was at the Keene home on numerous occasions. At one point in her testimony she indicated that Antoine M. was in the Keene home \u201ceveryday,\u201d stating, \u201che\u2019s always there.\u201d She estimated that during the summer of 2002 he was on the property on approximately 15 to 20 occasions. Mrs. Keene further testified that she was unsure of a possible dating relationship between her daughter and Antoine M., but that, to the best of her knowledge, her daughter had not invited Antoine M. into the home on August 26, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant made a motion for judgment of acquittal on both the trespassing charge and the destruction of property charge, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I make a motion for judgment of acquittal based on the, the State\u2019s failure to, uh, make a prima facie case at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>[COURT]: All right, what\u2019s ... as to the destruction of property, I think it\u2019s granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A48\">[COURT]: How about, I want to hear your argument on trespass, what ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The State has failed to produce facts sufficient to carry its burden at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Thereafter, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on the trespassing charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">During the defendant\u2019s case, Antoine M. testified that he did not trespass upon the Keene\u2019s property but was invited by the Keene\u2019s 15 year-old daughter, whom he was dating at the time of the alleged trespass. Antoine M. testified that, from the time he received the no-trespassing letter in June 2002 until the date of the alleged trespass in August 2002, he had been on the Keene\u2019s property on several occasions and that Mrs. Keene had invited him into the home on at least one of those occasions and had served him dinner. Antoine M. further testified that, when he would visit the Keene home, he would knock on the door and Mrs. Keene would either invite him into the home or ask him to wait on the porch while she went to get her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Following Antoine M.\u2019s testimony, the defense rested its case. The State then called Mr. Keene as a rebuttal witness. Mr. Keene testified that he was aware of the letter written by his wife in June 2002 notifying Antoine M. that he was not welcome on the Keene property. Mr. Keene testified that, following the delivery of that letter, Antoine M. was never told that he could come upon the Keene\u2019s property. Mr. Keene stated that his problem with Antoine M. was that he would not leave the property when asked and that on one occasion the Keenes threatened him with a shotgun in order to get him to leave. Mr. Keene further testified, however, that Antoine M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>was \u201cmade welcome\u201d at the Keene home on several occasions after the issuance of the letter, but that he did not intend the \u201cwelcome\u201d to mean that Antoine M. had permission to come upon the property. When asked by defense counsel, \u201c[w]ere there times after June when Antoine was made welcome in your home?\u201d Mr. Keene responded: \u201cYes sir, I\u2019ll have to say there were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">When asked by the court to clarify what he meant by \u201cmade welcome,\u201d Mr. Keene explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cWell, we, he refuses to leave. He\u2019s very obsessed, and I\u2019ve taken him, offered to take him home many nights. And, uh, sometimes I have taken him home. And, some nights I would say, \u2018Antoine, let me drive you home,\u2019 and he would say, \u2018No, I\u2019ve got a place to stay,\u2019 but, basically, he\u2019d be staying around the periphery of the property all night, looking for an opportunity to come in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cMade welcome in the sense that he wasn\u2019t abused. He was never made welcome in the sense, \u2018Yeah, you have permission to be here,\u2019 because we always wanted him to get it in his head that he needed to stay away, and we could never get that in his head. And, quite literally, it was do something bad to him, or know that he was gonna be there, and, you know, I, we threatened to use the shotgun on him. That\u2019s, you know, we didn\u2019t want to kill the young man. He\u2019s still alive, so obviously we didn\u2019t use the shotgun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">At the close of all the evidence, the defendant did not renew his motion for judgment of acquittal on the trespassing charge. The trial court then concluded that Antoine M. did trespass upon the Keenes\u2019 property and, therefore, was delinquent. The trial judge\u2019s entire finding in this regard was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cI, I have no difficulty concluding, based upon the evidence, that the owners of the property, Mr. and Mrs. Keene, the property known as 39 Broadway, they, as lawful owners, provided a no-trespass notice. It was received in approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>mately June 2002, and on August 26, 2002, Mr. M. was there, not as an invited guest, but simply because he showed up. Perhaps he was given permission by the daughter. I don\u2019t think she has the authority when the legal owners have notified a person that their property, their private property is off limits, that ... cannot be countermanded by a teenage daughter. And, so he was notified, knew what the deal was, and decided to enter the property anyway. I do not find that after delivery of the letter that he was there as an invited guest, which would, essentially, knock out, or countermand the written letter in June of 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">\u201cTherefore, I find beyond a reasonable doubt, he has committed the act of trespass.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">After issuing its decision, the trial court ordered that Antoine M. be placed in his mother\u2019s home under house arrest until the disposition hearing. At the disposition hearing, Antoine M. was committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for foster care placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Antoine M. appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals, applying Maryland Rule 4-324(a), held that Antoine M. was required to make a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence. Because Antoine M. failed to do so, the intermediate appellate court held that he lost his right to argue on appeal that the evidence was insufficient. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201cMaryland Rule 4-324(a) provides: \u2018A defendant may move for judgment of acquittal ... at the close of the evidence offered by the State and in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence.\u2019 The Rule further provides that \u2018[t]he defendant shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u2019 <em>See Dumornay v. </em>State, 106 Md.App. 361, 375, 664 A.2d 469 (1995) (appellant failed to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence; therefore, the issue of sufficiency of the evidence was not properly before appellate court). <em>See also In re Nahif A., </em>123 Md.App. 193, 208, 717 A.2d 393 (1998) (applying Rule 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>324(a) in a juvenile case). We have no discretion in the matter. <em>Williams v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 1, 748 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 335, 753 A.2d 1032 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">\u201cHere, appellant failed to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence. Accordingly, appellant has failed to preserve his sufficiency argument on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Turning to Antoine M.\u2019s alternative argument that he had a <em>bona fide </em>belief that he was permitted to be on the property, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201c[I]t is clear under the facts presented that appellant could not have reasonably or honestly believed that he was welcome on the Keene property or in their house. Unlike the facts of <em>In re Jason Allen D. </em>[, 127 Md.App. 456, 733 A.2d 351 (1999) ], this case does not involve complicated landlord tenant law where there are two apparent authorities, the landlord and the parent tenant. Rather, this case involves simple home ownership law and <em>one </em>authority, the owner parents. If the Keenes\u2019 fifteen-year-old daughter had invited appellant onto the property, in contravention of her parent\u2019s orders and the no-trespass letter her parents wrote, appellant could not reasonably assert that he honestly believed that he was entitled to be on the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Antoine M. then filed in this Court a petition for writ of certiorari which we granted. <em>In re Antoine M., </em>379 Md. 225, 841 A.2d 339 (2004). In his petition and brief, Antoine M. initially argues that the Court of Special Appeals erroneously applied Rule 4-324(a) to the trial court juvenile delinquency proceeding. He relies on <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 90, 646 A.2d 1012, 1014 (1994), where this Court held that \u201cthe criminal rules under Title 4 of the Maryland Rules do not apply to juvenile proceedings.\u201d Antoine M. further points out that Rule 4-324(a)\u2019s requirement of a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the evidence applies only to jury trials. He asserts that the appellate courts should review the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the trial court\u2019s findings because a juvenile delinquency proceeding is a non-jury trial. Antoine M. invokes Rule 8-131(c), which provides that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201c[w]hen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Antoine M. contends that, under Rule 8-131(c), he was not required to make a motion for judgment of acquittal in order to preserve his right to appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Antoine M. next argues that the evidence presented in the trial court was insufficient to find that he had committed a trespass under Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 576 and 577. According to Antoine M., the proper standards under the trespass statute are whether his being on the Keenes\u2019 property on August 26, 2002, was \u201cwanton\u201d and whether he reasonably had an \u201chonest\u201d or \u201cgood faith\u201d belief that he was permitted on the property. Antoine M. maintains that the evidence showing that, after the June 2002 notice, the daughter invited him to be on the property, that the Keenes tolerated his presence on their property, and that the Keenes on occasion made him \u201cwelcome,\u201d demonstrated that he lacked the requisite <em>mens rea </em>required by the trespassing statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, Antoine M. argues, there was insufficient evidence of a criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The State responds by pointing out that, in a series of cases, the Court of Special Appeals has appeared to take the position that Rule 4-324(a), and particularly the requirement of a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, applies to juvenile delinquency trials. In addition to the instant case, <em>see, e.g., In re Nahif A., </em>123 Md.App. 193, 208, 717 A.2d 393, 401 (1998); <em>In re Jason Allen D., </em>127 Md.App. 456, 473, 733 A.2d 351, 359-360 (1999). The State, however, relying upon <em>In re Victor B., supra, </em>336 Md. 85, 646 A.2d 1012, and <em>Ennis v. State, </em>306 Md. 579, 510 A.2d 573 (1986), \u201cagree[s] with Petitioner that a motion for judgment of acquittal need not be filed under the circumstances of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to preserve a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d (State\u2019s brief at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">With regard to the merits, the State also agrees with Antoine M. that a person \u201c \u2018has a defense to trespassing, when he honestly and in good faith believes that he is authorized to be on the property and when that belief is reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 5). The State \u201cdisagrees, however, that the juvenile court misapplied that law in adjudicating Antoine M. delinquent of trespassing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.). </em>The State argues that both the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals applied the correct legal standards, and that \u201cthe evidence was legally sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that Antoine M. committed the delinquent act of trespass.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We agree with Antoine M. and the State that Rule 4-324(a) has no application to juvenile delinquency trials. Preliminarily, the provision in Rule 4-324(a) regarding a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, by its very terms, is applicable only \u201cin a jury trial.\u201d Moreover, Rule 4-324(a) in its entirety has no application to non-jury trials. <em>See Ennis v. State, supra, </em>306 Md. at 590-597, 510 A.2d at 579-582, for a detailed discussion of Rule 4-324(a) and its predecessors, as well as the history and constitutional underpinnings of the motion-for-judgment-of-acquittal requirement in criminal jury trials and the lack of such requirement in non-jury trials. A juvenile delinquency trial is a non-jury proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">More broadly, this Court in <em>In re Victor B., supra, </em>and several subsequent cases, held that Title 4 of the Maryland Rules, dealing with criminal procedure, does not apply in juvenile delinquency proceedings. Judge Raker for the Court in <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. at 95-96, 646 A.2d at 1016-1017, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201c \u2018Title 4 applies to criminal matters, post conviction procedures, and expungement of records in the District Court and the circuit courts.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>To like effect, Rule 4-101, <em>Applicability, </em>under Title 4 states that \u2018[t]he rules in this Title govern procedure in all criminal matters, post conviction procedures, and expungement of records in both the circuit courts and the District Court, except as otherwise specifically provided.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201cWe find the language ... clear and unambiguous. Title 4 <em>only </em>applies to \u2018criminal matters, post conviction procedures, and expungement of records in the District Court and the circuit courts.\u2019 \u201d Neither rule provides that Title 4 applies to juvenile proceedings. Because Title 4 deals solely with criminal matters, it was unnecessary for the drafters of the rule to expressly exclude juvenile causes from Title 4. Since juvenile proceedings are civil in nature and are governed by the specific rules of procedure set out under Chapter 900 [now Title 11], it was necessary for the drafters of Rule 1-101 to expressly exclude juvenile causes from the Title 2 civil rules of procedure. In light of the clear and unambiguous language of Rules 1-101 and 4-101, the criminal rules of procedure therefore do not apply to juvenile proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201cWe find that neither the Maryland Rules nor the Juvenile Causes Act provides for the application of the criminal rules of Title 4 to juvenile proceedings. Furthermore, we find no implied incorporation of the criminal rules into the juvenile rules. Juvenile proceedings are governed by a separate, pervasive scheme of specific statutes and rules developed by the Maryland General Assembly and the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The holding of <em>In re Victor B., supra, </em>is dispositive of the issue. Title 4 of the Maryland Rules is inapplicable in juvenile proceedings. Consequently, a defendant in a juvenile proceeding is not required to make a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 4-324(a) in order to preserve his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence. To the extent that parts of any Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinions are to the contrary, they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We now turn to the intertwined issues of the requisite <em>mens rea </em>under the trespassing statute and the sufficiency of the evidence showing that Antoine M. committed the delinquent act of a \u201cwanton\u201d trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u201cA mere trespass to real property is not a crime at common law unless it amounts to a breach of the peace. Thus criminal trespass is for the most part a statutory creation.\u201d <em>In re Appeal No. 631, </em>282 Md. 223, 226, 383 A.2d 684, 685 (1978), and cases there cited. <em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>356 Md. 498, 506, 740 A.2d 615, 619 (1999). The Maryland statutory scheme with respect to criminal trespass is currently found in Title 6, Subtitle 4, of the Criminal Law Article, formerly Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 576-580. Those sections create criminal liability for trespassing upon both public and private property under certain conditions. In this case, we are concerned only with former Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 576(d) and 577(a)(2)\u00ae and (iii), which prohibited the \u201cwanton\u201d entry onto private property by a person who had been notified by the owner not to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, subsection (a)(2)(iii) expressly stated that the statute \u201cmay not be construed to apply to the entry on ... any land when the entry ... is done under a bona fide claim of right....\u201d The current statute, \u00a7 6-403 of the Criminal Law Article, which the Revisor noted was without substantive change, specifically exempts entry \u201cunder a good faith claim of right____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The definition section of the trespassing subtitle, previously Art. 27, \u00a7 576(d), and now \u00a7 6-401 (d) of the Criminal Law Article, states that \u201c 'wanton\u2019 retains its judicially determined meaning.\u201d We have said, particularly in reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>criminal trespass statute, that \u201c \u2018wanton\u2019 conduct\u201d is \u201cconduct \u2018characterized by extreme recklessness and utter disregard for the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland State Department of Personnel v. Sealing, </em>298 Md. 524, 536, 471 A.2d 693, 699 (1984), quoting <em>Dennis v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>189 Md. 610, 617, 56 A.2d 813, 817 (1948), and <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner, </em>179 Md. 598, 602, 20 A.2d 485, 488 (1941). Moreover, the term \u201cbona fide\u201d has been defined as \u201c[i]n good faith; honestly, openly, and sincerely; without deceit or fraud.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 91, 660 A.2d 447, 457 (1995), quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>177 (6th Ed.1990). <em>See In re Jason Allen D., supra, </em>127 Md.App. at 476, 733 A.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">This Court in <em>Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 498-501, 554 A.2d 1238, 1250-1252 (1989), examined at length the <em>mens rea </em>required for criminal trespass. <em>Warfield, inter alia, </em>presented the issue of whether a man hired to shovel snow from the walkways of a private residence was guilty of criminal trespass to private property when he entered the garage of the home, which he did not have permission to enter. The defendant argued that his belief, at the time of the alleged trespass, that the owner of the home would have given him permission to enter the garage in order to open the garage door to remove snow piled in front of it, eliminated the intent necessary to convict him of criminal trespass. This Court, in an opinion by Judge Orth, agreed, deciding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for criminal trespass. The Court held that the fact that the woman who hired the defendant would not have allowed him to enter the garage was not controlling in determining whether the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable at the time he entered the garage. With regard to the <em>mens rea </em>required, this Court stated (315 Md. at 498-499, 500, 554 A.2d at 1250-1251, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cThe common requirement of criminal trespass offenses is that the actor be aware of the fact that he is making an unwarranted intrusion. The Model Penal Code reflects this by making an intrusion culpable when a person knows he is not licensed or privileged to enter.... The knowledge requirement is designed primarily <em>to exclude from criminal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>liability </em>both the inadvertent trespasser and <em>the trespasser who believes that he has received an express or implied permission to enter or remain.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">\u201c[T]he legislature [in enacting the criminal trespass statutes] intended that the intrusion, to be culpable, be with an awareness that it was unwarranted \u2014 lacking authority, license, privilege, invitation, or legality. To make culpable the inadvertent trespasser and the <em>trespasser who entertains a reasonable belief that his conduct was proper </em>would be unreasonable, illogical, inconsistent with common sense, and contrary to the interests of justice. Such results, we have stated, are to be avoided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Court continued (315 Md. at 501, 554 A.2d at 1252):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cThe guilt of a person must depend on the circumstances as they appear to a reasonable man.... \u2018[A]n honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances which, if true, would have made the act done innocent, is a good defense.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">A case very much on point is <em>In re Jason Allen D., supra, </em>127 Md.App. 456, 733 A.2d 351. In that case, the juvenile defendant, Jason Allen D., was arrested when he was found on a housing authority\u2019s property after having been notified that he was not allowed on the property. He was subsequently charged in the Circuit Court for Frederick County with the delinquent act of committing a criminal trespass under Art. 27, \u00a7 577, and with resisting arrest. At trial, Jason claimed that he was invited onto the property by his cousin Morris, a minor who lived with his mother, as tenants, on the housing authority\u2019s property known as the Sanger property. That claim was substantiated by the testimony of Jason\u2019s cousin at trial. Despite this testimony, Jason was adjudicated delinquent for committing a criminal trespass and for resisting arrest. On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Jason argued that the trial court had insufficient evidence to adjudicate him delinquent for several reasons. Among them, Jason contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>that he had a bona fide right to be on the property because he was a \u201cguest\u201d or \u201cinvitee\u201d of his cousin, a resident of the property. Jason further argued that the State failed to prove that his presence was \u201cwanton\u201d as required under Art. 27, \u00a7 577. The State, in response, made a \u201cproperty law\u201d type of argument similar to the finding of the trial judge in the case at bar. \u201c[T]he State argued that Morris\u2019s invitation was ineffective to confer bona fide status upon Jason, either because Morris was a minor, or because a tenant\u2019s right to invite a social guest is superseded by the Housing Authority\u2019s right to exclude non-residents.\u201d <em>In re Jason Allen D., supra, </em>127 Md.App. at 480, 733 A.2d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The Court of Special Appeals in the <em>Jason </em>case, however, rejected the State\u2019s argument, saying (127 Md.App. at 486, 733 A.2d at 366-367):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cIn our view, the State has confused an actual or enforceable legal right with a bona fide claim of right. To be sure, the term \u2018bona fide\u2019 is not coextensive with an established legal right. On the continuum, a bona fide claim of right does not necessarily measure up to a valid claim of right. Thus, whether Jason\u2019s cousin, a Sanger resident, could lawfully invite Jason to enter the Sanger property is beside the point, because Jason only needed a bona fide claim of right to enter the Sanger property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cFurther, even if a minor\u2019s right to invite guests to the housing complex does not match the lessee\u2019s right, there was no evidence offered by the State to show that appellant knew or should have known that his cousin had neither authority, permission, nor the right to invite him to Sanger. Indeed, absent a sophisticated understanding by Jason of landlord-tenant rights or property rights, or knowledge that Morris had been prohibited by a parent or guardian or the lease itself from inviting Jason to visit him at Sanger, we do not see how Jason could have known that his cousin was unable to invite him lawfully to [the] Sanger property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals, after reviewing this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Warfield v.

Some of Mrs. Keene\u2019s and some of Mr. Keene\u2019s testimony may have supported a finding of the requisite <em>mens rea. </em>On the other hand, Mrs. Keene\u2019s testimony concerning the number of times Antoine M. had been on the property, Mr. Keene\u2019s testimony that Antoine M. was made \u201cwelcome,\u201d and Antoine M.\u2019s testimony that he was invited on the property by the Keenes\u2019 daughter, that he was on the property on several occasions, that Mrs. Keene herself invited him into the home on some occasions, that Mrs. Keene had him wait for her daughter on the front porch at other times, and that Mrs. Keene gave him dinner, would have supported a finding that Antoine M. lacked the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for a criminal trespass.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The problem in the case is that the trial court made no finding regarding Antoine M.\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>other than the statement that when Antoine M. received the notice, he \u201cknew what the deal was.... \u201d Instead of making a factual finding concerning Antoine M.\u2019s state of mind on August 26, 2002, based on all of the testimony, the trial court simply drew the \u201clegal\u201d conclusion that the Keenes\u2019 daughter did not have \u201cthe authority\u201d to give Antoine M. permission to be on the property and that the prior written notice \u201ccannot be countermanded by a teenage daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">While the teenage daughter may not, as a matter of property law, have been able to \u201ccountermand\u201d the notice, that is not the appropriate standard for determining whether the trespass was \u201cwanton\u201d and whether the defendant had a \u201cbona fide claim\u201d that he was allowed on the Keenes\u2019 property, within the meaning of the \u201cwanton trespass\u201d statute, former Art. 27, \u00a7 577.

Judge Wilner's dissenting opinion argues that the issue of the correct <em>mens rea </em>under the trespassing statute was not presented by the case or the certiorari petition. We shall address this contention, as well as other arguments made by the dissent, in footnote 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. With regard to the notice requirement of Art. 27, \u00a7 577, <em>see </em>the discussion in <em>Johnson v.

The dissenting opinion indicates that the only evidence supporting a reasonable and good faith belief on the part of Antoine M. that he was allowed on the Keenes' property after the June 2002 letter was his testimony that the Keenes\u2019 daughter invited him. The dissent totally ignores all of the other evidence supporting such a belief, such as Mrs. Keene's testimony concerning the number of occasions Antoine M. was on the property, Mr. Keene\u2019s testimony that Antoine M. was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u2018'welcome,\u201d and Antoine M.'s testimony as to how he was received by Mrs. Keene when he would ask to see her daughter, the fact that Mrs. Keene invited him to dinner, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The dissent also sets forth \"evidence\u201d from the pre-adjudication detention hearing and the post-adjudication disposition hearing. Such \"evidence,\u201d however, cannot properly support what the trial judge determined at the adjudication hearing. If it were pertinent, the Department of Juvenile Justice\u2019s representative at the pre-adjudication hearing testified that the Keenes\u2019 daughter would invite Antoine M. into the house and \"I don't think that she [Mrs. Keene] is always vehemently against his being there....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. Judge Wilner's dissent asserts that the proper legal standard was not an issue presented by the certiorari petition. The dissent contends that only two issues were presented by the certiorari petition, namely whether Rule 4-324(a) is applicable to juvenile delinquency proceedings and whether the evidence was sufficient to show that Antoine M. committed a trespass in violation of former Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 576(d) and 577. Judge Wilner denies that the case and the certiorari petition present any issue regarding the required <em>mens rea </em>under the criminal trespass statute. Somewhat inconsistently, the dissent seems to recognize that the petitioner\u2019s testimony, that the Keenes\u2019 daughter invited him on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>property after the June 2002 letter, may have been a basis for a \"good faith belief that petitioner had a right to be on the property\u201d (dissenting slip opinion at p. 8). As previously noted, the dissent erroneously states that this was the only evidence supporting a good faith belief by the petitioner. The dissent then rejects petitioner's testimony concerning the daughter\u2019s invitation by contending that the trial judge did not find as a fact that the daughter extended such an invitation and that there was evidence from Mrs. Keene indicating that no such invitation was extended. Judge Wilner's dissent relies on the principle that an appellate court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The petition for a writ of certiorari clearly presented the intertwined questions of the sufficiency of the evidence and whether the trial court applied the proper <em>mens rea </em>standard under the wanton trespass statute. The petitioner's second question presented was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIL\">\"2. Did the trial court misapply the law of trespass to the facts before it when it held that a fifteen year old's invitation to Petitioner to visit her at her home could not confer upon Petitioner a bona fide claim of right to enter that home, where Petitioner had previously received a no-trespassing notice issued by the fifteen year old\u2019s mother?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The third question presented specifically relied on the evidence that the Keenes\u2019 daughter invited petitioner to come upon the property and the evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\"that the property owners tolerated Petitioner's presence on the property on multiple occasions for almost two months after issuing a no-trespassing notice to Petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The body of the certiorari petition, after dealing with the applicability of Rule 4-3 24(a), was primarily devoted to the contention that the trial court misapplied the trespass statute, that the statute \"prohibits only \u2018wanton entry\u2019 and does not apply to an entry 'under a bona fide claim of right\u2019 \" (certiorari petition at 8), and that the trial court's refusal to recognize \"a bona fide claim of right to be on the property\u201d was \"in conflict with\u201d the case of <em>In re Jason Allen D., supra, </em>127 Md.App. 456, 733 A.2d 351 <em>(id. </em>at 8-9). The certiorari petition, as well as the briefs on both sides, clearly presented the issue of the proper <em>mens rea </em>under the wanton trespass statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">While the principle invoked by the dissent, that an appellate court should view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party, applies to the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence, the principle has no application where the trial court's judgment is based on an erroneous legal standard, where there is conflicting evidence under the correct legal standard, and where the trial court fails to make an evidentiary finding under the correct legal standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b541-6\">WILNER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">With respect, I dissent.

The Juvenile Petition alleged that petitioner \u201cunlawfully did enter, remain upon and cross over\u201d the Keenes\u2019 property. (Emphasis added). Section 577(a)(2)(h) made it a misdemean- or for a person to \u201cremain on, enter on, or cross over the land, premises, or private property ... of another, after having been duly notified by the owner or the owner\u2019s agent not to do so.\u201d Section 577(a)(2)(iii) stated that \u201c[i]t is intended that this paragraph is only to prohibit any wanton entry and may not be construed to apply to the entry on or crossing over any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>land when the entry or crossing is done under a bona fide claim of right or ownership.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The evidence before the Juvenile Court, taken at the adjudicatory hearing on October 16, 2002, was that petitioner, then 16 years old, was a persistent trespasser on the Keene property, apparently for the purpose of visiting the Keenes\u2019 15-year-old daughter. Mr. and Mrs. Keene initially had no objection to the visits but protested when petitioner refused to leave the home, even at night time. Mr. Keene testified that on several occasions, he offered to drive petitioner home, but that petitioner would remain \u201caround the periphery of the property all night, looking for an opportunity to come in.\u201d At one point, Mr. Keene threatened him with a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">At the suggestion of the police, Mrs. Keene, in June, 2002, wrote and delivered to petitioner a \u201cno trespassing\u201d note, informing him that he was not welcome on their property and that, if he continued to trespass, she would file charges against him. Petitioner acknowledged receiving that letter and ignoring it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Keene testified that, even after delivery of the letter, petitioner continued to come on the property and into their house. Petitioner alleged that he was dating the Keenes\u2019 daughter and that she invited him to the home. Without objection, Mrs. Keene testified to the contrary \u2014 that after the letter was delivered to petitioner, her daughter did not invite him: \u201cNot since he\u2019s been served, she never invited him, no.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The daughter was not called to testify and gave no evidence in the case. The instant charges were filed as a result of Mrs. Keene coming home on August 26 and finding petitioner not just on her property but inside her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Petitioner testified, but had, or professed to have, little recollection of many of the relevant facts. He acknowledged receipt of Mrs. Keene\u2019s \u201cno trespassing\u201d letter but could not remember when he received it. He acknowledged being on the property \u201ca couple of times\u201d thereafter and said that Mrs. Keene actually let him in, but he could not remember when he was there. He was \u201cnot sure\u201d whether he was there on August 26 but that \u201ceither the 26th or around the 26th\u201d he was allowed by Mr. Keene to sit on the porch. In addition to being \u201cnot sure\u201d if he was even on the property on August 26, he was also \u201cnot sure,\u201d if he <em>was </em>there, whether Mrs. Keene invited him into the house. Both Mr. and Mrs. Keene testified that petitioner was not invited on to the property after the \u201cno trespassing\u201d notice was delivered to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence taken at the adjudicatory hearing, defense counsel argued that \u201cthe uncontroverted testimony\u201d was that, even after the no-trespassing notice was served on petitioner, \u201che was invited by the daughter on at least one, or a number of occasions, to come into the home\u201d and that, as a result, \u201ca reasonable person would believe that the previously given notice to ... not come on the property was no longer in effect.\u201d The court immediately and correctly disputed that there was any such \u201cuncontroverted\u201d testimony. After listening to argument, the court found that petitioner had received the no trespassing notice and that \u201con August 26, 2002, [petitioner] was there, <em>not as an invited guest, </em>but simply because he showed up.\u201d The court added that <em>\u201c[p]erhaps </em>he was given permission by the daughter,\u201d but, even if so, the daughter had no authority to grant such permission after her parents \u2014 the owners of the property \u2014 gave the no trespassing notice. The court\u2019s ultimate conclusion was \u201cI do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>not find that after delivery of the letter that he was there as an invited guest....\u201d The court accordingly found that petitioner committed the act of trespass and, pending disposition, allowed him to return to his mother\u2019s home on \u201ccommunity detention,\u201d subject to a curfew and other restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Evidence taken at a pre-adjudication detention hearing in September, 2002, and at the post-adjudication disposition hearing in November indicated that the 16-year-old petitioner was largely out of control. His father was incarcerated in Florida, and he was in the custody of his mother, who testified that she was unable to control his behavior and that he often did not come home at night. She said that \u201c[h]e\u2019s belligerent with us\u201d and that \u201c[h]e\u2019s gone for days and weeks at a time, and then when he returns home, there\u2019s no explanation whatsoever, and he feels as though we shouldn\u2019t ask him where\u2019s he\u2019s been.\u201d At the detention hearing in September, the court was informed that petitioner, who had previously been placed on community detention, had not appeared at any of the scheduled conferences and that his mother did not know where he was. At the disposition hearing, the court was informed of some inappropriate behavior on petitioner\u2019s part while he was on the current community detention. The court accepted the recommendation of the Department of Juvenile Services that petitioner be placed in foster care, subject to certain restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Petitioner appealed, arguing to the Court of Special Appeals that the Juvenile Court \u201cmisapplied the law to the facts in its ruling\u201d and that the evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that he committed a trespass. The first argument centered on the trial court\u2019s statement that the daughter did not have the authority to countermand her parents\u2019 no trespassing order. He posited that \u201c[t]he fact that the Keenes\u2019 daughter was a minor does not mean that her invitation to Appellant could not confer upon him a bona fide claim of right to be present at her parent\u2019s house.\u201d That argument necessarily assumed that the daughter had, indeed, invited petitioner on to the property following the no-trespass letter and merely attacked the trial court\u2019s supposed finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>such an invitation was insufficient to confer on him a bona fide claim of right to enter the property. The second argument was that, because \u201cthe evidence demonstrated that appellant had a bona fide claim of right to be on the property,\u201d he lacked the requisite <em>mens rea </em>to commit a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">With respect to the sufficiency argument, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that, because petitioner failed to renew a motion for \u201cacquittal\u201d at the end of the case, as purportedly required by Maryland Rule 4-324(a), he failed to preserve that argument. The court did address the other argument, however, which it stated was \u201csimilar to the first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Court of Special Appeals took issue with petitioner\u2019s view of the trial court\u2019s ruling, which hinged on the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[pjerhaps he was given permission by the daughter\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t think she has the authority when the legal owners have notified a person that their property, their private property is off limits, that that cannot be countermanded by a teenage daughter.\u201d Given the fact that Mrs. Keene expressly denied that her daughter had given any permission to petitioner to be on the property after the no-trespass letter was delivered to him in June, the appellate court found that the trial court \u201cwas merely speculating when it stated that \u2018[p]erhaps [appellant] was given permission by the daughter.\u2019 \u201d The court continued that, even if the trial court believed that the daughter had invited petitioner on to the property after the June letter, <em>\u201cwhich is not the case\u201d </em>(emphasis added), petitioner \u201ccould not have reasonably or honestly believed that he was welcome on the Keene property or in their house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In his petition for <em>certiorari, </em>petitioner presented three questions. The first was whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in applying Rule 4-324 to a juvenile delinquency proceeding and thus finding that petitioner failed to preserve his sufficiency of the evidence complaint. The second and third points were essentially the arguments made to the Court of Special Appeals, arguments which erroneously assumed that the trial judge had found that the daughter did invite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>petitioner on to the property but then concluded that such permission was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Two issues are presented on this record \u2014 whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in applying Rule 4-324 to a juvenile delinquency proceeding, and, if so, whether the evidence was nonetheless sufficient to sustain the court\u2019s finding of a trespass. In a discussion that consumes two pages and merits no more, this Court correctly holds that Rule 4-324 does not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings. The rule applies only to criminal cases tried before a jury. The Court of Special Appeals was simply wrong in holding otherwise. As to sufficiency, this Court also concludes that \u201cif the trial judge had found that [petitioner] was \u2018aware of the fact that he [was] making an unwarranted intrusion,\u201d\u2019 that finding \u201cmay well have been supported by the evidence.\u201d That, of course, is precisely what the trial court <em>did </em>find and that finding not only \u201cmay well have been\u201d supported by the evidence but clearly <em>was </em>supported by the evidence. That should be the end of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Instead, the Court has swallowed the petitioner\u2019s bait and assumed that the trial court actually gave some credence to petitioner\u2019s claim that the daughter had continued to invite him on to the property following the June no trespass letter when, in fact, the record shows the exact opposite. Not only was there no testimony from the daughter in support of that claim, upon which petitioner\u2019s entire defense hinged, but it was expressly denied by Mrs. Keene. The Court seems to overlook the fact that, at the appellate level, we must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party \u2014 the State in this case \u2014 and that, under Md. Rule 8-131(c), where, as here, the case was tried by the court, without a jury, we must give due regard to the opportunity of the trial judge to judge the credibility of the witnesses and not set aside the judgment on the evidence unless clearly erroneous. Judge Greene, for the Court of Special Appeals, was absolutely correct in regarding the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cperhaps\u201d the daughter extended an invitation as mere speculation \u2014 an \u201ceven if\u201d statement \u2014 which, upon a fair reading of the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>is all that it was. <em>It certainly was not a fact found by the trial court. </em>Nowhere in this record does the Juvenile Court articulate or even imply a belief that the daughter (or anyone else) invited petitioner on to the property after the June notice was delivered. Absent a finding that the daughter or Mr. or Mrs. Keene actually extended such an invitation, there was no basis whatever for any reasonable or good faith belief that petitioner had a right to be on the property, and petitioner\u2019s argument falls like a house of cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The Court\u2019s reaching out to decide an issue that is not presented is bad enough. The effect of that overreach is equally problematic. The trespass occurred in August, 2002. The adjudicatory hearing was held in October, 2002, and the finding of delinquency was made in November of that year. This case was argued before us in May, 2004. The Court now directs that the Juvenile Court\u2019s judgment be vacated and that the case be remanded \u201cfor a new juvenile delinquency proceeding at which the court shall decide the case under the standard set forth in <em>Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 554 A.2d 1238 (1989) and its progeny,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>whether petitioner entertained a reasonable belief that his conduct was proper. That necessarily takes the case back to the adjudicatory stage. Apart from the fact that, as I read the trial court\u2019s statement, that <em>was </em>the standard it applied at the adjudicatory hearing, we will now have, because of the appellate delay, not a 16-year old but a nearly 21-year old petitioner returning to the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The record shows that petitioner was born on February 8, 1986. By the time this case returns and is likely to be set in for the mandated adjudicatory hearing, he will be close to, or maybe over, 21. The Juvenile Court will lose jurisdiction over petitioner when he turns 21 <em>(see </em>Maryland Code, \u00a7 3-8A-07(a) of the Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. Article), but even if it can act before then, if it confirms its finding that petitioner committed a delinquent act, what is it to do? A finding of delinquency requires proof not only that petitioner committed a delinquent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>act but also that he \u201crequires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 3-8A-01(Z). If the current judgment is vacated, as the Court directs, presumably a new judgment will have to be entered, and that will require a new determination of whether petitioner requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation. Is that determination to be made in light of the circumstances existing at the time of the new disposition hearing, or is the court simply to merge into a new finding of delinquent act the long outdated dispositional findings it made in November, 2002? It will have to do one or the other; it can\u2019t leave the matter in limbo, for there will then be no judgment Ordinarily, I expect, if a case is remanded for a new adjudicatory hearing and a new finding of delinquent act is made, the court would need to examine the child\u2019s status as of then, so as not to run the risk of imposing restrictions that once may have been appropriate but are no longer justified or <em>vice versa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Given that petitioner will be nearly 21 or over that age when the case is reheard, there will be little available for him in the juvenile justice system. As the court\u2019s entire judgment will be vacated, and thus a nullity, could the court, applying the factors set forth in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article \u00a7 3-8A-06(e), decide, based on current circumstances, to waive its jurisdiction and send the case to criminal court?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">These questions may arise not from any argument currently made by the parties but only from the Court\u2019s insistence, four years after the event and the judgment and nearly two-and-a-half years after the case was argued before us, on reaching out to address an issue that is not presented. We should either affirm the judgment below or dismiss the <em>certiorari </em>as improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Judge CATHELL has authorized me to state that he joins in this Dissent and Judge HARRELL has authorized me to state that he joins in Part I of this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">. Given the wording of that sub-paragraph (iii), it would appear that the caveat or limitation did not apply to a person <em>remaining </em>on the property in violation of subsection (a)(2)(ii), but only to those who enter or cross over it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">. The Court characterizes this clear, definitive, unambiguous statement as being \"to the best of her knowledge, her daughter had not invited [petitioner] into the home on August 26, 2002.\u201d That is not a fair or accurate statement of what Mrs. Keene actually said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. The Court places some weight on Mr. Keene's testimony that petitioner was made \"welcome\u201d on the property after the no trespass notice was delivered, ignoring entirely the facts that (1) Keene explained that petitioner was not welcome or invited to be on the property and that by using the word \"welcome,\u201d he simply meant that he did not use violence to eject the uninvited petitioner, and (2) more important, the Court <em>found as a fact </em>that petitioner was uninvited and had not been welcome onto the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
