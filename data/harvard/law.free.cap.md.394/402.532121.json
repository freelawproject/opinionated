On May 7, 2004, Karl H., Sr. (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) and his wife, Lisa H., the parents of Karl H. Jr. and Anthony H., consented to a finding that their sons were CINA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 10, 2004, the Circuit Court for Charles County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>approved concurrent permanency plans for adoption by a non-relative or reunification with Karl H., Sr. and Lisa H.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In January 2005, each parent separately filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on the grounds that the juvenile court abused it discretion, under the circumstances, in adopting the plans of reunification concurrent with adoption. The Court of Special Appeals held that the orders establishing concurrent permanency plans of reunification and adoption were neither final judgments nor appealable interlocutory orders and dismissed the appeal. <em>In re Karl H. and Anthony H., </em>163 Md.App. 536, 540-41, 881 A.2d 1174, 1177 (2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, which we granted. <em>In re Karl H., </em>390 Md. 90, 887 A.2d 655 (2005).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The issue we must decide is whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that a concurrent permanency plan that includes adoption is not an appealable interlocutory order. We vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We adopt the facts as summarized by the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">Karl Jr., [born in 1998], and his brother, Anthony, [born in 1999], are the children of [Petitioner] and [his wife,] Lisa H. The [Petitioner and his] family came to the attention of the Charles County Department of Social Services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(\u201cCCDSS\u201d) on March 5, 2004, when the boys were five and three, respectively, because the [family] ... w[as] homeless and living [in] ... their vehicle. The CCDSS caseworker assigned to the family[,] enabled them to use the agency\u2019s shower and laundry at that time. After the family moved into [a] ... [m]otel, CCDSS paid their back rent and provided vouchers for an additional week\u2019s rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">On March 25, 2004, a family friend reported to CCDSS that Mrs. H. had dropped the boys off at her home the preceding day, but had failed to return for them. That day, the family\u2019s caseworker spoke with Mrs. H., who explained that she had separated from [Petitioner], and had obtained a protective order against him, which prohibited contact between him and either herself or the boys. Mrs. H. stated that she could not care for the boys at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">[Petitioner] met with the caseworker the next day and confirmed the existence of the protective order. He also informed the caseworker that in the past he had been convicted of ... domestic violence against Ms. H [and previously served time in prison on a murder conviction]. [Petitioner] admitted to a history of substance abuse and [stated] ... that he had relapsed, having used crack cocaine the previous evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">The boys were ... placed in emergency shelter care, and the Circuit Court for Charles County, sitting as a juvenile court, continued shelter care on March 29, 2004.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] The juvenile court ordered [Petitioner] and Mrs. H. to participate in psychological and substance abuse evaluations, and to follow up with any treatment recommendations. [Petitioner] subsequently made an appointment to register for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>substance abuse treatment, but he did not arrive at the appointed time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">Adjudicatory and disposition hearings were held on May 7, 2004, during which [Petitioner] and Mrs. H. consented to a finding that the boys were CI\u00d1A. The juvenile court again ordered both parents to participate in substance abuse and mental health evaluations, including an assessment of both parents\u2019 mental capacity to care for their children, and to follow up with any treatment recommendations. In addition, the juvenile court ordered that [Petitioner] and Mrs. H. submit weekly to urinalys[i]s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">Over the next six months, [Petitioner] and Mrs. H. failed to make significant progress toward addressing their substance abuse and mental health issues. In November 2004, however, [Petitioner] and Mrs. H. enrolled in an eighteen-month Crisis Watch and Counseling program at the New Life Advocacy Council, which provided substance abuse counseling and parenting skills training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">[Both parents also had scheduled weekly supervised visits with the children, in which Petitioner visited the children regularly. Mrs. H\u2019s visits, however, were sporadic.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">On December 10, 2004, the juvenile court conducted an initial permanency planning hearing for both boys. At the time of the hearing, the boys remained in the foster home in which they had been placed in March, and appeared to have adjusted well, having made friends in the community and at school. The juvenile court concluded that [Petitioner] and Mrs. H. were not yet able to care for their children at that time, as they still had \u201cserious issues of their own\u201d that had yet to be addressed. Accordingly, the juvenile court ordered a concurrent plan of reunification and adoption for the boys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\"><em>In re Karl H., </em>163 Md.App. at 539-40, 881 A.2d at 1175-76 (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">At the December 10, 2004, permanency plan hearing the trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>I find that continued placement is certainly necessary and appropriate. I do find that the parents at this time are not able to care for the children. They have serious issues of their own that they must address.... I hope that they ... can get their lives straight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\"># <em>^</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">I don\u2019t believe ... the children can wait, I\u2019m going to order the plan be adoption but it\u2019s also going to be concurrent with reunification because I want the parents to be afforded all the services for reunification. I want that, basically we\u2019re going to ... it\u2019s going to be a race, to both concurrent plan, [sic] And I want the parents to work toward reunification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">* * * * H* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">[W]e will schedule this matter for review on June the 17th of 2005 or earlier if another issue needs to be addressed sooner. And unless the petition for guardianship is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Two identical permanency plans were adopted as a result of the December 10, 2004 hearing, one pertained to Karl Jr. and the other to Anthony. In the plans, the court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ano\">[t]he Respondent\u2019s permanency plan is Reunification with his parents[,] concurrent with [a]doption, because the following compelling reasons exist making return home not in the Respondent\u2019s best interests: Mr. and Mrs. H have not completed the court ordered recommendations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">$ :{c $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">ORDERED, that the permanency plan is a concurrent plan of [a]doption and Reunification with his parents; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">Hi Hs * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">ORDERED, that a petition for termination of parental rights be filed within 30 days;[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ORDERED, that this matter shall be set for a permanency plan review hearing on June 17, 2005, at 9:30 a.m.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">At the permanency plan hearing the court ordered the CCDSS to file a termination of parental rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) petition within 30 days after the hearing. The department did not file the petition until April 5, 2005, almost four months after the December 10, 2004, court hearing. <em>See Id. </em>at 544 n. 6, 881 A.2d at 1179 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In April 2006, in a joint motion, both Respondents requested that this Court dismiss Petitioner\u2019s appeal as moot. In March 2006, prior to oral argument in this Court in the present case, the Circuit Court terminated Petitioner\u2019s parental rights as a result of a judgment for guardianship with right to consent to adoption and/or long term care. Petitioner appealed the termination of parental rights. As of the filing of this opinion, an appeal of that order is pending in the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Respondents argue that there is no longer an existing controversy and it would not be appropriate to resolve the issue presented; therefore, the petition should be dismissed. Conversely, Petitioner contends that, even if moot, the issue would easily evade appellate review, would likely recur, and this Court has the discretion to review moot cases that involve questions of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">We have previously stated that, \u201c[gjenerally, appellate courts do not decide ... moot questions. A question is moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Gen. v. Anne Arundel County Sch. Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749, 752 (1979)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">This Court was confronted with a similar issue in another child in need of assistance (\u201cCI\u00d1A\u201d) case, <em>In re Justin D., </em>357 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Md. 431, 444-45, 745 A.2d 408, 415-16 (2000). That case involved the validity of orders that appeared to give the Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) unfettered discretion to determine the child\u2019s visitation schedule. We recognized, in that case, that \u201c[w]ith periodic six-month reviews, orders of this kind that are appealed ... [could] be replaced by subsequent orders before this Court w[ould] have the opportunity to review them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 745 A.2d at 415. Although we rarely review moot issues of law, under circumstances such as this, where an issue may perpetually evade review, we are inclined to review moot questions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">\u201c \u2018[I]f the public interest clearly will be hurt if the question is not immediately decided, if the matter involved is likely to recur frequently, and its recurrence will involve a relationship between government and its citizens, or a duty of government, and upon any recurrence, the same difficulty which prevented the appeal at hand from being heard in time is likely again to prevent a decision, then the Court may find justification for deciding the issues raised by a question which has become moot, particularly if all these factors concur with sufficient weight.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 444-45, 745 A.2d at 416 (quoting <em>Lloyd v. Bd. of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore County, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379, 382 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In the present case, because the order would subsequently be replaced by another order and evade review and the appeal of the termination of parental rights is pending in the Court of Special Appeals, we will review the issue raised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The question of whether a concurrent permanency plan order which provides for both adoption and reunification is an appealable interlocutory order is an issue of law, which we will review <em>de novo. See Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 391-92, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002) (\u201c[Wjhere the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, [we] must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>view.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Register of Wills for Baltimore County v. Arrowsmith, </em>365 Md. 237, 249, 778 A.2d 364, 371 (2001) (\u201c[A]s is consistent with our review for all questions of law, we review the order and judgment <em>de novo\u201d) </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that Petitioner would not be detrimentally affected by the trial judge\u2019s concurrent permanency plan orders because reunification efforts were not terminated. Petitioner asserts that even if reunification efforts were continued during the pendency of the proceedings, the order required the filing of a termination of parental rights petition within thirty days (sixty days if the local department does not support the plan of adoption), which could lead to Petitioner\u2019s loss of custody. Petitioner contends that the concurrent plan of reunification and adoption was detrimental to him, depriving him of the expectation or hope of reunification; therefore, adoption of the plan was an appealable interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Further, Petitioner maintains that although the Court of Special Appeals based its holding on <em>In re Billy W., </em>386 Md. 675, 874 A.2d 423 (2005), that case is distinguishable from Petitioner\u2019s case. According to Petitioner, in the <em>In re Billy W., </em>case, <em>infra, </em>the mother appealed because the trial court \u201cfail[ed] to revise the permanency plan and return the child to her custodyt;]\u201d however, in Petitioner\u2019s case, he argues, that the terms of the permanency plan did not benefit him, quite the opposite, the terms were detrimental to him and deprived him of his rights to raise his own children.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Respondent, CCDSS, contends that the permanency plan did not adversely affect the Petitioner\u2019s custody rights. CCDSS asserts that a concurrent plan provides hope to a parent that he or she may regain custody, whereas, any expectation of reunification is extinguished with a reunification plan that is amended to a singular plan of adoption. Addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ally, CCDSS argues that since the initial plan (established by the court at the time of the permanency plan hearing) was a concurrent plan, the permanency plan order could not then effect any \u201cchange\u201d in the permanency plan as required by <em>In re, Damon M., supra. </em>Additionally, Respondents assert that the circuit court can rescind the permanency plan at any time before the TPR petition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Respondent, Legal Aid Bureau, Inc., attorney for the children, argues that the trial court in its concurrent plan set forth a periodic review hearing approximately six months from the date of the permanency plan hearing. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s argument that any expectation of regaining custody of his sons was illusory. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-823(h) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Respondent contends that CCDSS is permitted to make efforts toward concurrent goals and concurrent planning achieves the statutory objectives. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1999, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-525(d)(l)-(3) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held that a concurrent permanency plan of reunification and adoption ordered at the time of the permanency plan hearing, was not an appealable interlocutory order, because it did not \u201coperate to either deprive [a parent or parents] of the care and custody of [their] children or change the terms of ... care and custody of the children to [the parent\u2019s or parents\u2019s] detriment.\u201d <em>In re Karl H., </em>163 Md.App. at 543, 881 A.2d at 1178 (quoting <em>In re Billy W., </em>386 Md. at 691-92, 874 A.2d at 423) (alterations added). The Court of Special Appeals reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">We are persuaded that this case is analogous to <em>In re Billy W., </em>because the orders adopting a concurrent permanency plan of reunification and adoption here did not detrimentally affect [Petitioner\u2019s] ... custody rights. Like the mother\u2019s rights in <em>In re Billy W., </em>[Petitioner\u2019s] ... custody rights were abrogated when Karl, Jr. and Anthony were adjudicated CI\u00d1A and committed to CCDSS\u2019s custody, but not when the juvenile court adopted the concurrent permanency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>plans.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">H\u00ab ^ Hi ^ H&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">After the court ordered concurrent plans of reunification and adoption, CCDSS was required to file guardianship petitions for both Karl, Jr. and Anthony, pursuant to CJP section 3 \u2014 823(g)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Practically, this \u201cdual-track\u201d planning makes sense. If future events and circumstances demonstrate that adoption, and not reunification, is in the best interests of Karl, Jr. and Anthony, the earlier steps taken by CCDSS should hasten the goal of achieving a positive and stable home for the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\"><em>In re Karl H., </em>163 Md.App. at 543-45, 881 A.2d at 1178-79 (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">A Parent\u2019s Fundamental Right</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Parents have a fundamental and constitutional right to raise their children. <em>See In re Samone H. &amp; Marchay E., </em>385 Md. 282, 299-301, 869 A.2d 370, 380-81 (2005) (and cases cited therein). We acknowledge that \u201cMaryland has ... echoed the Supreme Court, declaring a parent\u2019s liberty interest in raising a child a fundamental one that cannot be taken away unless clearly justified.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 567, 819 A.2d 1030, 1039 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The Court has recognized the fundamental rights which parents possess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that a parent has a constitutionally protected fundamental right to raise his or her children. Recently, ... we iterated this principle and stated that a parent\u2019s interest \u201coccupies a unique place in our legal culture, given the centrality of family life as the focus for personal meaning and responsibility. \u2018[Far] more precious ... than property rights,\u2019 parental rights have been deemed to be among those \u2018essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In <em>In re Mark M., </em>we explained that a parent\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of his or her children is not absolute. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akb\">That fundamental interest, however, is not absolute and does not exclude other important considerations. Pursuant to the doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>the State of Maryland has an interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves. We have held that \u201cthe best interests of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">We have recognized that in cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a CI\u00d1A case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more pro-active. <em>See In re Justin D., </em>[357 Md. 431, 448, 745 A.2d 408, 417 (2000)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">A trial court, acting under the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>authority, is in the unique position to marshal the applicable facts, assess the situation, and determine the correct means of fulfilling a child\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>[In re Mark </em>M., 365 Md. 687, 705-07, 782 A.2d 332, 343-44 (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 299-301, 869 A.2d at 380-81 (alterations in original) (alterations added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">We recently stated that \u201c \u2018the best interests of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Billy W., </em>386 Md. at 684, 874 A.2d at 429 (quoting <em>Boswell v.

A State\u2019s role in a child\u2019s care and protection should take on utmost importance, while a parent\u2019s right may not be absolute. A parent\u2019s rights may be diminished, \u201c[w]hen there is a conflict between the rights of the parents or legal guardian and those of the child, the child\u2019s best interest shall take precedence.\u201d COMAR 07.02.11.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Permanency Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">When a child declared a CINA is removed from his or her home and placed in the temporary custody of the State, several steps must be taken to guarantee the child and his or her parents their due process rights. Md.Code (1974, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-802 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. There must be an adjudicatory and disposition hearing to determine whether the child is a CINA. <em>See generally </em>Md.Code (1974, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-819 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. If declared CINA, then several family services are implemented such as housing, visitation, mental and physical assessments, parental courses, psychological therapy, drug rehabilitation, and educational services for the family. <em>Id. </em>Within eleven months, a permanency plan hearing must be held which sets a course towards securing a long-term goal for the CINA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">The implementation of a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">permanency plan is an integral part of the statutory scheme designed to expedite the movement of Maryland\u2019s children from foster care to a permanent living, and hopefully, family arrangement. It provides the goal toward which the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>and the court are committed to work. It sets the tone for the parties and the court and, indeed, may be outcome determinative. Services to be provided by the local social service department and commitments that must be made by the parents and children are determined by the permanency plan. And, because it may not be changed without the court first determining that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so, the permanency plan must be in the child\u2019s best interest.

The State\u2019s failure to adopt the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>would have resulted in the loss of federal funding. As anticipated, implementation of the Act resulted in fiscal incentives.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The purpose of the Act was to streamline the foster care placement process and provide permanent homes for children in foster care, by expediting permanency planning hearings and TPR proceedings. Patton, <em>supra </em>note 15, at 174. Further, the presumption of the Act is that if reunification efforts fail the preferred result is adoption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">When the Maryland Legislature adopted the federal Act there was no discussion of whether expediting the termination of a parent\u2019s rights would be in the best interest of a child. The main focus of the Act was to accelerate the placement of foster children in adoptive homes. The relative pros and cons of concurrent permanency planning were neither discussed nor analyzed before the Act was adopted by the Legislature. The passage of the bill amended several sections of the Family Law Article, including \u00a7 5 \u2014 525(b), which states that DSS shall establish a goal that facilitates reunification while concurrently generating and executing a concurrent permanency plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Commentators, Patton and Pellman, have criticized concurrent permanency planning on the grounds that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMTB\">is severally flawed for a number of reasons. First, one may question whether termination of parental rights was required in a significant number of cases because: (1) the expedited decision to terminate parental rights is often made in six months, and sometimes without the necessity of providing family rehabilitation and reunification; (2) necessary social services are often not readily available so while the termination clock ticks away, little reunification is possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ble; (3) ... [and] (4) [DSS workers and legal counsel for the families are overloaded with work]; (5) the ultimate fact-finder, juvenile dependency judges, have only a few minutes per case to determine the fate of families----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Patton, <em>supra, </em>at 192. Although concurrent permanency planning is authorized in Maryland, we note that the practice of having such concurrent plans that provide for reunification or family placement and adoption should be scrutinized carefully by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">It is important, however, to distinguish between contingency permanency planning and concurrent permanency plans. The former looks to reunification with parents or placement with family members while permitting the DSS to begin making contingency plans for adoption or other long-term care arrangements in the event the desired reunification or family placement proves not feasible or in the children\u2019s best interest. Indeed, in some cases, that may be the most prudent thing to do, so that if, when the permanency plan is next reviewed by the court, the court concludes that adoption or other long-term arrangement is appropriate, that goal can be achieved more expeditiously \u2014 some of the groundwork will already have been done. The statute clearly allows for such contingency planning. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5 \u2014 525(d)(1)\u2014(4), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The problem with concurrent permanency plans that are diametrically inconsistent is that they give DSS (and the parents) no real guidance and can lead to arbitrary decision-making on the part of DSS. If the court approves a permanency plan that calls for reunification or family placement, that should be the paramount goal. It should not share the spotlight with a completely inconsistent court-approved goal of terminating parental rights, especially when the inconsistent plan calls for a TPR petition to be filed before the next scheduled court review of the permanency plan. The objective of contingency planning can be achieved without a Janus-type order.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">When a permanency plan for adoption, whether with a concurrent goal of reunification or adoption alone, is ordered, the statute requires the filing of a TPR petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(g) In the case of a child for whom the court determines that the plan should be changed to adoption ... <em>the court shall:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">(1) Order the local department to file a petition for guardianship in accordance with Title 5, Subtitle 3 of the Family Law Article within 30 days or, if the local department does not support the plan, within 60 days; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">(2) <em>Schedule a TPR hearing instead of the next 6-month review hearing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Section 3-823(g) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">A natural parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s rights are terminated as a result of an adoption.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-312 and 5-313 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Family Law Article.

In 1997, the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS) assumed custody of Samone and Marchay, after two unsuccessful placements with a relative. <em>Id. </em>at 286-87, 869 A.2d at 372-73. In 1998, a permanency plan was established, which provided that both children were to live with relatives. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88, 869 A.2d at 373. In 1999, the court revised the permanency plan for placement with a relative or adoption. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 869 A.2d at 373-74. In 2000, after a periodic review, the judge modified the permanency plan with the goal toward adoption. <em>Id. </em>at 288-89, 869 A.2d at 374. In 2002, during an annual review hearing, a representative of the BCDSS testified that the children had developed a strong attachment with the foster family, although the visits with the natural mother were \u201cgoing pretty well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 869 A.2d 370. In 2003, the natural mother filed a motion for an independent clinical study to assess her relationship with the children and to determine whether removal of the children from foster care would be harmful.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 291, 869 A.2d at 375. The trial court denied the natural mother\u2019s motion and reaffirmed the permanency plan. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 869 A.2d at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The mother in <em>In re Samone </em>requested a study which the trial court denied; however, the permanency plan for adoption remained unaltered. The trial judge affirmed the previous plan, the original plan was not changed and the order did not result in a deprivation of the mother\u2019s fundamental right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>care and custody of her children. We held that the bonding study may have been beneficial in assisting the court in its ruling; however, the denial of the motion for a bonding study was not an appealable interlocutory order or final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 869 A.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>In re Billy W., supra, </em>we held that an order continuing a previously established permanency plan was not immediately appealable because the order did not detrimentally affect the parents\u2019 custody rights or visitation with the children. 386 Md. at 691-92, 874 A.2d at 433. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>In re Billy W. </em>to support its holding that the concurrent permanency plan order was not an appealable interlocutory order. That case, however, is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>In re Billy W., </em>four children were removed from their home and placed initially in emergency shelter care. <em>Id. </em>at 677, 874 A.2d at 424. Subsequently, the court conducted a hearing, as a result of a petition requesting judicial approval of the placement of the children in shelter care, and \u201cordered DSS custody of the children, and shelter care for them, pending an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Allegations of child sexual abuse and neglect were the genesis of the order for shelter care and the subsequent adjudicatory hearing. All four children had resided previously with Tammy B., their mother, and Tammy B.\u2019s husband, Michael B., also father of George B., the youngest of the four children. As a result of an adjudicatory hearing, \u201c[the] children were declared to be children in need of assistance (\u2018CI\u00d1A\u2019) and committed to the care and custody\u201d of the Baltimore County Department of Social Services (BCDSS). <em>Id. </em>at 677-78, 874 A.2d at 424-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">At the February 2002 adjudicatory hearing, the court established a permanency plan of reunification providing Tammy B. and Michael B. with unsupervised and supervised visitation with the children. The three older children were eventually placed in foster homes. <em>See id. </em>at 678-80, 874 at 425-26. In June 2003, the juvenile court changed the youngest child\u2019s (George B.) permanency plan from reunification to a concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>rent plan of reunification and adoption.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In addition, at the June permanency plan hearing, the trial court increased the amount of unsupervised visits for the mother with three of her four children. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 874 A.2d at 426. After the November 2003 permanency plan six-month review hearing, the mother and her husband separately appealed, raising the issue that hearsay evidence was inappropriately considered by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 874 A.2d 423. The subsequent review in this Court resulted from the six-month periodic permanency plan hearing in November 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 874 A.2d 423. The mother appealed the time allocated for supervised and unsupervised visits with her children as provided by the plan. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 874 A.2d at 427-28. There was no request for review in this Court of the June 2003 order amending the permanency plan from reunification to a concurrent plan of reunification and adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The issue that was before us in <em>In re Billy W. </em>is unlike the issue before us in the present case. Here the order establishing the concurrent permanency plan is the subject of the dispute before this Court. In <em>In re Billy W., </em>the order of June 2003, which amended the permanency plan from reunification to a concurrent plan of reunification and adoption, was similar to the concurrent plan in the present case, but was not the subject of appellate review in this Court. Moreover, changes to the visitation provisions of the permanency plan, in <em>In re Billy W., </em>emanated from the November 2003 order and were deemed by this Court not to constitute an appealable order because \u201ccourt orders arising from a periodic review hearing that maintain the permanency plan[ ] ... do not constitute final judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 874 A.2d at 431. The modifications made to the permanency plan in November 2003 involved maintenance of an existing plan. That plan was previously amended in June 2003, from a plan for reunification to a concurrent plan of reunification and adoption. Thus, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>orders continuing the permanency plan for the children in <em>In re Billy W., </em>after June 2003, \u201cdid not detrimentally affect Tammy B.\u2019s custody rights or visitation with the children, even though Tammy B. had sought full custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692, 874 A.2d at 433. Our holding in <em>In re Billy W., </em>was limited to whether the orders of November 2003 were immediately appealable interlocutory orders. We held that \u201cto be appealable, court orders arising from the permanency plan review hearing must operate to either deprive Tammy B. of the care and custody of her children or change the terms of her care and custody of the children to her detriment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691-92, 874 A.2d 423 (citing <em>In re Samone H., </em>385 Md. at 282, 869 A.2d at 380; <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In the present case, the intermediate appellate court, erred in its interpretation of <em>In re Billy W. </em>and our narrow holding in that case. The Court of Special Appeals also distinguished <em>In re Damon M., supra, </em>from the present case, on the ground that the trial court\u2019s orders terminated reunification efforts. The Court of Special Appeals opined that in <em>In re Damon M., </em>\u201cthe permanency plans were amended from reunification to either long-term foster care or adoption. The ... [trial] court[\u2019s] orders terminated reunification efforts, and thus, detrimentally affected the parent\u2019s custodial rights.\u201d <em>In re Karl H., </em>163 Md.App. at 545, 881 A.2d at 1179. Ultimately, the Court of Special Appeals held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">[ordering the necessary preliminary steps toward the possible outcome of terminating parental rights did not deprive [Petitioner] ... of the care and custody of [his] children such that the juvenile court orders were appealable interlocutory orders under CJP section 12-303(3)(x). Rather, the juvenile court\u2019s orders simply imposed additional work on CCDSS to lay the foundation for potential adoption proceedings, including filing the guardianship petitions, serving [Petitioner] ... with required notice of the guardianship proceedings ... and seeking to identify and approve a qualified family for adoption[. <em>S]ee </em>COMAR 07.01.12.04(C)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>In re Karl H, </em>163 Md.App. at 544-45, 881 A.2d at 1179 (alterations added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We reject the assertion that a concurrent plan of reunification and adoption is not an appealable interlocutory order and does not deprive parents of their rights to care and custody of their children. In <em>In re Damon </em>M., we held that an \u201corder amending a permanency plan calling for reunification to foster care or adoption is immediately appealable.\u201d 362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628. That case involved four consolidated cases where seven children were committed to the care and custody of the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (MCDHHS) and all seven children had been in foster care for at least one year. <em>Id. </em>at 430, 765 A.2d at 624. In three of the cases, the trial court\u2019s order amended the permanency plan from reunification to either long-term foster care or permanent foster care.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 430-31, 765 A.2d at 624-25. The fourth case, <em>In re Marcello K., Lenny M., and Keshya K., </em>involved three children. The trial court at the initial permanency plan hearing established a permanency plan of adoption. <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 765 A.2d at 625. The four cases were appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In a reported opinion, that court dismissed <em>In re Damon M., </em>131 Md.App. 449, 749 A.2d 231 (2000), holding that the order was not a final order. Citing the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding in <em>In re Dam,on M., </em>that court dismissed the other three appeals, in unreported opinions. <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 432, 765 A.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">We acknowledged in <em>In re Damon M. </em>the facts in <em>In re Marcello, </em>an unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals. The order appealed from in <em>In re Marcello </em>was for adoption and stemmed from the permanency planning hearing. We did not, however, distinguish the facts in <em>In re Marcello </em>from the facts in <em>In re Damon M. </em>when we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">[t]he amendment of the permanency plan to long-term or permanent foster care and adoption is a change in the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of the custody order, whenever it was passed. The respondent acknowledges as much when it argues: \u201cIn the absence of the permanency planning orders appealed here, the previous commitment orders would have remained in effect and all of these children would have remained in the Department\u2019s custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">The respondent asserts ... that an order approving or revising a permanency plan is not appealable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 437, 765 A.2d at 628. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this Court focused not only on orders that revise a permanency plan, but also on orders that approve a permanency plan when considering the question of appealability of an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Further indications that we acknowledged an order approving or revising a permanency may be immediately appealable is our discussion in <em>In re Damon M., </em>with regard to respondent\u2019s contention in that case, that other states have addressed this issue, and \u201cconcluded that an order approving or revising a permanency plan is not appealable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We distinguished the cases cited by the respondent in support of that proposition on the basis that \u201c[t]here apparently was no counterpart to \u00a7 12-303(3)(x) in any of the States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In determining whether an interlocutory order is appealable, in the context of custody cases, the focus should be on whether the order and the extent to which that order changes the antecedent custody order. It is immaterial that the order appealed from emanated from the permanency planning hearing or from the periodic review hearing. If the change could deprive a parent of the fundamental right to care and custody of his or her child, whether immediately or in the future, the order is an appealable interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">We hold that a concurrent permanency plan that includes the option of adoption is sufficiently far enough along the continuum of depriving a parent of a fundamental right and is immediately appealable. Whether the concurrent permanency plan was ordered at the permanency planning hearing or, subsequently, at the periodic review hearing, the detrimental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>effects are the same. Reunification and adoption are mutually exclusive goals, and are directly contradictory goals. Reunification gives a parent the opportunity for reconciliation. The goal of adoption, however, guarantees that, under \u00a7 3-823(g) of the Family Law Article, after thirty days at the earliest, a petition will be filed to terminate a parent\u2019s rights along with the hope of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The DSS\u2019s role is an important one in these matters \u2014 to secure a permanent, secure, and safe home for a child. The Department is required to facilitate and accelerate the process to ensure that a child is not left languishing in limbo for years. In Petitioner\u2019s case, in March 2004, it was determined that his children required emergency shelter care. By December 2004, a secure placement was obtained for the children and they were happy and thriving. Meanwhile, Petitioner was unsuccessful in completing the tasks set forth by CCDSS, such as getting clean and sober, staying clean and sober, and providing a home for his two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We are not unmindful of the need for a concurrent plan of reunification and adoption; however, we find that the implementation of those goals are not parallel. When the option of \u201cadoption\u201d enters into a permanency plan, whether alone or with a concurrent vision, under \u00a7 3-823(g) the \u201clocal department\u201d must file a petition for TPR within thirty days (or sixty days if the local department does not support the plan). A parent is deprived of a six-month review of the permanency plan. The six-month review is replaced with a TPR hearing when \u201cadoption\u201d is a component of the permanency plan. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-823(g). An interlocutory order which includes adoption as a possible outcome has the potential both to accelerate the termination and to terminate a parent\u2019s custodial rights; therefore, such orders adversely affect a parent\u2019s rights to care and custody and entitle the parent to an immediate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>WITH THIS OPINION.
