GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">James \u201cJimmie\u201d Earl Aron is presently being detained without bail pending trial on charges including mail fraud, use of interstate commerce facilities in the course of a conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. Aron was originally released on $100,000 bond. Aron\u2019s bail was revoked, however, and Aron was ordered detained, because of proof that he had intimidated a government witness. Aron appeals the Detention Order, arguing that the government did not sustain its burden of proof. We affirm the Detention Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">On October 27 1989, a grand jury returned a nine-count indictment charging Aron with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and murder-for-hire, use of interstate commerce facilities in the course of a conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, mail fraud, and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. The government moved for the detention of Aron pending trial, but the magistrate denied the motion and released Aron on conditions. The release order forbade Aron from contacting four witnesses: Wendell Blount, Linda Fason, C. B. Gladney, and A. W. Yates. The release order also contained the standard condition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(c)(1)(A), requiring Aron to observe all federal, state, and local laws. Finally, the \u201cAdvice of Penalties and Sanctions\u201d portion of the release form alerted Aron to the fact that it was a federal offense to tamper with or intimidate a witness, victim, or informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">On November 29, 1989, the government moved for revocation of Aron\u2019s release, contending that he had violated the conditions of his release by attempting to intimidate a witness, Boyce Crowell, who had testified before the grand jury in this case, with the aim of influencing the witness\u2019s testimony. An evidentiary hearing was held before the magistrate on December 20, 1989. The transcript of that hearing reveals that it is undisputed that Aron drove to the home of Boyce Crowell on Thanksgiving evening, November 23, 1989, and spoke with Crowell. The testimony at the evidentiary hearing presented two versions of the discussion that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">Crowell testified that Aron came to his home and asked him what he had told the grand jury about the life insurance policy Aron had purchased on the life of Wendell Blount, the man whose death was the object of the alleged conspiracy. Crowell testified that he informed Aron that he had told the grand jury that he had not seen Blount sign the application. Crowell testified that Aron expressed disappointment and that Aron \u201cwished that I had said that I had seen Blount sign it.\u201d Crowell also testified that, later in the conversation, Aron said that he would \u201cget even with anyone that lines up on their side.\u201d Cro-well testified that by \u201ctheir side,\u201d Aron meant the law and Wendell Blount.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">Crowell further testified that Aron stated that he had taken a back road to Cro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>well\u2019s house so that no one would observe his presence. Crowell testified that, although Aron did not threaten him, did not raise his voice while speaking, and did not ask him to change his testimony, he nevertheless felt intimidated by the visit. Cro-well admitted that he knew Aron from business dealings and that he had borrowed money from Aron to finance a business venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Sue Taylor testified that in November 1989 she had paid off a debt she owed to Aron and that, as a condition of repayment, Aron was to contact Crowell and cancel the insurance policy he had on Taylor. Crowell admitted that he and Aron discussed the Taylor policy during the Thanksgiving visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Lamar Johnson testified that he observed Crowell and Aron speaking at Crowell\u2019s house on Thanksgiving evening, but that he did not overhear the conversation. Dr. Walter Hudson testified that in November 1989 Crowell told him to tell Aron that Crowell wanted to speak with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">Aron testified that Dr. Hudson had told him that Crowell wished to see Aron. Cro-well testified that he did not remember asking Dr. Hudson to convey this message to Aron. Aron also testified that he did not know that Crowell was a grand jury witness, and that Crowell brought up the subject of his grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">After the hearing was concluded, the magistrate revoked Aron\u2019s pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">Aron appealed the magistrate\u2019s order to the district court. The district court, after conducting a de novo evidentiary hearing and considering the transcript of the detention hearing conducted by the magistrate, ordered Aron\u2019s release revoked. The district court found that Aron had \u201cwillfully violated a written condition of his previous release on bail, namely that he should not intimidate or attempt to intimidate any witness involved in the case.\u201d The district court further found that the violation warranted revocation and that Aron could not be released on any condition or combination of conditions. Aron filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The district court\u2019s detention order must be sustained <em>\u201c </em>\u2018if it is supported by the proceedings below.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Barker, </em>876 F.2d 475, 476 (5th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>845 F.2d 1262, 1263 (5th Cir.1988)). This court reviews the factual basis for the order revoking release under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>(5th Cir.1989) (unpublished opinion, attached hereto as an appendix) (citing <em>United States v. Gotti, </em>794 F.2d 773, 778 (2d Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Title 18, Section 3148(b) provides that a judicial officer shall enter an order of revocation of a previous release order if, after a hearing, the judicial officer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">(1) finds that there is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">(A) probable cause to believe that the person has committed a Federal, State, or local crime while on release; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">(B) clear and convincing evidence that the person has violated any other condition of release; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-18\">(2) finds that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-19\">(A) based on the factors set forth in section 3142(g) of this title, there is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-20\">(B) the person is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-21\">If there is probable cause to believe that, while on release, the person committed a Federal, State, or local felony, a rebut-table presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. If the judicial officer finds that there are conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, and that the person will abide by such conditions, the judicial officer shall treat the person in accordance with the provisions of sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tion 3142 of this title and may amend the conditions of release accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADm\">According to the statute, the district court must have found (1) that there was either probable cause that Aron committed a crime while on release <em>or </em>clear and convincing evidence that he violated any <em>other </em>condition of release, <em>and </em>(2) that either no condition or combination of conditions will assure that Aron will not pose a danger to any other person or the community <em>or </em>that Aron is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions or release.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The district court found that there was probable cause to believe that Aron had committed a crime while on release, i.e., that Aron endeavored to intimidate witness Boyce Crowell. The district court also concluded that Aron would \u201cagain violate the orders of the court concerning conditions of his release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In order to satisfy the probable cause requirement of \u00a7 3148(b)(1)(A), the facts available to the judicial officer must \u201c \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the defendant has committed a crime while on bail.\u201d <em>Gotti, </em>794 F.2d at 777 (quoting <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983)). We hold that the probable cause standard of \u00a7 3148(b)(1)(A) was clearly satisfied in this case. In any event, despite his complaints about the district court\u2019s credibility choices, Aron does not appear to dispute the district court\u2019s finding of probable cause to believe that he had committed a crime while on release.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Under the statute, a finding of probable cause under \u00a7 3148(b)(1)(A) carries with it a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Aron argues that the government is not entitled to rely solely on the existence of the presumption after a defendant has offered evidence to the contrary, but must thereafter offer affirmative evidence that there is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will assure that the defendant will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Aron argues that he offered substantial evidence rebutting any presumption that he posed a danger to any person or the community, and contends that the government failed to demonstrate even by a preponderance of the evidence, much less by clear and convincing evidence, that Aron posed a danger to any person or to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The district court found that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s willful and intentional violation of the conditions of his previous release substantiate a finding that he would again violate the orders of the court concerning conditions of his release....\u201d Thus, the district court relied upon \u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B) (\u201cthe person is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release\u201d) rather than upon the presumption that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Aron, however, complains that the district court used its credibility choice in favor of Crowell as the sole basis to support its conclusion that Aron will \u201cagain violate the orders of the court concerning conditions of his release,\u201d and argues that the court\u2019s conclusion is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The Second Circuit has held, and we agree, that a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant will not abide by any conditions of release may be established by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Gotti, </em>794 F.2d at 778. The district court, at the February 2, 1990 hearing, stated that it would consider the entire record in making its decision. The record includes the transcript of the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate as well as the superceding indictment filed on January 19, 1990, charging Aron with two counts of intimidating Boyce Crowell. The district court found that Crowell was a more credible witness than Aron and concluded that Aron had attempted to intimidate Crowell. The district court\u2019s credibility determination is a finding of fact, and we cannot say that the finding is clearly erroneous. We further hold that the district court\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Aron willfully and intentionally violated the conditions of his previous release by attempting to intimidate Crowell is sufficient to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Aron would again violate the orders of the court concerning conditions of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the district court\u2019s detention order is supported by the proceedings below. The district court\u2019s order is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AQd\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"A8Y\">No. 89-4107</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">United States of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">versus</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Charlie Glen Cook, Defendant-Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi (CRW89-17-B).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">(May 31, 1989)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Before CLARK, Chief Judge, REAYLEY and POLITZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">Charlie Glen Cook is presently being detained without bail pending trial on 32 drug-related charges, including operation of a continuing criminal drug enterprise. Cook was originally released on $200,000 bond. Cook\u2019s bail was revoked, however, and Cook was ordered detained, because of proof that he had threatened a government witness. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148. On appeal to this court, Cook seeks revocation of the order of detention on the grounds that proper procedures were not followed and that he was denied the right to confront his accusers. We affirm the order of detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">On December 16, 1988, a Federal Grand Jury for the Northern District of Mississippi returned a 27-count indictment against Charlie Glen Cook. This initial indictment charged Cook with multiple violations of the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, <em>et seq. </em>Three days later, Cook was apprehended in Memphis, Tennessee, and the next day a United States magistrate in Memphis ordered Cook released on $200,-000 bond. The United States did not seek to have Cook detained without bail at the hearing in Memphis.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">One month later, Cook voluntarily appeared in federal court in Oxford, Mississippi to be arraigned. At the arraignment, the government sought, for the first time, to revoke Cook\u2019s bail and to detain him without bail, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148, on the grounds that Cook had violated the conditions of his release by threatening a government witness. A hearing was held before a United States magistrate. The threatened witness did not personally appear at the hearing, although her identity was known to the defendant. The government did introduce a handwritten statement from the witness that recited the telephone threat \u2014 \u201cWhat you done to me, you won\u2019t make it very far. You better be watching your shadow.\u201d Three witnesses, two drug agents and an agent from the criminal division of the Internal Revenue Service, appeared on behalf of the government. These witnesses testified concerning Cook\u2019s general reputation as a large-scale drug dealer who was considered dangerous and the availability of Cook\u2019s assets that might facilitate his flight. Based on this evidence, the magistrate revoked Cook\u2019s bail and ordered him detained pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148, which permits the revocation of bail upon a showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>probable cause to believe that the defendant violated a term of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Cook immediately appealed the magistrate\u2019s detention order to the district court. Prior to the ruling of the district court, a superseding indictment was returned against Cook. In this new indictment the Grand Jury added several charges, including one count of endeavoring by a threatening communication to influence, obstruct, and impede the due administration of justice in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 3147, and 3623. The district judge accordingly ordered that the parties return to the Mississippi magistrate for re-arraignment and a detention hearing under the superseding indictment. The magistrate orally adopted his prior ruling that Cook be detained, and Cook again sought revocation of the detention order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The district court affirmed the order of detention, but for reasons different from those recited by the magistrate. Instead of relying on the provisions for the revocation of bail, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148, the district court ordered Cook detained pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. Section 3142 provides for an order for pre-trial detention without bail issued at the first appearance before a federal court. This provision requires that a detention hearing be held in any case, such as Cook\u2019s, in which the defendant is charged with an offense under the Controlled Substances Act that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(1)(C). In such cases, there is a rebuttable presumption that the defendant should be detained, unless it can be shown that a condition or combination of conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any individual or the community. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3742(2) [3142(f)(2)],</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On appeal of the order of detention to this court, Cook argues that the detention hearing should have been heard by the United States magistrate sitting in Memphis and that, accordingly, the order issued by the district court in Oxford was rendered improperly. Cook also argues that there was not sufficient evidence to support the detention order. In this regard, Cook argues that his sixth amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him in any criminal prosecution prohibits his detention based solely on hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.App.Proc. 9(a). We affirm the order of detention on the grounds recited by the United States magistrate; that is, that Cook violated the conditions of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">We need not reach Cook\u2019s argument that it was error for the magistrate sitting in Mississippi, rather than the magistrate who first presided over his release on bail in Tennessee, to preside over the detention hearing under section 3142 and to issue the order of detention. Section 3142 states that a detention hearing \u201cshall be held immediately upon the person\u2019s first appearance before the judicial officer unless that person, or the attorney for the Government, seeks a continuance.\u201d In this case, when Cook\u2019s detention hearing was held, he was released on a $200,000 bond by the Memphis magistrate. The government now asserts that while out on bail, Cook threatened a government witness. On the basis of this alleged threat, a clear violation of the conditions of Cook\u2019s release, the government moved to revoke Cook\u2019s bail. Section 3148, which governs revocation of bail, obviously could not require the revocation hearing to be held upon \u201cfirst appearance.\u201d Nor is there any need to hold the hearing in the district in which the defendant is first released on bail. Revocation of bail is not a change of the original order of release. It is a separate proceeding based on new and independent events. The hearing on revocation was thus properly held before the court in the district in which Cook was arraigned and in which he would be tried. The superseding indictment, which added a count for the intimidation of a government witness, did not in any way render section 3148 inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">We expressly pretermit any ruling with regard to whether the initial proceeding in Memphis was Cook\u2019s \u201cfirst appearance\u201d before a judicial officer within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>section 3142(f). We note only that the issue is undecided in this circuit. Nor do we rule on the relevance of the superseding indictment in regard to that section. The Seventh Circuit has held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cfirst appearance\u201d for the purposes of section 3142 is not the place or time when the defendant is arrested and initially appears, but rather when and where the defendant is charged. <em>United States v. Dominquez, </em>783 F.2d 702, 704-05 (7th Cir.1986). This circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. O\u2019Shanghnessy [O'Shaughnessy], </em>764 F.2d 1035, 1038 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated as moot, </em>772 F.2d 112 (5th Cir.1985), is contrary to this rule, but is no longer precedent in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We review the factual basis for the order to revoke Cook\u2019s bail and to detain him pending trial under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Gotti, </em>794 F.2d 773, 778 (2nd Cir.1986). Our review is further limited by the burden of proof established under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148. Revocation of a defendant\u2019s bail is required upon a showing of probable cause to believe (1) that a condition of release has been violated, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b)(1), and (2) that no conditions of release will guard against the potential for flight or dangerousness presented by the defendant, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b)(2). <em>Gotti, </em>794 F.2d at 777. Section 3142, on the other hand, requires that similar findings be proven by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f). Under the less stringent requirements for revocation of bail under section 3148, the order of detention is clearly supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The district court in reviewing the magistrate\u2019s order revoking bail and detaining the defendant found \u201cfrom the evidence received that [Cook] did intimidate or attempt to intimidate a prospective witness as shown by the affidavit filed herein and the transcript at the magistrate\u2019s detention hearing previously held.\u201d This finding is clearly broad enough to determine probable cause. \u201cProbable cause\u201d under section 3148(b) \u201crequires only that the facts available to the judicial officer \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the defendant has committed a crime while on bail.\u201d <em>Gotti, </em>794 F.2d at 777 <em>(quoting Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. at 730, 742 [103 S.Ct. at 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502] (1983) (plurality opinion)). The affidavit plus the reputation testimony proffered by the United States establish that the determination of probable cause to believe both components of section 3148(b) was without clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Cook argues that an order of pre-trial detention based solely on hearsay evidence violates his sixth amendment right to cross-examine witnesses against him. The sixth amendment, however, protects the right of cross-examination only in criminal prosecutions. U.S. CONST, amend. VI. The hearing to revoke Cook\u2019s bail was not a criminal prosecution. <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 120-21 [95 S.Ct. 854, 866-67, 43 L.Ed.2d 54] (1975); <em>United States v. Delker, </em>757 F.2d 1390, 1397-98 (3rd Cir.1985). In <em>Gerstein, </em>the Court held that \u201cthe full panalopy of adversary safeguards \u2014 counsel, confrontation, cross-examination, and compulsory process ... are not essential ... [when the issue] is whether there is probable cause for detaining the arrested person pending further proceedings.\u201d <em>Gerstein, </em>420 U.S. at 119-20 [95 S.Ct. at 865-66]; <em>see also Delker, </em>757 F.2d at 1397. The inability of the defendant to cross-examine a declarant is relevant to the probative value of the proffered evidence, but the lack of such opportunity does not render the evidence constitutionally infirm. <em>See Gerstein, </em>420 U.S. at 121-22 [95 S.Ct. at 866-67]. The district court in this case considered Cook\u2019s inability to cross-examine the threatened witness, but in light of the weight of the evidence concluded that the threat had occurred. Since this conclusion was not clearly erroneous, the detention order is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Cook makes one final argument: that the telephone conversation quoted in the witness\u2019s affidavit was not a threat. Cook would have us characterize the following words as mere \u201charassment\u201d or a \u201cbitter complaint\u201d concerning the witness\u2019s testimony: \u201cWhat you done to me, you won\u2019t make it very far. You better be watching your shadow.\u201d The lower court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>that this statement was a threat is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The order of detention is</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3n\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-16\">.
