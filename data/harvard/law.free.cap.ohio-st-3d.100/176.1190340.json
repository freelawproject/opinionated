Hutton was convicted of aggravated murder with two death specifications. After a penalty hearing, the trial court sentenced Hutton to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">{\u00b6 2} Hutton had once been a close friend of Mitchell and Simmons. However, Hutton became angry with the two men because he believed that they had stolen from him. On Friday, September 13, or Saturday, September 14, 1985, outside the house where Samuel Simmons Jr., then lived, Hutton confronted Simmons over the theft of a sewing machine belonging to Hutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">{\u00b6 3} Claiming that he had seen Mitchell trying to sell the machine, Hutton demanded its immediate return. Simmons suggested that Hutton talk to Mitchell. During this conversation, Mitchell arrived. He and Hutton entered the residence and went upstairs together. When they returned, according to Simmons, Hutton said that \u201cit wasn\u2019t what he was looking for and if he found out we had anything to do with what was missing or stolen he was going to kill us.\u201d Hutton also told Mitchell, \u201cI\u2019m tired with you f* * *ing with me and stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Around midnight on Monday, September 16, 1985, Hutton drove to Simmons\u2019s house in a gray Chrysler Cordoba, accompanied by Bruce Laster, whose sister was engaged to Hutton. Hutton asked Simmons to come with him and help him work on a car. When Simmons got into Hutton\u2019s car, he noticed a .22-caliber rifle lying on the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">{\u00b6 5} Hutton drove to Mitchell\u2019s house, stating that he wanted to talk to Simmons and Mitchell. When they arrived, Simmons went in and brought Mitchell outside, telling him that \u201cJune wanted to talk to him.\u201d Hutton then confronted Mitchell, demanding the return of his sewing machine and accusing Mitchell of stealing some tires from Hutton\u2019s backyard. Hutton said that he had hidden $750 in the sewing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 6} Mitchell denied taking the machine. However, Hutton insisted that Mitchell had tried to sell it to a Mr. Evans. Hutton demanded that Mitchell come with him to Evans\u2019s house to settle the issue. Hutton threatened to \u201cf* * * [Mitchell] up\u201d if Evans confirmed Mitchell\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 7} Mitchell and Simmons got into the car. Before pulling away from the curb, Hutton pointed the rifle into Simmons\u2019s side and said: \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you all breaking in my sister\u2019s house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 8} Instead of going to Evans\u2019s house, Hutton drove to a parking lot behind an RTA bus facility. Hutton got out of the car and ordered Mitchell to get out as well. Hutton and Mitchell then walked a short distance from the car. Simmons could not hear their conversation, but he saw Hutton put a pistol against Mitchell\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 9} Hutton and Mitchell returned to the car. With Mitchell giving directions, Hutton drove to an area known as \u201cthe Projects.\u201d Hutton and Mitchell went into a building and emerged after a few minutes with a white sewing-machine case.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 10} Hutton drove to his mother\u2019s house, took the case inside, and returned to the car. He then drove to the next street and pulled into an alley where a Cadillac El Dorado was parked. Hutton told Simmons that the El Dorado was the car he wanted to work on. Simmons got out of Hutton\u2019s car. Hutton then moved his car to the other end of the street. Leaving Laster and Mitchell in the car, he walked back to the alley, where Simmons was waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 11} Hutton broke into the El Dorado with a screwdriver. When Simmons got inside, Hutton opened the hood and told him to try starting the engine. Hutton then walked back to Simmons, shot him twice in the back of the head, and ran up the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">{\u00b6 12} Unable to move at first, lying half in and half out of the car, Simmons cried for help. He managed to get up and stagger away in search of assistance. Simmons went first to the nearby home of Hutton\u2019s mother, then to Mary Etta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Pollard\u2019s house next door. He banged on Pollard\u2019s front door and cried for help. Then he heard Hutton\u2019s car coming out of the nearby alley. He ran into Pollard\u2019s back yard and pounded on the back door, shouting that he had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 13} Hutton drove up and stopped in front of Pollard\u2019s house. He urged Simmons to \u201ccome here\u201d or \u201ccome from back there.\u201d Hutton noticed that Pollard\u2019s son was looking out from his front door and told him to close the door. Simmons begged Hutton to take him to the hospital. Hutton said, \u201cJust shut up and get in the car,\u201d and Simmons obeyed. Mitchell and Bruce Laster were in the car with Hutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 14} Telling Mitchell that some unknown assailant had shot Simmons, Hutton drove to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. Simmons asked Mitchell to go inside with him, but Mitchell said, \u201cNo. We [are] going to get the mother-f* * *er that did this to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 15} At 2:30 a.m., Mitchell, Hutton, and Laster returned to Mitchell\u2019s home. They woke Mitchell\u2019s girlfriend, Eileen Sweeney, and took her to the hospital, where they dropped her off. Sweeney went into the hospital to visit Simmons. Telling her that Hutton had shot him, Simmons sent her to warn Mitchell to get out of the car. She went outside, but the car was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 16} Hospital security officer Paul Whitcomb saw a Chrysler Cordoba drop Simmons off and leave \u201cin a hurry.\u201d About half an hour later, Whitcomb saw the same car drop off Sweeney. After Sweeney went inside, Whitcomb saw the same car parked across the street from the hospital. He sent security officer Gary Barnhard to get the license number. As Barnhard drove past the car, he saw its two occupants crouch down in an attempt at concealment. Then the car left. A subsequent check of the license number disclosed that the gray Chrysler was registered to Hutton\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Celeste Laster.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 17} Hutton and Bruce Laster later returned to the hospital without Mitchell. Sweeney was still there. Hutton told her that Mitchell was at home and offered to drive her back. However, once he had Sweeney inside the car, Hutton took her to a park instead. There, Hutton and Sweeney got out of the car. Laster then drove off, and Hutton proceeded to rape Sweeney. During the rape, Hutton told Sweeney that \u201cRicky wasn\u2019t coming back.\u201d According to Sweeney, Hutton had in his possession a small handgun with a white handle and a silver-colored barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">{\u00b6 18} When Laster returned with the car, Sweeney saw Hutton remove two rifles from the trunk and put them in the rear passenger compartment. Hutton then drove Sweeney home to the apartment she shared with Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 19} When they arrived, Mitchell was not there. The door to the apartment had been damaged and the apartment was in disarray. Sweeney was too \u201cscared and nervous\u201d to drive, so Hutton drove her to the home of LaWanda Mitchell, the sister of Ricky Mitchell. Hutton followed Sweeney into LaWanda\u2019s house. According to Sweeney, Hutton told her that \u201cRicky [Mitchell] wasn\u2019t coming back,\u201d and that \u201cif [she] told, someone would be looking for [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">{\u00b6 20} On Tuesday, September 17, Hutton drove to Indianapolis to enroll in a course for automotive mechanics at the Lincoln Technical Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 21} On September 30, 1985, the body of Derek Mitchell was found near an intersection in Cleveland with a large tire lying on the body. An autopsy disclosed that Mitchell had been shot to death. Two .22-caliber long rifle bullets were recovered from the body; a firearms expert testified that these could have been fired from either a rifle or a handgun. The expert testified that the bullets that killed Mitchell had the same class characteristics as a bullet that had been removed from Simmons\u2019s head, but he could not tell whether all three had been fired from the same gun. The murder weapon was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 22} The defense presented evidence that Mitchell was not killed on September 16, 1985, but at some later time while Hutton was in Indianapolis. Denise Richardson testified that she spoke to Mitchell at 3:00 p.m. on September 17, 1985, the day after the state claims Mitchell was murdered. According to Hutton, he was in Indianapolis at the time Richardson spoke to Mitchell. Hutton claimed that he stayed in Indianapolis until October 3, except for two brief visits to Cleveland on September 21 and 28. An employee of the Indianapolis YMCA saw Hutton there sometime after 4:00 p.m. on September 17. The YMCA employee testified that Hutton had paid rent for the period of September 17 through October 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 23} On October 4, 1985, Cleveland Police Detective Robert Moore spoke to Hutton on the telephone. Hutton agreed to return to Cleveland and surrender to Moore at a prearranged time and place. On October 5, Hutton surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 24} Hutton and Laster were jointly indicted on two counts of aggravated murder for killing Derek Mitchell. The first count charged that they committed the murder with prior calculation and design. R.C. 2903.01(A). The second charged them with murdering Mitchell while committing, attempting, or fleeing the commission or attempted commission of kidnapping. R.C. 2903.01(B). Each murder count carried two capital specifications: a course-of-conduct specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and a felony-murder kidnapping specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Hutton and Laster were also indicted for kidnapping Mitchell and Simmons, and for the attempted murder of Simmons. Each count carried a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Hutton was tried separately from Laster. The jury convicted Hutton of all charges and specifications. After a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended a death sentence. The trial judge sentenced Hutton to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Proceedings on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 26} Represented by the now-deceased Floyd B. Oliver, Hutton appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County. The court of appeals reversed Hutton\u2019s convictions and sentence and remanded the cause to the common pleas court for retrial. <em>State v. Hutton </em>(Apr. 28, 1988), Cuyahoga App. No. 51704, 1988 WL 39276 <em>(\u201cHutton </em>I\u201d). Having reversed the convictions, the court of appeals did not perform an independent review of Hutton\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 27} We allowed the state\u2019s motion to certify the record. <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 716, 534 N.E.2d 88. Hutton filed a cross-appeal. 41 Ohio St.3d 704, 534 N.E.2d 1206; <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 725, 535 N.E.2d 1370. Hutton was represented in this court by Oliver and David L. Doughten.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 28} We sustained the state\u2019s propositions of law, rejected Hutton\u2019s propositions on cross-appeal, and reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 36, 559 N.E.2d 432 <em>(\u201cHutton II\u201d). </em>Following the precedent set in <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 235, 533 N.E.2d 272, we remanded the cause to the court of appeals, directing that court to perform an independent review of the death sentence in accordance with R.C. 2929.05(A). <em>Hutton II, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 50, 559 N.E.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The Appeal from Remand (No. 2000-1540)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">{\u00b6 29} On remand, the court of appeals affirmed the death sentence. <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 348, 594 N.E.2d 692 <em>(\u201cHutton III\u201d). </em>Oliver filed a motion for reconsideration on Hutton\u2019s behalf. The court of appeals denied the motion. Hutton did not file an appeal of that judgment to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">{\u00b6 30} On August 21, 1991, Oliver died. Since no appeal had been filed, no further action occurred until July 17,1996, when we granted the state\u2019s motion to set an execution date. 76 Ohio St.3d 1421, 667 N.E.2d 24. On September 19, 1996, we stayed execution pending completion of postconviction proceedings. 76 Ohio St.3d 1480, 669 N.E.2d 861. On October 18, 2000, we granted Hutton\u2019s motion for a delayed appeal of the 1991 judgment of the court of appeals on remand. 90 Ohio St.3d 1441, 736 N.E.2d 903. Case No. 2000-1540, which we decide today, is that delayed appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The Application for Reopening (No. 2000-0816)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">{\u00b6 31} On April 21, 1997, Hutton filed in the court of appeals an application for reopening of his direct appeal, pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Hutton\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>alleged ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on failure to raise three issues in the court of appeals in <em>Hutton I, </em>and also because counsel had failed to raise other issues in this court in <em>Hutton II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 32} The court of appeals denied the motion on March 20, 2000. <em>State v. Hutton </em>(Mar. 20, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 51704, 2000 WL 301097 <em>(\u201cHutton IV\u201d). </em>Hutton now appeals from this judgment. He subsequently moved to consolidate No. 2000-0816 with his delayed appeal in No. 2000-1540 for purposes of oral argument and disposition. On July 25, 2001, we granted the motion to consolidate. 92 Ohio St.3d 1446, 751 N.E.2d 484. Today, we decide the consolidated appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">I. Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 33} A convicted defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel on his first appeal as of right. <em>Evitts v. Lucey </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 387, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821. In his proposition of law in case No. 2000-0816, Hutton contends that his appellate counsel failed to effectively assist him in his original appeal in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 34} In case No. 2000-1540, the appeal from <em>Hutton III </em>(the court of appeals\u2019 proceedings on remand), Hutton asserts five claims of ineffective appellate assistance. Three claims involve <em>Hutton I, </em>his original appeal in the court of appeals; one claim involves <em>Hutton II, </em>his 1989 cross-appeal to this court; and one involves <em>Hutton III. </em>In case No. 2000-0816, the appeal from <em>Hutton TV </em>(the denial of reopening), Hutton includes only the claims involving <em>Hutton I </em>and <em>II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">A. Original Appeal in Court of Appeals <em>(Hutton I)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">{\u00b6 35} In Parts A through C of his first proposition of law, Hutton claims that his counsel in <em>Hutton I </em>failed to raise three issues before the court of appeals. The state contends that Hutton\u2019s ineffective-appellate-assistance claim is res judicata, and that it lacks merit as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">1. Res Judicata Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>Hutton II, </em>Hutton raised seven propositions of law on cross-appeal from the judgment of the court of appeals. We decided six of those issues\u2014 Hutton\u2019s first and third through seventh propositions of law on cross-appeal\u2014 adversely to Hutton. Having sustained several of the state\u2019s propositions of law, we reversed the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and thereby reinstated Hutton\u2019s convictions. We therefore remanded this case to the court of appeals for the sole purpose of allowing that court to perform its statutorily mandated independent review. Id. at 50, 559 N.E.2d 432. \u201cThe fact that the cause was remanded to the court of appeals for re-evaluation of the death sentence in no way implicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>finality of those convictions.\u201d <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 143, 652 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 37} Hutton\u2019s claims in the <em>Hutton II </em>cross-appeal did not include any claim that his appellate counsel had been ineffective in <em>Hutton I. </em>\u201cWhere an argument could have been raised on an initial appeal, <em>res judicata </em>dictates that it is inappropriate to consider that same argument on a second appeal following remand.\u201d <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 143, 652 N.E.2d 710. Accord <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 548, 549, 679 N.E.2d 276 (on appeal after remand, \u201cnew issues\u201d are barred by res judicata). Since Hutton\u2019s ineffective-appellate-assistance claims pertaining to his counsel\u2019s performance in <em>Hutton I </em>could have been raised on his <em>Hutton II </em>cross-appeal, they would normally be res judicata on appeal from remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 38} Similarly, since Hutton did not raise the ineffective-appellate-assistance claim in his <em>Hutton II </em>cross-appeal, res judicata would ordinarily bar him from raising it in his application for reopening under App.R. 26(B). See <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 363, 365, 708 N.E.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 39} However, Hutton points out that the attorney who had represented him in <em>Hutton I </em>continued to represent him before this court in <em>Hutton II. </em>We have recognized that an attorney \u201ccannot realistically be expected to argue his own incompetence.\u201d <em>State v. Cole </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 2 OBR 661, 443 N.E.2d 169, fn. 1. Cf. <em>State v. Lentz </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 527, 639 N.E.2d 784 (claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, raised for first time in postconviction proceedings, is barred by res judicata where appellate counsel is different attorney, even though from same public defender\u2019s office as trial counsel). Since Hutton\u2019s counsel could not have been expected to raise in <em>Hutton II </em>the issue of his own ineffective representation in <em>Hutton I, </em>Hutton argues that res judicata does not bar raising the issue now, either in the appeal from remand or on his motion to reopen the <em>Hutton I </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 40} In <em>Hutton II, </em>Hutton also had one new attorney who had not represented him in <em>Hutton I </em>and was therefore free of any personal conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 41} Courts of appeals in Ohio have generally held that res judicata bars an ineffective-assistance claim not raised in an appeal, even where the defendant was represented on appeal by his trial counsel, so long as the defendant was also represented on appeal by at least one attorney who had not represented the defendant at trial. See <em>State v. Zuern </em>(Dec. 4, 1991), Hamilton App. Nos. C-900481 and C-910229, 1991 WL 256497; <em>State v. Swiger </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 456, 465, 708 N.E.2d 1033; <em>State v. Broom </em>(May 7, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 72581, 1998 WL 230425; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(Jan. 11, 1999), Ross App. No. 98 CA 2401, 1999 WL 22626.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>{\u00b6 42} However, in <em>State v. Evans </em>(June 19, 1998), Lucas App. No. L-97-1134, 1998 WL 351884, the court held that, where the appellant continues to be represented by his trial counsel on appeal, \u201cone additional counsel on appeal does not permit the application of <em>res judicata </em>to claims of ineffective assistance of [trial] counsel,\u201d because \u201c[i]t is unlikely that, as co-counsel with [trial counsel], [new counsel] would be inclined to assert a claim on appeal for ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\u201d We agree with this reasoning and today hold that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to bar a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel not previously raised in an appeal where a defendant was represented on appeal by the same attorney who allegedly earlier provided the ineffective assistance, even where the defendant was also represented on that appeal by another attorney who had not represented the defendant at the time of the alleged ineffective assistance. Accordingly, Hutton\u2019s claims that he received ineffective assistance in <em>Hutton I </em>are not res judicata, and we proceed to the merits of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">2. Merits Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 43} Hutton claims that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in his first appeal as of right (i.e., the court of appeals\u2019 proceedings in <em>Hutton I) </em>by failing to raise three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 44} Appellate counsel\u2019s effectiveness is to be judged by the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. See, e.g., <em>State v. Mitts, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 325, 2003-Ohio-1007, 784 N.E.2d 698, \u00b6 4. Hence, to prevail on his ineffective-assistance claim, Hutton must show deficient performance and resulting prejudice. Deficient performance means performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation. \u201cPrejudice\u201d means a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. See, also, <em>Williams v. Taylor </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 362, 390-391, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">a. <em>DePew </em>issue</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">{\u00b6 45} The trial court, in its penalty-phase jury instructions, listed all seven of the statutory mitigating factors in R.C. 2929.04(B), and the prosecutor discussed all seven in his closing argument, even though several were not raised by the defense. Citing <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 289-290, 528 N.E.2d 542, Hutton contends that the trial court and the prosecutor erred in discussing mitigating factors on which Hutton had not presented evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">{\u00b6 46} Hutton correctly contends that such comment is inconsistent with <em>DePew. </em>\u201cIf the defendant chooses to refrain from raising some of or all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>factors available to him, those factors not raised may not be referred to or commented upon by the trial court or the prosecution. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c[I]t is the defendant who has the right to present and argue the mitigating factors. If he does not do so, no comment on any factors not raised by him is permissible.\u201d 38 Ohio St.3d at 289, 528 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 48} Hutton claims that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not raising the <em>DePew </em>issue in the court of appeals. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 49} First, <em>DePew </em>was not available as precedent to Hutton\u2019s appellate counsel. The court of appeals issued its opinion in <em>Hutton I </em>on April 28, 1988. We did not decide <em>DePew </em>until four months later, on August 31,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Because attorney performance is not to be judged by hindsight, courts generally do not find that an attorney performs deficiently by failing to anticipate a future decision or development in the law. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 342, 345, 594 N.E.2d 688. See, also, <em>Clark v. Moran </em>(C.A.1, 1991), 942 F.2d 24, 33; <em>Jameson v. Coughlin </em>(C.A.2, 1994), 22 F.3d 427, 429; <em>Senk v. Zimmerman </em>(C.A.3, 1989), 886 F.2d 611, 618; <em>Lilly v. Gilmore </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 988 F.2d 783, 786; <em>Brown v. United States </em>(C.A.8, 2002), 311 F.3d 875, 878; <em>Spaziano v. Singletary </em>(C.A.11, 1994), 36 F.3d 1028, 1039; <em>Fretwell v. State </em>(1987), 292 Ark. 96, 728 S.W.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 51} Second, Hutton contends that, had counsel raised the <em>DePew </em>issue in the court of appeals, this court \u201cwould have had to reverse [his] death sentence.\u201d On the contrary, we find it unlikely that a <em>DePew </em>claim would have succeeded. We have never reversed a death sentence on the ground that the trial court gave the jury an instruction that neutrally listed all statutory mitigating factors, even though the list included factors on which the defense had not presented evidence or argument. Such errors have consistently been held either harmless or not plain error. See <em>State v. Benge </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 661 N.E.2d 1019; <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 481, 620 N.E.2d 50; <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 62, 549 N.E.2d 491; <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 39, 544 N.E.2d 895; <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 317, 533 N.E.2d 701. Thus, no reasonable likelihood exists that Hutton would have prevailed on the <em>DePew </em>issue had his counsel raised it in <em>Hutton I. </em>Part A of Hutton\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">b. Failure to Define \u201cAggravating Circumstances\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 52} In the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury: \u201cThe prosecution has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>circumstances, of which the Defendant was found guilty, outweigh the factors in mitigation * * The instructions further told the jury to recommend a death sentence \u201cif you unanimously * * * find proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d However, the trial court neglected to inform the jury that the term \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d meant the specifications of which Hutton had been found guilty in the guilt phase. Defense trial counsel did not object to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 53} Hutton\u2019s appellate counsel in <em>Hutton I </em>did not raise the issue of the trial court\u2019s failure to define \u201caggravating circumstances.\u201d In part B of his first proposition of law, Hutton now contends that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 54} However, because defense trial counsel had not objected to the instructions at trial, any error was waived. Having been waived, the error could not serve as a basis for reversal unless it met the strict standard for plain error. See, generally, <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804; <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. Because the issue had been waived at trial, appellate counsel could reasonably decide not to try to raise it in the court of appeals. See <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 29, 716 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 55} Appellate counsel need not raise every possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 750-753, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987. \u201cNotwithstanding <em>Barnes, </em>it is still possible to bring a <em>Strickland </em>claim based on counsel\u2019s failure to raise a particular claim, but it is difficult to demonstrate that counsel was incompetent. See, <em>e.g., Gray v. Greer, </em>800 F.2d 644, 646 (C.A.7 1986) (\u2018Generally, only when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented, will the presumption of effective assistance of counsel be overcome\u2019).\u201d <em>Smith v. Robbins </em>(2000), 528 U.S. 259, 288, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 56} Failure to raise the waived instructional issue was not deficient performance constituting ineffective assistance. Part B of Hutton\u2019s first proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">c. Trial Counsel\u2019s Failure to Object</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">{\u00b6 57} Although the <em>DePew </em>error and the trial court\u2019s instructional error were waived by trial counsel, Hutton\u2019s appellate counsel could have argued on appeal that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to these errors amounted to ineffective assistance. In part C of his first proposition of law, Hutton argues that his appellate counsel were ineffective because they failed to raise the issue of trial counsel\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>{\u00b6 58} With respect to the <em>DePew </em>error, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue. As noted supra, <em>DePew </em>was not decided until August 31, 1988, and therefore was not available to tidal counsel as precedent. For the reasons discussed earlier, prejudice is also absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 59} Hutton argues that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to assert trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to define \u201caggravating factors\u201d for the jury. However, we do not find that this issue was \u201cclearly stronger,\u201d <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. at 288,120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756, than the issues Hutton\u2019s appellate counsel actually did present. Part C of Hutton\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">B. Cross-Appeal <em>(Hutton IP)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 60} In part D of his first proposition of law, Hutton contends that his counsel before this court in <em>Hutton II </em>denied him effective assistance by misreading the court of appeals\u2019 opinion and thereby failing to raise certain issues before us on cross-appeal. See <em>Hutton II, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 44, 559 N.E.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 61} However, Hutton\u2019s appeal from the court of appeals to this court was not his first appeal, but his second. \u201cHaving no constitutional right to counsel on a second appeal, [Hutton] had no constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Buell </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 1211, 1212, 639 N.E.2d 110. Part D of Hutton\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">C. 1991 Decision on Remand to Court of Appeals <em>(Hutton HR</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">{\u00b6 62} In Part E of his first proposition of law, Hutton claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when the court of appeals considered his case on remand from this court in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">{\u00b6 63} Because the court of appeals in <em>Hutton I </em>reversed Hutton\u2019s convictions, that court did not perform an independent review of Hutton\u2019s death sentence. Therefore, when our decision in <em>Hutton II </em>reinstated his convictions, we remanded the cause to the court of appeals so that court could independently review the sentence, as was then required by R.C. 2929.05(A). See <em>Hutton II, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 50, 559 N.E.2d 432. No other issues remained for the court of appeals to determine on remand, inasmuch as the court of appeals had already addressed each of Hutton\u2019s assignments of error in <em>Hutton I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">{\u00b6 64} On November 2, 1990, Hutton filed a motion asking the court of appeals to appoint counsel. The court of appeals denied the motion without explanation on January 8, 1991. On January 17, 1991, the court of appeals announced its judgment in <em>Hutton III, </em>affirming the death sentence on independent review. On January 28, 1991, Hutton filed a motion for reconsideration. On February 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>1991, the court of appeals journalized its opinion in <em>Hutton III, </em>explaining its reasons for affirmance. See <em>Hutton III, </em>72 Ohio App.3d 348, 594 N.E.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 65} Hutton contends that when the court of appeals denied his motion for appointment of counsel, it denied him the assistance of counsel to which he was constitutionally entitled. Hutton contends that he was not represented by <em>any </em>counsel during the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 66} However, Hutton\u2019s claim is incorrect. The record shows that his motion for reconsideration, filed January 28, 1991, was signed by the same attorney who had represented him during both <em>Hutton I </em>and <em>Hutton II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 67} It is true that no brief was filed on Hutton\u2019s behalf during the remand. The court of appeals did not invite briefing by either party. But there was no need to do so, for both parties had already had a full opportunity to brief the issue of the appropriateness of the death sentence during the original <em>Hutton I </em>proceedings. Moreover, Hutton\u2019s counsel had taken that opportunity. In the <em>Hutton I </em>appellate brief of October 26, 1988, the third assignment of error read as follows: \u201cIN VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ART. I, \u00a7\u00a7 9 AND 16 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION, THE APPELLANT\u2019S SENTENCE OF DEATH IS INAPPROPRIATE AND DISPROPORTIONATE TO SIMILAR CASES.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 68} Since the parties had already briefed the sentencing issue once, there was no need for rebriefing or reargument. The record had not changed since <em>Hutton I. </em>The court of appeals could quite properly consider the case on the briefs that had already been filed. Part E of Hutton\u2019s first proposition therefore lacks merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">II. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">{\u00b6 69} In his second proposition of law, Hutton contends that the death sentence in this case is inappropriate. This claim invokes our duty of independent review under R.C. 2929.05. It is that task to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">{\u00b6 70} Under R.C. 2929.05(A), we independently review the death sentence in every capital case in which we find no reversible legal error on the capital conviction. We must determine whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, and whether the death sentence is proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">{\u00b6 71} Hutton was found guilty of two capital specifications. Under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), he was found guilty of engaging in a course of conduct involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>purposeful killing of Ricky Mitchell and the purposeful attempt to kill Samuel Simmons. Under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), he was found guilty of committing aggravated murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after the commission or attempted commission of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">{\u00b6 72} The evidence supports these findings. As we noted in <em>Hutton II:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cThe evidence * * * points ineluctably to Hutton as the murderer of Derek Mitchell. Hutton had a strong motive: revenge for the theft of the sewing machine and the money hidden therein. Hutton claimed to have been told by Evans that Mitchell had tried to sell Evans a sewing machine. Hutton accused Mitchell of \u2018breaking in my sister\u2019s house.\u2019 In response to Hutton\u2019s demands, Mitchell actually produced a sewing machine, which he turned over to Hutton. Finally, Hutton carried out his threat to shoot Simmons. On this record, it is clear that Hutton believed that Mitchell and Simmons stole his machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cHutton attempted to kill Simmons with a .22 caliber revolver. He also had a .22 caliber rifle in his car. Mitchell was killed with a .22 caliber weapon. Expert testimony established that Simmons could have been shot with the same gun. Eileen Sweeney corroborated Simmons\u2019s description of Hutton\u2019s pistol. Mitchell\u2019s corpse was found with a tire lying on it \u2014 a significant fact in light of the evidence that Hutton believed that Mitchell had stolen tires from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cHutton told Eileen Sweeney that \u2018Ricky wasn\u2019t coming back,\u2019 and she should \u2018forget about him.\u2019 These statements clearly show that Hutton knew Mitchell was dead. He later informed her that \u2018if * * * [she] told[,] someone would be looking for * * * [her].\u2019 This threat indicates consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cEvents confirmed Hutton\u2019s statement that Mitchell \u2018wasn\u2019t coming back.\u2019 Eileen Sweeney * * * never saw Mitchell again after he left her at the hospital. This was unusual, since Sweeney testified that, during their three-year cohabitation, Mitchell \u2018[v]ery seldom\u2019 failed to spend the night at their apartment and never left home without telling her.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cThe evidence that the murder was committed with prior calculation and design is, if anything, stronger. Mitchell was shot at least twice, once in the head and once in the chest. * * * When this is added to Hutton\u2019s repeated threats against Mitchell\u2019s life, a rational trier of fact could hardly fail to find prior calculation and design.\u201d 53 Ohio St.3d at 41, 559 N.E.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 78} Moreover, Simmons\u2019s testimony that Hutton shot him twice in the head from behind supports the jury\u2019s finding of guilty on the course-of-conduct specification. Finally, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of kidnapping. <em>Hutton II, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 41, 559 N.E.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 79} The only evidence offered by Hutton in the penalty phase was his unsworn statement, in which he professed his innocence, and the presentence investigation report and psychological examination requested by the defense pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). The only mitigating factor expressly offered by Hutton at trial was residual doubt. That is not a valid mitigating factor. <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus. However, the trial record does disclose some other mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 80} <em>Provocation: </em>Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(2), we must consider \u201c[wjhether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed, but for the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 81} On the state\u2019s theory of the case, Hutton killed Mitchell and tried to kill Simmons because they stole money he needed to attend school. Hutton testified that his tuition for the automotive course was $9,700. He made a down payment of $1,500, had taken a $5,300 student loan, and was seeking a $2,200 grant from the state of Ohio. This left him $700 short,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which may explain why Hutton was so insistent on recovering the $750 hidden in the sewing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 82} Nevertheless, provocation deserves very little weight as a mitigating factor. Hutton committed the murder with prior calculation and design; the jury so found by returning a guilty verdict on the first count of the indictment. Moreover, Mitchell\u2019s murder occurred some length of time after the alleged theft that may have provoked it. Hutton clearly had time to cool off before resorting to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">{\u00b6 83} <em>Degree of participation: </em>Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(6), mitigation exists \u201c[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender, the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and the degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the acts which led to the death of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 84} The jury did not make any finding in this case that Hutton was the principal offender. The felony-murder specification alleged, in the alternative, that Hutton \u201ceither * * * was the principal offender in the commission of the Aggravated Murder, or, if not the principal offender, committed the Aggravated Murder with prior calculation and design.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The verdict form for this specification was also phrased in the alternative. For this reason, the jury cannot be said to have found that Hutton was the principal offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Hence, we must examine \u201cthe degree of the offender\u2019s participation in the offense and * * * in the acts which led to the death of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 85} Although the record does not conclusively demonstrate that Hutton was the actual killer, Hutton did instigate Mitchell\u2019s murder. Moreover, he played the leading role in that offense. Hutton was driving the car and did almost all of the talking. Hutton was the one who had a motive to kill Simmons and Mitchell, he was the one who had threatened their lives, and he was the one who shot Simmons. Accordingly, we give the (B)(6) factor little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 86} <em>Other factors: </em>Hutton voluntarily returned from Indianapolis and surrendered to Detective Moore. We give some weight to this fact as mitigation under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7): \u201cAny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 87} <em>History, character, and background: </em>Hutton was born on October 28, 1953. The presentence investigation report shows that his father died in 1963, when Hutton was still a child. Although it is not clear whether Hutton\u2019s mother and father were ever divorced, Hutton\u2019s mother remarried in 1960. However, her second husband abandoned the family in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 88} Hutton was self-employed as an automotive mechanic. Before he surrendered to Detective Moore, he was taking courses in that field at Lincoln Technical Institute. He testified in the guilt phase that he had also been employed as a security guard and had completed a six-week, 120-hour course of \u201csecurity [and] private police training\u201d at Case Western Reserve University. He had also been on general relief and food stamps \u201coff and on\u201d since 1981, and he admitted that he had never reported his income from repairing cars to the welfare authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 89} There was also guilt-phase testimony about Hutton\u2019s good reputation. Samuel Simmons Sr., the father of victim Samuel Simmons Jr., testified in the guilt phase that Hutton had a \u201c[v]ery good\u201d reputation for truthfulness. Simmons Sr. also testified that he \u201cwould put [his] life in [Hutton\u2019s] hands any day.\u201d We give some mitigating weight to Hutton\u2019s history, character, and background.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">{\u00b6 90} <em>Nature and circumstances of the offense: </em>Nothing mitigating appears in the nature and circumstances of the offense. The murder of Derek Mitchell was characterized by treachery and deceit. After he shot Simmons from behind, Hutton used Simmons\u2019s shooting to lure Mitchell to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">{\u00b6 91} Although Hutton\u2019s voluntary surrender and his history, character, and background are entitled to some weight in mitigation, the aggravating circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>stances here are extremely grave. In this case, we find that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) multiple-murder aggravating circumstance carries great weight in aggravation. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 48, 58, 765 N.E.2d 334. The R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) aggravating circumstance in this case consists of a calculated murder set up by a treacherous kidnapping. We find that these aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors in this case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Proportionality Review</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 92} In his third proposition of law, Hutton contends that the death sentence in this case is \u201cexcessive and disproportionate\u201d to sentences in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 93} Hutton claims that one \u201csimilar case\u201d we should consider is the case of Hutton\u2019s co-defendant, Bruce Laster. According to the parties, Laster pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 7 to 25 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hutton argues that, because there was no proof of who actually shot Mitchell, it cannot be justified to sentence Hutton to death when Laster received a sentence of only 7 to 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 94} However, we find that Laster\u2019s case is not a \u201csimilar case\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2929.04. Laster was not convicted of aggravated murder, nor did he receive a death sentence. See <em>Gillard, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 558, 679 N.E.2d 276; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 95} The death sentence in this case is proportionate to death sentences we have approved in similar cases with specifications under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and (A)(7). See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568; <em>State v. Dickerson </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 206, 543 N.E.2d 1250; <em>State v.
