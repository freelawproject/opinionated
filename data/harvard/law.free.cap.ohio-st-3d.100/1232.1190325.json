Stead, seeking the disqualification of Judge Deborah P. O\u2019Neill from participating in the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 2} The underlying case is a death penalty case and affiant is one of two assistant Franklin County prosecutors assigned to the case. Defendant Gerald L. Brown has waived his right to a jury trial and will be tried before a three-judge panel; Judge O\u2019Neill was randomly chosen as one of the three. The other two judges are Judge David Cain, presiding judge, and Judge Patrick McGrath.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 3} Affiant makes two arguments in support of his claim that Judge O\u2019Neill should be disqualified. First, affiant states that in 1993, he \u201cmade her aware\u201d of conduct that led to disciplinary charges against her, and that she told affiant \u201cto never appear in her courtroom again.\u201d Affiant states that since 1993, he has removed himself from any case assigned to Judge O\u2019Neill, and that he was a \u201ckey witness\u201d in the 1996 disciplinary proceeding against Judge O\u2019Neill. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 1425, 667 N.E.2d 27 (hereafter \u201cthe 1996 disciplinary proceeding\u201d). Affiant claims that the state will be prejudiced if he removes himself from the underlying case because there is insufficient time for him to be replaced by another assistant prosecutor, or if Judge O\u2019Neill is on the panel that hears the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 4} Affiant\u2019s second argument in support of his request for disqualification concerns a now-pending disciplinary proceeding against Judge O\u2019Neill, <em>In re Complaint Against O\u2019Neill </em>(2002), case No. 02-34, Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (hereafter \u201cthe 2002 disciplinary proceeding\u201d). Affiant\u2019s argument is that in connection with that proceeding, Judge O\u2019Neill has made statements about other judges, particularly Judge Cain, which create \u201can appearance of impropriety that cannot be overcome and which prejudices the state.\u201d Affiant refers to statements by Judge O\u2019Neill in her formal response to the disciplinary complaint, including:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c \u2018The Complaint is a compilation of grievances solicited and asserted by Judges * * * Patrick M. McGrath, David Cain. * * *\u2019 \u201d (Judge Deborah P. O\u2019Neill\u2019s Response to Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s Complaint, July 8, 2002, hereafter \u201cResponse\u201d at 3, \u00b6 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c \u2018The unfortunate lack of collegiality felt by Judge Cain who is the chief author of the allegations and the incumbent who apparently has not forgotten his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>defeat by Judge O\u2019Neill in the 1992 election is reflected in the facts pertinent to these allegations.\u2019 \u201d (Summary Response at 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c \u2018While this event, like others raised in the Complaint, does not involve any issue of judicial ethics as it relates to Judge O\u2019Neill, it does reflect that hostility from Judge Cain that has poisoned the atmosphere in which Judge O\u2019Neill has been required to perform her judicial duties, divided the Court and engendered the allegations currently before this Board.\u2019 \u201d (Summary Response at 137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c \u2018It is well known among Courthouse circle [sic] the animosity Judge Cain harbors against Judge O\u2019Neill. * * * Since 1992, Judge Cain has filed a number of groundless disciplinary grievances against Judge O\u2019Neill all of which have been dismissed.\u2019 \u201d (Response at 202, \u00b6 472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 9} In her response to this affidavit of disqualification, Judge O\u2019Neill claims that affiant was not a \u201ckey\u201d witness in the 1996 disciplinary proceeding but merely one of many. She states that it has been affiant\u2019s voluntary decision since 1993 not to appear before her, and claims that she has tried to \u201copen the lines of communication\u201d with affiant over the years but that her overtures have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 10} Second, Judge O\u2019Neill claims that she discussed this matter with the Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O\u2019Brien and Franklin County Common Pleas Court Administrative Judge Michael Watson and that neither has asked her to recuse. She states that neither of the other two judges who will sit on the three-judge panel in the underlying case, Judges Cain and McGrath, has expressed to her any reservations about her serving on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 11} Judge O\u2019Neill states that affiant is not involved in any way in the pending disciplinary complaint and that the 1996 disciplinary proceeding in which affiant was a witness resulted in the dismissal of all charges. Judge O\u2019Neill claims that the Disciplinary Counsel and Special Counsel who prosecuted the 1996 disciplinary proceeding against her and are now in the private practice of law have since practiced before her and neither has sought her recusal or disqualification. She views affiant\u2019s concerns as his own \u201cpersonal animosity\u201d and not an issue for the prosecutor\u2019s office or the victim\u2019s family, and argues that affiant has not shown sufficient cause to overcome the presumption that a judge will act fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 12} I have thoroughly reviewed the record before me and I am familiar with the complaint and Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s response in the pending disciplinary proceedings. Even if it is assumed that affiant has a legitimate reason for personally not wanting to appear before Judge O\u2019Neill, a replacement prosecutor could be assigned, instead of disqualifying an elected, randomly assigned judge. There is a second prosecutor assigned to this case and affiant does not claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>second prosecutor is incapable of trying the case, or that the prosecutor\u2019s office does not have someone who can replace affiant. The prosecutor\u2019s office has not claimed that Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s participation will prejudice the state or create an appearance of impropriety; only affiant, who is one of many assistant prosecutors and one of two who will try the underlying case, makes this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">{\u00b6 13} If this affidavit of disqualification is denied, Judge O\u2019Neill will be only one of three judges who hear the case, and she will not be the presiding judge. It is noted that the 1996 disciplinary complaint was dismissed by a five-judge panel at the conclusion of the relator\u2019s case. Affiant has not suggested that Judge O\u2019Neill will make decisions adverse to the state because affiant is counsel. Affiant has not even suggested that Judge O\u2019Neill will be hostile to him personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 14} The term \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d \u201cimplies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191. In his affidavit, the affiant has made no claim that Judge O\u2019Neill has a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d or that Judge O\u2019Neill does not have \u201can open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts\u201d that will prejudice the state in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 15} The disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. <em>In re Disqualification of Hunter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 607, 522 N.E.2d 461. A judge is presumed to follow the law and is presumed not to be biased:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018Bias or prejudice on the part of a judge will not be presumed. In fact, the law presumes that a judge is unbiased and unprejudiced in the matters over which he presides, and bias or prejudice must be strong enough to overcome the presumption of his integrity.\u2019 \u201d 48 A Corpus Juris Secundum (1981) 731, Judges, Section 108, quoted in <em>State v. Baker </em>(1984), 25 Ohio Misc.2d 11, 12, 25 OBR 232, 495 N.E.2d 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 17} The appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions. <em>In re Disqualification of Olivito </em>(1994), 74 Ohio St.3d 1261, 657 N.E.2d 1361. There is no evidence in the record before me to suggest that either the 1996 disciplinary proceeding or the 2002 disciplinary proceeding \u201chas affected or would affect the conduct\u201d of Judge O\u2019Neill in the underlying case. <em>In re Disqualification of Kilpatrick </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 18} I have held that a unique combination of factors, particularly those arising from a pending disciplinary matter, can be sufficient to create an appearance of impropriety that mandates a judge\u2019s disqualification. See <em>In re Disqualification of Maschari </em>(1999), <em>88 </em>Ohio St.3d 1212, 723 N.E.2d 1101; <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number><em>Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1226, 2002-Ohio-7476, 798 N.E.2d 12; <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1228, 2002-Ohio-7477, 798 N.E.2d 13. However, on the record before me, I do not find that the allegations of bias or prejudice are sufficient to warrant disqualification of Judge O\u2019Neill, nor do I find that Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s participation in the underlying case creates an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 19} For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. Judge O\u2019Neill may continue to participate in the underlying case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
