Allegations of racial bias are among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>most serious and damaging claims that can be directed at a judge, since such allegations, if true, would not only constitute a violation of the judge\u2019s oath of office and the Code of Judicial Conduct, see R.C. 3.23 and Canon 3(B)(5) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, but also would strike at the very heart of the integrity of the judiciary. In order to warrant a judge\u2019s disqualification, these claims must be demonstrated by clear evidence that establishes the existence of bias. Here, affiant provides no evidence, beyond speculation, to support his assertions that Judge Cunningham\u2019s decisions are the product of bias and prejudice, racial or otherwise. Indeed, affiant asserts that he \u201ccannot say for certain if Judge Cunningham is using my race in making her decision.\u201d Moreover, affiant\u2019s apparent attempt in the opening paragraph of his affidavit to mischaracterize or misidentify the racial and professional background of his former wife casts serious doubt on the truthfulness of the balance of his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">{\u00b6 3} In view of affiant\u2019s failure to present clear evidence of bias on the part of Judge Cunningham, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Cunningham.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
