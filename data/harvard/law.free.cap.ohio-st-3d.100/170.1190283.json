Morris, of two counts of rape and one count of kidnapping and sentenced him to prison. The common pleas court also classified Morris as a sexual predator. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>State v. Morris </em>(May 5, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APA07-897, 1998 WL 226933, appeal not allowed (2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 1426, 755 N.E.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2003, Morris filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Warren County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel his prison warden, appellee, Anthony Brigano, to release him from prison. Morris claimed that in his criminal trial, the state had failed to present sufficient evidence to support his convictions. Brigano moved to dismiss the petition. On May 14, 2003, the court of appeals granted Brigano\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 3} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. \u201cHabeas corpus will not issue to raise claims of insufficiency of evidence * * <em>State ex rel Bruggeman v.
