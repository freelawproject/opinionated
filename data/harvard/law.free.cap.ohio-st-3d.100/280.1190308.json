In a complaint filed April 8, 2002, relator, Office of Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with professional misconduct committed while respondent pursued at least 20 lawsuits on behalf of several clients embroiled in disputes stemming mainly from their plans to develop property. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court (\u201cboard\u201d) heard the cause and made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation. The panel\u2019s findings of fact as to the underlying misconduct are based principally on the parties\u2019 stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 2} In December 1993, respondent agreed to represent Dr. John Master, an elderly, retired physician, and John H. Nix, who had befriended Master through his acquaintance with Master\u2019s housekeeper. Master, who lived in an established Cleveland neighborhood, had no children and had lost his wife, Dr. Anne Master, in 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By the end of 1993, Nix had moved into Master\u2019s home and had formed a partnership between them and the housekeeper, to which Master had conveyed all of his real property, which included eight parcels adjacent to Master\u2019s home that the partnership planned to develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent had previously performed legal work for Nix, and Nix sought respondent\u2019s services again after Patrick J. O\u2019Malley, who served on Cleveland City Council representing the ward in which the partnership property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>located, declined Nix\u2019s request for support of a tax-abatement plan to aid the development. Nix also knew that some neighboring residents opposed the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 4} Apparently some of these residents had also consulted O\u2019Malley to voice their concerns about the development, including the possibility that Master was incompetent and being exploited by Nix. Respondent claims that O\u2019Malley asked the Cleveland police to investigate Master\u2019s household, a course of action police abandoned after Master appeared to be in sound mental health. A probate court investigator also found no reason to pursue proceedings for Master\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 5} On or about December 12, 1993, various residents met in the home of Jack and Carole Sword, who lived across the street from the Master residence. O\u2019Malley also attended the residents\u2019 meeting, to which neither Master nor Nix was invited. Events before and during this meeting would later be the subject of considerable controversy and, under respondent\u2019s direction, much litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 6} Also in late 1993, Nix apparently asked the FBI to investigate the disappearance of bearer bonds that had belonged to Master\u2019s wife. The bearer bonds had disappeared while attorney Paul P. Chalko, who would later oversee the administration of the wife\u2019s estate, represented the couple. Respondent\u2019s efforts to. recover the missing bearer bonds also generated much litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 7} In January 1994, respondent filed a lawsuit against the Swords on behalf of Master and Nix, asserting claims for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The complaint included the allegations that (1) the Swords had informed O\u2019Malley that Nix was attempting to defraud Master of his assets and (2) at the December 12, 1993 meeting, the Swords had told attendees that Master was incompetent and that Nix was defrauding him. Respondent deposed 13 people, including the Swords and other residents of the neighborhood, during discovery. All failed to confirm the allegations of defamation, and the trial court granted summary judgment for the Swords. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court, notwithstanding respondent\u2019s contention that issues of credibility requiring a trial remained. See <em>Master v. Sword </em>(Nov. 9, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 68297, 1995 WL 662108.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 8} In early January 1994, Dr. Anne Master\u2019s grandniece, Cleveland police officer Sue Sazima, contacted Chalko and asked him to apply in probate court for her appointment as Master\u2019s guardian. Represented by another attorney, Master filed an application to have Nix appointed as his conservator. Sazima ultimately withdrew her request for guardianship, and the court appointed Nix as conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 9} Then, in February and March 1994, one or more individuals intercepted and taped telephone conversations made from or received by the Master/Nix residence. The interceptor(s) acted without a warrant and without the consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the parties to the conversations. In late March 1994, Nix obtained four cassette tapes containing recordings of these conversations. The interceptions resulted in a series of lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">{\u00b6 10} In April 1994, respondent filed a lawsuit in federal district court on behalf of Master, Nix, and others whose communications were intercepted (\u201cthe first wiretapping case\u201d). The complaint alleged that the Swords, O\u2019Malley, and Sazima, among others, engaged in illegal wiretapping, conspiracy to invade privacy, conspiracy to conceal wiretapping, and intentional infliction of emotional distress in an effort to block the partnership\u2019s development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 11} In June 1994, respondent filed a lawsuit for Master and Nix against Chalko, claiming that he had committed malpractice by negligently failing to pursue the recovery of the bearer bonds (\u201cthe first malpractice suit\u201d). Respondent later amended the complaint to also name Sazima, alleging that she (1) had conspired with Chalko to have herself appointed Master\u2019s guardian in an effort to gain control over his assets and (2) had tortiously interfered with the attorney-client relationship between Master and his former attorney. The court denied Sazima\u2019s motion to dismiss but also dismissed the claim concerning recovery of the bearer bonds, finding the claim improper in a malpractice action. At trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sazima invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during cross-examination, and the court directed the jury\u2019s verdict in her favor. The jury returned a verdict against Chalko for $300 in compensatory and $30,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent did not appeal the directed verdict against Sazima, and years later, the verdict against Chalko was reversed. See <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(June 5, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70527, 1997 WL 298260. Sazima, however, filed a motion under R.C. 2323.51 for attorney fees as sanctions for frivolous conduct. Respondent opposed the motion, but further proceedings were apparently stayed pending Chalko\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 13} In November 1994, after filing lawsuits in state and federal courts against the Swords, O\u2019Malley, and Sazima, respondent filed on behalf of Nix and Master a complaint for declaratory judgment against these individuals and their insurance carriers: Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Allstate Insurance Company, and State Farm Insurance Company. Respondent asked the trial court to declare that the defendants\u2019 insurance companies had no duty to defend these insureds under their homeowner\u2019s policies and cited precedent from which he argued that his clients had standing, even as third parties, to pursue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>declaratory judgment. The trial court held, and the court of appeals affirmed, that respondent\u2019s clients lacked such standing, that there could be no discovery of the insurance companies\u2019 files prior to a ruling on a motion to dismiss, and that an insurance company must provide a defense if the claims are potentially or arguably -within the policy coverage. See <em>Master v. O\u2019Malley </em>(Apr. 4, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 68895, 1996 WL 157340.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">{\u00b6 14} In April 1995, respondent filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of Master\u2019s accountant, alleging that the Swords, O\u2019Malley, and Sazima, among others, conspired to wiretap Nix\u2019s telephone and to use the information gained from the interception to block the partnership\u2019s proposed housing development (\u201cthe second wiretapping case\u201d). This suit alleged not only that the defendants had intercepted the telephone communications, but also that they 'had illegally used and disclosed the contents of the communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 15} Thereafter, O\u2019Malley retained the law firm of Weston Hurd, Fallon, Paisley &amp; Howley, L.L.P. (\u201cWeston Hurd\u201d), to defend him against the allegations in the two wiretapping cases. O\u2019Malley denied involvement in any conspiracy or wiretapping but admitted that he had heard portions of a recording that probably contained the intercepted communications. In November 1995, Weston Hurd filed in the wiretapping cases affidavits to support motions for summary judgment. O\u2019Malley purportedly disclosed in these affidavits certain contents of the intercepted communications. For the purpose of the disciplinary proceedings, relator and respondent stipulated that these disclosures, if made with knowledge or reason to believe that said tapes had been illegally made, violated Ohio and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 16} In December 1995, respondent initiated another lawsuit against Chalko on behalf of Master and Nix. This action (\u201cthe second malpractice suit\u201d) claimed that Chalko should have attempted to recover the missing bearer bonds. The trial court granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs in the second malpractice case for the reason, among others, that Chalko had not been asked to recover the bonds and, therefore, owed no such duty to Master. The trial court\u2019s judgment was affirmed on appeal. See <em>Nix v. Chalko </em>(Feb. 19, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 72023, 1998 WL 72495.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 17} On December 27, 1995, soon after he filed the second malpractice case, respondent filed yet another suit on Nix\u2019s behalf, this one against O\u2019Malley and Weston Hurd. The suit, which was later removed to federal district court on the basis of a RICO claim, contained three counts: (1) the defendants had violated Ohio and federal wiretap statutes by using and disclosing the contents of the intercepted conversations; (2) the defendants had conspired to aid and abet others in the concealment of the wiretapping and had withheld unprivileged statements about the wiretapping to avoid civil and criminal liability; and (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>law firm had committed \u201clegal malpractice,\u201d notwithstanding that the law firm had never represented the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 18} The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on all counts. On appeal, however, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. In reversing, the court of appeals found that the first count presented a genuine issue of material fact. See <em>Nix v. O\u2019Malley </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 160 F.3d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent also attempted to instigate various criminal or disciplinary proceedings. In May 1994, he sent a letter asking the Cleveland Police Department to internally investigate allegations that Sazima had illegally accessed a police computer. The police department conducted an investigation and presented the results to the Cleveland City Prosecutor. In January 1995, the city prosecutor concluded that there was not probable cause to believe that Sazima had committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 20} In March 1995, also at respondent\u2019s urging, Cleveland police investigated allegations that Sazima had participated in illegal wiretapping of respondent\u2019s clients. And in June 1995, respondent wrote a letter to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor asking for felony indictments against various individuals whom he alleged to be responsible for the wiretapping of his clients\u2019 telephone conversations, the illegal use and/or disclosure of the tapes, and/or a cover-up of these crimes. Respondent accused Sazima, other members of the police force, Chalko, O\u2019Malley, and neighborhood residents, including the Swords, among others. No indictments resulted from the allegations in respondent\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, in May 1995, respondent, acting on behalf of Master, Nix, and Master\u2019s probate attorney, accountant, and former housekeeper, submitted a public records request for documents compiled during the police department\u2019s investigation of Sazima. And in June 1995, acting on behalf of the same clients, respondent filed an action in this court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the city prosecutor to investigate the alleged misconduct of Sazima and other city employees and to compel the police department and the city of Cleveland to allow the inspection and copying of the records requested in the May 1995 public records request. The complaint further requested a writ ordering appointment of a special prosecutor to \u201cinvestigate and prosecute the wiretappers, and those who have concealed the wiretapping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 23, 661 N.E.2d 180, we held that Master and Nix were not entitled to the requested writ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>However, we ordered the city to submit the subject records for review under seal to permit us to determine the applicability of the uncharged-suspects exception of Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 23} Thereafter, in <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 340, 342, 667 N.E.2d 974, we examined the records submitted by the city and, for the limited purpose of that case, observed that \u201csome person or persons purposely intercepted and recorded * * * Nix and Master\u2019s cordless telephone conversations through the use of some interception device. The foregoing constitutes a violation of R.C. 2933.52(A).\u201d We concluded, however, that the records were exempt from disclosure under the work-product, uncharged-suspect, and other-law provisions of Ohio\u2019s public records laws. We also concluded that \u201c[t]he records do not indicate any policy cover-up or fictitious investigation, as relators have alleged. Instead, the sealed investigatory file indicates a thorough investigation by law enforcement officials.\u201d Id. at 343-344, 667 N.E.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 24} On December 19, 1995, respondent filed still another suit for Nix, this time against Nancy Schuster and Schuster <em>&amp; </em>Simmons Co., L.P.A., Sazima\u2019s attorneys in the first malpractice case. This complaint alleged, among other claims, that Schuster had violated state and federal wiretapping laws during that proceeding. As to the disposition of this case, the stipulations before the panel indicate only that \u201c[t]he case was removed to federal court, remanded to the state court, and refiled on June 24, 1996 [with a different case number]. The trial court denied two dispositive motions as to one cause of action filed by Schuster and then, on the morning of trial, granted a defense motion in limine which resulted in a voluntary dismissal without prejudice by respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 25} In August 1997, again for Nix, respondent filed a second public records request asking for voluminous materials pertaining to the wiretapping and to O\u2019Malley that were alleged to be in the city of Cleveland\u2019s possession. After the city responded to the request, respondent filed another writ of mandamus in this court. Concluding that the requests for records were largely meritless, we noted that the requests were moot insofar as they requested access to records already provided, that some of the requested records were subject to the attorney-client privilege, and that the other records were exempt from disclosure as trial-preparation records. <em>State ex rel. Nix v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 379, 700 N.E.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 26} In December 1998, respondent filed a lawsuit on Nix\u2019s behalf against O\u2019Malley, Weston Hurd, and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and its counsel. This complaint asserted claims of civil conspiracy to conceal criminal conduct, conspiracy to defraud Nix, a state RICO claim, and legal malpractice as to one of the insurance company\u2019s attorneys. In particular, the lawsuit alleged that newly discovered evidence revealed that O\u2019Malley had made false statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>in his affidavits and prior statements; that O\u2019Malley was involved in the wiretapping; and that Nationwide and its counsel had assisted O\u2019Malley and Weston Hurd in concealing evidence of O\u2019Malley\u2019s involvement in the wiretapping. The trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the defendants in this case was also affirmed on appeal. <em>Nix v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Mar. 27, 2000), Stark App. No. 1999CA00176.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 27} Then, on February 3, 1999, after a long delay and a series of hearings commencing on July 6, 1998, the trial court granted Sazima\u2019s motion for sanctions in the amount of $78,504.71. According to the trial court\u2019s decision, the amount represented Sazima\u2019s legal fees incurred in the first malpractice case and in prosecuting her frivolous-conduct action. The trial court held that respondent, respondent\u2019s law practice, Nix in his individual capacity, Master\u2019s estate, and Nix as executor were jointly and severally responsible for paying Sazima\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 28} Before Sazima was granted attorney fees, respondent sued the trial court itself. In the Eighth District Court of Appeals, respondent requested a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition to prevent the judge from hearing the motion for sanctions. Rejecting respondent\u2019s request, the court of appeals held that respondent and Nix had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. See <em>State ex rel. Nix v. Curran </em>(Sept. 23, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 75261, 1998 WL 685384.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 29} While the trial court was considering Sazima\u2019s motion for sanctions, respondent filed an affidavit of bias and prejudice against the trial judge. This court rejected respondent\u2019s allegations of bias and declined any disqualification. <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(Oct. 31, 1998), Supreme Court of Ohio No. 98-AP-125.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 30} Undeterred, respondent and Nix appealed from the ordered sanctions and determination that they had violated R.C. 2323.51. The court of appeals affirmed, concluding that respondent, in particular, had exhibited \u201cextreme bad faith,\u201d had \u201cimproperly directly contacted [Sazima\u2019s] insurers in an attempt to deprive her of coverage\u201d to try to intimidate and harass her, had \u201cpursued litigation against [Sazima] in an abusive and vexatious manner,\u201d and had gone \u201cfar beyond\u201d zealous advocacy. <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(May 11, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75973, 2000 WL 573200. We dismissed sua sponte respondent\u2019s request for discretionary review. <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1428, 736 N.E.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 31} The panel incorporated information from the following stipulations as part of its findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c52. During the course of litigation that respondent filed on behalf of [Master and Nix], respondent telephoned and/or wrote to insurance companies in order to persuade potential insurers against affording Sazima, O\u2019Malley, and others a defense and/or indemnity protection. Respondent also asked that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Sazima be forced to repay her insurers for any legal sums expended in her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c53. During the course of the litigation that respondent filed on behalf of [Master and Nix], respondent took numerous depositions of parties and witnesses. At the depositions, respondent asked questions designed to elicit answers constituting inadmissible evidence. As the lawsuits progressed, respondent\u2019s conduct made it necessary for the parties to conduct depositions in the presence of a magistrate or judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c54. On more than one occasion, respondent asked Cuyahoga County and city of Cleveland prosecutors to file criminal charges against opposing counsel. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c55. Respondent accused Sazima of being a corrupt police officer in a written communication to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c56. After he sued Attorney Nancy Schuster, respondent made several attempts to deny her malpractice coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c57. [Respondent filed] approximately 20 state and federal lawsuits instituted * * * against various parties, including Sazima and arising out of Nix\u2019s relationship with [Master],</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c58. Sazima, O\u2019Malley, Sword and others were forced to expend inordinate time, money, and effort to defend against the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c59. No one has been charged with a crime in connection with the wiretapping allegations set forth by respondent on behalf of Nix, [Master], and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c60. The FBI completed its investigation * * * in connection with the bearer bonds that originally belonged to [Master\u2019s wife]. Evidence compiled by the FBI was presented to an Assistant United States Attorney. [No one was] charged with a crime in connection with the bearer bonds. [The FBI was able to recover approximately half of the bearer bonds at issue.]</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c61. In or about July 2000, all of the then-pending lawsuits filed by respondent on behalf of Nix and others as well as those filed by Nix, pro se, were dismissed under the terms of a global settlement agreement. Under the terms of the global settlement agreement, approximately 12 defendants including but not limited to Weston, Hurd; O\u2019Malley; * * * and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., agreed to pay $61,000 to Sazima to satisfy respondent\u2019s and, Nix\u2019s sanction award and to relinquish all claims they may have against inter alia respondent and Nix arising out of the wiretap litigation. In exchange, respondent agreed to dismiss with prejudice all pending claims against the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">{\u00b6 42} The panel found that respondent\u2019s conduct at issue in these proceedings violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(5) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>justice), 1-102(A)(6) (engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law), 7-102(A)(l) (taking legal action during representation that obviously serves to harass or maliciously injure another), 7-102(A)(2) (advancing a claim or defense that the attorney cannot in good faith assert is warranted under existing law, or the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law), 7-106(0(1) (while before a tribunal, stating or alluding to a matter that is not reasonably considered relevant or supportable by admissible evidence), and 7-106(0(2) (while before a tribunal, asking a question that is not reasonably considered relevant and is designed to degrade another).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 43} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel observed that respondent has been practicing law for 27 years without a previous disciplinary infraction. The panel also considered testimony that respondent has an established reputation for dedication and competence, particularly in real estate law. According to witnesses, respondent is considered by many in the legal community to be an extremely zealous and passionate advocate, having a history of representing clients in seemingly unpopular causes or where the clients\u2019 success appeared unlikely. This dedication was graphically manifested by respondent\u2019s having personally expended at least $225,000 of the $350,000 needed to fund the litigation underlying the charged misconduct. However, because respondent had \u201ccrossed the line\u201d between zealous, but principled, advocacy and the zealousness that \u201ccomes from personalizing the litigation,\u201d the panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one-year, with six months of this period stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 44} In objecting to the board\u2019s report, respondent concedes that he violated DR 1-102(A)(5), 7-102(A)(l), and 7-106(0(2), but insists that he did not violate DR 1-102(A)(6), 7-102(A)(2), and 7-106(0(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 45} As to the violation of DR 7-102(A)(2), we decline to find specifically unethical what respondent insists is creative precedent and argument to advance his clients\u2019 causes. It is true that various courts, including this one, have found his claims meritless and, at times, frustratingly repetitious. However, those findings do not necessarily mean that the arguments are so far-fetched that professional discipline is in order. Attorneys must be given rein to experiment in groundbreaking legal pursuits, and here, respondent researched and supplied precedent (however tenuous) for his controversial claims. We will not foreclose the assertion of novel legal theories through the disciplinary process unless they are absolutely specious. The alleged violation of DR 7-102(A)(2), therefore, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 46} However, we agree that respondent \u201ccrossed the line\u201d and thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), and 7-102(A)(l). Respondent\u2019s representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tion in the underlying cases became a personal crusade no longer driven by his clients\u2019 interests. Even respondent realizes now that he lost his objectivity. Thus, despite respondent\u2019s explanations for the claims and arguments he advanced throughout this ordeal and his assurance that he only sought justice for his clients, we view respondent\u2019s \u201czeal\u201d as blind determination to ruin those he seemed to consider his clients\u2019 oppressors. Drawing the same conclusion, the Eighth District Court of Appeals declared respondent \u201can obnoxious litigator bent on abusing the courts to further an illegitimate agenda.\u201d <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(May 11, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75973, 2000 WL 573200. That court provided these samples of his work when discussing his treatment of Sazima:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cDespite the fact that Mr. Nix and his attorneys have filed in excess of 20 lawsuits against an array of defendants arising out of the same series of transactions, and have accused literally dozens of people, including prominent public officials, of being involved in intricate and high-level conspiracies to loot the modest assets of the respective Masters\u2019 estates, they have repeatedly been stymied in their efforts to obtain judgments on these claims as they inevitably prove to be meritless after the courts are able to sift through the sensational allegations and examine the evidence. See <em>Master v. Sword </em>(Nov. 9, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 68297; <em>Master v. O\u2019Malley </em>(Apr. 4, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 68895; <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(June 5, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70527; <em>Nix v. Chalko </em>(Feb. 19, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 72023; <em>State v. Curran </em>(Sept. 23, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 75261.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe record is replete with evidence of malicious intent on the part of the appellants [respondent and Nix] during their pursuit of the instant litigation against the appellee [Sazima] so as to justify the imposition of sanctions under R.C. 2323.51. In a transparent effort to professionally embarrass the appellee, a Cleveland police officer, the appellants attempted to depose representatives of the Cleveland Police Department, the Civil Service Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Additionally, the appellants sought to depose [several high-ranking Cleveland officials, including the mayor]. There was not a shred of evidence presented at the sanctions hearing by the appellants which tended to indicate that any of these officials possessed any information that was in any manner relevant to the claims brought against the appellee. The appellants, in furtherance of their character assassination objectives, chose to write a letter to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor stating that the appellee was a \u2018dirty cop\u2019 and asking that she be criminally investigated. The appellants even filed a motion with the trial court asking that there be a \u2018referral\u2019 to the county prosecutor for the purposes of a criminal investigation. Once again, the appellants failed, throughout the entire course of this litigation, to either substantiate these charges or to demonstrate their relevance to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Master v. Chalko </em>(May 11, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75973, 2000 WL 573200.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b398-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Jonathan E.

Respondent does not contest that he at times posed irrelevant and disparaging questions, contrary to DR 7 \u2014 106(C)(2). Moreover, the parties stipulated, in effect, that at some point while representing Master and Nix, respondent so persistently asked for inadmissible information that further depositions required court supervision. Furthermore, we have before for us the transcripts from the hearing on Sazima\u2019s motion for sanctions, and they contain numerous examples of respondent\u2019s inappropriate inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 50} Respondent also argues that an actual suspension of any period is too severe in light of the mitigating factors and absence of many aggravating concerns. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. He also urges us to temper our disposition for the reason that his over-the-top zeal in the underlying proceedings was provoked by unique circumstances unlikely to recur. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Miller, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 500, 2002-Ohio-6729, 780 N.E.2d 586, \u00b6 14. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Donnell </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 501, 684 N.E.2d 36, however, we suspended an attorney\u2019s license for six months because he exceeded the bounds of zealous advocacy while representing himself in a custody dispute. Legal wrangling of the proportion in which respondent engaged requires a similar disciplinary sanction for the public\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 51} Accordingly, a suspension of one year, with six months stayed, is appropriate. Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, but six months of this sanction are stayed on the condition that he commit no further misconduct during that period. If respondent violates the condition of this stay, the stay will be lifted and respondent will serve the entire one-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
