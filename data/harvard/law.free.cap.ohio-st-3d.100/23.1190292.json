Witt, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>an industrial accident. Dissatisfied with the decision of appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio, she petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b132-11\">George S. Maley, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b132-12\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 2} The court of appeals referred the matter to a magistrate, who on March 15, 2002, issued a report recommending that the writ be denied. Thirty-four days later, appellant filed objections to that report. The commission responded with a motion to strike the objections as untimely and appellant made no reply. The court granted that motion and ultimately adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 3} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant\u2019s arguments derive directly from the conclusions of law provided in the magistrate\u2019s decision. Appellant, however, did not timely object to those conclusions as Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(a) requires. Thus, pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b) and <em>State ex rel. Booher v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 52, 723 N.E.2d 571, we can proceed no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 5} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
