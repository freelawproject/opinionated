Buckley, was injured in a work-related accident on July 4, 2001. The Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation allowed the claim in an order dated July 20, 2001. The order also set claimant\u2019s full weekly wage (\u201cFWW\u201d) and average weekly wage (\u201cAWW\u201d) at $96.87 and $29.31, respectively. These amounts were based on an employer earnings ledger submitted by claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">{\u00b6 2} The order also stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cBWC law requires a 14-day period for the injured worker or employer to appeal this order. However, if the injured worker and the employer agree with this decision, the 14-day appeal period may be waived by both parties submitting a waiver in writing to the listed BWC customer service office.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIf the injured worker or the employer disagree with this decision, either may file an appeal within 14-days of receipt of this order. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIF AN APPEAL IS NOT RECEIVED WITHIN 14-DAYS, THIS DECISION IS FINAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIf there are any questions concerning this claim, contact the claims service specialist at the listed BWC customer service office. However, a telephone call or other correspondence does not alter the need to file an appeal. Therefore, if you are not satisfied with this order, you must file an appeal within 14-days of receipt of this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">{\u00b6 7} Claimant did not appeal. Two months later, on September 21, 2001, claimant moved the bureau to reset her AWW under R.C. 4123.61\u2019s \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d provision. She resubmitted her wage information and also offered an affidavit attesting to her status as a full-time university student.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The bureau referred the matter to appellee, the Industrial Commission of Ohio, for hearing. The commission denied the motion, finding that recalculation was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 9} Claimant commenced a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, petitioning the court to order the commission to grant her motion. The court denied the writ after finding that claimant\u2019s failure to appeal the July 20, 2001 bureau order constituted a failure to pursue an available administrative remedy. A writ of mandamus was, therefore, unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 11} This case is not about res judicata and the invocation of the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52. It instead involves the effect of claimant\u2019s failure to appeal the July 20, 2001 bureau order that set her FWW and AWW, and, on this, <em>State ex rel. Leyendecker v. Duro Test Corp. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 237, 719 N.E.2d 528, is directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 12} As here, Leyendecker failed to appeal a bureau weekly wage order that contained a notice of appealability and finality similar to the one now before us. Later, claimant tried to have his AWW and FWW reset. The commission denied that request, and the court of appeals upheld that order. We, in turn, affirmed the court of appeals, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMandamus will not issue where the relator has a plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225. For this reason, the failure to pursue an adequate administrative remedy bars mandamus relief. <em>State ex rel. Reeves v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 212, 559 N.E.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cUnder R.C. 4123.511(B)(1), claimant could have appealed the bureau\u2019s order to a commission district hearing officer. The bureau\u2019s order, moreover, informed claimant, in highlighted language, of his right and responsibility to appeal if he was dissatisfied with the wage as set. Claimant chose not to appeal.\u201d Id. at 237-238, 719 N.E.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">{\u00b6 15} Claimant argues that consideration of this issue is inappropriate, claiming that the commission in its answer conceded the unavailability of an adequate remedy at law. This is an incorrect reading of the commission\u2019s answer. The commission admitted claimant\u2019s allegation that the <em>commission\u2019s </em>order denying claimant\u2019s September 21, 2001 motion was \u201cnot appealable into the Common Pleas Court under Ohio Revised Code 4123.519 and [claimant], therefore, has no adequate remedy at law.\u201d This is a true statement that required the commission\u2019s admission. It is not, however, a concession that claimant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>appeal the <em>bureau\u2019s </em>order was inconsequential to the issuance of a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b178-8\">Hochman <em>&amp; </em>Roach Co., L.P.A., Gary D.
