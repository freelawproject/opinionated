In one building, two cranes moved north-south along an approximately 600-foot track above blast furnaces. A walkway ran parallel to the path of the crane for its entire length. This walkway was designed to provide a constant means of exiting the crane in an emergency. The east side of the walkway was guarded. The west side \u2014 onto which the crane\u2019s cab door opened\u2014 was not, to allow the operator to step from the cab to the emergency walkway unimpeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">{\u00b6 2} Joseph Fadeley was operating one of those cranes on June 20, 1999. While the events of that night will never be fully known, coworkers indicated that Fadeley had complained of a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit in his crane earlier that shift. Shortly after 7:45 p.m., a fellow employee heard Fadeley\u2019s crane moving north, possibly to escape the heat and smoke from a ladle below. When Fadeley\u2019s crane later failed to respond to repeated requests for assistance, coworkers went to investigate and found Fadeley lying dead in a ladle, at least 80 feet below. All agree that Fadeley must have fallen from the unguarded side of the emergency walkway.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">{\u00b6 3} After decedent\u2019s death claim was allowed, his surviving spouse, Kimberly, appellant-claimant herein, filed for additional compensation, alleging violations of more than one specific safety requirement (\u201cVSSR\u201d). One of the violations asserted was of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D):</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c(D) Elevated platforms, runways and walkways.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>{\u00b6 5} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(1) Guarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(a) Elevated platforms, runways and walkways six feet or more above floor or ground level shall be guarded with standard railings and toeboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(b) When the requirement prescribed above would result in an impairment of the work being performed, alternative protection may be provided for employees. Such alternative protection shall provide safety equivalent to or greater than that required in paragraph (D)(1)(a) of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(4) Special purpose runways.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cRunways used exclusively for special purposes, such as oiling, shafting, or filling tank cars, may have the railing on one side omitted where operating conditions necessitate such omission, provided the falling hazard is minimized by using a runway of not less than eighteen inches wide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">{\u00b6 12} At a hearing of the Industrial Commission of Ohio, WTieeling-Pittsburgh argued that the walkway was a special-purpose walkway and that operating conditions necessitated omission of guarding on the walkway\u2019s west side. The claimant countered (1) that operating conditions did not necessitate omission of a guardrail, and (2) that the walkway was not used exclusively for a special purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">{\u00b6 13} The commission ruled in favor of the claimant. The commission found that operating conditions did not require omission of protection, based on Wflieeling-Pittsburgh\u2019s postaccident erection of a modified rail/gate system on the walkway\u2019s west side that did not interfere with the crane\u2019s operation. Consequently, it found that the exception of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D)(4) did not apply and that the open west side constituted a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">{\u00b6 14} Wheeling-Pittsburgh petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order and deny the award for a VSSR. The court of appeals granted the writ, guided by the principle that because awards for YSSRs are penalties, all reasonable doubts as to interpretation and application of specific safety requirements must be resolved in the employer\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216; <em>State ex rel. Carder v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 165,166-167, 761 N.E.2d 32. It held that (D)(4)\u2019s specification of \u201cthe railing\u201d as a potential obstruction meant the \u201cstandard railing\u201d required by Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-02(D)(1)(a) and defined by subsection (E). In other words, if operating conditions necessitated absence of the standard guard railing referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>to in (D)(1)(a), no more was required to establish the applicability of (D)(4)\u2019s special-purpose runway exception. Contrary to what the magistrate proposed, the employer did not have to show that operating conditions necessitated the absence of standard guard railing <em>and </em>any of the other forms of protection envisioned by Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D)(l)(b), such as the nonstandard railing ultimately installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals also ruled that once the exception applied, <em>no </em>form of protection was required as a substitute for the standard guard rail omitted from one side. It rejected the claimant\u2019s contention that alternative protection was still required. She now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 16} There are two issues: What does Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D)(4) require, and when does it apply? The claimant argues that protection was required on the walkway\u2019s open side because the (D)(4) exception did not apply. Alternatively, she contends that even if controlling, (D)(4) excuses only the standard guard railing required by 4121:l-5-02(D)(l)(a), not the alternative protection required by (D)(1)(b). We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 17} The first flaw in claimant\u2019s position derives from her second argument, which would in effect eliminate the (D)(4) exception or, at a minimum, render it redundant. If (D)(4) required alternative protection for a special-purpose walkway when a standard guard railing is impractical, then the effect of (D)(4) would be much the same as (D)(1)(a) and (b), and its inclusion would be redundant and pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 18} Such a reading also defies logic. The (D)(4) exception demands that the falling hazard be \u201cminimized\u201d by using a walkway at least 18 inches wide. If the claimant\u2019s interpretation is accepted, however, the falling hazard must be virtually eliminated, not merely minimized, by means equivalent to the standard railing, according to (D)(1)(b). Consequently, it makes no sense that the code\u2019s authors would require employers to minimize a nonexistent hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 19} The claimant\u2019s interpretation of (D)(4) is also undermined by the principle that specific safety requirements must contain \u201csuch lawful, specific and definite requirements or standards of conduct * * * which are of a character plainly to apprise an employer of his legal obligations toward his employees.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Holdosh v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 179, 36 O.O. 516, 78 N.E.2d 165, at syllabus. Nothing in Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D)(4) plainly apprises an employer that where a standard guard railing is impractical, alternative protection must be provided. Moreover, when viewed with the tenet that a specific safety requirement, being a penalty, must be strictly construed in the employer\u2019s favor, the claimant\u2019s reading of the (D)(4) exception cannot stand. <em>State ex rel. Burton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>{\u00b6 20} We find, therefore, that where operating conditions necessitate the omission of standard guard railing, (D)(4) does not require alternative protection. Inquiry turns then to whether Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-02(D)(4) applies. There is little debate that the walkway at issue was a special-purpose one, intended for emergency use by crane operators. This conclusion, however, does not automatically exempt the employer from the guardrail requirement of (D)(1)(a), for it is, after all, still an elevated runway. To the contrary, guard railing can be omitted only \u201cwhere operating conditions necessitate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 21} The commission found that operating conditions did not necessitate omission, based solely on Wheeling-Pittsburgh\u2019s postaccident erection of a modified railing/gate system that permitting escape without hindering the crane\u2019s function. The court of appeals declared that finding to be an abuse of discretion, stressing the exact language of (D)(4): special-purpose runways \u201cmay have the <em>railing </em>on one side omitted where operating conditions necessitate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the only germane consideration was whether standard guard railing as defined in 4121:l-5-02(E) would interfere with the operating conditions of the crane. Here, it is uncontested that the modified gate/railing system was not a \u201cstandard guard railing\u201d as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(B)(131) and 4121:l-5-02(E), since it lacked the intermediate rail required by that definition of standard guard railing. Accordingly, the court of appeals held that it was irrelevant whether the operating conditions of the runway and crane could be maintained with the modified rail/gate. What mattered was whether the integrity of the operation could be maintained with an Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-02(E) standard guard railing in place. While the commission did not directly answer this question, its order suggests that operations could <em>not </em>be maintained with a standard guard railing.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 22} The preeminent concern underlying the walkway\u2019s construction was the availability of an immediate and accessible way to exit the crane in case of emergency. The commission concluded that the absence of an intermediate rail offered \u201ca means of escape from the crane in the event of an emergency, with a single railing not providing a total restriction on the operator\u2019s ability to get to the emergency walkway.\u201d This implies that the intermediate rail required by standard guard railing <em>would </em>restrict the operator\u2019s escape, and common sense corroborates this.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 23} We also disapprove of the commission\u2019s use of Wheeling-Pittsburgh\u2019s subsequent attempts to enhance worker safety as essentially a means to penalize the employer. In this case, a tragic accident occurred, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh quickly instituted measures to ensure that such a mishap was never repeated. The commission\u2019s reasoning is a true disincentive to such remedial efforts, for had Wheeling-Pittsburgh done nothing, the commission apparently would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>had no evidence from which to conclude that operating conditions could have been unimpaired by standard guard railing. We will not validate such a rationale.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b138-10\">Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Joseph A. Brunetto and Randall W.
