See <em>State v. Wilson, </em>8th Dist. No. 79485, 2002-Ohio-1846, 2002 WL 664023; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>8th Dist. No. 79475, 2002-Ohio-1554, 2002 WL 509563. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgments of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">{\u00b6 2} Appellees, Lawrence J. Taylor and Willie Wilson, were separately convicted of sex crimes in the 1970s. After being released from prison for the sexually oriented offenses, both men were convicted of nonsexual offenses. Both were sentenced to prison. After Taylor was released in 2000, and while Wilson was still incarcerated, plaintiff-appellee, the state of Ohio, moved that hearings be held to determine whether Taylor and Wilson were sexual predators subject to the registration requirements of R.C. Chapter 2950. Thus, the trial courts were faced with the issue whether Taylor and Wilson had a duty to register as sexual predators, even though the offense for which they were imprisoned was not a sexual offense. See R.C. 2950.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court ruled that Taylor had a duty to register as a sexual predator. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed, stating that the trial court\u2019s application of the statute defied its plain meaning. A different trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>determined that Wilson was also required to register as a sexual predator. The court of appeals reversed, relying on <em>State v. Bellman </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 208, 714 N.E.2d 381. The causes are now before this court pursuant to the allowance of discretionary appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2950.04 includes registration requirements for sexually oriented offenders. This statute states:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c(A)(1) Each of the following types of offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to, or has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to, a sexually oriented offense shall register * * *:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(a) Regardless of when the sexually oriented offense was committed, an offender who is sentenced for the sexually oriented offense to a prison term * * * and, on or after July 1, 1997, is released in any manner from the prison term</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(b) Regardless of when the sexually oriented offense was committed, an offender who is sentenced for a sexually oriented offense on or after July 1, 1997, and to whom division (A)(1)(a) of this section does not apply;</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(c) If the sexually oriented offense was committed prior to July 1, 1997, and neither division (A)(1)(a) nor division (A)(1)(b) of this section applies, an offender who, immediately prior to July 1, 1997, was a habitual sex offender who was required to register under Chapter 2950. of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">{\u00b6 9} Taylor and Wilson do not fit into any of these categories. They were not convicted of a sexually oriented offense, sentenced to a prison term for it, and released from that prison term on or after July 1, 1997. R.C. 2950.04(A)(1)(a). They were not sentenced for a sexually oriented offense on or after July 1, 1997. R.C. 2950.04(A)(1)(b). They were not, prior to July 1, 1997, habitual sex offenders who were required to register. R.C. 2950.04(A)(1)(c). Accordingly, we conclude that, even though Taylor and Wilson have been adjudicated to be sexual predators, R.C. 2950.04 does not require them to register as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">{\u00b6 10} This conclusion is consistent with our decision in <em>Bellman, </em>where we stated that \u201calthough Bellman is properly adjudicated a sexual predator under the new law, he has no duty to register because he does not fit within the plain language of R.C. 2950.04 describing categories of compulsory registrants.\u201d Id., 86 Ohio St.3d at 212, 714 N.E.2d 381. The reasoning behind <em>Bellman </em>applies with equal force in this case: adjudication as a sexual predator is distinct from the duty to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The state argues that it defies common sense to define a person as a sexual predator without requiring him to register, that any other reading renders R.C. 2950.04 toothless, and that the duty to register is inherent. We conclude that the plain meaning of R.C. 2950.04 provides no support for the state\u2019s arguments. The General Assembly could have written the statute to require all sexual predators to register; it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 12} We conclude that Taylor and Wilson are not required to register as sexual predators under R.C. 2950.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

Essentially, the state inquires what purpose may be served by classifying some offenders as sexual predators but not requiring them to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2950.04(A)(1) requires registration of only certain sexually oriented offenders. Registration is limited to those who were previously required to register and those who would be released from confinement for a sexually oriented offense into our communities on or after the effective date of R.C. Chapter 2950. Notably absent is a registration requirement for sexually oriented offenders who were confined pursuant to a sexually oriented offense and released from that confinement prior to July 1, 1997. Although an Ohio citizen may reasonably desire notification that any sexually oriented offender is about to enter his or her community, the General Assembly did not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State v. Bellman </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 208, 714 N.E.2d 381, we described this peculiarity as \u201ca gap in the R.C. 2950.04 coverage,\u201d but we declined to fill it, recognizing that it is not our place to cure a legislative omission. <em>Bellman </em>at 211, 714 N.E.2d 381, citing <em>Hough v. Dayton Mfg. Co. </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 427, 437, 64 N.E. 521. Nonetheless, the state, and no doubt many interested citizens, would have us fill this gap by imputing a duty to register based upon R.C. 2950.09(C)(1), which sets forth the procedure for classifying certain offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ers as sexual predators. This section details the circumstances under which the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction must recommend whether a sentencing court should classify a sexually oriented offender as a sexual predator. Such a recommendation must be made if the offender\u2019s conviction or guilty plea for a sexually oriented offense occurred before January 1, 1997, if the offender \u201cwas not sentenced for <em>the </em>offense on or after January 1, 1997, and if, on or after January 1, 1997, the offender is serving <em>a </em>term of imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d in reference to \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d indicates that it is irrelevant whether the offender was confined on or after January 1, 1997, for the sexually oriented offense or for some other offense, for instance burglary, as was the case with Taylor. Regardless of how this court should interpret the duty of the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, R.C. 2950.09 addresses classification only; it does not command registration of an offender that was found to be a sexual predator. The registration requirement is exclusively found in R.C. 2950.04.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b283-8\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Renee L. Snow, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b283-9\">Carlos Warner, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 17} This court\u2019s primary goal when interpreting a statute is to effectuate legislative intent. <em>Carter v. Youngstown Div. of Water </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63, paragraph one of the syllabus. Where this intent is unclear, our interpretation is guided by myriad rules of statutory construction. Here, however, the language establishing the obligation to register is found solely in R.C. 2950.04, and it clearly does not impose registration upon a sexually oriented offender released from confinement for a sexually oriented offense prior to July 1, 1997. We cannot read a registration requirement for this class of offenders into either R.C. 2950.04 or R.C. 2950.09. Clearly a gap exists; however, it is solely within the General Assembly\u2019s purview to close it.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-7\">Petree and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
