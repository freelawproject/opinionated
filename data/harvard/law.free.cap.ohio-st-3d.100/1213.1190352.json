Having reviewed the record before me, I cannot conclude that affiant has demonstrated the existence of bias or prejudice on the part of Judge Basinski. A judge\u2019s ruling on a request for a continuance or other scheduling matters is discretionary, and an adverse ruling on these matters does not demonstrate the existence of bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Spahr </em>(1987), 36 Ohio St.3d 603, 522 N.E.2d 457. Moreover, a judge will not be disqualified because he or she attempts to adhere to a trial schedule and insists on compliance with the mandates of this court\u2019s Rules of Superintendence regarding the granting of continuances and the timely disposition of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 3} For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Basinski.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
