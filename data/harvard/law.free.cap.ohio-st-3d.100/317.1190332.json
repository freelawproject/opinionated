In her complaint as subsequently amended, Schmidt requested a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, School Employees Retirement System (\u201cSERS\u201d), to grant her previously filed application for disability retirement benefits. Upon SERS\u2019s motion, the case was transferred to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 2} The court of appeals referred the case to a magistrate under Civ.R. 53(C) and Loc.R. 12(M) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals. In November 2002, the magistrate issued a decision in which he recommended that the court of appeals deny the writ because Schmidt\u2019s brief did not comply with the requirements of App.R. 19 and Loc.R. 12(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2003, after Schmidt failed to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the court of appeals denied the writ. The court of appeals \u201cagree[d] with the magistrate\u2019s determination that [Schmidt] failed to file a brief in compliance with Loc.R. 12(J) and App.R. 19, thereby justifying the denial of the requested writ of mandamus.\u201d The court of appeals further concluded that \u201cthe argument [Schmidt] appears to advance was rejected\u201d in <em>State ex rel Schwaben v. School Emp. Retirement Sys. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 280, 667 N.E.2d 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, Schmidt asserts that we should reconsider our decision in <em>Schwaben.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">{\u00b6 5} Schmidt is not entitled to reversal of the judgment denying the writ. Although the court of appeals gave two reasons to deny the writ, i.e., failure to comply with the briefing requirements of App.R. 19 and Loc.R. 12(J) and our holding in <em>Schwaben, </em>she challenges only the court of appeals\u2019 reliance on <em>Schivaben </em>in this appeal. Even if the court\u2019s rationale on this latter ground was incorrect, its judgment denying the writ is not subject to reversal because Schmidt does not challenge all of the independent reasons given by the court of appeals to deny the writ. See <em>Stewart v. Corrigan, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 80, 2002-Ohio-5316, 776 N.E.2d 103, \u00b6 4 (\u201ceven if the court\u2019s rationale on this ground was incorrect, its judgment denying the writ based on the grounds that Stewart does not contest on appeal was proper\u201d); <em>State ex rel. White v. Suster, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 465, 2002-Ohio-2482, 768 N.E.2d 1178, \u00b6 3. That is, Schmidt does not challenge the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 denial of the writ based on her failure to comply with the briefing requirements of App.R. 19 and Loc.R. 12(J).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b427-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Croskery &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., and Robert F. Croskery, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b427-9\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Judith T. Edwards, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, even if Schmidt had raised this briefing issue on appeal, she waived any error by failing to object to the court of appeals\u2019 adoption of the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. \u201cA party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or conclusion of law unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion under this rule.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(d); Loc.R. 12(M)(1) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals (\u201cthe proceedings and decision of the magistrate and objections thereto shall be governed by Civ.R. 53\u201d); see, also, <em>Smith v. Null </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 264, 271, 757 N.E.2d 1200; <em>Boyd v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 384, 388, 760 N.E.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 7} Therefore, we need not consider Schmidt\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of <em>Schwaben </em>to SERS\u2019s decision to deny her application for disability retirement benefits. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
