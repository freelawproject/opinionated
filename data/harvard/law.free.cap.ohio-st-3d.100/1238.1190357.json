The State of Ohio <em>v. </em>Rebecca.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b526-5\">[Cite as <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1238, 2003-Ohio-5483.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b526-8\">(No. 02-AP-115</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ase\">Decided February 5, 2003.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b526-10\">Moyer, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">{\u00b6 1} This affidavit of disqualification was filed by Donald J. Tennant Jr., counsel for defendant Tyson E. Rebecca, seeking the disqualification of Judge John M. Solovan II from further proceedings in the above-captioned case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">{\u00b6 2} The defendant is facing criminal charges in which two of his alleged victims are deputies in the county sheriffs department. Deputy sheriffs provide security for the Belmont County courthouse and the judges and employees therein, and serve as bailiffs to the judges. Affiant alleges that this relationship creates \u201csufficient conflict of interest\u201d or an appearance of impropriety requiring the disqualification of all judges of the Belmont County Common Pleas Court, including Judge Solovan.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">{\u00b6 3} There is no suggestion that the judge has any particular relationship with the deputies, or anything more than a professional relationship with any members of the sheriffs department. Nor does the affiant allege any actual bias or prejudice. I do not find on the facts of this case that the professional relationship between Judge Solovan and members of the county sheriffs department requires his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">{\u00b6 4} Even in cases where there has been a personal relationship or friendship between a judge and potential witnesses, \u201cAbsent some affirmative indication that a judge\u2019s friendship with a potential witness in a pending action will affect that judge\u2019s consideration of the case, I decline to establish a rule that mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification based on the existence of the friendship.\u201d <em>In re Disquali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number><em>fication of Bressler </em>(1997), 81 Ohio St.3d 1215, 688 N.E.2d 517 (judge had admitted close friendship with a police detective who would be called as a witness in the case). See, also, <em>In re Disqualification of Cunningham </em>(1999), 88 Ohio St.3d 1219, 723 N.E.2d 1105 (admitted friendship between the judge and a party\u2019s expert witness was not grounds for disqualification); and <em>In re Disqualification of Economus </em>(Sept. 8, 1987), No. 87-AP-059 (admitted friendship between the judge and an assistant prosecutor would not automatically result in the judge\u2019s disqualification from cases handled by that prosecutor).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">{\u00b6 5} The affiant also alleges that Judge Solovan\u2019s college-age daughter has, for the past two summers, worked at a county agency, where she was supervised by the defendant\u2019s father. Affiant speculates that if the daughter works at the agency next summer, she may again be supervised by the defendant\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 6} In his response, Judge Solovan states that he has never discussed the facts of the underlying case with his daughter and that he was not aware that the defendant\u2019s father had been her supervisor until this affidavit of disqualification was filed. Judge Solovan also states that he sees no conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety even if, as speculated, his daughter again has summer employment where she is supervised by the defendant\u2019s father. I decline to require disqualification based on this past connection between the judge\u2019s daughter and the defendant\u2019s father or on the speculation of a future connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 7} For the foregoing reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The cause shall continue before Judge Solovan.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 8} The affidavit also included defendant\u2019s Motion for Leave to Recuse the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney of Belmont County, Ohio. Two different prosecuting attorneys, in their private law practices, represent members of the defendant\u2019s family. One represents the defendant\u2019s wife in a divorce proceeding, and another represents the defendant\u2019s cousin in a civil matter. The Chief Justice does not have the authority to rule upon the disqualification of a prosecuting attorney. The disqualification of counsel in a particular case is a matter for the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
