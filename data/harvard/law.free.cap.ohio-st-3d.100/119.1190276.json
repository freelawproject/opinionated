Potts, of aiding or abetting aggravated robbery and sentenced him to prison. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Potts </em>(Sept. 28, 2000), Richland App. No. 00 CA 12, 2000 WL 1473879.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>{\u00b6 2} In June 2001, Potts filed a civil complaint in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas in which he claimed that his trial court judge was guilty of fraud and lacked jurisdiction to preside over his criminal trial because of his failure to comply with certain statutes, including R.C. 2701.06.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The common pleas court dismissed the complaint, and on appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal. <em>Potts v. Deweese </em>(Jan. 23, 2002), Richland App. No. 01CA66, 2002 WL 106320, appeal not allowed, 95 Ohio St.3d 1438, 2002-Ohio-2084, 766 N.E.2d 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 3} In August 2001, Potts filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this court. Potts again claimed that his trial court judge lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because of his failure to comply with R.C. 2701.06. In September 2001, we dismissed the cause. <em>Potts v. Bagley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 1426, 755 N.E.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 4} In March 2003, Potts filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Appeals for Richland County. Potts reiterated his claim that he was entitled to release from prison because the asserted failure to comply with R.C. 2701.06 divested the trial court of jurisdiction to convict and sentence him. Potts named his prison warden as the respondent. In April 2003, the court of appeals sua sponte dismissed Potts\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Res judicata barred Potts from filing a successive habeas corpus petition. <em>Turner v. Ishee, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 411, 2003-Ohio-1671, 786 N.E.2d 54, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, Potts\u2019s claim is not cognizable in his habeas corpus action. \u201c \u2018The right of a <em>de facto </em>officer to hold office may not be questioned in a collateral proceeding to which he is not a party.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.

Staten </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 107, 110, 54 O.O.2d 235, 267 N.E.2d 122, vacated on other grounds (1972), 408 U.S. 938, 92 S.Ct. 2869, 33 L.Ed.2d 759; see, also, <em>State v.
