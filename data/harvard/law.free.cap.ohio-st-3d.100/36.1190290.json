Ahmed requested a writ of prohibition to prevent appellee, Judge John Mark Costine of the Belmont County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, from subverting his appellate rights in certain probate cases. On October 29, 2002, Ahmed voluntarily dismissed his complaint under Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">{\u00b6 2} On December 20, 2002, the court of appeals dismissed Ahmed\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the dismissal, Ahmed filed several motions, including motions for contempt and for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">{\u00b6 3} On February 19, 2003, the court of appeals held that it had \u201cno further jurisdiction to act on the motions filed since the order of dismissal\u201d and that it would not rule upon Ahmed\u2019s present and subsequent filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">{\u00b6 4} In his appeal as of right, Ahmed contends that the court of appeals erred in failing to consider the merits of his postdismissal motions for contempt and sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">{\u00b6 5} We agree. Trial courts may consider collateral issues like criminal contempt and Civ.R. 11 sanctions despite a dismissal. See <em>State ex rel. Hummel v. Sadler, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 84, 2002-Ohio-3605, 771 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 23, and cases cited therein. Therefore, the court of appeals erred in holding otherwise.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b145-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Nawaz Ahmed, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b145-9\">Frank Pierce, Belmont County Prosecuting Attorney, and Robert W.
