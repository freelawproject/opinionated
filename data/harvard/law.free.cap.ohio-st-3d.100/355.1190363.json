On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment. <em>State v. Booker </em>(July 29, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 62841, 1993 WL 294799.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">{\u00b6 2} In May 2003, Booker filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Lorain County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellee, Grafton Correctional Institution Warden Carl S. Anderson, to release him from prison. Booker claimed that he was entitled to immediate release from prison because his speedy-trial rights were violated, the trial court failed to rule on four of his pretrial motions, and his indictment was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">{\u00b6 3} Anderson moved to dismiss Booker\u2019s petition. On July 30, 2003, the court of appeals granted Anderson\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">{\u00b6 4} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Neither a claimed violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial nor the asserted invalidity of an indictment is cognizable in habeas corpus. <em>Travis v. Bagley </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 322, 323, 750 N.E.2d 166; <em>Turner v.
