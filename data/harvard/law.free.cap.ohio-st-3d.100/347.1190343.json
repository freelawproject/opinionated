Ministerial has provided educational daycare services to children of low-income families under the Head Start Act. See Section 9831 et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code. The purpose of the Head Start Act is \u201cto promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of low-income children through the provision, to low-income children and their families, of health, educational, nutritional, social, and other services that are determined, based on family needs assessments, to be necessary.\u201d Section 9831, Title 42, U.S.Code. The state appropriates additional funds for Head Start agencies. See, e.g., R.C. 3301.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">{\u00b6 2} Ministerial has also provided food and nutrition services under the National School Lunch Act, as amended, Section 1751 et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code, the Child Nutrition Act, as amended, Section 1771 et seq., Title 42, U.S.Code, and the regulations governing the Child and Adult Care Food Program (\u201cCACFP\u201d), Section 226.1 et seq., Title 7, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Head Start Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2001, the Ohio Department of Education (\u201cODE\u201d) informed Ministerial that its tentative allocation of state Head Start funds was $7,850,904 for fiscal year 2002 and $8,007,010 for fiscal year 2003. ODE specified that the award was based on a \u201cper pupil amount\u201d and that the amount was \u201ctentative and subject to change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 4} In May 2001, Ministerial submitted its continuing grant application for Head Start funds for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to ODE based upon the tentative allocation. In its application, Ministerial assured appellee, Superintendent of Public Instruction Susan Tave Zelman, that it would comply with applicable law and its application representations and that its failure to comply with these representations could result in a reduction of the award:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe applicant hereby assures the Superintendent of Public Instruction that:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA. Applicant shall operate this program in accordance with applicable federal Head Start regulations, including: the Head Start Act; Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 45 Parts 1301-1306, and 1308; all applicable statutory provisions and rules adopted by the State Board of Education (including for Head Start programs Ohio Revised Code, Section 3301.311); and in accordance with the representations in this application. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cN. Applicant acknowledges that failure to comply with these assurances or the requirements of the Amended Substitute House Bill in effect for this award * * * may result in an adjustment, reduction or termination of this award prior to the end of the award period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">{\u00b6 9} From May 7-11, 2001, ODE reviewed Ministerial\u2019s Head Start program on-site. Based upon this review, ODE concluded that the program was deficient because of (1) inadequate record keeping, (2) a significant number of ineligible children and families in the program, and (3) failure to provide comprehensive Head Start services to all children.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">{\u00b6 10} Because of these deficiencies, ODE notified Ministerial in June 2001 that it would not continue its Head Start funding at the same level. Instead, ODE would fund Ministerial based only on the number of eligible children, which resulted in a Head Start allocation of $2,248,450 for fiscal year 2002. In July 2001, ODE informed Ministerial that its Head Start award had been adjusted downward and would be $2,166,425 for fiscal year 2002 and $2,166,425 for fiscal \u25a0 year 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">{\u00b6 11} In June 2002, the State Auditor issued a special audit report of Ministerial\u2019s Head Start program for the period from July 1, 1997, to September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>30, 2000. The Auditor concluded that during fiscal year 1998, Ministerial had received funding for more children than it could document were enrolled in its Head Start program and had failed to pay all the funds to which private providers were entitled. The Auditor issued findings for recovery against Ministerial for approximately $3.8 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">CACFP Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 12} In 1996, Ministerial entered into a \u201cpermanent agreement\u201d with ODE to provide CACFP services. The agreement provided that the \u201cprovisions automatically renew each year contingent on state agency approval of a complete and correct Application or Application Renewal submitted by the sponsor.\u201d Ministerial expressly agreed to \u201c[c]omply with and meet all responsibilities and requirements set forth in 7 CFR, Part 226, Child and Adult Care Food Program Regulations\u201d and \u201c[c]laim reimbursement only for meals served to enrolled and eligible CACFP participants.\u201d ODE agreed to \u201c[reimburse [Ministerial] for meals * * * based on the percentage of participants enrolled as free, reduced, and paid enrollmen[t].\u201d According to Ministerial, this agreement was renewed in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 13} From September 26 through September 29, 2000, ODE reviewed Ministerial\u2019s administration of CACFP funds. In November 2000, ODE notified Ministerial of serious deficiencies in its program, including inflated meal counts and the provision of meals to ineligible children. ODE ordered Ministerial to immediately correct the deficiencies and to issue a corrective action plan by December 18, 2000. In its notice, ODE informed Ministerial that the designation of serious deficiency could not be appealed but that Ministerial could appeal other findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 14} Due to the State Auditor\u2019s June 2002 special audit on Ministerial\u2019s Head Start program, ODE requested a plan for repayment of the amount Ministerial was overpaid from July 1, 1997, through September 30, 2000. Ministerial\u2019s application for participation in CACFP has been denied until it submits a plan for repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Common Pleas Court Case</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 15} In February 2002, Ministerial filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas against several defendants, including ODE and Zelman. Ministerial sought a declaratory judgment that ODE\u2019s termination and reduction of its Head Start funding was unconstitutional. Ministerial further requested that ODE pay Ministerial the over $15 million it had been tentatively awarded in April 2001 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Ministerial also requested that the defendants be enjoined from illegal conduct involving threats and harassment. Ministerial voluntarily dismissed this common pleas court case in November 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"AHv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Court of Appeals Case</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">{\u00b6 16} On November 29, 2002, Ministerial filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County against Zelman and the State Auditor. Ministerial requested a writ of mandamus ordering Zelman and the State Auditor \u201c(1) to transfer to [Ministerial] $11 million in outstanding CACFP and Head Start funds, (2) to restore its rightful amount for the remainder of SFY 2003 as originally allocated by ODE in its letter of April 17, 2001, and [Ministerial\u2019s] continuation grant application, (3) to recognize [Ministerial\u2019s] rightful status as a Head Start provider, with a right to continue service (and receiving state Head Start funding for) at least 1,754 children, directly as well as through its private child care partners and (4) to recognize [Ministerial\u2019s] rightful status as a CACFP provider to provide food and nutritional services to children under CACFP and to receive timely reimbursement therefore.\u201d Zelman and the State Auditor moved to dismiss Ministerial\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 17} In May 2003, after Ministerial had voluntarily dismissed the Auditor from the case, the court of appeals granted Zelman\u2019s motion and dismissed Ministerial\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 18} In its appeal as of right, Ministerial asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing its complaint for a writ of mandamus. In order to be entitled to the requested writ, Ministerial had to establish a clear legal right to continued recognition as an appropriate Head Start and CACFP provider and to the transfer of over $11 million in additional Head Start and CACFP funds, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of Zelman to so recognize Ministerial and to transfer those funds, and the lack of an adequate legal remedy. <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Referendum, of Ordinance No. 3844-02 v. Norris, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 336, 2003-Ohio-3887, 792 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 19} Under R.C. 3301.13, ODE is the \u201cadministrative unit and organization through which the policies, directives, and powers of the state board of education and the duties of the superintendent of public instruction are administered by such superintendent as executive officer of the board.\u201d As the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Zelman executes her duties and the powers of the State Board of Education through ODE.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Head Start Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 20} Ministerial claims that once the court of appeals determined that Ministerial had participated in the Head Start program during the pertinent period, it was automatically entitled to funding it had received for the previous award period.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 21} Ministerial\u2019s claim is devoid of merit. Ministerial expressly represented in its grant application for Head Start funds that its failure to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>applicable law concerning the Head Start program \u201cmay result in an adjustment, reduction or termination of this award prior to the end of the award period.\u201d By reducing Ministerial\u2019s tentative award for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 due to its failure to comply with applicable Head Start requirements, ODE merely did what Ministerial had acknowledged that it could. In addition, Ohio Adm.Code 3301-69 \u2014 07(B)(5)(b) permits ODE to review the status of an agency in meeting Head Start performance standards in the continuation grant process.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, insofar as Ministerial seeks a judgment declaring its status as a Head Start provider, neither this court nor the court of appeals has original jurisdiction over claims for declaratory judgment. <em>State ex rel. Satow v. Gausse-Milliken, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 479, 2003-Ohio-2074, 786 N.E.2d 1289, \u00b6 13; <em>State ex rel. Shimko v. McMonagle </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 426, 430, 751 N.E.2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">CACFP Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 23} Ministerial next asserts that the court of appeals was compelled to grant the writ ordering the CACFP funds once it had held that Ministerial was a participant in the program. Ministerial cites Section 226.11, Title 7, C.F.R., R.C. 3313.813(B), and its agreement with ODE in support of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 24} These provisions, however, do not confer a clear legal right upon Ministerial to the CACFP funds or impose a corresponding clear legal duty on Zelman to provide them. Ministerial did not provide any credible allegation that its agreement with ODE was renewed beyond 1999. In fact, even if the agreement had been renewed, Ministerial specifically agreed to claim reimbursement only for meals served to \u201cenrolled and eligible CACFP participants.\u201d Therefore, once ODE determined that Ministerial requested funds for ineligible participants, Ministerial could not seek reimbursement. Nothing in Section 226.11, Title 7, C.F.R. or R.C. 3313.813(B) prevents ODE from refusing to reimburse an agency for funds to which it is not entitled under CACFP and the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">{\u00b625} Furthermore, Ministerial could have instead filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. In fact, Ministerial essentially concedes the adequacy of this alternate remedy by arguing that this case \u201cis very similar to\u201d <em>Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Gilligan </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 107, 67 O.O.2d 108, 311 N.E.2d 529, a case that was instituted as an action for injunctive and declaratory relief in a common pleas court rather than as an action for an extraordinary writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">{\u00b6 26} In addition, insofar as Ministerial requests a judgment declaring its status as a CACFP provider, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Shimko, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 430, 751 N.E.2d 472.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b460-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Zukerman, Daiker &amp; Lear Co., L.P.A., Larry W.
