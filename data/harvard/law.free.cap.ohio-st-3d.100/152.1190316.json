Ward arrested defendant-appellee, Chadd A. Burnside, for driving under the influence of alcohol. In the early hours of that morning, Trooper Ward stopped Burnside\u2019s vehicle for a speeding violation. During the stop, Trooper Ward observed that Burnside had glassy eyes and smelled of alcohol. Burnside admitted that he had consumed \u201ca few\u201d alcoholic beverages and consented to a standard field sobriety test. Upon the completion of the field sobriety test, Trooper Ward arrested Burnside and charged him with driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">{\u00b6 3} Trooper Ward transported Burnside to the State Highway Patrol Post, where he asked Burnside to submit to a chemical breath test. Burnside refused and requested a blood test. Trooper Ward then transported Burnside to the Fairfield Medical Center, where a phlebotomist drew a blood sample. After properly sealing the blood sample, Trooper Ward mailed the sample to the State Highway Patrol Laboratory in Columbus, Ohio. A criminalist at the laboratory tested the sample and determined that Burnside\u2019s blood-alcohol content was 0.169 grams per 100 milliliters. As a result, Trooper Ward additionally charged Burnside with operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited blood-alcohol level in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On August 1, 2001, Burnside entered pleas of not guilty to charges of speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, and driving with a prohibited level of alcohol. Burnside thereafter filed a motion to suppress the blood-test results, asserting that the state had failed to substantially comply with the blood-testing procedures in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05. At the suppression hearing, the state presented testimony from the arresting officer, the phlebotomist who drew the blood sample, and the criminalist who tested the blood sample. Burnside presented no evidence. During closing argument, Burnside asserted that the blood-test results should be suppressed because the state had failed to establish that it (1) used a nonvolatile antiseptic on his skin prior to collecting the blood sample and (2) drew the blood into a vacuum container with a solid anticoagulant. The trial court overruled Burnside\u2019s motion to suppress, holding that the state had substantially complied with the blood-testing procedures in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">{\u00b6 5} On December 4, 2001, Burnside entered a plea of no contest to operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited level of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(2). In exchange, the state dismissed the remaining charges. Burnside appealed his conviction to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, alleging that the trial court had erred in denying his motion to suppress the blood-test results. The court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court on the basis that the state failed to substantially comply with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05 and certified its judgment to be in conflict with that of the Seventh District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Zuzga </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 696, 753 N.E.2d 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists in case No. 2002-1524 and pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal in case No. 2002-1440.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals certified the following issue for our determination: \u201cWhen there is no evidence that a solid anticoagulant is used in a blood test to determine alcohol content as required by O.A.C. 3701-53-05(C), dos [sic] the State still meet its burden of substantial compliance with Department of Health regulations?\u201d Our analysis of the certified issue begins with the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 8} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972. Consequently, an appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583. Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard. <em>State v. McNamara </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 706, 707 N.E.2d 539. We therefore consider whether the facts in the instant case demonstrate substantial compliance with the Department of Health regulations under a de novo standard of review. Resolution of this issue requires an examination of the blood-testing procedures in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">B. The Blood-Testing Procedures in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 9} The General Assembly established the threshold criteria for the admissibility of alcohol-test results in prosecutions for driving under the influence and driving with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in R.C. 4511.19(D). That section, which governs the admissibility of alcohol-test results, provides that a defendant\u2019s blood, breath, or urine \u201cshall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the director of health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the director of health pursuant to section 3701.143 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 3701.143 requires the director of health to \u201cdetermine, or cause to be determined, techniques or methods for chemically analyzing a person\u2019s blood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 10} In accordance with this statutory mandate, the Director of Health promulgated the following alcohol-testing regulations in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) All samples shall be collected in accordance with section 4511.19, or section 1547.11 of the Revised Code, as applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(B) When collecting a blood sample, an aqueous solution of a nonvolatile antiseptic shall be used on the skin. No alcohols shall be used as a skin antiseptic.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(C) <em>Blood shall be drawn ivith a sterile dry needle into a vacuum container with a solid anticoagulant, </em>or according to the laboratory protocol as written in the laboratory procedure manual based on the type of specimen being tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(D) The collection of a urine specimen must be witnessed to assure that the sample can be authenticated. Urine shall be deposited into a clean glass or plastic screw top container which shall be capped, or collected according to the laboratory protocol as written in the laboratory procedure manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c(E) Blood and urine containers shall be sealed in a manner such that tampering can be detected and have a label which contains at least the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(1) Name of suspect;</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(2) Date and time of collection;</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(3) Name or initials of person collecting the sample; and</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(4) Name or initials of person sealing the sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(F) While not in transit or under examination, all blood and urine specimens shall be refrigerated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 21} The blood-testing procedure in Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05 thus requires the state to (1) use an aqueous solution of a nonvolatile antiseptic on the skin, (2) use a sterile dry needle to draw blood into a vacuum container with a solid anticoagulant, (3) seal the blood container in accordance with the appropriate procedure, and (4) refrigerate the blood specimen when it is not in transit or under examination. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure the accuracy of the alcohol-test results. <em>State v. Dickerson </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 64, 65-66, 25 OBR 86, 495 N.E.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">C. Judicial Interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">{\u00b6 22} We first addressed the application of the Department of Health regulations that govern alcohol testing in <em>State v. Steele </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 187, 6 O.O.3d 418, 370 N.E.2d 740. <em>Steele </em>involved the admissibility of a breath-alcohol test administered by a police officer who failed to continuously observe a subject for the requisite 20-minute observation period prior to administering the test. We concluded that the failure to observe the subject for a \u201cfew seconds\u201d while the officer exited and walked around his patrol car did not render the test results inadmissible. <em>Steele </em>thus established that rigid compliance with the alcohol-testing procedures in the Ohio Administrative Code is not a prerequisite to the admissibility of alcohol-test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">{\u00b6 23} Nearly a decade later, we again addressed whether the state had complied with the Department of Health regulations relating to alcohol testing in <em>State v. Plummer </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 292, 22 OBR 461, 490 N.E.2d 902. In <em>Plummer, </em>we considered the consequences of the state\u2019s failure to comply with a regulation that required it to refrigerate urine samples that were not in transit or under examination. Concluding that a three-to-four-hour interval without refrigeration did not render the test results inadmissible, we held that \u201c[ajbsent a showing of prejudice to a defendant, the results of a urine-alcohol test administered in substantial compliance with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05 are admissible in a prosecution under R.C. 4511.19.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>{\u00b6 24} In the wake of <em>Plummer, </em>courts have applied a burden-shifting procedure to govern the admissibility of alcohol-test results. E.g., <em>State v. Zuzga, </em>141 Ohio App.3d at 698-699, 753 N.E.2d 229. The defendant must first challenge the validity of the alcohol test by way of a pretrial motion to suppress; failure to file such a motion \u201cwaives the requirement on the state to lay a foundation for the admissibility of the test results.\u201d <em>State v. French </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 446, 451, 650 N.E.2d 887. After a defendant challenges the validity of test results in a pretrial motion, the state has the burden to show that the test was administered in substantial compliance with the regulations prescribed by the Director of Health. Once the state has satisfied this burden and created a presumption of admissibility, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut that presumption by demonstrating that he was prejudiced by anything less than strict compliance. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 629, 632, 672 N.E.2d 1050. Hence, evidence of prejudice is relevant only after the state demonstrates substantial compliance with the applicable regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 25} Against this backdrop, we turn to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 26} The state does not dispute that it had the burden to establish compliance with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05, that this provision requires the use of a solid anticoagulant, and that it failed to establish the use of an anticoagulant. The state\u2019s argument, rather, is that it need not use a solid anticoagulant to substantially comply with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05. We begin our analysis by examining the parameters of the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b627} In determining the admissibility of alcohol-test results regulated by Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05, we have observed that \u201cthere is leeway for substantial, though not literal, compliance with such regulations.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 294, 22 OBR 461, 490 N.E.2d 902. The state must therefore establish that it substantially complied with the alcohol-testing regulations to trigger the presumption of admissibility. Our conclusion that the state must establish substantial compliance rather than strict compliance, however, does not relieve the state of its burden to prove compliance with the alcohol-testing regulations, but rather defines <em>what compliance is.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">{\u00b6 28} Although we have not had occasion to expound upon the substantial-compliance standard, appellate courts have developed two approaches to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>mine whether the state has substantially complied with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05. One approach is to consider whether the noncompliance rendered the test results unreliable. See, e.g., <em>State v. Gray </em>(1980), 4 Ohio App.3d 47, 50, 51, 4 OBR 96, 446 N.E.2d 469. Under this approach, a court will conclude that the state has substantially complied with the Department of Health regulations if the alleged deviation did not affect the reliability of the test results. Id. The other approach for determining substantial compliance is to consider whether the alleged deviation prejudiced the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State v. Zuzga </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 696, 701, 753 N.E.2d 229. Under this approach, a court will conclude that the state has substantially complied with the Department of Health regulations so long as the alleged deviation did not cause an erroneously higher test result. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 29} The import in denominating between these two approaches lies not in understanding the difference between them, but rather in recognizing the similarity: both require a judicial determination of what effect, if any, noncompliance had on the alcohol-test results. This determination, however, often requires judges to speculate why the Director of Health adopted a given regulation. One judge, charged with determining whether the failure to strictly comply with a regulation rendered alcohol-test results unreliable, deplored the fact that \u201cmost judges, myself included, do not know enough about chemistry, physics, or scientific testing so as to be able to know why the Department of Health adopted some of the required procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c* * * Thus, since I cannot know whether there was substantial compliance in this case, I am left with having to guess.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell </em>(Mar. 31, 1995), 6th Dist. No. L-92-227, 1995 WL 136820 (Grey, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 32} This sentiment is not surprising when one considers the more fundamental problem with such a method of determining admissibility: a judicial determination that an alcohol test, although not administered in strict compliance with the alcohol-testing regulations, is reliable and therefore admissible may subvert the rule-making authority and the statutory mandate of the Director of Health. Indeed, the General Assembly instructed the Director of Health \u2014 and <em>not </em>the judiciary \u2014 to ensure the reliability of alcohol-test results by promulgating regulations precisely because the former possesses the scientific expertise that the latter does not. See R.C. 4511.19(D)(1). Notwithstanding this statutory mandate, however, courts have concluded that the state need not show strict compliance with the regulations prescribed by the Director of Health if a <em>judge </em>deems the test results reliable. The problem, of course, is that such an approach is inconsistent with R.C. 4511.19, which provides that <em>compliance with the regulations, </em>rather than a judicial determination as to reliability, is the criterion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>for admissibility. See <em>Cincinnati v. Sand </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 79, 72 O.O.2d 44, 330 N.E.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 33} This problem is particularly acute where, as here, the state has failed to proffer evidence that it complied with a particular regulation directly related to blood-alcohol testing. To state it succinctly: A court infringes upon the authority of the Director of Health when it holds that the state need not do that which the director has required. Such an infringement places the court in the position of the Director of Health for the precise purpose of second-guessing whether the regulation with which the state has not complied is necessary to ensure the reliability of the alcohol-test results. This approach further precipitates conflicting decisions from lower courts and impedes the public policy of achieving uniformity and stability in the law. Painter, Ohio Driving Under the Influence Law (2003), Section 9.3,116.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 34} Nevertheless, we are cognizant that if \u201cwe were to agree * * * that any deviation whatsoever from th[e] regulation rendered the results of a [test] inadmissible, we would be ignoring the fact that strict compliance is not always realistically or humanly possible.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 294, 22 OBR 461, 490 N.E.2d 902. Precisely for this reason, we concluded in <em>Steele </em>that rigid compliance with the Department of Health regulations is not necessary for test results to be admissible. <em>Steele, </em>52 Ohio St.2d at 187, 6 O.O.3d 418, 370 N.E.2d 740 (holding that the failure to observe a driver for a \u201cfew seconds\u201d during the 20-minute observation period did not render the test results inadmissible). To avoid usurping a function that the General Assembly has assigned to the Director of Health, however, we must limit the substantial-compliance standard set forth in <em>Plummer to </em>excusing only <em>errors </em>that are clearly de minimis. Consistent with this limitation, we have characterized those errors that are excusable under the substantial-compliance standard as \u201cminor procedural deviations.\u201d <em>State v. Homan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 421, 426, 732 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 35} With these principles in mind, we consider whether the state substantially complied with the alcohol-testing regulations in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 36} The state asserts that it substantially complied with the alcohol-testing regulations notwithstanding its failure to establish the use of a solid anticoagulant. We disagree. Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05(C) declares in no uncertain terms that \u201c[b]lood <em>shall </em>be drawn * * * into a vacuum container with a solid anticoagulant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language does not <em>advise </em>the use of a solid anticoagulant when drawing a blood sample; it <em>demands </em>it. Indeed, the state failed to produce any evidence that it complied with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>53-05(C). As a result, we cannot conclude that such an error is de minimis and therefore permissible under the substantial-compliance standard. Given that the state failed to establish substantial compliance, its insistence that the defendant did not show prejudice is immaterial; rather, any evidence of prejudice would have been relevant only after the state demonstrated substantial compliance with the alcohol-testing regulations in Ohio Adni.Code 3701-53-05(C).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b268-11\">Jason M.

Wood, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 37} Finally, we address the state\u2019s argument that the alcohol-test results in the instant case should be admissible because the use of a solid anticoagulant was not necessary to ensure the reliability of the alcohol testing. This argument is properly directed not to us but to the Director of Health, whose charge it is to promulgate regulations that will ensure the reliability of alcohol-test results. To hold otherwise would be to speculate, with neither the requisite expertise nor the statutory authority, whether the failure to use a solid anticoagulant affected the reliability of the alcohol-test results in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-8\">Hildebrandt, F.E.
