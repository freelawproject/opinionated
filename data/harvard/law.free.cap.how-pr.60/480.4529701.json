Co. </em>agt. <em>Thompson </em>(58 N. <em>Y., </em>80). The power to charge her separate estate by a married woman presupposes that she has a separate estate, and if she has not, she is under the common law disability <em>(Switzer </em>agt. <em>Valentine, </em>4 <em>Duer, </em>96; <em>Wood </em>agt. <em>Sanchey, </em>3 <em>Daly, </em>198; <em>Baker </em>agt. <em>Lamb, </em>11 <em>Hun, </em>521). She is not estopped, as estoppel only applies to a married woman in so far as her capacities have been enlarged (44 <em>N. Y., </em>249; 53 <em>id., </em>96).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-6\"><em>Betts, Atterbury &amp; Betts, </em>for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-E\">insisted that she was liable within the decision in <em>Cashman </em>agt. <em>Henry </em>(12 <em>J. </em>&amp; <em>S., </em>93; <em>S.

Fuller. If she had no separate estate at the time of the execution of the bond, she was not competent to enter into the contract which the bond contains.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">In the language of Boabdmah, J., in <em>Baker </em>agt. <em>Lamb </em>(11 <em>Hun, </em>522), \u201c a married woman cannot give herself a legal capacity to contract by falsely representing that she has such capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">I do not regard the case of <em>Cashman </em>agt. <em>Henry </em>as in conflict with the views expressed in <em>Baker </em>agt. <em>Lamb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Judgment is, therefore, granted, dismissing the complaint as to the defendant Frances L.
