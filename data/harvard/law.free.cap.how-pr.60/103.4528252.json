All material issues must be tried by the court <em>(Exchange F. Ins. Co. </em>agt. <em>Earley, </em>54 <em>How., </em>279; <em>Code, sec. </em>965). There can be no valid decree against an infant by default, nor upon his guardian\u2019s answer <em>(Mills </em>agt. <em>Dennis, </em>3 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>367). An infant\u2019s claim to property is entitled to especial protection <em>(Freemam </em>agt. <em>Muns, </em>15 <em>Abb., </em>468). The consent by a guardian-to a decree will not bind the infant <em>(Rogers </em>agt. <em>Cruger, </em>7 <em>Johns., </em>557).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b108-7\">Macomber, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ALK\">The third defense contained in the answer of Trinnie by his guardian <em>ad Utem </em>raises a material issue, namely, the amount unpaid upon the mortgage held by the plaintiff. This motion, therefore, being based solely upon <em>Buie </em>63, must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The motion is denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
