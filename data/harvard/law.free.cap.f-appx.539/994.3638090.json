In 2009, Stewart was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in excess of 50 grams, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On appeal, Stewart argues the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) enacted August 3, 2010, also known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>as Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, requires a sentence reduction because the FSA lowers Stewart\u2019s applicable Guidelines range. He also argues that not reducing his sentence under the FSA is an Equal Protection violation. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a Guidelines range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. The amendment must \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). However, when a defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a mandatory minimum sentence, a future change to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence does not apply retroactively. <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">At the time of Stewart\u2019s guilty plea, his applicable Guideline range was 140-175 months with a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. The district judge, after weighing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, decided to vary downward as much as possible and imposed the mandatory minimum sentence. Therefore, Stewart is ineligible<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a sentence reduction because the district court based his sentence on the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">Stewart\u2019s argument that failing to apply the FSA retroactively to defendants sentenced before its effective date violates the Equal Protection Clause is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Hanna, </em>153 F.3d 1286, 1288-89 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Byse, </em>28 F.3d 1165, 1170 (11th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Sorondo, </em>845 F.2d 945, 947-48 (11th Cir.1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>does not support Stewart\u2019s equal protection argument because that decision does not address either equal protection or defendants sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>See generally Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stewart\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">. We review for an abuse of discretion whether the district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was proper. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-8\"><em>. </em>Stewart's challenge also fails because a change to the applicable Guidelines range such as Amendment 750, which was promulgated by Congress, is outside the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it was not a change made by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Since these changes were effectuated by Congress and not the Sentencing Commission, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is inapplicable to Stewart\u2019s case. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Moreover, Amendment 750, which was made to apply retroactively by Amendment 759, only applies to defendants sentenced after the enactment of the FSA. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012); <em>see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013). Hence, Stewart is ineligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 750 does not apply retroactively in his case. <em>See Berry </em>701 F.3d at 377; <em>Hippolyte </em>712 F.3d at 542; <em>see also Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1027-19\">.
