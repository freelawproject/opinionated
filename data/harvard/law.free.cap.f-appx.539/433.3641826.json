For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-23\">Menson filed this claim on March 2, 2012, alleging that his former employers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the City of Baton Rouge and the DPW, unlawfully terminated him on the basis of age and race. After filing multiple charges of discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and the Louisiana Commission on Human Rights (\u201cLCHR\u201d), Menson received a final Dismissal and Notice of Rights from the EEOC on September 6, 2011. The Notice informed Menson that he must file suit within ninety days of receipt of the Notice in order to retain his right to sue on that charge. On November 28, 2011, Menson requested a ninety-day extension. The EEOC denied this request verbally in a telephone call. This denial was further confirmed in an undated letter that stated as follows: \u201cThis will confirm our telephone conversation of today wherein you were advised that the EEOC could not extend the ninety days to file a lawsuit in the subject charge of employment discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Menson filed this complaint against the City of Baton Rouge and the DPW on March 2, 2012, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1969 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the Louisiana'Employment Discrimination Law (\u201cLEDL\u201d), La. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 23:301 <em>et seq., </em>La.Rev.Stat. 23:967 Louisiana Whistleblower Statute, and La.Rev.Stat. 30:2027 (Louisiana Environmental Whistleblower Statute). The district court dismissed his claims on the basis of prescription. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Menson\u2019s claims under Title VII and the ADEA have prescribed. Once a plaintiff has received a right to sue letter from the EEOC, he has ninety days to file a suit or he loses the right to pursue his claims. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 376, 379 (5th Cir.2002); <em>St. Louis v. Texas Worker\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n, </em>65 F.3d 43, 47 (5th Cir.1995). We strictly construe the ninety-day limitation period. <em>Taylor, </em>296 F.3d at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Menson argues that the letter confirming the denial of his extension of time request was ambiguous and constituted his actual right to sue letter, with the ninety-day deadline starting upon its receipt. However, the letter clearly explains, \u201cyour dismissal and notice of rights was issued on September 6, 2011.\u201d It then provides a copy of the instructions that were attached to the September 6th letter, explaining the ninety-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Menson is correct that the equitable tolling doctrine can, in rare circumstances, serve to suspend prescription. <em>Teemac v. Henderson, </em>298 F.3d 452, 457 (5th Cir.2002). We apply this doctrine, however, \u201conly sparingly,\u201d <em>Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). It is not appropriate here, where Menson knew of his rights and failed to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">It is also undisputed that more than one year has passed between the last act of which Menson complained and the time he filed the complaint; therefore, his state claims have also prescribed. <em>See, e.g., Rubinstein v. Adm\u2019rs of Tulane, </em>58 F.Supp.2d 702, 708 (E.D.La.1998) <em>aff'd in part, remanded sub nom. Rubinstein v. Adm\u2019rs of Tulane Educ. Fund, </em>218 F.3d 392 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Langley v. Pinkerton\u2019s Inc., </em>220 F.Supp.2d 575, 581 (M.D.La.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Menson\u2019s claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
