In 2011, Hernandez received a sentence of time served and two years of supervised release, following his guilty-plea conviction for escape. During his supervised-release period, however, Hernandez was arrested for the new crime of \u201cIllegal Barter/Expend Invest in Marijuana Over 50 Pounds\u201d. He pleaded guilty ultimately to conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute. Subsequently, the district court found he had violated six conditions of his supervised release, revoked it, and sentenced him to 24 months in prison, to be served consecutively to the 108 months imposed for the new drug-conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>trict court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Hernandez does not claim procedural error. Instead, he maintains only that the challenged sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The district court may impose a sentence that falls within the maximum term of imprisonment allowed by statute for the revocation sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Hernandez\u2019s 24-month sentence, which is within both the statutory maximum prison term and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy-statement sentencing range, is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 427-28 (5th Cir.2008); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In addition, the district court had the discretion to impose a consecutive sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 929-30 (5th Cir.2001). The court considered the relevant sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when exercising its discretion to impose consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) and (b); <em>Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 929-30. The decision to impose the sentence consecutively also accords with the recommendations set forth in the Guidelines \u201cRevocation of Probation and Supervised Release\u201d policy statement and commentary. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), p.s.; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 7B1.3, p.s., comment, (n.4). Furthermore, the sentence imposed is supported by Hernandez\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his violation of the terms of his supervised release after being sentenced for his underlying escape conviction. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
