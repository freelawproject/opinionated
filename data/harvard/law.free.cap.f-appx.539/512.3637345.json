He contends that a special condition of supervised release imposing drug treatment and testing must be deleted from the written judgment because it was not part of the sentence announced orally in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-21\">\u201cA defendant has a constitutional right to be present at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001). Therefore, when a conflict exists between a sentence pronounced orally in court and a later written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cStandard\u201d conditions of supervised release need not be announced orally, but when, as here, a written judgment contains a \u201cspecial\u201d condition of supervised release that was not contained in the oral pronouncement of sentence, the written judgment must be reformed by deleting the special condition. <em>Id. </em>at 936; <em>Martinez, </em>250 F.3d at 942. Although we ordinarily review for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006), Hernandez suggests our review should be de novo. We need not address that contention, however, Hernandez prevails under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The government relies on <em>Torres-Aguilar </em>to argue that the written drug-treatment condition is \u201crecommended by the Sentencing Guidelines [and thus] does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d at 938. Unlike the objective and undisputed factors relevant to imposing the dangerous-weapon prohibition in <em>Torres-Aguilar, </em>however, the subjective factors relevant to imposing the drug-treatment condition here are \u201cnot so clear as to transform\u201d this special condition into a standard condition. <em>Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Hernandez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED; his sentence is VACATED in PART; and this matter is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to conform the written judgment to the oral pronouncement at sentencing, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
