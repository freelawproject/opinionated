He argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying, without holding an evidentiary hearing, his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel based on a claim that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal, a defendant must show that the failure to file fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that it prejudiced the defendant. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477-80, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Failing to file a notice when requested to do so can constitute deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">A district court may deny a \u00a7 2255 motion without conducting a hearing only if \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief[.]\u201d \u00a7 2255(b); <em>United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992). Contested factual issues may not be decided on the basis of affidavits alone unless the affidavits are supported by other evidence in the record. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>635 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir.1981). A district court\u2019s decision to deny an evidentiary hearing is reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Nothing in the record outside of counsel\u2019s affidavit directly refutes Pena-Garavi-to\u2019s unsworn declaration, made under penalty of perjury, that he asked counsel to file an appeal. Moreover, Pena-Garavito\u2019s unsworn declaration, made under penalty of perjury, carried the same \u201cforce and effect\u201d as counsel\u2019s affidavit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746; <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003). The fact that Pena-Garavito was advised of his right to appeal during sentencing and that counsel may have advised Pena-Garavito that he would not represent him on appeal does not preclude the possibility that Pena-Ga-ravito asked counsel to take on the ministerial task of filing a notice of appeal on his behalf. <em>See Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 477, 120 S.Ct. 1029. As the record fails to conclusively establish that Pena-Garavito did not instruct counsel to file a notice of appeal, the district court abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. The denial of Pena-Garavito\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for an evi-dentiary hearing on Pena-Garavito\u2019s claim that he instructed counsel to file a notice of appeal. Pena Garavito\u2019s motion for leave to supplement his appellate brief with a copy of his \u00a7 2255 motion is DENIED as his complete \u00a7 2255 motion is already contained in the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
