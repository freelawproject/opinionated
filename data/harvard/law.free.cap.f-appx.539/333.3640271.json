Cozby, </em>818 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Our jurisdiction is limited to appeals from \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), a decision that adjudicates fewer than all the claims may be considered on appeal if the district court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay and expressly directs entry of judgment. A district court satisfies the requirements for entering an order of final judgment under Rule 54(b) \u201c[i]f the language in the order appealed from, either independently or together with related portions of the record referred to in the order, reflects the district court\u2019s unmistakable intent to enter a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b)....\u201d <em>Kelly v. Lee\u2019s Old Fashioned Hamburgers, Inc., </em>908 F.2d 1218, 1220 (5th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">The district court\u2019s order does not indicate that the district court intended for it to be a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b). <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, this court is without jurisdiction, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
