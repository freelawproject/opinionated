He claims the district court erred by enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b), because there was insufficient evidence on which to find that his attack was motivated by the victim\u2019s status as a federal officer and that the application of the six-level enhancement amounted to double-counting of the victim\u2019s status. Because Hashi preserved those arguments in the district court, we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The district court determined that Hashi was a career offender and applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to arrive at the total offense level. The court then upwardly departed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) based on its conclusion that Hashi\u2019s criminal history was underrepresented by the guidelines calculations. The six-level enhancement was not used to arrive at Hashi\u2019s total offense level, \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d and did not affect substantial rights. <em>See Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753; <em>see also United States v. Chon, </em>713 F.3d 812, 821 (5th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 9, 2013) (No. 13-50). Accordingly, any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
