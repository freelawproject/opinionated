Reyes challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of the offense, which was essentially a trespass. He contends that his 34-month sentence overstated his criminal history, his risk of recidivism, his danger to the public, and the seriousness of his offense, and that the district court misweighed the \u00a7 3553 factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We have rejected the argument that illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense that is treated too harshly under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). The district court considered Reyes\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the other statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), in particular Reyes\u2019s criminal history of a conviction for attempted robbery, numerous DUI offenses, and a resisting arrest offense, and determined that he was a danger to the public. Reyes\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Reyes has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentences of 34 months. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
