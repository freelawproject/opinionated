We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">The sequence that led to Thomas\u2019s arrest began with Defendantr-Appellee Officer Barber\u2019s investigatory stop of Thomas when responding to a report of a fight and a large crowd at the scene of a shooting that had occurred hours earlier. On appeal, Thomas argues that the district court erroneously determined that Officer Barber had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to support the investigatory stop. Although Thomas\u2019s complaint does not allege that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by Officer Barber\u2019s investigatory stop, Thomas asserts that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the claims raised in his complaint is \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">We reject Thomas\u2019s argument that Officer Barber did not have reasonable suspicion to perform an investigatory stop. Thomas asserts that multiple reports directly to Officer Barber by citizens at the scene that Thomas possessed a gun could not provide a basis for reasonable suspicion. This argument ignores the totality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>of the circumstances surrounding Officer Barber\u2019s investigatory stop of Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">\u201cUnder <em>Terry v. Ohio</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and its progeny, a temporary investigative stop (a seizure of the person) is proper if the stop is based on reasonable suspicion \u2018that criminal activity may be afoot.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We determine whether a police officer had reasonable suspicion based on the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, Officer Barber and one other officer were the first responders to the scene of a murder that had occurred hours earlier following reports of a large crowd and a fight. No suspect had yet been apprehended, and the murder weapon had not been recovered. When the officers arrived, there was a crowd of dozens people. A fight was taking place. By Thomas\u2019s own admission, the scene was \u201chectic\u201d and \u201cintense.\u201d As soon as the officers exited their vehicles, several bystanders, including two that Officer Barber could identify by nickname, shouted that someone in or around Thomas\u2019s vehicle \u201chad a gun.\u201d Accordingly, Officer Barber asked Thomas to come to the back of Thomas\u2019s vehicle in order to verify whether Thomas possessed a firearm. Officer Barber then attempted to conduct a pat-down search of Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Viewed together, these facts are more than sufficient to support Officer Barber\u2019s investigatory stop of Thomas. Thomas\u2019s lone argument to the contrary \u2014 that eyewitness tips are the equivalent of anonymous tips submitted over the phone \u2014 is not persuasive. This circuit and other circuits have recognized that face-to-face reports are qualitatively different from anonymous, telephoned tips.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taking into account the recent murder that occurred at the same scene, the fact that a fight was taking place, the scene\u2019s otherwise hectic and crowded nature, and the eyewitness reports that someone in Thomas\u2019s vehicle possessed a firearm, Officer Barber had reasonable suspicion to conduct the investigatory stop.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
