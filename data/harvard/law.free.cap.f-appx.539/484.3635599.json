He contends that the district court erred when it denied him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Esquivel argues that he satisfied the requirements for acceptance of responsibility because he pleaded guilty, admitted his participation in the offense, and provided a detailed account of his conduct after the presen-tence report was prepared and at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-22\">\u201cWhile the district court\u2019s findings under the sentencing guidelines are generally reviewed for clear error, a determination whether a defendant is entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed with even greater deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d 274, 287 (5th Cir.2007). \u2018We will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1 unless the decision is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The district court denied Esquivel\u2019s request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction noting that although Esquivel pleaded guilty, he did not admit to the elements of the offense during the presen-tence interview. The district court reasoned that the presentence interview statement could not be corrected by Esquivel\u2019s subsequent confession to the court and that Esquivel had continued to minimize his knowledge of the offense by providing as little information as he thought necessary. Above all because defense counsel at sentencing acknowledged that Esquivel \u201cdid not elaborate the complete role that he played,\u201d Esquivel has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was without foundation. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
