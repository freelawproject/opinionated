Glas-cock and Faye Glascock, husband and wife (the \u201cGlaseocks\u201d) sued Defendant-Appel-lee Medical Depot, Incorporated (\u201cMedical Depot\u201d) for damages incurred by Mr. Glas-cock when he fell from a \u201ccane seat\u201d \u2014 a walking cane that folds out to become a seat \u2014 manufactured by Medical Depot. The Glaseocks advanced claims under the Louisiana Products Liability Act grounded in improper design, construction, and failure to warn; and, alternatively, under <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>Medical Depot filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the Glaseocks\u2019 claims. Following the parties\u2019 submission of summary judgment evidence, including testimony of competing experts, the district court entered judgment in favor of Medical Depot, dismissing the Glaseocks\u2019 action, and they appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We have carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the district court\u2019s patiently detailed Ruling on Motion for Summary Judgment, all of which convinces us that the district court\u2019s judgment was providently granted. Even though the Glas-cocks\u2019 evidence presented issues of disputed fact, it does not rise to the level required to make such disputes \u201cgenuine,\u201d as required to avoid summary judgment. The Glaseocks might have been able to meet the standard of genuine issues of disputed fact had they adduced a deeper and broader quality of evidence, particularly their expert testimony, but they failed to do so in both their products liability claim and their assertion of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>\u2014 as surgically analyzed and rejected by the district court in its aforesaid Ruling. For essentially the same reasons and reasoning set forth therein, that court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Ciu. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
