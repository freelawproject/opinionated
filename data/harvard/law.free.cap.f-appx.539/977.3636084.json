We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">White pled guilty to distribution of more than 50 grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack-cocaine\u201d) and was sentenced for the offense in November 2004. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated White\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). However, because White was a career offender, his guideline range was calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After receiving a departure for substantial assistance, he was sentenced to 160 months of imprisonment. In 2011, White filed a \u00a7 3582(c) motion based on Amendment 750 and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. After the government responded, the district court determined White was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c) reduction based on Amendment 750, because his sentence was based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, which Amendment 750 amended. Further, the FSA was not applicable because White was sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. Thus, the court determined he was not entitled to a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">On appeal, White argues he was entitled to a sentence reduction notwithstanding his career offender status. Citing to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he argues he was sentenced based on \u00a7 2D1.1(c), which was amended by Amendment 750, because \u00a7 2D1.1(c) remained a point of reference throughout the process of calculating his guideline range and determining whether any departure or variance was warranted. White argues we should not rely on our decision in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012), in the instant case because that decision relies unduly on Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman, </em>which was not the controlling opinion in the case, does not specifically address career offenders, and lacks any in-depth analysis of the FSA\u2019s background. White further argues that he was entitled to be resentenced under the FSA, which decreased the mandatory minimums with respect to crack-cocaine offenses. In his reply brief, White also argues that <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012), and <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 12-10828 (U.S. June 12, 2013), are distinguishable from his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319. Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that a career offender is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected a career offender\u2019s argument that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>the holding of <em>Moore </em>was overruled, such that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, notwithstanding his sentence being based on the career offender guideline. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319-21. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(e)(2) relief. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. We determined that neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Thus, we held <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule Moore\u2019s holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his guideline range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment because <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue that arose in <em>Moore. Id. </em>Accordingly, we held Lawson, a career offender, was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his guideline range based on \u00a7 4B1.1 was not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">In <em>Berry, </em>we addressed the applicability of Amendment 750 and the FSA in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 701 F.3d at 376-77. Berry was convicted of a crack-cocaine offense and sentenced in 2002, and his initial guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1(b), not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 376. On appeal, we held that the district court did not have the authority to grant Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 377. In addition, we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the FSA, determining the FSA was not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it did not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Even assuming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we continued, his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002 and the FSA did not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentences. <em>Id. </em>We pointed out that the general savings clause in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 states the repeal of a statute shall not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty incurred under that statute unless the repealing act expressly so provides. <em>Id. </em>We then agreed with \u201cevery other circuit to address the issue\u201d that there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before the August 3, 2010, date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), noting that <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">In <em>Hippolyte, </em>we rejected Hippolyte\u2019s arguments that (1) Congress intended for the FSA to apply to drug-crime sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for the same reasons articulated in <em>Dorsey, </em>and (2) it would be inconsistent to apply the more lenient sentencing ranges of Amendment 750, but keep the harsh pre-FSA mandatory m\u00ednimums in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding involving a defendant sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment. 712 F.3d at 539-40, 542. We determined that <em>Berry </em>was indistinguishable from Hippolyte\u2019s case, and thus, the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties did not apply to his case. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">In the instant case, the district court correctly denied White\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750. Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ment 750 reduced the base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, not in \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750; U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748; <em>see also Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. White was initially assigned a base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, but his total offense level and guideline range were based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, because he was a career offender. Thus, Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range upon which White\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. As <em>Freeman </em>did not abrogate our prior holding \u2014 that defendants sentenced as career offenders, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, were not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions where their guideline ranges were unaffected by a retroactive amendment \u2014 the district court properly determined that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a reduction in White\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Although White argues that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the FSA, <em>Berry </em>forecloses White\u2019s argument. As we stated in <em>Berry, </em>the FSA is not a guideline amendment, and thus, White is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the FSA. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376-77. Here, White appears to argue that <em>Berry </em>is distinguishable because he is seeking to reduce his sentence based both on Amendment 750 and the FSA. However, as discussed above, Amendment 750 has no application here because it does not lower White\u2019s guideline range. Further, although White argues that the FSA applies retroactively in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding for the same reasons articulated in <em>Dorsey, </em>we have previously rejected such an argument in <em>Berry </em>and <em>Hippolyte, </em>as nothing in <em>Dorsey </em>suggests that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78; <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 539-40, 542. Thus, the FSA does not apply to White\u2019s case, and he has not shown that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because he has not shown that an amendment to the Guidelines has the effect of reducing his sentence. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying White\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
