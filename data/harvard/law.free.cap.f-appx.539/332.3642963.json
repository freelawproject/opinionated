An IFP movant must demonstrate that he or she is a pauper and that the appeal is not frivolous. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Moye and Johnson also move to seal their IFP motions. Gidget Lewis\u2019s appeal was previously dismissed for want of prosecution. All of the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the defendants were liable under the Texas wrongful death statute and pursuant to a survival action for the death of Andrea Lewis, who was Gidget\u2019s son and Moye and Johnson\u2019s grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">We review the issue of standing de novo. <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Knox Park Constr., Inc., </em>488 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.2007). In their appellate brief, Moye and Johnson allege for the first time on appeal that they raised Andrea since he was two years old and Gidget designated them as Andrea\u2019s managing conservators by executing an irrevocable power of attorney. They argue that they should therefore be treated as if they were Andrea\u2019s parents. We generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000). Even if we were to consider this argument, Moye and Johnson have failed to show that they have standing to sue as conservators under either the Texas wrongful death statute or in a survival action. <em>Pratho v. Zapata, </em>157 S.W.3d 832, 846 (Tex.App.2005); <em>Taylor v. Parr, </em>678 S.W.2d 527, 529 (Tex.App.1984). Although they also argue in their reply brief for the first time that they have the right under a power of attorney to sue on behalf of Andrea and/or Gidget, we cannot consider an argument based upon facts that were not before the district court at the time of the challenged ruling. <em>See Taita Chem. Co. v. Westlake Styrene Corp., </em>246 F.3d 377, 384 n. 9 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Moye and Johnson have not shown that their appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Moye and Johnson\u2019s motions for leave to proceed IFP on appeal are DENIED, their motion to seal their IFP motions is DENIED, and their appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
