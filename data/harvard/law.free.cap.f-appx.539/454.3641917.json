In response to Cleco\u2019s initial motion for summary judgment, the court dismissed Burgess\u2019s claims under Title VII, the ADEA, and the state statutes in question, leaving in place his claims for failure to promote, racial discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-23\">Over objections from Burgess, the court entertained a second motion for summary judgment by Cleco which the court granted, dismissing Burgess\u2019s remaining claims. The district court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the summary judgment evidence proffered by Burgess was uniformly conclu-sional and irrelevant, never rising to a level sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact in opposition to Cleco\u2019s summary judgment evidence and legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-24\">Our review of the record on appeal, including briefs of counsel for the parties and the district court\u2019s admirably patient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>detailed, and comprehensive 22-page Memorandum Ruling, leaves us with no doubt but that Burgess has failed to support his insistence on appeal that the district court committed reversible error in hearing and granting Cleco\u2019s motions for summary judgment and dismissing all claims asserted on his behalf as wholly wanting in fact and in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As counsel for Burgess did not bother to file a reply brief, we reiterate \u2014 and adopt \u2014 the Summary of the Argument from the brief of Appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">A. <em>Allowing Cleco To File A Second Motion for Summary Judgment </em>Was <em>Proper: </em>The district court did not err in allowing Cleco to file a second motion for summary judgment because it had the discretion to do so, even with no new facts presented or changes in the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">B. <em>Burgess Offers Insufficient Facts and Legal Authority. </em>Burgess asserts the district court erred in its decision, but fails to support his arguments with accurate citations to material facts and legal authority, thus waiving many of his arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">C. <em>Dismissal Of Burgess\u2019s Failure To Promote Claims Was Proper. </em>The district court properly dismissed Burgess\u2019s failure to promote claims because he abandoned them and they are untimely. It properly dismissed Burgess\u2019s allegation regarding the 2008 Director-Marketing and Contracts position because it is actually a failure to hire claim that is untimely and because Burgess conceded that he never applied for the position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">D. <em>Dismissal Of Burgess\u2019s Pay Discrimination Claim Was Proper. </em>The district court properly dismissed Burgess\u2019s pay discrimination \u25a0 claim because Burgess has no evidence of pretext sufficient to rebut Cleco\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. Additionally, Cleco demonstrated that the claim is untimely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">E. <em>Dismissal Of Burgess\u2019s Miscellaneous Racial Discrimination And Retaliation Claims </em>Was <em>Proper. </em>The district court property dismissed Burgess\u2019s miscellaneous discrimination and retaliation claims because he abandoned them, because they are untimely, and because they are without merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">F. <em>Dismissal Of Burgess\u2019s Hostile Work Environment Claims Was Proper. </em>The district court properly dismissed Burgess\u2019s hostile work environment claims finding Burgess could not prove that he was subjected to unwelcome harassment or that the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive. Additionally, Cleco demonstrated that Burgess\u2019s hostile work environment claim is untimely and the complained of conduct was not race-based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">G. <em>Dismissal Of Burgess\u2019s Constructive Discharge Claim </em>Was <em>Proper. </em>The district court properly dismissed Burgess\u2019s constructive discharge claim because he did not present evidence that the working conditions at Cleco were so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. Additionally, Cleco demonstrated that the claim is untimely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">For these reasons and those detailed in the district court\u2019s aforesaid Memorandum Ruling, its dismissal of Burgess\u2019s action is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
