Vega first argues that the district court erred in its resolution of his motion for a downward departure. We, however, lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downwardly. <em>See United States v. Sam, </em>467 F.3d 857, 861 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">Next, Vega contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he was only a \u201cpassive participant\u201d in -viewing child pornography on a personal computer and because the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similarly situated defendants, as mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), supports a below-guidelines sentence. The district court was aware of these allegedly mitigating circumstances but concluded that a sentence of 210 months was appropriate based on all of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Further, Vega has failed to show that any sentencing disparity was unwarranted given that he provides no information regarding the records of other defendants and given the district court\u2019s particular emphasis on his \u201cheavy\u201d use of the file sharing network and the number of images he downloaded. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006). Vega thus fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise, and his \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to [his] sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
