While Lozman\u2019s appeal of the dismissal was pending, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>district court entered an Order awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the then prevailing defendants. In April 2018 we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal, but did not address the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla., </em>713 F.3d 1066 (11th Cir.2013). Defendants argue that, by virtue of our reversal, Loz-man\u2019s appeal is \u201cnow moot.\u201d Lozman agrees, and asks this Court to reverse the district court\u2019s order awarding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">While the parties have filed notices describing Lozman\u2019s appeal as moot, their concessions are not legally dispositive. <em>See Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., </em>525 U.S. 249, 253, 119 S.Ct. 685, 687, 142 L.Ed.2d 648 (1999). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a case is moot. <em>Tanner Adver. Group, L.L.C. v. Fayette Cnty., Ga., </em>451 F.3d 777, 784 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">\u201cThe rule that federal courts may not decide cases that have become moot derives from Article Ill\u2019s case and controversy requirement.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. EPA, </em>315 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>BankWest, Inc. v. Baker, </em>446 F.3d 1358, 1364 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). \u201cWhen events subsequent to the commencement of a lawsuit create a situation in which the court can no longer give the plaintiff meaningful relief, the case is moot and must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Florida Ass\u2019n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. State of Florida Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Rehab. Servs., </em>225 F.3d 1208, 1217 (11th Cir.2000). Further, \u201c[t]his case-or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 1253, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">As the district court\u2019s final order directing Lozman to pay defendants attorney\u2019s fees has not been vacated, there is \u201cmeaningful relief\u2019 we can provide to Lozman on appeal. Therefore, his appeal is not moot. <em>See Florida Ass\u2019n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc., </em>225 F.3d at 1217. Because we reversed the district court order upon which the award of attorneys fees was based, we now vacate the court\u2019s order awarding defendants attorneys fees and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">Lozman\u2019s brief also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his recusal motion. However, that issue is not properly before us. As Lozman acknowledges in his July 9, 2013 filing, the recusal motion was part of a separate, appeal, No. 13-10252, which he voluntarily dismissed. For that reason, we will not consider his arguments on that issue. <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">. Defendants are Michael Brown, Gloria Shuttlesworth, Norma Duncombe, Vanessa Lee, Elizabeth Wade, Ann lies, George Carter, and the City of Riviera Beach, Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
