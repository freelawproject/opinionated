He argues that the district court erred by denying him a three-level downward adjustment to his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. He asserts that the district court incorrectly characterized as frivolous his objection to a four-level upward adjustment under \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)(A) for knowing or having reason to know that the firearms his group purchased from undercover agents were intended to be transported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The denial of the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008). First, Delarosa refused to answer questions during his interview with the probation officer about the destination of the firearms or the purpose for which they were being purchased. Second, the transcripts of surveillance videos indicated that Delarosa either knew or should have known that the firearms were destined for Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
