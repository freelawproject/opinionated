FIVE-STEP SEQUENTIAL EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">A claimant for Social Security benefits must prove that she is disabled. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Under the five-step sequential evaluation used to determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) if so, whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in the Listing of Impairments; (4) if not, whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform her past relevant work; and (5) if not, whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, the claimant can perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4) <em>&amp; </em>(g), 404.1560(c), 416.920(a)(4) &amp; (g), 416.960(c). The claimant bears the burden to prove the first four steps. If the claimant does so, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to prove the fifth step. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">II. HICKEL\u2019S CASE BEFORE THE ALJ</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Here the ALJ determined at steps one and two that Hickel had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since birth and had the severe impairment of mild mental retardation. At step three, the ALJ con-eluded that Hickel\u2019s impairment of mild mental retardation did not meet or equal a listed impairment, specifically the mental retardation listing in C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.05 (2012) (\u201cListing 12.05\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">At step four, the ALJ concluded that Hickel had the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, but with the non-exertional limitations that she perform only simple, unskilled, repetitive work and be given verbal instructions. The ALJ further concluded that, based on Hickel\u2019s RFC, Hickel could perform her past relevant work as a nursery school attendant. Alternatively, the ALJ determined at step five that Hickel could perform other work, such as small product assembler, hand packer, or eye glass assembler, based on the testimony of the vocational expert. Thus, the ALJ concluded that Hickel was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">III.HICKEL\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">On appeal, Hickel argues that: (1) substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that her mental retardation did not meet or equal the criteria in Listing 12.05; (2) the ALJ improperly rejected the opinion of Dr. Michael Eastridge, her consulting, examining psychologist; and (3) the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert improperly included non-existent past relevant work and failed to account for Hickel\u2019s moderate limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>ALJ\u2019s determination at step three that Hickel\u2019s mental retardation did not meet the criteria in Listing 12.05. We further conclude that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion, which requires that the case be returned to the Commissioner for further consideration at steps four and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">A. Substantive Evidence Supports the ALJ\u2019s Finding at Step Three</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">To \u201cmeet\u201d a listing at step three, the claimant must have an impairment that \u201csatisfies all of the criteria of that listing, including any relevant criteria in the introduction, and meets the duration requirement.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1525(c)(3), 416.925(c)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Listing 12.05 contains an introduction that includes the \u201cdiagnostic description for mental retardation\u201d and also \u201cfour sets of criteria\u201d in paragraphs A through D. <em>Id. </em>pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.00(A) (2012). If the claimant\u2019s mental impairment \u201csatisfies the diagnostic description ... and any one of the four sets of criteria\u201d in Listing 12.05, then the claimant\u2019s impairment meets the mental retardation listing, and the claimant is presumed disabled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Listing 12.05\u2019s introduction states that \u201cmental retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period; i.e., the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age 22.\u201d <em>Id. </em>pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.05 (2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relevant to this appeal, the claimant\u2019s mental retardation satisfies the criteria in paragraph C of Listing 12.05 when there is: (1) a \u201cvalid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70\u201d; and (2) \u201ca physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12.05(C); <em>see also Hodges v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 1265, 1269 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[A] claimant meets the criteria for presumptive disability under Listing 12.05(C) when the claimant presents a valid I.Q. score of 60 to 70 and evidence of additional mental or physical impairment.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">This Court has concluded that a valid IQ score of 60 to 70 after age 22 \u201ccreate[s] a rebuttable presumption of a fairly constant IQ throughout [a claimant\u2019s] life.\u201d <em>Hodges, </em>276 F.3d at 1268 (explaining that, absent evidence of sudden trauma that could cause retardation, a claimant who presents a valid IQ score need not also present evidence that her mental impairment arose before age 22). However, \u201ca valid I.Q. score need not be conclusive of mental retardation where the I.Q. score is incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>sistent with other evidence in the record on the claimant\u2019s daily activities and behavior.\u201d <em>Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 887 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also Popp v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 1497, 1499-1500 (11th Cir.1986) (stating that the ALJ may disregard IQ test results that are inconsistent with other record evidence because the regulations require the ALJ to examine intelligence tests and other evidence, such as the medical report and the claimant\u2019s daily activities and behavior).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding at step three that Hickel did not meet the requirements of Listing 12.05. The ALJ acknowledged that Hickel has a valid IQ score between 60 and 70.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the ALJ applied the presumption established in <em>Hodges, </em>but further found that the presumption was rebutted by other evidence that showed that Hickel did not have \u201cdeficits in adaptive functioning,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">Since the claimant has a valid full scale IQ score of 63 as an adult and valid full scale IQ scores of 59 and 65 as a ehild[,] [t]he claimant is entitled to the benefit of the rebuttable presumption established in <em>Hodges. </em>However, the undersigned finds that there is sufficient evidence to rebut that presumption. For example, the claimant works part time, has friends, attends church regularly, and drives. Moreover, the claimant has no limitations in her ability to care for her personal needs as she is able to prepare simple meals, groom herself, dress herself, toilet, and bathe herself. Her parents reported that she has friends in her neighborhood and takes care of her grooming. Although the claimant reported that she was in special education classes while in school, she graduated from high school. Since the undersigned finds the claimant does not have deficits in adaptive functioning, the criteria of 12.05 are not met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">(record citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">There is evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s findings with respect to Hickel\u2019s daily activities and behavior. Hickel does not dispute that she is a high school graduate, she works part time at a nursery, she drives herself to work, she can prepare simple meals and dress and groom herself, she attends church regularly, and she socializes with friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Moreover, three medical sources \u2014 Dr. Colleen Morgan (psychologist), who examined Hickel and administered an IQ test in 2009,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Drs. Martha Putney (non-examining psychologist) and Nancy Dinwoodie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>(non-examining medical doctor), who completed mental RFC assessments \u2014 all determined based on Hickel\u2019s better-than-expected functional capacity that Hickel\u2019s mental impairment was more consistent with borderline intellectual functioning than mild mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Similarly, Dr. Mark Klisch \u2014 a psychologist who administered an IQ test in 2001\u2014 noted that Hickel\u2019s composite score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale was \u201cabove her intellectual level and suggests a relatively greater ability to live independently than would be predicted from her formal intelligence testing scores.\u201d Dr. Klisch explained that although Hickel\u2019s \u201cformal academic skills pulled down her scores,\u201d her relatively strong interpersonal skills and independent living skills indicated that her adaptive functioning is \u201cquite a bit higher than would be predicted on the basis of her formal IQ scores.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Additionally, Dr. Michael Eastridge\u2014 who performed a psychological evaluation and administered an IQ test in 2011\u2014 noted that although Hickel had intellectual functioning in the mildly retarded range throughout her life, she had \u201cconsistently functioned, in her activities of daily living, at a level that is higher than expected, given her IQ scores.\u201d Thus, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hickel lacked the required level of deficits in adaptive functioning to meet Listing 12.05.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">B. Steps Four and Five \u2014 Dr. Eas-tridge\u2019s Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">In determining at steps four and five whether a claimant can perform her past relevant work or other work in the economy, the ALJ must determine a claimant\u2019s RFC by considering all relevant medical and other evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). In assessing RFC, the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given different medical opinions and the reasons for doing so. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). Without this explanation, a reviewing court cannot determine whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. Although the ALJ\u2019s explanation of the decision need not account for every piece of evidence, <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005), it must sufficiently explain the weight given to \u201cobviously probative exhibits.\u201d <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">In evaluating medical opinions, the ALJ considers factors such as the examining relationship, the treating relationship, the doctor\u2019s specialization, whether the opinion is amply supported, and whether the opinion is consistent with the record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c). Generally, the opinions of examining physicians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>are given more weight than non-examining physicians, and the opinions of treating physicians are given more weight than non-treating physicians. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(1)-(2), 416.927(c)(1)-(2). The opinions of nonexamining physicians are entitled to little weight when they are contrary to those of an examining physician, and, taken alone, they do not constitute substantial evidence. <em>Spencer ex rel. Spencer v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 1090, 1094 (11th Cir.1985). However, the ALJ may reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Here, Hickel argues that the ALJ improperly evaluated the opinion of Dr. Eastridge. Dr. Eastridge is a consulting, board certified clinical psychologist who performed a psychological evaluation of Hickel and conducted IQ and neuropsycho-logical tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">In his resulting report, Dr. Eastridge diagnosed Hickel with mild mental retardation and ADHD inattentive type. Dr. Eastridge administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \u2014 Fourth Edition (WAIS4) IQ test. Hickel\u2019s full scale score was 68, the same as her previous adult IQ testing. However, Dr. Eastridge conducted additional tests, including the Conners\u2019 Continuous Performance Test, the logical memory subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale \u2014 Revised (WMSR), and the working memory subtests of the WAIS4, all of which showed significant weaknesses in Hickel\u2019s working memory, attention, and concentration. Hickel\u2019s score on the logical memory portion of the WMSR put her in the 2nd percentile for immediate and delayed recall of spoken information. Based on the results of the working memory subtests of the WAIS4, Hickel had a Working Memory Index of 60, which fell in the extremely low range or the .4 percentile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Dr. Eastridge conducted other tests, including the Wide Range Achievement Test 4, which showed that Hickel\u2019s word recognition, reading comprehension, and math calculation skills were at a second-grade level. Dr. Eastridge noted that Hickel\u2019s very low reading and math skills were not diagnosed as learning disabilities due to her low IQ, but that \u201ca child with Borderline intellectual ability, that is and [sic] IQ between 75 and 80, would be considered to have learning disabilities in reading and math.\u201d Dr. Eastridge also opined that, because tests showed that Hickel\u2019s attention, concentration, and pace were severely impaired, she would need to be supervised at all times at work and \u201ccould not perform at a productive pace in a job with deadlines, quotas, or time constraints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">The ALJ credited some portions of Dr. Eastridge\u2019s report and rejected others.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At issue in this appeal is the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion that Hickel was \u201cseverely impaired in reading and math skills and had impaired memory skills.\u201d The ALJ offered two reasons for rejecting this opinion: (1) Dr. Eastridge examined Hickel only based on her attorney\u2019s referral in \u201can effort to generate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>evidence for the current appeal\u201d and \u201cwas presumably paid for the report\u201d; and (2) Dr. Eastridge\u2019s \u201copinion is inconsistent with the record.\u201d For the following reasons, we conclude that neither of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Dr. Eas-tridge\u2019s opinion is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">With respect to the ALJ\u2019s first reason, there is no evidence in the record that Dr. Eastridge was \u201chired by [Hickel\u2019s] representative\u201d or was \u201cpaid for [his] report,\u201d as the ALJ states.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In fact, there is no evidence in the record as to how any of the medical sources were paid for their medical opinions. And, although the ALJ correctly noted that Dr. Eastridge was a \u201cone-time examining physician,\u201d that is true of all the examining psychologists who rendered an opinion, including Dr. Kliseh and Dr. Morgan, the Commissioner\u2019s own consulting psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Likewise, to the extent the ALJ rejected Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion because it was obtained \u201cin an effort to generate evidence\u201d about Hickel\u2019s mental impairments, that is also true of Dr. Morgan\u2019s opinion. Indeed, generating evidence is the purpose of obtaining opinions from medical sources, whether paid for by the Commissioner or by the claimant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513, 416.918 (explaining that medical sources provide evidence to establish whether the claimant has an impairment, the severity of the impairment, and what the claimant can still do despite the impairment). The fact that Dr. Eastridge was a one-time consultative examiner retained by the claimant rather than the Commissioner is not, standing alone, a valid basis for rejecting his medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">As to the ALJ\u2019s second reason, the ALJ did not identify what evidence in the record is inconsistent with Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion about Hickel\u2019s reading, math, and memory skills. Furthermore, our own review indicates that Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion is consistent with the other evidence of Hickel\u2019s academic and memory skills found in the record, including Dr. Eastridge\u2019s own standardized testing of these skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Both Hickel and her mother reported that Hickel had reading and math problems. Both stated that Hickel could read only \u201ceasy\u201d words and sentences, and could not write a grocery list or read a restaurant menu. Hickel testified that she could read first- and second-grade children\u2019s books, but did not understand what she was reading; she obtained her driver\u2019s license without taking a written test; she had someone help her complete her job applications; and she left one part-time position as a nursery worker after she was unable to complete an incident report about one child biting another child. In addition, Hickel\u2019s mother reported that her daughter had trouble following written instructions and that she (Hickel\u2019s mother) had filled out the Social Security Administration\u2019s forms for her daughter because her daughter was \u201cnot able to completely understand\u201d them due to her \u201creading problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">With respect to Hickel\u2019s math abilities, Hickel and her mother reported that her mother supervises Hickel\u2019s finances, including balancing her checkbook and paying bills, because Hickel cannot handle money matters. Hickel\u2019s mother also ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>companies her to the grocery store because she cannot count change or determine the balance on her food stamp card. Hickel testified that she could not add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Hickel and her mother also reported that Hickel had problems with memory and completing tasks and that she needed to be reminded to do things, such as brush her teeth or do her chores.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Hickel\u2019s school records also reflect problems with reading, math, concentration, and memory. As early as kindergarten, a school social worker, Mary Norris, reported that Hickel had trouble recognizing letters and matching numbers. After an evaluation by a psychologist, Hickel was placed in the speech/language resource program at school. Later in the school year, Hickel was tested by a language diagnostician and found eligible for the language impaired program. When Hickel was in the third grade, school psychologist Eleanor Franzese reported that Hickel was tested in reading and mathematics at a first-grade level and \u201cha[d] made minimal academic progress.\u201d Franzese also noted that Hickel \u201cexhibited a short attention span and difficulty concentrating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">In 1991, when Hickel was in fourth grade, Dr. Gerald Kurtz, a school psychologist, performed a psycho-educational evaluation. Among other things, Dr. Kurtz\u2019s testing showed memory deficits. For example, the Differential Ability Scales indicated that Hickel fell in the 8th percentile for recall of digits, the 27th percentile for recall of objects-immediate, and the 42nd percentile for recall of objects-delayed. The Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised indicated that Hickel was in the 22nd percentile for memory for names, the 7th percentile for memory for sentences, the 11th percentile for memory for words, and the 8th percentile for short-term memory. Dr. Kurtz stated that Hickel was \u201cable to retain information after repeated presentations of the same information.\u201d Dr. Kurtz\u2019s testing also showed that Hickel fell in the 4th percentile for broad reading, the 1st percentile for broad mathematics, and the .3 percentile for broad written language. Dr. Kurtz noted that Hickel had weaknesses in reading, mathematics, and written language, but that she \u201cwas able to demonstrate minimally adequate basic calculation skills,\u201d most likely because of her \u201cability to retain repeatedly presented information.\u201d At Dr. Kurtz\u2019s recommendation, Hickel was placed in the Educable Mentally Handicapped Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">When Hickel was a senior in high school, Dr. Klisch performed a psychological evaluation for the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. Dr. Klisch indicated that Hickel was in special education classes for math and English and could write only simple words and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Finally, Dr. Morgan, the Commissioner\u2019s own consulting, examining psychologist, indicated in her report that Hickel could not keep track of money and did not know how to count her change when she shopped. Dr. Morgan stated that Hickel was able to recall a three-word list immediately and five minutes later, which Dr. Morgan opined \u201csuggest[ed] no <em>severe </em>short-term or long-term memory impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (emphasis added.) However, Hickel was unable to spell the word \u201cworld\u201d forwards or backwards, which Dr. Morgan opined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>might be due to inappropriate attention or concentration, or her intellectual functioning. Hickel was also unable to complete simple math calculations. Further, both of the Commissioner\u2019s non-examining medical sources indicated in their mental RFC assessments that Hickel was limited in her ability to understand and remember detailed instructions. Dr. Putney opined that the limitation was moderate, while Dr. Dinwoodie opined that the limitation was marked.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">In short, the record as a whole is consistent with Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion that Hickel\u2019s math and reading abilities are severely impaired and that her working memory and her memory for spoken information are also impaired. Substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion on these points. We note also that the ALJ\u2019s decision failed to address Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion that Hickel would require close supervision and could not perform at a productive pace in a job with deadlines, quotas, or time constraints. This portion of Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion is particularly material because the three jobs the vocational expert identified as ones Hickel could perform appear to be production jobs. Given the obvious materiality of this part of Dr. Eastridge\u2019s opinion, the ALJ was required to address it explicitly. <em>See Co-wart, </em>662 F.2d at 735; <em>see also </em>SSR 96-8P, 1996 WL 374184, at *7 (July 2, 1996) (stating that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment must consider and address all medical source opinions, and if the RFC assessment conflicts with a medical source opinion, the ALJ \u201cmust explain why the opinion was not adopted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">We conclude that a remand is necessary so that the ALJ can reconsider her assessment of Hickel\u2019s RFC in light of Dr. Eas-tridge\u2019s opinion on these matters and then re-examine, at steps four and five, whether there is work Hickel can perform.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Additionally, given that neither consulting psychologist who completed a mental RFC assessment had the benefit of Dr. Eas-tridge\u2019s additional testing and report, the ALJ should obtain a new mental RFC assessment that considers all of the medical evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with instructions that it be returned to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">. Our review is limited to whether the Administrative Law Judge's decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. <em>Winschel </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019r of Soc.

On August 1, 2013, while this appeal was pending, the Social Security Administration amended Listing 12.05 by replacing the words \u201cmental retardation\u201d with \"intellectual disability.\u201d <em>See </em>78 Fed.Reg. 46,499, 46,501 (to be codified at 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt.

The Social Security Administration stated that the change \"does not affect the actual medical definition of the disorder or available programs or services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46,500. Because the amendment does not effect a substantive change, and to avoid confusion, this opinion uses the term \"mental retardation\u201d used by the parties and the ALJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. Hickel does not argue that her mental impairments functionally equal the criteria in Listing 12.05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">. The Social Security Administration\u2019s Program Operations Manual System (POMS) states that the phrase \"adaptive functioning\u201d refers to \"the individual\u2019s progress in acquiring mental, academic, social and personal skills as compared with other unimpaired individuals of his/her same age.\" POMS DI 24515.056(D)(2). Similarly, the American Psychiatric Association states that the phrase refers to how effectively an individual copes with the common demands of life and how well the individual meets the standards for personal independence expected of someone in her particular age group, sociocultural background, and community setting. <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR, </em>at 42 (4th ed.2000); <em>see also Talavera v. Astrue, </em>697 F.3d 145, 153 (2d Cir.2012) (explaining that the phrase \"adaptive functioning\u201d in Listing 12.05 refers to an individual\u2019s ability to cope with the challenges of ordinary life).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">. The regulations provide that \"standardized intelligence tests may provide data to help verify the presence of mental retardation,\u201d but the results of such tests \"are only part of the overall assessment\u201d and \"the narrative report that accompanies \u2022 the test results should comment on whether the IQ scores are considered valid and consistent with the developmental history and the degree of functional limitation.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.00(D)(6)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">. When there are multiple IQ scores, the ALJ uses \"the lowest of these in conjunction with 12.05.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.00(D)(6)(c). Hickel\u2019s lowest IQ score has consistently been her full scale score. In 1991, when Hickel was eight years old, she had a full scale IQ score of 59 under the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children \u2014 Revised. In 2001, Hickel\u2019s full scale IQ score was 63 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \u2014 Third Edition. Both times Hickel was tested after she turned 22 (in 2009 and 2011), her full scale IQ score remained 63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">.We note that Dr. Morgan, a postdoctoral resident, conducted the psychological evaluation and prepared the report. However, Dr. Morgan was directly supervised by Dr. Jeremy Zehr, and the report was submitted as joint work product of both psychologists. For ease of reference, however, this opinion refers to Dr. Morgan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">. Because substantial evidence supports the AO\u2019s finding that Hickel did not meet the \"deficits in adaptive functioning\u201d requirement in \u00a7 12.05\u2019s introduction, we do not address the AO's alternative finding that Hickel also did not have \u201ca physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant work-related limitation of function,\u201d as required by paragraph C of Listing 12.05. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1525(c)(3), 416.925(c)(3) (requiring the claimant to satisfy <em>both </em>the criteria in the introduction and the specific criteria to meet a listing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">. RFC is what a claimant can do in a work setting despite any physical, mental, or environmental limitations caused by the claimant\u2019s impairment and its related symptoms. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545(a), 416.945(a). RFC includes physical abilities, such as standing, sitting, or walking, and mental abilities, such as understanding, carrying out instructions, or responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers, or work pressure. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1545(b)-(c), 416.945(b)-(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">. Although Hickel suggests otherwise, the ALJ appears to have accepted Dr. Eastridge's diagnosis of mild mental retardation and his test results, given that the AU found that Hickel had the severe impairment of mild mental retardation and acknowledged Dr. Eastridge\u2019s full scale IQ testing result. The ALJ rejected Dr. Eastridge\u2019s diagnosis of ADHD, explaining that there was no other evidence in the record of a similar diagnosis or that Hickel had received treatment or taken medication for ADHD. The ALJ credited and gave great weight to Dr. Eastridge's opinion that Hickel's activities of daily living were within normal limits and that she consistently functioned at a higher level than expected given her IQ scores. The ALJ\u2019s reasons for the weight accorded to these portions of Dr. Eastridge's opinion are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">. Although not record evidence, Hickel's attorney represented to the Appeals Council that she recommended that Hickel seek a comprehensive psychological evaluation from Dr. Eastridge to determine the nature and extent of Hickel\u2019s functional limitations, but that Hickel\u2019s parents paid for the evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">. Hickel points out, and the Commissioner does not dispute, that the Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of Disability Adjudication and Review also frequently employs Dr. Eastridge as an expert witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">. The only standardized testing Dr. Morgan administered was the verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning subtests of the WAIS4. She did not administer the WAIS4 subtests that measure working memory or the logical memory subtests from the WMSR, both of which Dr. Eastridge later administered, and the AU did not discount. Thus, Dr. Morgan\u2019s statement \u2014 that Hickel's ability to recall a three-word list suggested no severe memory impairment \u2014 does not, by itself, constitute substantial evidence, nor is it even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>necessarily inconsistent with Dr. Eastridge\u2019s later test findings and opinion that Hickel\u2019s working memory and memory for the spoken word were impaired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">. Dr. Putney's mental RFC assessment inexplicably states that Hickel can count money, make change, use checks, and pay bills and thus \"is able to handle routine financial transactions.\u201d There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that Hickel could do any of these things; in fact, quite the opposite is true. Although the ALJ did not explicitly rely on Dr. Putney\u2019s opinion, we note that a non-examining source\u2019s medical opinion is accorded little weight if, as here, it contradicts an examining source\u2019s opinion and cannot, standing alone, constitute substantial evidence. <em>See Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 584 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), 416.927(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">. Because we remand for the ALJ to reconsider her RFC assessment in light of Dr. Eas-tridge\u2019s opinion, we do not address Hickel\u2019s third argument that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert improperly included non-existent past relevant work and did not adequately account for Hickel\u2019s moderate limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
