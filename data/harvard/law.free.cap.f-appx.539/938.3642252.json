Second, the Mroseks claim that the notice standard applied by the district court was too strict, and is inconsistent with the actual intent of the CWA and its interpretation by our sister circuits. After a thorough review of the briefs and the record, we reverse and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">In 1972, Congress enacted the CWA in order to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). \u201cSection 402 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342, provides for the issuance, by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by authorized States, of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.\u201d <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 174, 120 S.Ct. 693, 701, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). Such permits \u201cimpose limitations on the discharge of pollutants, and establish related monitoring and reporting requirements, in order to improve the cleanliness and safety of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d <em>Id., </em>120 S.Ct. at 701. Non-compliance with an NPDES <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>permit qualifies as a violation of the CWA. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">When an alleged violation occurs, the CWA expressly authorizes citizens to bring suit against the alleged offender, including the United States, a government instrumentality or agency, or administrator. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1365(a). At least 60 days before filing a complaint, plaintiffs must notify the alleged violators of their intent to sue. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1365(b)(1)(A); <em>see Nat\u2019l Envtl. Found. v. ABC Rail Corp., </em>926 F.2d 1096, 1097 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201c[T]he 60-day notice requirement of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(b) is a mandatory condition precedent to the filing of a citizen suit under the Clean Water Act.\u201d). Pre-suit notice must contain</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2q\">sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard, limitation, or order alleged to have been violated, the activity alleged to constitute a violation, the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation, the location of the alleged violation, the date or dates of such violation, and the full name, address, and telephone number of the person giving notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">40 C.F.R. 135.3(a). \u201cThe notice requirements are strictly construed to give the alleged violator the opportunity to correct the problem before a lawsuit is filed.\u201d. <em>Nat\u2019l Parks and Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Tenn. Valley Auth., </em>502 F.3d 1316, 1329 (11th Cir.2007). We review the sufficiency of pre-suit notice de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">We hold that the district court erred in concluding that the Mroseks\u2019 pre-suit notice was insufficient, as the Mroseks satisfied all the requisite components of pre-suit notice. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. 135.3(a). As a preliminary matter, the district court improperly concluded that the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (the \u201cBlue Book\u201d) and the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual (the \u201cGreen Book\u201d), which the Mroseks referred to in their pre-suit notice, had not been incorporated into Peachtree City\u2019s water management standards. To the contrary, Peachtree City\u2019s Notice of Intent (NOI) \u2014 under which it sought and obtained a municipal NPDES permit from the state of Georgia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 explicitly states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-11\">[t]he City Engineering Department will inspect all publicly and privately owned BMPs (detention/retention ponds, im-poundments, stormwater wetlands, etc.) at a rate of one third of the city per year, to determine if they are in proper working condition and if any maintenance is required. <em>The City will use the checklists in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual to determine proper working condition.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">NOI App. E(B)(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">Moreover, the city\u2019s Code of Ordinances dealing with Water Resource Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>explicitly incorporates the Blue Book \u2014 albeit interchangeably referred to as the \u201cStormwater Design Manual\u201d \u2014 as the basis of many of the city\u2019s minimum standards and best practices, including its drainage, sedimentation control, and stormwater management. <em>See </em>Peachtree City, Ga., Code of Ordinances pt. II, app. B, art. X, \u00a7 1006(b)(1) (\u201cAll engineering design items for storm drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation control ... <em>shall meet the applicable minimum requirements of the Stormwater Design Manual.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1011(a)(6) (\u201cThe city will utilize the policy, criteria and information!,] including technical specifications and standards[,] <em>in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual </em>and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this ordinance.\u201d (emphasis added)). Peachtree City\u2019s Code of Ordinances also incorporates the Green Book. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1005.2(37) (stating that \u201cproperly designed\u201d soil erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control mechanisms must be \u201c[d]esigned in accordance with [the] ... requirements and specifications contained in the \u2018Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia\u2019 \u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1005.4(c) (\u201cThe rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to [the Erosion and Sedimentation Act,] O.C.G.A. \u00a7 12-7-1 [,] ... shall require, as a minimum, ... best management practices ... which are consistent with and no less stringent than ... the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">Further, the Mroseks\u2019 pre-suit notice letter cites to \u201cthe specific standard[s], limitation[s], or orderfs] alleged to have been violated.\u201d 40 C.F.R. 135.3(a). The Mroseks correctly identify each of the Blue Book and Green Book provisions that support the alleged violations, as well as the state regulations promulgated in accordance with the Georgia Water Quality Control Act with which Peachtree City, by its own ordinance terms, must comply. <em>See </em>Peachtree City, Ga., Code of Ordinances pt. II, app. B, art. X, \u00a7 1005.4(b)(3) (\u201cFailure to ... maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any ... permit issued ... pursuant to ... the \u2018Georgia Water Quality Control Act.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 12-5 \u2014 40 (\u201cThe Board of Natural Resources is empowered to adopt such rules, regulations, and procedures to be followed in applying for state grants authorized in this article as shall be necessary for the effective administration thereof.\u201d). The Mroseks also describe the conduct alleged to have constituted those violations, as well as the specific dates and the continuing nature of the alleged violations. <em>See </em>Peachtree City, Ga., Code of Ordinances pt. II, app. B, art. X, \u00a7 1005.4(b)(3) (\u201cFailure to ... maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation ... for each day on which such failure occurs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Finally, the Mroseks properly listed Peachtree City, its mayor, and the members of the city council in their pre-suit notice: the NOI explicitly makes the city responsible for stormwater management, and also lists the mayor as the \u201cresponsible official\u201d for stormwater management and maintenance. In addition, the city council members make up the city\u2019s \u201cgoverning authority,\u201d and are empowered to \u201c[d]irect and control all property located within Peachtree City,\u201d as well as \u201c[e]xam-ine, settle and allow claims against the City of Peachtree City.\u201d <em>See </em>Peachtree City, <em>Mayor and City Council, </em>http://www. peachtree-city.org/index.aspx?NID=109 (\u201cThe governing authority of Peachtree City is the Mayor and City Council, consisting of five elected members who serve 4-year terms.\u201d) (last visited Aug. 26, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Because the district court erroneously concluded that the Mroseks\u2019 pre-suit notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>was insufficient, we reverse and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-12\">. In addition to their request for injunctive relief under the CWA, the Mroseks also brought pendant state law claims for nui-sanee, a writ of mandamus, and declaratory judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-6\">. According to its website,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">City of Peachtree City is required by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) to comply with the Phase 2 Regulations of the Federal Clean Water Act. What this means is that the City of Peachtree City was required by law to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the EPD outlining how [it] intend[s] to clean stormwater to the maximum extent practicable. [That] NOI is approved and is in force....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-8\"><em>See </em>Peachtree City, <em>Stormwater Management, </em>http://www.peachtree-city.org/index.aspx? NID= 159 (last visited Aug. 26, 2013). Peach-tree City updated its NOI in December 2011. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b972-15\">. Peachtree City's official \"Stormwater Management\u201d website also explicitly states that \"[t]he City has adopted the Georgia Stormwa-ter Management Manual Volumes 1 and 2 ... to manage redevelopment and new development.\u201d Peachtree City, <em>Stormwater Management, </em>http://www.peachtree-city.org/index. aspx?NID=159 (last visited Aug. 26, 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b974-5\">JORDAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A45t\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">I join the court\u2019s opinion, and add the following thoughts.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">First, the regulation setting forth the requirements for pre-suit notice \u2014 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 135.8(a) \u2014 does not require that the notice detail the \u201cspecific standard, limitation, or order alleged to have been violated.\u201d It only requires \u201csufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard, limitation, or order alleged to have been violated.\u201d The Mroseks\u2019 notice satisfied this standard. As explained by cases like <em>Ecological Rights Foundation v. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., </em>713 F.3d 502, 518-19 (9th Cir.2013), <em>Paolino v. JF Realty, LLC, </em>710 F.3d 31, 36-38 (1st Cir.2013), and <em>Atl. States Legal Found., Inc. v. Stroh Die Casting Co., </em>116 F.3d 814, 819-20 (7th Cir.1997), the notice need only put the defendant in a position to remedy the violations alleged. <em>See also Nat\u2019l Parks and Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Tenn. Valley Authority, </em>502 F.3d 1316, 1329 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Second, the pre-suit notice requirement does not require that the person complaining demonstrate to a factual or legal certainty that he will prevail. Success on the merits is something that can only be decided by a federal court after a lawsuit has been filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
