The district court sentenced him to 87 months in prison, at the bottom of the guidelines range. Valles appeals, contending that the district court erred by refusing to reduce his offense level for being a minor participant pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Whether Valles was entitled to a minor role adjustment is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). A minor participant is one who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). \u201cIt is not enough that a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Valles argues that he was only a courier of the drugs, that he had no role in organizing the operation, and that he did not negotiate payment. Further, he contends, he had less contact with the drug dealers than his codefendant, Aura Martinez, who received a minor role adjustment. He notes that a person named \u201cJose\u201d supplied Martinez with a cell phone; that Martinez would be responsible for delivering the drugs to \u201cJose\u201d in the event that an unidentified male who was to take delivery of the heroin did not show up at the designated meeting place; and that Martinez was \u201cevidently living\u201d with \u201cJose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">Although one\u2019s role as a drug courier does not preclude a minor role adjustment, a mere courier is \u201cnot necessarily a minor participant in the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>690 F.3d 358, 376 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1281, 185 L.Ed.2d 215 (2013). As the district court noted, Valles trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ported more than three kilograms of heroin, a significant amount, in his shorts from the vessel to a meeting with Martinez. In addition, before the vessel arrived, Valles was in regular contact with both Martinez and a person named \u201cJulio\u201d regarding setting up the meeting between Martinez and Valles; Valles was to receive $8,000 of the $9,000 that \u201cJose\u201d provided to Martinez; and Valles was to accompany Martinez to deliver the drugs to the unidentified male. Given the totality of the circumstances, it was not clear error to conclude that Valles\u2019s role was not \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
