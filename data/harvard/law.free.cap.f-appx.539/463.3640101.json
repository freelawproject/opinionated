He contends that the district court erred by applying the crime-of-violence enhancement found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on his 2004 Texas conviction for aggravated sexual assault of a child. We disagree with the Government\u2019s contention that this claim was waived. <em>See United States v. Femandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006). Instead, we review it for plain error due to his failure to raise it in the district court. <em>See Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d at 384; <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-21\">Sanchez-Hernandez has not shown error, plain or otherwise, in connection with the district court\u2019s imposition of the disputed adjustment. We have previously held that a conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.021(a), the statute under which his prior conviction arose, warranted the \u00a7 2L1.2 adjustment. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 315-20 (5th Cir.2002). We have also held that the generic, contemporary definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) does not include an age-differential requirement. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 562 n. 28 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 6, 2013) (No. 12-10695).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
