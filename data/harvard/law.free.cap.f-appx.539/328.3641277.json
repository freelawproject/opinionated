She has not presented to this court any legal error by the district court. She complains of a problem with her uniform and also discusses her medical problems, but she has failed to connect any complaint to a material adverse employment action by the defendant state agency. The Referee who considered her appeal to the Civil Service explained the necessity of her relating specific details of discriminatory action to justify any legal recovery, and the district judge repeated that requirement. Her reply brief attempts to do better, but it, too, is largely based on conclusions and is unconnected to any legal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">Again, there is no error of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
