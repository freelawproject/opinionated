We review the dismissal de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">As Sanchez seeks to challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence rather than the manner in which his sentence has been executed, his petition properly arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 451-52. A section 2255 motion must be brought by the movant in the court that sentenced him. \u00a7 2255(a); <em>Ojo v. I.N.S., </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997). As the district court did not impose the sentence at issue, it did not err by dismissing the petition without prejudice rather than construing it as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Ojo, </em>106 F.3d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
