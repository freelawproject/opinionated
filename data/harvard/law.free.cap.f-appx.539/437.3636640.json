California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Pouncy has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-29\">The record does reveal two clerical errors in the judgment, which stated an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>fense of conviction as \u201cconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute [cocaine],\u201d where the indictment and the guilty plea recognized that offense of conviction as \u201cpossession with intent to distribute cocaine.\u201d The judgment should be corrected to reflect that Pouncy was convicted of possession with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>FED. R. CRIM. P. 36. With respect to Count 8, the judgment should be corrected to reflect the right code number of 18 (rather than 21) U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Accordingly, Pouncy\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and as to Pouncy <em>only </em>(Case No. 12-31181) his APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. His case is REMANDED for correction of the clerical errors pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-14\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
