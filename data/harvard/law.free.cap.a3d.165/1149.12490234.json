The respondent claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that she had failed to adequately brief one of the two independent grounds for reversing the judgment of the trial court and, consequently, that her appeal was moot. She further claims that the trial court incorrectly determined, first, that the Department of Children and Families (department) made reasonable efforts to reunify her with Elijah and, second, that she was unable to benefit from those efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the respondent that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed her appeal as moot. We further conclude, however, that the evidence supports the trial court's determination that the respondent was unable to benefit from reunification efforts. Because our resolution of that issue constitutes an independent basis for affirming the trial court's judgment, we need not address the respondent's claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify her with Elijah. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to affirm the trial court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \"The [trial] court granted the petitioner, the Commissioner\n   of Children and Families, an ex parte order of temporary custody of Elijah shortly after he was born.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner filed a neglect petition on February 21, 2014, on the basis of the doctrine of predictive neglect as a result of the respondent's diminished cognitive abilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order granting temporary custody of Elijah was sustained four days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The court,\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , held a neglect trial on September 15, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the court adjudicated Elijah as neglected and ordered his care, custody, and guardianship [be] committed to the petitioner. Additionally, the court ordered the department (1) to contact [the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) and the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) ] to inquire about additional services for the respondent, (2) to ascertain from those agencies whether a group home existed where the respondent could potentially be reunified with Elijah and receive various forms of instruction, (3) to request the behavioral health center that was providing the respondent with psychotropic medications to conduct a medication management review, and (4) to file a written report with the court addressing various issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"On November 4, 2014, the petitioner filed a motion for review of the permanency\n   plan seeking to terminate the parental rights of the respondent. Judge Dyer held a trial on January 22, 2015, and, six days later, the court issued its memorandum of decision. After considering the evidence presented, the court concluded that it was in the best interest of Elijah ... '[to afford the respondent] ... a limited period of additional time to pursue reunification efforts,' namely, to continue with the services provided by the department.... The time\n   period, the court believed, 'should not exceed six or seven months.' [Accordingly], the court rejected the department's permanency plan of termination of parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"On February 24, 2015, the petitioner filed a petition pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to terminate the parental rights of the respondent and Paul Y.... On September 8 and 10, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Francis J. Foley III\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, held a hearing on the ... petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 18, 2015, the court issued a comprehensive memorandum of decision. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that '[the department had] made reasonable efforts to reunify [Eliljah] with [the respondent] ... [and that the respondent was] unable to benefit from reunification services.' Consequently, the court terminated the parental rights of the respondent....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The court's memorandum of decision from the termination hearing sets forth the following facts .... Shortly after Elijah was born, the hospital personnel were concerned because the respondent 'appeared to\n   have cognitive limitations and serious mental health problems (schizophrenia ) and ... was reported to have poor judgment and no insight into parenting.' Thus, the hospital contacted the department, [which] sent a social worker to observe the respondent and Elijah. The social worker concluded that the respondent could not care for Elijah because of the severity of her limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The respondent's lengthy and exceptionally sad involvement in the child welfare system provides ... context to the present appeal. The respondent was born prematurely, addicted to cocaine and alcohol, and suffered serious medical conditions. In April, 1989, the respondent was placed in foster care with Gwendolyn C. and [Gwendolyn's] ... husband. In 1993, Gwendolyn and her ... husband adopted the respondent and another girl unrelated to the respondent. In 1994, the respondent's adoptive parents divorced. Between 1997 and 1999, Gwendolyn adopted three more children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The respondent's childhood with Gwendolyn was difficult. Under her care, the respondent and the other children were 'cruel[ly] discipline[d] ... [by her]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   making them run up and down stairs, standing them on one leg with their arms outstretched holding a book in each arm, [and] beating [them] with a stick and with a belt.' In July, 2001, just prior to the respondent's thirteenth birthday, Gwendolyn abandoned three of her adoptive children, including the respondent, at the department's Meriden office. Gwendolyn explained that she could no longer care for [them]. All three children were underweight, which lent credence to claims that Gwendolyn routinely withheld food from [them].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"After being abandoned by Gwendolyn, the respondent remained in the custody of the petitioner as a committed child for approximately six years. The respondent qualified for postmajority services through\n   [DDS] and [DMHAS]. The department developed a postmajority plan in which both agencies were to provide the respondent with 'life skills, vocational training, and supportive housing.' The postmajority plan, however, never came to fruition because, prior to her nineteenth birthday, the respondent returned to Gwendolyn's care. The respondent resided with Gwendolyn for the next several years before cohabitating with Paul Y. After the respondent and Paul Y.'s relationship ended, she returned to Gwendolyn's home. Approximately four months later, Elijah was born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The court's memorandum of decision also detailed the department's efforts to reunite Elijah with the respondent. It noted that the department offered the respondent case management services, three in-home visits per week with a parenting skills component, the opportunity to attend Elijah's medical visits by providing transportation, and services from two agencies [namely, Nurturing Seeds and Family Network] to provide supervised visitation and training in basic childcare skills. Concerned that the respondent was 'being overwhelmed with too many services,' the department sought and was granted permission for the respondent to undergo psychological evaluations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The respondent underwent two psychological evaluations that informed the court's decision. The first evaluation, conducted by Madeleine Leveille, a licensed psychologist, was completed in August, 2014, prior to the neglect trial. In addition to providing the court with the respondent's background, Leveille's evaluation [contained] key observations and opinions. For example, when discussing her mental illness, the respondent told Leveille that she regularly saw a 'shadow,' which Leveille characterized as a visual hallucination. Leveille concluded that the respondent had a 'limited conceptual understanding, [was] highly dependent socially on others, and [had] odd and occasionally paranoid and cynical\n   thought processes.' Moreover, the respondent's 'thinking processes show[ed] clear evidence of her [i]ntellectual [d]isability, [s]chizophrenia and a mood disorder.' Leveille was unequivocal that '[h]aving an [i]ntellectual [d]isability does not mean that one cannot parent a child. In [the respondent's] case, however, her intellectual disability, coupled with her psychiatric conditions, particularly her personality disorder, render[ed] her incapable of parenting a child independently.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Approximately two months before the termination trial, in July, 2015, the respondent underwent a second evaluation. This evaluation was funded by the department in an effort to assess the respondent on an 'individualized basis.' The 'Cognitive/Adaptive Functioning Evaluation' was conducted by Stephanie Stein Leite, a licensed psychologist. Leite concluded that the respondent had an [intelligence] quotient that placed her in the '[e]xtremely [l]ow range,' i.e., at the 'bottom [one] percentile of the [population] ....' Leite's evaluation also concluded that the respondent's personal and social skills, adaptive\n   behavior, [and] ability to perform daily living skills ... were in the [1] percent range, i.e., '[99 percent] of the population [have] better adaptive functioning skills than ... [the respondent].' Leite's assessment indicated that the respondent's 'eating, dressing, and hygiene skills [were] commensurate with [those of] a six year old ... [that] [s]he complete[d] household chores at the level of an eleven year old, and use[d] time, money, and communication tools at the level of a [thirteen] year old.' In short, Leite's evaluation demonstrated that the respondent, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-1g,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   was intellectually disabled. On the basis\n   of these results, Leite opined that the respondent was 'unlikely to be able to independently care for herself, which means she [would] not [be] able to care for [Elijah]. Because many of [the respondent's poor adaptive skills were] rooted in her lower intellectual functioning, though she is educable, the deficits are not, overall, likely to be responsive to remediation.' Leite concluded that the respondent could only care for Elijah if the respondent was under someone's care.\" (Footnotes altered.)\n   <em>\n    In re Elijah C.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20Conn.%20App.%20518\">\n    164 Conn.App. at 520-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    137 A.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although well aware of the respondent's love for Elijah and the fact that her parenting deficiencies are due to extremely unfortunate circumstances not of her own making, the trial court concluded in relevant part that, \"[r]egrettably, [the respondent's] condition is such\" that \"[s]he is not able to care for a child by herself and would require twenty-four hour assistance by a surrogate parent or a group home with the capacity to monitor [her] day and night\" for her \"to achieve any form of reunification.

There is abundant evidence that [the respondent] is only marginally able to care for herself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal to the Appellate Court, the respondent claimed that the trial court incorrectly determined that\n   the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite her with Elijah when, within two weeks of the trial court's January 28, 2015 order directing the department to continue the services it was then providing to the respondent, the department \"removed one of the services that was most crucial to her progress ....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Elijah C.\n   </em>\n   , Conn. Appellate Court Briefs &amp; Appendices, February Term, 2016, Respondent's Brief p. 8. More specifically, the respondent argued that the department had reduced the number of weekly supervised visits from three to two and had changed the agency responsible for supervising one of the visits from Nurturing Seeds, whose employees were trained to work with people with cognitive disabilities, to Family Network,\n   whose employees were not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See id., pp. 7-8. In the respondent's view, those actions by the department deprived the trial court of the information necessary to determine whether she, in fact, was unable to benefit from reunification services. Thus, the respondent claimed that, \"[b]ecause [Judge Dyer], on January 28, 2015, defined reasonable efforts [to reunite the respondent and Elijah] for the petitioner, and because the department acted in opposition to that order, [Judge Foley's] subsequent holding that ... clear and convincing evidence showed that the petitioner made reasonable efforts and that the respondent was unable to benefit from [them] is clearly erroneous.\" Id., p. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The petitioner maintained, inter alia, that the respondent's appeal must be dismissed as moot because, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    In re Jorden R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147456\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/539/#p552\">\n    293 Conn. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20469\">\n    979 A.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), either one of the trial court's findings-that the department made reasonable reunification efforts or that the respondent was unable to benefit from them-was sufficient to sustain the trial court's judgment, but, in her brief to the Appellate Court, the\n   respondent had challenged only one of those findings. See\n   <em>\n    In re Elijah C.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20Conn.%20App.%20518\">\n    164 Conn.App. at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    137 A.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the petitioner argued, the respondent could not obtain any practical relief on appeal because the Appellate Court was bound to affirm the trial court's judgment on the basis of that court's unchallenged finding that the respondent was unable to benefit from reasonable reunification efforts. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    In re Jorden R.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 555-57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20469\">\n    979 A.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court agreed with the petitioner, concluding that the respondent had inadequately briefed her claim challenging the trial court's finding that the respondent was unable to benefit from reunification efforts.\n   <em>\n    In re Elijah C.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 526,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    137 A.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court stated that, \"[a]lthough the respondent's main brief does use language suggesting a challenge to the court's second finding, the argument was far from complete, lacking legal authority and analysis. As a result, the respondent ha[d] failed to adequately brief any challenge [to] the court's second finding that she was unable to benefit from the reunification efforts.\" Id., at 529,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    137 A.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further explained that, to the extent that the respondent's brief could be read as challenging the trial court's second finding, the argument consisted of a mere seven sentences and was improperly located in the section of the respondent's brief addressing her claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that the department made reasonable reunification efforts. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 529 and n.6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n    137 A.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This certified appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, the respondent claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that her appeal was moot. She further claims that the department's reunification efforts failed to comport with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Pub. L. No. 101-336,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Stat.%20327\">\n    104 Stat. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. 2012)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, therefore, that the\n   trial court's finding that those efforts were reasonable for purposes of \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1) is clearly erroneous. Finally, the respondent argues that the trial court incorrectly determined that she was unable to benefit from reunification efforts. We agree with the respondent that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that her appeal was moot. We agree with the petitioner, however, that the record supports the trial court's finding by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent was unable to benefit from reunification efforts, which serves as an independent basis for sustaining the judgment of the trial court.

To be sure, the respondent's argument was neither comprehensive nor painstaking, cited no authority, apart from the applicable statutes and rules of practice, and was relegated to the section of her brief\n    contesting the trial court's finding that the department made reasonable efforts to reunite her with Elijah. Nonetheless, the extent of the briefing required to ensure that a claim will be reviewed by this court or the Appellate Court is highly dependent on the nature of the claim being asserted, such that the more nuanced and complex the claim, the more extensive the required analysis.

We agree with the respondent that her challenge to the trial court's second finding in the Appellate Court satisfied this standard, albeit minimally.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The respondent's claims in the Appellate Court, which she viewed as inextricably linked, were straightforward. The respondent argued, first, that the trial court's finding that the department made reasonable efforts to reunite her with Elijah was clearly erroneous because, inter alia, shortly after the trial court issued its January 28, 2015 order directing the department to continue the services it was then providing to the respondent, the department eliminated one of the services\n    that the respondent considered most crucial to the success of her reunification efforts. See\n    <em>\n     In re Elijah C.\n    </em>\n    , Conn. Appellate Court Briefs &amp; Appendices, supra, Respondent's Brief p. 8. In a closely related vein, the respondent further argued that the trial court's\n    finding that she could not benefit from reunification efforts was clearly erroneous in light of the department's failure to provide the reunification services that the trial court previously had determined were reasonable and appropriate in light of the respondent's cognitive deficits, and that the court had ordered be continued for a period not to exceed six or seven months so that it could better determine whether the respondent was able to benefit from them.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    See id, pp. 9-10. Considering the relative simplicity and interdependence of these claims, we believe, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, that the respondent's second claim was sufficiently clear to permit that court to address it on the merits.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    We disagree with the petitioner that the respondent's second claim was inadequately briefed because the respondent's argument failed to take into account the evidence that supported the trial court's finding that she was unable to benefit from reunification services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    As we explain more fully hereinafter, the petitioner is correct that the respondent, in addressing her second claim, failed to address certain evidence that strongly supported the trial court's second finding. We have never held, however, that an appellant's failure to consider every countervailing argument renders a claim inadequately briefed. Of course, in the interests of effective advocacy, an appellant should address both the strengths and weaknesses of her case, but we cannot say that the failure to do so necessarily renders the claim inadequately briefed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Nor are we persuaded by the petitioner's contention that the respondent's claim was inadequately briefed because she failed to address the holding of\n    <em>\n     In re Jorden R.\n    </em>\n    , which the petitioner maintains \"rejected\" the logic underlying the respondent's second claim, namely, \"that, without the department first providing reasonable [services], a trial court's finding that [the respondent] was unable to benefit from [such services] must necessarily fail.\" We disagree with the petitioner's characterization of the respondent's claim in the Appellate Court. The respondent did not claim in that court that the department's failure to provide reunification services necessarily precludes a finding by the trial court that a parent is unable to benefit from such services. To the contrary, the respondent acknowledges that, in some cases, the department may be under no obligation to pursue a permanency plan of reunification. The respondent argued, rather, that, in light of the department's failure to provide the services that the trial court previously had determined were reasonable in light of the respondent's disabilities and necessary for a determination of whether reunification was feasible, that court's finding that\n    she was unable to benefit from such services was not supported by the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Accordingly, although it is true that a finding that the department made reasonable reunification efforts is not\n    a necessary predicate to a finding that a parent is unable to benefit from such efforts, this does not mean that a trial court could never view those two issues as interrelated. Cf.\n    <em>\n     In re Gabriella A.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20775\">\n     319 Conn. 775\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 814,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20948\">\n     127 A.3d 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015) (\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     J.\n    </em>\n    , dissenting) (\"[T]he question of whether the petitioner made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with her child is inextricably linked to the question of whether the respondent can benefit from such efforts. Because the petitioner's efforts were unreasonable, we cannot determine whether the respondent could have benefited from reasonable efforts.\" [Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.] ). Nothing that we stated in\n    <em>\n     In re Jorden R.\n    </em>\n    suggests otherwise. Depending on the case, a trial court might well conclude that the department's reunification efforts were so lacking as to preclude both a finding that the department made reasonable reunification efforts\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    that a parent is unable to benefit from such efforts. Cf.\n    <em>\n     In re Fried\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"580455\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/266/535/#p541\">\n     266 Mich.App. 535\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 541,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=702%20N.W.2d%20192\">\n     702 N.W.2d 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005) (reasonableness of reunification efforts affects sufficiency of evidence supporting grounds for termination). Although the respondent believed in good faith that this is such a case and tailored her arguments accordingly, as we explain hereinafter, we disagree with the merits of the respondent's view of that issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    We turn, therefore, to the respondent's claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that she was unable to benefit from reunification efforts. As we have explained, the respondent views the success of this claim as dependent on the success of her claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that the department made reasonable efforts to reunite her with Elijah. Specifically, the respondent argues that the trial court incorrectly determined that she was unable to benefit from reunification services because, seven months\n    before the termination hearing, the department reduced the number of the respondent's weekly visits with Elijah from three to two and replaced the agency tasked with supervising one of the visits, Nurturing Seeds, with Family Network, whose employees, in contrast to the employees of Nurturing Seeds, were not trained to work with clients with cognitive disabilities. The respondent maintains that, because the evidence indicates that her parenting skills were improving under Nurturing Seeds, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that her skills would have continued to improve but for the department's substitution of agencies. The respondent also faults the department for failing to do more to identify services that might have assisted her in her reunification efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The petitioner counters that there is no evidence that the change from Nurturing Seeds to Family Network had any adverse effect on the respondent's reunification efforts. To the contrary, the petitioner maintains that the only evidence related to this issue indicates that the services provided by the two agencies were indistinguishable in terms of outcomes. The petitioner further argues that the respondent does not identify a single available reunification service that the department failed to offer her, and, therefore, her assertion that the department could have done more to assist her in her reunification efforts is entirely speculative. Finally, the petitioner contends that, even if the respondent is correct that the department's reunification efforts were somehow lacking, she nonetheless cannot prevail because the evidence overwhelmingly supports the trial court's determination that she was unable\n    to benefit from reunification services, regardless of what services were provided or how long they were provided for. We agree with the petitioner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The following principles guide our analysis of this claim. \"Pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j), the trial court must\n    make certain required findings after a hearing before it may terminate a party's parental rights. It is well established that, [u]nder \u00a7 17a-112, a hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the trial court must determine whether one or more of the ... grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 [ (j)(3) exist] by clear and convincing evidence.... In contrast to custody proceedings, in which the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration and in fact usually dictate the outcome, in termination proceedings, the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun.... Section [17a-112 (j) (3) ] carefully sets out ... [the] situations that, in the judgment of the legislature, constitute countervailing interests sufficiently powerful to justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent.... If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, then it proceeds to the dispositional phase. During the dispositional phase, the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests of the child.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     In re Oreoluwa O.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485134\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/674/#p531\">\n     321 Conn. 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 531-32,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485134\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/674/#p531\">\n     139 A.3d 674\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016). \"Also, as part of the adjudicatory phase, the department is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it has made reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds ... that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485134\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/674/#p531\">\n     Id., at 532\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485134\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/674/#p531\">\n     139 A.3d 674\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"Because a respondent's fundamental right to parent his or her child is at stake, [t]he statutory criteria must be strictly complied with before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     In re Elvin G.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20485\">\n     310 Conn. 485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 500-501,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20797\">\n     78 A.3d 797\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013).\n    On appeal, we evaluate the trial court's subordinate factual findings for clear error.

First, as we previously discussed, the trial court credited the opinions of Leveille and Leite, the two psychologists who evaluated the respondent at different stages of the case, that the respondent's cognitive deficits and psychological conditions were so severe that the only way that reunification could be achieved would be if the respondent and Elijah lived in a setting in which they both received around-the-clock supervision. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     In re Shane M.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20569\">\n     318 Conn. 569\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 590,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201247\">\n     122 A.3d 1247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015) (\"[c]ourts are entitled to give great weight to professionals\n    in parental termination cases\" [internal quotation marks omitted] );\n    <em>\n     In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"704602\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/177/648/#p667\">\n     177 Conn. 648\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 667,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20A.2d%20875\">\n     420 A.2d 875\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1979) (in termination proceeding, \"[p]sychological testimony from professionals is rightly accorded great weight\"). It was for this reason that the trial court, following the neglect hearing, ordered the department to contact DMHAS and DDS to ascertain whether there were any\n    assisted living programs in Connecticut that provided the level of care that the respondent needed for a permanency plan of reunification to proceed. The department subsequently communicated with staff from both agencies, who informed the department that there were no such programs in the state.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The trial court also relied on the fact that, three months before the termination hearing, the respondent was hospitalized for eight days following a period of \"homicidal ideation toward her mother, mood swings, auditory hallucinations and visions of hitting others in the head with a hammer and enjoying it,\" a development that the court aptly described as a \"significant safety concern\" for Elijah. The court further observed that the respondent's hospital admission form indicated that she had been \"aggressive toward her three year old nephew on the day prior to [her] admission,\" and that the respondent's adoptive mother, Gwendolyn, had testified \"that [the respondent was] not allowed unsupervised contact with [any of Gwendolyn's] twelve grandchildren.\" The court concluded that, \"[a]s this ha[d] only recently occurred, it [was] unlikely that [the respondent's] anger toward her mother and aggression toward [her] nephew [had] been addressed in therapy.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    It bears emphasis, moreover, as it relates to the trial court's finding that the respondent was unable to benefit from reunification services, that, at the time of her\n    June, 2015 hospitalization, the respondent had been receiving reunification services, including individual counseling and psychotropic medication management services, for fifteen months and yet was still experiencing hallucinations and had not progressed to a point at which she could be left alone with children. Subsequently, approximately two months before the termination hearing, Leite conducted a court ordered \"Cognitive/Adaptive Functioning Evaluation\" of the respondent. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     In re Elijah C.\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20Conn.%20App.%20518\">\n     164 Conn.App. at 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=137%20A.3d%20944\">\n     137 A.3d 944\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In her report, which the trial court credited, Leite stated that the respondent \"continued to have visual and auditory hallucinations,\" which \"likely impacts her ability to tolerate stressful situations, such as when a baby cries, and her ability to engage in creative problem solving, as both the psychoticism and the mental retardation make it difficult [for her] to extrapolate learned information to new situations.\" In light of these and other facts, the trial court reasonably concluded by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent, albeit through no fault of her own, was simply unable to benefit from\n    reunification services to the extent required for her reunification with Elijah.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Notably, the respondent does not address the trial court's findings regarding the events preceding her June, 2015 hospitalization, much less explain why those findings do not support that court's determination that she was ultimately unable to benefit from reunification services. Moreover, the respondent's only response to the trial court's finding that there were no assisted living programs in this state that offered the level of care and supervision that she and Elijah would require for reunification efforts to proceed is to argue, for the first time on appeal, that the petitioner should have looked out of state to find such a program. We agree with the petitioner that the proper place for the respondent to have raised her claim concerning an out-of-state placement\n    was in the trial court, where the issue could have been litigated and a factual record developed as to whether reasonable reunification efforts required the department to search for an out-of-state placement. E.g.,\n    <em>\n     Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Brown of Connecticut, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20123\">\n     311 Conn. 123\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 142,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n     84 A.3d 840\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014) (\"[i]t is well settled that [o]ur case law and rules of practice generally limit [an appellate] court's review to issues that are distinctly raised at trial\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). In the absence of such a record, we can only speculate as to whether such a program existed, what it would have cost or whether the respondent even would have agreed to participate in it.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We note, finally, that, even if the respondent's claim concerning an out-of-state placement had been preserved, the respondent cites no authority for the proposition that reasonable reunification efforts required the department to provide her with around-the-clock parenting\n    assistance-in state or out of state. To our knowledge, only one court has considered such a claim, and that court flatly rejected it.

We nevertheless take this opportunity to clarify the ADA's role in child welfare proceedings given the apparent misapprehension of the respondent and the amici curiae that the ADA is inapplicable to child welfare proceedings merely because it cannot be raised as a defense in such proceedings.

United States Dept. of Health and Human Services &amp; United States Dept. of Justice, Protecting the Rights of Parents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities: Technical Assistance for State and Local Child Welfare Agencies and Courts under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (August, 2015), available at https://www.ada.gov/doj_hhs_ta/child_welfare_ta.html (last visited August 3, 2017). That document provides in relevant part: \"Individuals with disabilities must be provided opportunities to benefit from or participate in child welfare programs, services, and activities that are equal to those extended to individuals without disabilities. This principle can require the provision of aids,\n    benefits, and services different from those provided to other parents ... [when] necessary to ensure an equal opportunity to obtain the same result or gain the same benefit, such as family reunification.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    \"This does not mean lowering standards for individuals with disabilities; rather, in keeping with the requirements of individualized treatment, services must be adapted to meet the needs of a parent ... who has a\n    disability to provide meaningful and equal access to the benefit. In some cases, it may mean ensuring physical or programmatic accessibility or providing auxiliary aids and services to ensure adequate communication and participation, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the nature of the program or undue financial and administrative burden. For example, a child welfare agency must provide an interpreter for a father who is deaf when necessary to ensure that he can participate in all aspects of the child welfare interaction. In other instances, this may mean making reasonable modification to policies, procedures, or practices, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the nature of the program. For example, if a child welfare agency provides classes on feeding and bathing children and a mother with an intellectual disability needs a different method of instruction to learn the techniques, the agency should provide the mother with the method of teaching that she needs.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20N.W.2d%20637\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    We therefore continue to encourage trial courts to look to the ADA for guidance in fashioning appropriate services for parents with disabilities. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record before us to suggest that the trial court deviated in any way from ADA principles, which, as we have explained, are incorporated by reference into our state's own stringent antidiscrimination statutes, in adjudicating the neglect and termination petitions in the present case. To the contrary, the record reflects that the trial court was keenly aware of, and sensitive to, the respondent's intellectual deficits when it ordered specific steps to facilitate reunification. Although extremely unfortunate, in the end, those deficits, along with the respondent's psychological conditions, proved to be an insurmountable barrier to reunification.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The form of the judgment of the Appellate Court is improper, the judgment of the Appellate Court is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"11\">\n    <p id=\"p-80\">\n     See footnote 6 of this opinion.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12\">\n    <p id=\"p-81\">\n     For example, the respondent argued that, \"because the department acted in opposition to [the court's earlier] order, the trial court's subsequent holding that the clear and convincing evidence showed that the petitioner made reasonable efforts and that the respondent was unable to benefit from [them] is clearly erroneous.\"\n     <em>\n      In re Elijah C.\n     </em>\n     , Conn.

The trial court expressly stated in its memorandum of decision that, over the department's strong objections, the respondent decided to reside with Gwendolyn when she reached the age of majority, and, in doing so, she had abandoned the housing, educational and vocational services that the department had arranged for her. The respondent also continued to live with Gwendolyn throughout the neglect and termination proceedings, even though the trial court, early on in the proceedings, made it abundantly clear that reunification was not possible as long as the respondent resided in Gwendolyn's home.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-85\">\n     Despite the trial court's ruling that Gwendolyn's home was not a suitable placement for Elijah, and knowing that there were no state programs that provided the level of care and supervision that she and Elijah required to achieve reunification, the respondent never once requested that the department investigate an out-of-state placement. The respondent instead asked the court to reconsider its prior decision to deny Gwendolyn's motion to be Elijah's legal guardian, a request that the court flatly denied, citing, as reasons, Gwendolyn's \"catastrophic ... failures\" as a parent, the \"diabolically cruel\" punishment she inflicted on her own children, and the \" 'toxic and controlling' \" relationship that existed between her and the respondent at the time of the termination proceedings.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"16\">\n    <p id=\"p-86\">\n     See, e.g.,\n     <em>\n      People ex rel.
