On appeal, the defendants\n   contend that the trial court improperly relied on an affidavit furnished by the plaintiff in calculating the outstanding debt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal concerns real property owned by the defendants and known as 106B Comstock Hill Avenue in Norwalk (property). On April 14, 2003, the defendants executed a promissory note (note) in favor of America's Wholesale Lender\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the principal amount of $550,000. The note was secured by a mortgage deed on the property (mortgage).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 3, 2006, the plaintiff commenced this foreclosure action in its capacity as owner and holder of the note and mortgage. The operative complaint, the plaintiff's January 31, 2007 amended complaint, alleged in relevant part that the note was in default, that the defendants had been provided written notice thereof, and that the defendants had failed to cure that default. Accordingly, the plaintiff sought to \"declare [the] note to be due in full and to foreclose the mortgage securing said note.\" Over the next decade, multiple judgments\n   of foreclosure were entered by the trial court, only to be stayed by the filing of bankruptcy petitions by the defendants under title 11, chapter 13, of the United States Code.

On September 9, 2015, the plaintiff, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 49-15(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a notice that the defendants had commenced yet another bankruptcy proceeding, thereby staying the judgment of foreclosure recently reentered by the trial court. On January 7, 2016, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut issued an order granting relief from that automatic stay \"to permit the [plaintiff] to exercise [its] rights, if any, with respect to [the property] in accordance with applicable non-bankruptcy law.\" The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion to reset the law days and to reenter the judgment on the ground that the June 8, 2015 judgment of strict foreclosure had been opened and the law days vacated pursuant to \u00a7 49-15(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In support of that motion, the plaintiff submitted an updated calculation of debt dated March 9, 2016. That\n   filing stated that the total due as of February 18, 2016 was $794,608.66. Attached to that filing was an affidavit of debt dated March 3, 2016, and signed under oath by Tina Marie Braune, a \"Document Execution Specialist of Nationstar Mortgage LLC,\" which was the plaintiff's servicing agent at that time. In her affidavit, Braune provided a detailed breakdown of the various components\n   of that calculation, including unpaid principal, interest, and property tax and hazard insurance advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties appeared before the court on March 14, 2016, at which time the court indicated that it had \"a couple of questions or problems with some of the numbers that don't make sense\" in comparison to the calculation of debt submitted by the plaintiff two years earlier. The plaintiff previously had filed a calculation of debt dated February 11, 2014 (2014 calculation), which indicated that the total due to February 18, 2014 was $801,528.16. That filing was accompanied by an affidavit of debt dated November 12, 2013, and signed under oath by Kimberly Gina Harvey, an assistant vice president at Bank of America N.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Comparing the 2014 calculation to the one presently before it, the court observed that \"[t]he total debt has actually gone down which doesn't make sense since you're dealing with a substantial increase in interest.\" The court then noted a significant discrepancy with respect to the property tax and hazard insurance advances detailed in the respective affidavits, \"that seems to be the source ... of why notwithstanding increased interest over time the aggregate actually has gone down somewhat.\" The parties requested a one week continuance to review the matter, which the court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties returned to court on March 21, 2016. The plaintiff had filed an additional calculation of debt dated\n   March 18, 2016, which was identical in all material respects to the March 9, 2016 calculation, save for the inclusion of $2328.81 in additional interest that recently had accrued. The defendants' counsel indicated that he had \"no problem\" with that additional interest but remained \"deeply concerned\" that the 2014 calculation was higher than the one presently before the court. In response, the court inquired whether the defendants had any reason or evidentiary basis for the court to doubt the accuracy of the updated calculation of debt furnished by the plaintiff, which the court noted was \"more advantageous\" to the defendants. The defendants' counsel offered no such reason, apart from the fact that the plaintiffs had introduced inconsistent affidavits. The plaintiff's counsel confirmed that the Braune \"numbers are correct for the affidavit of debt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants' counsel nonetheless argued that the court should not rely on Braune's affidavit because \"the plaintiff ... is now seeking to collect roughly half of what it allegedly\" paid in property tax and hazard insurance advances. The court noted that it had two alternatives: accept the updated calculation of debt predicated on Braune's affidavit or conduct an evidentiary hearing. The defendants' counsel stated that he did not want an evidentiary hearing, but an explanation for why the numbers had decreased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court inquired of the defendants' counsel how the defendants were harmed by the present calculation of debt, and whether he had \"any basis\" on which to challenge Braune's affidavit. In response, counsel pointed only to its inconsistency with the prior affidavit. The court responded that \"there is a presumptive quality to what is being submitted. Absent a request for an ability to challenge the evidentiary value and weight to be given presumptively, I rely on unchallenged submissions such as this affidavit.\" The defendants' counsel then requested an evidentiary hearing but indicated that\n   he would not be offering any evidence to contradict the affidavit.\n   The court then ruled in relevant part: \"Absent any proffer of evidence that challenges the validity or accuracy of the most recent affidavit ... I believe I am entitled to and should proceed on the basis of the affidavit as submitted absent a claim that you're going to be offering evidence to challenge those numbers.\" The court issued an order reentering the judgment of strict foreclosure, in which it reset the law days and found the outstanding debt to be $796,922.47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly relied on Braune's March 3, 2016 affidavit in calculating the debt. In response, the plaintiff argues that, irrespective of the merits of that claim, the defendants cannot demonstrate that they were substantially prejudiced by the court's evidentiary ruling. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The standard governing such claims is well established. \"Our standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court's evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. ... Additionally, it is well settled that even if the evidence was improperly admitted, the [defendant] must also establish that the ruling was harmful and likely to affect the result of the trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    National City Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stoecker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3408946\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/92/787/#p797\">\n    92 Conn.App. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 797,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=888%20A.2d%2095\">\n    888 A.2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749346,5749214,5749534\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/925/\">\n    277 Conn. 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=895%20A.2d%20799\">\n    895 A.2d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The record reflects that the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure on June 8, 2015. At that\n   time, the court, without objection by the defendants, determined the outstanding debt to be $801,498.16. Ultimately, the defendants' filing of a bankruptcy petition precluded that foreclosure from proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the January 7, 2016 order of the bankruptcy court granting the plaintiff relief to exercise its right to foreclose on the property, the plaintiff moved for a reentry of the judgment of strict foreclosure, which necessitated a resetting of the law days and a recalculation of the debt. Although more than nine months had passed, during which additional interest had accrued, the plaintiff nonetheless submitted an updated calculation of debt and an accompanying affidavit that set forth a total due that was thousands of dollars\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than the debt previously set by the court. When pressed by the court as to how that reduction in the amount owed to the plaintiff prejudiced the defendants, the defendants' counsel provided no answer. Furthermore, although the court considered conducting an evidentiary hearing on the matter, it declined to do so in light of the defendants' affirmation that they would not be offering any additional evidence to challenge the figures set forth in Braune's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the defendants have articulated no colorable claim of prejudice. Although the plaintiff argued in its appellate brief that \"[t]here was effectively no harm to the defendants by the trial court's decision,\" the defendants did not rebut that contention. On our review of the record, we can discern no substantial prejudice to the defendants. Moreover, we are mindful that \"[a] foreclosure action is an equitable proceeding ... [and the] determination of what equity requires is a matter for the discretion of the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956901\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/322/#p326\">\n    284 Conn. 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20A.2d%201143\">\n    933 A.2d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2007).
