The petitioner alleged that he was represented at trial by Sullivan, Sturman, and Barrs, and that their \"performance was deficient because they failed to adequately convey to the court that the petitioner wished to represent himself.\" The petition further alleged that there is a reasonable probability that, \"but for the petitioner's trial counsel's deficient performance,\" the result of the criminal proceedings would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The habeas court held a trial on October 31, 2014, at which Sullivan, Sturman, and Barrs testified. The petitioner did not testify. The habeas court denied the petition in a memorandum of decision filed January 16, 2015. After concluding that the petitioner's ineffective assistance claim was collaterally estopped by the Supreme Court's decision on direct appeal; see footnote 2 of this opinion; the habeas court also rejected the claim on the merits.

Thus, the habeas court concluded that trial counsel did not perform deficiently because, other than at sentencing, \"there was no clear and unequivocal invocation for them to convey to the court ....\" Following a grant of certification to appeal, this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court erred in concluding that he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.

Historical facts constitute a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators. ... Accordingly, [t]he habeas judge, as the trier of facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. ...

We note that, as a matter of law, the petitioner's ineffective assistance claim fails in the absence of evidence establishing that he made a clear and unequivocal request for\n   self-representation, and that his trial counsel either failed to inform the trial court of the request or did so in a manner that did not capture the unequivocal nature of the request. In other words, the mere fact that trial counsel did not inform the trial court that the petitioner made a clear and unequivocal request for self-representation does not form the basis for an ineffective assistance claim. The petitioner must demonstrate that he actually made such a request and that his attorneys failed to properly relay it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The habeas court correctly found that the petitioner failed to carry his burden of showing that his trial counsel failed to inform the trial court of a clear, unequivocal request for self-representation. With regard to Sullivan, the record reflects that, after convening with the petitioner at the December 20, 2005 hearing, she informed Judge Handy that the petitioner \"indicate[s] now that he wishes to represent himself in this matter. I informed him that I didn't think Your Honor was going to allow him to represent himself on a murder charge simply because that would be much too dangerous and it would not be in his best interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pires\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20222\">\n    310 Conn. at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%2087\">\n    77 A.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was no evidence in the habeas record that this representation was inaccurate. The petitioner did not testify at the habeas trial. Sullivan testified that the petitioner mentioned self-representation at the end of their conversation in an offhand manner, that she was unsure whether the request was genuine because the petitioner was angry and irrational at the time, and that she could not explore the issue because the petitioner refused to speak with her further. Sullivan further testified that, although the petitioner repeatedly had tried to fire her, the only time he expressed a desire to represent himself was during that December 20, 2005 meeting. Therefore, the record establishes only that the petitioner made a single offhand reference to self-representation, which Sullivan promptly conveyed to the trial court. She did not perform deficiently simply because she characterized the petitioner's request in a manner that did not prove favorable to the petitioner's subsequent claim that he had clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to self-representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There was also no evidence that Barrs or Sturman performed deficiently. They both testified at the habeas trial that the petitioner never expressed a desire to represent himself. They further testified that they did not construe any of the petitioner's pro se motions to be requests for self-representation. Even if they had, however, it would not matter because those written motions had already been filed with the court. Accordingly, the habeas court properly denied the petitioner's amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he failed to satisfy the performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The petitioner makes a number of other claims in his appellate brief that we need not address in this appeal-specifically, that his attorneys (1) provided him with incorrect advice as to whether the trial court would permit him to represent himself, (2) failed to advise him to invoke his right to self-representation more clearly and more unequivocally than he did, (3) failed further to pursue his right to self-representation, (4) failed to advise him that the trial court would not consider his statements on the record to be a clear and unequivocal invocation of the right, and (5) failed to advise him that accepting replacement counsel could be perceived as a waiver of his right to self-representation. Although the petitioner presented testimony and argument on these claims at the habeas trial, he did not allege them in his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, nor did the habeas court address them in its memorandum of decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \"This court is not bound to consider claimed errors unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised ...\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant's claim. ...
