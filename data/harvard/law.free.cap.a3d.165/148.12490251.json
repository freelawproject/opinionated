Specifically, we must decide whether there is municipal immunity when a town charges a nominal fee to a private group for reserved use of a public pool and an individual group member slips and falls on accumulated water in the vicinity of that pool. The plaintiff, David L. St. Pierre, appeals from the judgment rendered in favor of the named defendant, the town of Plainfield,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   after concluding that no exception to the defendant's general immunity applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant was immune from liability because (1) the defendant derived a special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit through its operation of the pool, or (2) the plaintiff constituted an identifiable person subject to imminent harm. We disagree with each of these claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff filed this negligence action against the defendant and Eastern Connecticut Rehabilitation Center, Inc. (Eastern); see footnote 2 of this opinion; to recover for injuries he allegedly sustained in an August 26, 2011 fall on wet steps after participating in an aqua therapy session. This session was conducted by Eastern in a pool owned by the defendant, which is located in the defendant's town hall building. The plaintiff alleged that he slipped and fell on the steps, which were covered with approximately one-quarter inch of water, on his way to the men's locker room. None of the defendant's employees witnessed the incident, nor had there been any previous complaints about the condition of the steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Since 1994, Eastern, through its manager Penny Allyn, had reserved the pool two to three times per week for one hour sessions to provide aqua therapy services to its rehabilitation patients. Since 2006, Eastern has paid the defendant $50 per reserved hour for the exclusive use of the pool during the sessions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Participation in\n   the aqua therapy program ranged from two to seven individuals per session. During the reserved times, the defendant provided a lifeguard and remained responsible for the cleaning and general maintenance of the pool. There was no formal contract between the defendant and Eastern. Rather, a one page form letter generally used to make reservations provides the rules of pool use, in addition to listing the usage fee, the time of the reservation, and the party making the reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Eastern is not the only program that utilizes the pool. Myra Ambrogi, the defendant's recreation director, stated in her affidavit that the pool is generally open to the public as well as for organizations that pay the\n   usage fee. Activities held at the pool include swim lessons, open swim periods, and exercise classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In discussing the pool's financials, Ambrogi stated in her affidavit that the costs of operating the pool for the fiscal year from July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2012, were $81,315.42 and that total revenue of $75,605.96 was taken in during the same time frame, including the fees from Eastern. Thus, the pool operated at a loss of $5709.46. Ambrogi's figures included operational costs such as the lifeguards' salaries, instructor fees, equipment, pool chemicals and cleaning supplies, but did not include electricity, heat, water, maintenance employees' salaries, or consumable supplies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff filed this action on August 19, 2013, alleging that the defendant had been negligent in various ways and that the plaintiff had been injured as a result. On January 30, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that municipal immunity applied to preclude the plaintiff's action because any acts or omissions alleged by the plaintiff involved judgment or discretion, the operation of the pool was a governmental function, and no exception to discretionary act immunity had been shown. The plaintiff objected, arguing that municipal immunity did not attach because the defendant's operation of the pool constituted a proprietary function and, in the alternative, that the identifiable person, imminent harm exception to immunity applied. In an August, 2015 memorandum of decision, the trial court agreed with the defendant that it was immune from liability. As to the proprietary function exception, the trial court concluded that the defendant's operation of a municipal pool was a governmental function and did not create a profit for the defendant. In regard to the identifiable person, imminent harm exception, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff was not an identifiable person given his voluntary presence at the aqua therapy program\n   and that the water on and around the pool surfaces did not qualify as an imminent harm. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff does not contest that the allegedly negligent acts of the defendant are discretionary in nature and, therefore, are generally entitled to immunity. See\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Consequently, we confine our analysis to whether municipal immunity is abrogated by an exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We begin with the standard of review and applicable law. \"The standard of review of a trial court's decision granting summary judgment is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\n   and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.... The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment is plenary.... On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aranow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    321 Conn. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    138 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

The proprietary function exception is codified in \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B), which provides in relevant part: \"Except as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by ... negligence in the performance of functions from which the political subdivision derives a\n   <em>\n    special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff contends that the defendant derived a special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit from the operation of its municipal pool because it rented that pool to Eastern, a for-profit entity, for a fee. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Considine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669206\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/830/#p837\">\n    279 Conn. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 837-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20A.2d%2070\">\n    905 A.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), we undertook a comprehensive analysis of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B).

In the plaintiff's view, rental of municipal property to a private party is a proprietary action.

First, the defendant's rental of its pool to an aqua therapy program two or three times a week fits within the general public purposes espoused in\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   . By allowing use of the pool, the defendant is promoting health and exercise for those using the pool, purposes that are entirely within\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   's framework. See\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531487\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/106/13/#p17\">\n    106 Conn. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.%20876\">\n    136 A. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the fee charged to Eastern is, like the fees charged in\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   , nominal, and the total fees collected from all parties reserving the pool do not cover the costs of maintaining the pool. Instead, in the year in question, the pool's expenses exceeded revenues by more than $5000, even without considering such things as electricity and water costs. This undercuts the plaintiff's assertion that the municipality is acting like a \"private enterprise.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Considine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669206\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/830/#p837\">\n    279 Conn. at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20A.2d%2070\">\n    905 A.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most private enterprises do not operate at a loss, or they will cease to exist. Also, the defendant's nominal fee of $50 per hour had remained stable for several years, further suggesting that profit is not a goal; cf. id., at 833,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20A.2d%2070\">\n    905 A.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that rent charged to private party increased annually as lease term); but, rather, that the fee \"was a mere incident of the public service rendered in the performance of a governmental duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Hannon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.%20876\">\n    136 A. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Considine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carta\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1535336\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/108/697/#p702\">\n    108 Conn. at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20A.%20158\">\n    145 A. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , private parties, like Eastern, who reserve the pool do so without a formal lease or contract and for only short periods of time. Aside from the equivalent of a sign-up sheet that Eastern's manager fills out and the consistency with which Eastern has used the pool, nothing in Eastern's reservation of the pool resembles a binding commercial lease. As mentioned, the defendant continues to provide a lifeguard during reserved times and to retain responsibility for the general maintenance of the pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff claims that, even if no actual profit was gained by the defendant's operation of the pool overall, this court should determine profitability by evaluating the fees paid by Eastern with reference to the periods of time that Eastern reserved the pool, and conclude that Eastern's fee for its use exceeded the costs of operating the pool for those periods of time. Specifically, the plaintiff reasons that, annually, Eastern is contributing $7800 for 156 hours of use, an amount that exceeds the costs attributable to the pool for that period of time. This argument was not raised in the trial court and should not be raised for the first time on appeal, particularly in the absence of an undisputed\n   factual record to support it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mazda Motor of America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20610\">\n    313 Conn. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201079\">\n    99 A.3d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In any event, we have never before held that, to determine whether a municipality derives a profit, the measure of revenues to expenses should be determined based on the exact proportion of time a private company uses a facility relative to the yearly costs of operating that facility. Because the plaintiff has not\n   provided any authority in support of this inventive approach to evaluating profitability, we decline to adopt it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It bears mentioning that extending the abrogation of municipal immunity to any situation in which a town allows the private use of its facilities for a nominal fee potentially could expose municipalities to great liability. In the face of such a threat, no rational municipality would continue to allow its municipal facilities to be used by outside parties. This would be detrimental to the enjoyment and use of municipal facilities by any smaller group of the general public that might wish to use these facilities. Under such restrictions, private, nonprofit, and other independent groups would be prevented from utilizing public parks, softball fields and, yes, pools. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the defendant's operation of the municipal pool constitutes a governmental function, and, by operating the pool, the defendant does not derive a special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We turn next to whether any other recognized exception to immunity is in play. Three exceptions to discretionary act immunity are recognized,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   but only one is relevant here: the identifiable person, imminent harm exception. Pursuant to this exception, liability is not precluded when \"the circumstances make it apparent to the public officer that his or her failure to act would be likely to subject an identifiable person to imminent\n   harm ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668473\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/607/#p615\">\n    279 Conn. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615-16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20A.2d%20191\">\n    903 A.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). The plaintiff contends that he qualifies as an identifiable person subject to imminent harm by virtue of his presence at the defendant's pool for the aqua therapy session provided by Eastern. Specifically, he contends that he was an identifiable individual to the on duty lifeguard employed by the defendant. We disagree that the plaintiff qualifies as an identifiable person and, therefore, conclude that this exception does not apply to abrogate the defendant's municipal immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[T]he identifiable person, imminent harm exception to qualified immunity for an employee's discretionary acts is applicable in an action brought under \u00a7 52-557n (a) to hold a municipality directly liable for those acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770143\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/324/#p332\">\n    294 Conn. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20A.2d%20684\">\n    984 A.2d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).
