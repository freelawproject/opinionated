Pursuant to Vermont Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(a), the superior court has-with the parties' consent-certified a question of law for our review in connection with the prosecution of defendant Geoffrey King. Specifically, the court and parties ask this Court to determine what legal standard the court should apply to determine whether the State's approximately three-year delay in bringing charges against defendant violated defendant's due process rights under the U.S. and Vermont Constitutions. We conclude that, to establish the State's preaccusation delay violated a defendant's due process rights under either the U.S. Constitution or the Vermont Constitution, the defendant must demonstrate actual substantial prejudice and prosecutorial misconduct intended to gain a tactical advantage or to advance some other impermissible purpose that violates fundamental conceptions of justice. Because defendant fails to meet either prong of this standard, we affirm the superior court's denial of his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In August 2008, the Department for Children and Families (DCF) contacted Detective Patrick Call to report an alleged sexual assault by defendant on the complainant. The detective interviewed defendant regarding the alleged assault between September and November, 2008. Sometime prior to the end of 2008, the detective referred the case to the Windsor County State's Attorney's Office. Subsequently, the detective interviewed two witnesses in February 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. One of the witnesses initially interviewed was A.F., a friend of the complainant. A.F. said that once-when she and the complainant were teenagers and the complainant was sleeping over-she asked the complainant why she \"was kind of weird about [guys].\" The complainant told A.F. that she was abused when she was little. In the interview, A.F. explained to the detective that she believed the complainant meant that defendant had had vaginal sex with the complainant. Following this interview with A.F. in February 2009, no activity in the criminal case occurred until August 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Prior to the renewed activity, DCF indicated in a January 10, 2009, letter that the reported sexual assault had been substantiated. Although defendant did not appeal the substantiation decision, he subsequently requested that the substantiation be expunged; the DCF Commissioner denied\n   the expungement request on June 25, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. On August 6 or 7, 2012, the complainant's mother contacted the Windsor County State's Attorney's Office to inquire about the case. As a result of her message, the new deputy state's attorney (DSA) tasked with prosecuting sex crimes reviewed the case referral file, to determine the status of the case. After reviewing the file, the DSA contacted the complainant's mother. In their conversation, the new DSA indicated that the state's attorney's office did not want to file charges against defendant without assurances from the complainant that she wanted to move forward and, further, that he believed an email string in the file indicated that the office never received this confirmation from the complainant after the initial investigation. The complainant's mother then told the DSA that the complainant wished to pursue charges. Subsequently, the DSA contacted Detective Call to conduct a follow-up investigation before the State filed charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. On August 30, 2012, the State charged defendant with aggravated sexual assault of a child under ten, in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3253(a)(8), and lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2602. The DSA conceded that the affidavit of probable cause did not include any substantive evidence gathered after February 11, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the three and a half year gap between the conclusion of the initial investigation in February 2009, and the filing of charges in late August 2012, violated his due process rights under Chapter One, Articles 4 and 10 of the Vermont Constitution. After an evidentiary hearing on February 13, 2014, the superior court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court first concluded that the Vermont Constitution did not require a different standard than the analysis under the federal constitution for determining whether a preaccusation delay violated the due process clause. That federal standard, according to the superior court, required defendant to prove two things-that he was substantially prejudiced by the delay and that the State intentionally delayed to gain a tactical advantage over him-neither of which defendant had proved. In particular, the court determined that any discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony as a result of the delay could actually benefit defendant by opening the witness to impeachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8. Defendant's trial commenced on September 17, 2014. The State's case rested on the complainant's testimony and the testimony of A.F., who testified at trial that she believed defendant forced the complainant to perform oral sex on defendant. Defendant's cross-examination of A.F. focused on the inconsistencies between A.F.'s initial interview with Detective Call, her June 28, 2013 deposition in preparation for trial, and her trial testimony; specifically, whether the alleged assault involved oral or vaginal sex. A.F. testified that, based on their conversation as teenagers, she inferred that the complainant meant vaginal sex and that she relayed this assumption to Detective Call in their initial February 2009 interview; however, in preparation for her deposition on June 28, 2013, she contacted the complainant, who clarified that the alleged assault involved oral sex, not vaginal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9. Defendant similarly attacked the inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony. The complainant's initial statement in 2009 involved great detail, then her deposition five years later, in 2014, contained less detail, and finally, her trial testimony contained more detail. The complainant explained the discrepancies by testifying that she did not review her initial 2009 interview\n   prior to her deposition, but that she did review the interview prior to her trial testimony, which refreshed her recollection of the details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10. In the parties' closing arguments, the State acknowledged that the complainant's memory of the events was inconsistent. But the State justified those inconsistencies by referring to the five-year delay between the complainant's initial report and the trial. The State further noted that the discrepancies were actually a sign of the complainant's honesty, because \"[s]he didn't put in every detail one could possibly put in if one wanted to get somebody in trouble.\" By contrast, defendant again focused on the complainant's inconsistencies in his closing, noting that \"already we have different sworn testimony in a deposition, different sworn testimony here at trial, and different unsworn interview testimony.\" And defendant further categorized A.F.'s inconsistent testimony as \"evasive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11. The trial resulted in a hung jury. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for mistrial and dismissal with prejudice; in this motion, defendant again claimed that the action should be dismissed because the State's preaccusation delay violated his due process. In considering the motion, the court noted that, at trial, defendant took advantage of the inconsistencies between the complainant and A.F.'s prior depositions and trial testimony; as a result, \"the inconsistent testimony was far more prejudicial to the State than to the Defendant.\" The court further relied on its previous order dismissing defendant's pretrial motion, noting, \"Nothing that occurred during the jury trial changes the Court's decision on the motion.\" The court subsequently denied defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12. In anticipation of a retrial, the superior court certified this question of law for our review: under the U.S. and Vermont Constitutions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   what is the proper standard for evaluating whether a preaccusation delay violates a defendant's due process rights?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13. Broadly speaking, statutes of limitation provide the chief protection against the government bringing overly stale charges.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Marion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172901\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/307/#p322\">\n    404 U.S. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172901\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/307/#p322\">\n    92 S.Ct. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172901\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/307/#p322\">\n    30 L.Ed.2d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). In limited circumstances, however, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires dismissal of a charge if the preaccusation delay violates a two-pronged test: \"[T]he due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Consensus exists that a defendant must demonstrate actual substantial prejudice to satisfy one prong of the test, not speculative or premature prejudice. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    431 U.S. at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]roof of actual prejudice makes a due process claim concrete and ripe for adjudication.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the federal circuit courts disagree about the showing a defendant must make to prove unjustifiable prosecutorial\n   reasons for the preaccusation delay. A majority of the circuits require the defendant to demonstrate \"improper prosecutorial motive,\" while two circuits \"hold that the proper inquiry is to balance the prejudice to the defendant against the Government's justification for delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoo v.

This disagreement over the defendant's burden under the second prong arises from competing interpretations of the two U.S. Supreme Court cases addressing preaccusation delay:\n   <em>\n    Marion\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Marion\n   </em>\n   , after concluding the Speedy Trial Clause did not protect the defendants from the State's preaccusation delay, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Due Process Clause had \"a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    431 U.S. at 789-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (articulating\n   <em>\n    Marion\n   </em>\n   's holding). As an example, the U.S. Supreme Court approvingly noted the government's concession that dismissal would be warranted under the due process clause if the \"delay was an intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused\" and if the delay actually prejudiced defendant.\n   <em>\n    Marion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172901\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/307/#p322\">\n    404 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172901\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/307/#p322\">\n    92 S.Ct. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that delay for \"investigative purposes\" did not evince an improper prosecutorial motive sufficient to deprive a defendant of due process, \"even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    431 U.S. at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   , the government filed an indictment against the defendant eighteen months after the criminal acts occurred; the government's sole reason for the delay was a hope that the delay would flush out the defendant's accomplices, a hope that the Court of Appeals held did not justify the delay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18.

Applying this formula, the Supreme Court concluded that it did not violate \"fundamental conceptions of justice\" for a prosecutor to defer an indictment until probable cause was established, to delay charges until sufficient evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was assembled, or to postpone a formal indictment until the investigation was complete, even if sufficient evidence already existed\n   to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    at 790-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But that difficulty helps maintain the limited applicability of the Due Process Clause to preaccusation delay. As the Supreme Court noted, there are compelling reasons to justify such a limited application-reasons that benefit the government, the defendant, and the courts.

Having articulated the standard for analyzing preaccusation delay under the U.S. Constitution, we must now consider whether Vermont's constitution requires a different test. Given our previous precedent analyzing Vermont's due process clause, we conclude that the same standard should be applied to evaluate preaccusation delay for due process violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 28.

In particular, we noted that the policy concerns cited by the\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh\n   </em>\n   court were present to \"a lesser degree in sentence reconsideration proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4774508\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/510/#p514\">\n    148 Vt. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4774508\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/510/#p514\">\n    536 A.2d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, by declining to apply the more flexible \"speedy trial\" standard, this Court recognized that a more rigid test reflected the lesser policy concerns surrounding post-trial due process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 33. In this case, we believe that the due process concerns enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh\n   </em>\n   are also present to a reduced degree in cases involving preaccusation delay and, more important, are balanced by competing policy concerns favoring a less flexible standard. In\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh\n   </em>\n   , the New Hampshire Supreme Court cited three policy concerns: \"prevent[ing] undue and oppressive pretrial incarceration, [minimizing] the anxiety that attends public accusation, and [limiting] the risk that a long delay might impair the ability of the accused to defend himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Cavanaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=498%20A.2d%20735\">\n    498 A.2d at 738-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of the three, the first two are not present in cases involving preaccusation delay because, absent a formal charge, no incarceration or public accusation occurs. At the same time, a rule that requires prosecutors to file charges at a certain time would invite the same adverse consequences articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Lovasco\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    431 U.S. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/#p790\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting, among other concerns, that \"insisting on immediate prosecution once sufficient evidence is developed to obtain a conviction would pressure prosecutors into resolving doubtful cases in favor of early and possibly unwarranted prosecutions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 34. Given these competing policy concerns, we find further support for a less flexible standard in the structure of the Vermont Constitution, which suggests a more circumscribed protection for due process claims. For example, in contrast to the \"speedy trial\" clause embodied in Chapter 1, Article 10, the due process clauses of the Vermont Constitution do not specifically articulate a protection against preaccusation delay. Like the U.S. Supreme Court, absent more specific due process protections, we are reluctant to adopt a more flexible standard that could invite adverse consequences for the government, the courts, and defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 35. Finally, we are mindful of our independent duty to examine the Vermont Constitution, its language, and its history to determine the scope of its protections. We have sometimes found Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution to provide similar protections as those provided by the federal Due Process Clause. See\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174249\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/162/#p171\">\n    169 Vt. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174249\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/162/#p171\">\n    730 A.2d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (1999) (\"The due process requirements imposed by Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution mirror those imposed by the United States Constitution.\") (citing cases). At other times, we have granted greater or different protections under Article 10. See\n   <em>\n    Delisle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    162 Vt. at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    648 A.2d at 642-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying different standard to evaluate \"lost evidence\" claims under Chapter I, Article 10, of Vermont Constitution than that applied under Federal Constitution). In this case, we are not persuaded that the Vermont Constitution provides greater protections than the Federal Constitution. As a result, we hold that the standard for establishing that preaccusation delay violated the Vermont Constitution is the same as the standard described above for finding a due process violation under the Federal Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 36. Defendant urges us to adopt one of two flexible standards for reviewing preaccusation delay under the Vermont Constitution. One of the tests advocated by defendant hews closely to the minority standard articulated in the federal circuits. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Philibotte\n   </em>\n   , New Hampshire requires a defendant to show initially that \"actual prejudice has resulted from a delay\" and, after that showing is made, \"the trial court must then balance the resulting prejudice against the reasonableness of the delay.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2349334\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/123/240/\">\n    123 N.H. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20A.2d%20275\">\n    459 A.2d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (1983) (citations omitted); see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

In adopting this version of the test, however, the New Hampshire Supreme Court did not analyze the state's constitutional provisions; rather, the court followed the precedent set by the First Circuit, which uses the minority test.

By contrast, the Second Circuit follows the majority standard, a fact that more aptly supports our adoption of the majority standard.

Moreover, as previously demonstrated in\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   we did not follow the New Hampshire court's more permissive interpretation of its constitutional provisions precisely because we determined the policy concerns were present to \"a lesser degree\" in certain due process inquiries.\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4774508\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/510/#p514\">\n    148 Vt. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4774508\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/510/#p514\">\n    536 A.2d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the same reasons, we do not adopt the more flexible test employed by New Hampshire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 38. On similar grounds, we reject the second, alternative test defendant espouses. That test, formulated by the Court of Appeals of New York in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Applying the Standard to Defendant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 39. To establish the preaccusation delay violated defendant's due process rights under either the U.S. Constitution or the Vermont Constitution, defendant must demonstrate actual substantial prejudice and prosecutorial misconduct intended to gain a tactical advantage or to advance some other impermissible purpose.

In this case, however, the court applied a slightly more restrictive version of the majority standard than the one we adopt in this opinion-the trial court required defendant to demonstrate actual substantial prejudice and the State's intention to gain a tactical advantage over defendant. In most cases, the application of this different standard would require a remand to the superior court. But given the undisputed facts on appeal, we conclude that defendant's claim is legally insufficient to establish a due process violation under the standard articulated in this opinion.

Second, there is no evidence that the State delayed in order to gain a tactical advantage or to advance some other impermissible purpose that violates fundamental conceptions of justice. On appeal, defendant claims that there was no justification for the delay. But, as noted by the superior court, the State's explanation for the delay was that the former prosecutor involved in the case wanted to be assured that the complainant would support the charges and would be willing to proceed with the case. This reason falls well within permissible delay. In\n   <em>\n    Delisle\n   </em>\n   , we upheld a fourteen-year delay because, absent a crucial witness, there was insufficient evidence to bring on earlier prosecution.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    162 Vt. at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    648 A.2d at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Noting first that the defendant did not contest the State's explanation that the delay was an investigatory one resulting from a lack of evidence, the Court considered and rejected each of the defendant's claims of actual prejudice.

Nothing in the Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Delisle\n   </em>\n   suggests a view that preindictment delay runs afoul of due process only if it results from the State's bad faith or impermissible motives.\n   <em>\n    Delisle\n   </em>\n   considered both the reason for the delay and the degree of prejudice-both factors to be considered under any potential test. But the Court said nothing to suggest that a claim based on prosecutorial negligence could not make out a due process violation under the Vermont Constitution. In fact,\n   the Court acknowledged at the outset of its analysis that the defendant did not even challenge the State's innocent explanation for the delay. Yet it went on to evaluate the prejudice claimed by the defendant. Had the Court endorsed the view now embraced by the majority, it would not have undertaken that second step. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Delisle\n   </em>\n   Court recognized that the negligent loss of evidence may critically prejudice a defendant every bit as much as a bad faith loss of evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    648 A.2d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 50. The\n   <em>\n    Delisle\n   </em>\n   Court's recognition that the constitutionally cognizable consequences of lost evidence may depend on more than just the purity of the State's motivations makes sense. If we were barring an untimely prosecution solely as a sanction for prosecutorial misconduct, or in order to deter future misconduct, the singular focus on the permissibility of the State's purposes would be justified. But the core question for due process purposes is whether a delay violates \"fundamental conceptions of justice\" and \"the community's sense of fair play.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"848733\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/162/293/#p312\">\n    648 A.2d at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Although it may be an unusual case, there are likely circumstances in which a negligent and extraordinary delay that causes extreme prejudice violates those fundamental conceptions of justice and fair play. The majority's more sweeping approach denies that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 51. For these reasons, I would evaluate the defendant's claim pursuant to the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court considered an indictment for second-degree murder of an infant that had occurred twenty years prior. On appeal from the trial court's dismissal of the indictment, the New Hampshire Supreme Court considered whether a defendant making a due process claim on the basis of excessive preindictment delay must prove under the New Hampshire Constitution that the State's delay resulted from a deliberate device to gain an advantage.\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n    880 A.2d at 421-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court first explored the split in federal appeals court decisions evaluating due process claims under the U.S. Constitution, acknowledging that a majority of the federal circuits require a showing of prosecutorial misconduct or some other impermissible purpose in order to establish a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n    at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court concluded that this majority view was not compelled by the U.S. Supreme Court decision on which it purported to rest, and that the unsettled federal precedent did not provide a sound basis for reexamining the State's own constitutional test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n    at 422-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, considering a state constitutional provision almost identical to Ch. I, Article 4 of the Vermont Constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court reaffirmed the following test for preindictment delay: \"The defendant must initially show that actual prejudice has resulted\n   from a delay. Once such a showing has been made, the trial court must then balance the resulting prejudice against the reasonableness of the delay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n    at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 52. The\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   court emphasized that the bar for establishing actual prejudice is a high one. The defendant must show \"actual prejudice that is definite and not speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted). A showing of\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   trial prejudice is not enough, and the prejudice must be substantial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[T]he possibility of prejudice due to the dimming of memories is inherent in any delay and, alone, is insufficient to constitute a denial of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted). And when the claimed prejudice arises from the unavailability of a witness, the defendant must demonstrate with specificity the expected content of the testimony, that the information the witness would have provided was not available from other sources, and that the defendant made serious attempts to find the witness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court noted that a dismissal on the basis of undue delay prior to trial will rarely be appropriate since an assessment of actual substantial trial prejudice can be more accurately made after the trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20419\">\n    at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   , the court applied this stringent approach, reversing the trial court's various findings of prejudice and concluding that the defendant had failed to establish actual prejudice due to his delayed indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 53. In contrast to the majority's approach, the\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   test focuses the inquiry first and foremost on the subject of greatest constitutional concern: the prejudice to the defendant as a result of the State's action (or inaction). In the absence of actual and substantial prejudice, a defendant has no grounds to complain of a delayed prosecution within the applicable statute of limitations. But if the defendant makes the difficult showing of actual, nonspeculative, and substantial prejudice as a result of inordinate delay, then this approach contemplates that negligent delays-as opposed to perfectly reasonable investigative delays-could in some cases cause so much harm to an accused as to violate fundamental notions of fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 54. That is not the case here. Applying the stringent\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   test, I would reach the same result as the majority-not because the defendant failed to show an impermissible prosecutorial purpose, but because he failed to show substantial actual prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Part 1, Article 14 of the New Hampshire Constitution reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    Every subject of this state is entitled to a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries he may receive in his person, property, or character; to obtain right and justice freely, without being obliged to purchase it; completely, and without any denial; promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Chapter I, Article 4 of the Vermont Constitution states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    Every person within this state ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs which one may receive in person, property or character; every person ought to obtain right and justice, freely, and without being obliged to purchase it; completely and without any denial; promptly and without delay; comformably to the laws.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
