The defendant, Justin Skipwith, was charged with, inter alia, manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle after the vehicle that he was driving struck and killed Brianna Washington, the daughter of the plaintiff in error, Tabatha Cornell. Although the plaintiff in error notified the defendant in error, the state's attorney for the judicial district of Waterbury (state), that she was invoking her rights as a victim of the crime pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles seventeen and\n   twenty-nine of the amendments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   she was not afforded an opportunity to object to the plea agreement between the defendant and the state or to make a statement at the defendant's sentencing hearing. Thereafter, the plaintiff in error filed a motion to vacate the sentence, which the trial court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff in error then filed a writ of error claiming that the trial court improperly dismissed her motion to vacate the defendant's sentence, naming the state as the defendant in error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Skipwith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20502\">\n    159 Conn.App. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20104\">\n    123 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).

We then granted the plaintiff in error's petition for certification\n   to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on the alternative ground that the writ of error must be dismissed on the merits\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it seeks a form of relief that is barred by the victim's rights amendment. Accordingly, we need not reach the question of whether the Appellate Court properly found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff in error's motion to vacate the defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The undisputed facts of this case are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court; see id., at 503-506,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20104\">\n    123 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and\n   need not be repeated here, as the state concedes that the plaintiff in error was denied her right under article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, to object to the plea and to give a statement at the defendant's sentencing. Conn. Const., amend. XXIX (b) (7) and (8). After learning that the defendant had been sentenced, the plaintiff in error filed a motion to vacate the sentence based on violations of the victim's rights amendment. The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion, at which the plaintiff in error and a family friend gave statements, and ultimately dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the sentence was not illegal. Id., at 505-506,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20104\">\n    123 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff in error then filed this writ of error challenging the decision of the trial court. The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court properly had dismissed the motion to vacate the defendant's sentence, and then dismissed the writ of error on the merits. Id., at 512,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20104\">\n    123 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   addition, the Appellate Court observed that victims have no statutory authority to seek to vacate a defendant's conviction. Id., at 512,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%20104\">\n    123 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This certified appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff in error contends that, contrary to the Appellate Court's determination, because the defendant's sentence was imposed without affording her the\n   right under article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, to give a statement at the defendant's sentencing, the sentence was \"imposed in an illegal manner\" for purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, and, therefore, she was entitled to have the sentence vacated. The state contends that the Appellate Court correctly determined that the trial court had properly dismissed the plaintiff in error's motion to vacate the defendant's sentence and further claims, essentially as an alternative ground for affirmance, that, in the absence of any express constitutional or statutory provision, both the Appellate Court and this court lack jurisdiction to entertain a writ of error seeking to enforce the provisions of the victim's rights amendment. We conclude that this court had jurisdiction over the writ of error and, consequently, we had the authority to transfer it to the Appellate Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also conclude, however, that the writ of error must be dismissed on the merits because it seeks a form of relief that is barred by the victim's rights amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because it implicates this court's appellate jurisdiction, we first address the state's claim that this court lacks authority to entertain a writ of error seeking to enforce the victim's rights amendment because neither the state constitution nor any statute expressly confers such authority. This is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950716\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/262/#p274\">\n    281 Conn. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201025\">\n    914 A.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (whether party \"properly invoked the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court is a question of law subject to plenary review\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of its contention that this court lacks jurisdiction over a writ of error seeking to enforce the victim's\n   rights amendment, the state relies primarily on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20330\">\n    304 Conn. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In that case, the victim\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   appealed from an order of the trial court requiring that an affidavit supporting the arrest warrant for the defendant, which had been redacted to remove information that could identify the victim, be unsealed. Id., at 335-36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She contended, among other things, that this order violated her right under article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, to be treated with fairness and respect throughout the criminal justice process.

XXIX (b) (1). The state claimed on appeal that, because the victim was not a party to the criminal proceeding, she had no standing to appeal.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 333, 337-38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court agreed with the state. Id., at 338,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We observed in\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   that \"except insofar as the constitution bestows upon this court jurisdiction to hear certain cases ... the subject matter jurisdiction of ... this court is governed by statute.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

We then noted that the victim's\n   rights amendment did not contain a right to appeal from a ruling by the trial court implicating the rights created by that amendment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We further noted that the statute authorizing appeals, General Statutes \u00a7 52-263, provided that the remedy of appeal was available only to parties to the case.

Finally, we observed that, although Public Acts 1998, No. 98-231, \u00a7 2, as amended by Public Acts 2001, No. 01-211, \u00a7 12, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 46a-13c (5), authorized the Office of the Victim Advocate to \"[f]ile a limited special appearance in any court proceeding for the purpose of advocating for any right guaranteed [by the victim's rights amendment or] the general statutes,\" the legislature did not intend that victims would have full party status or the right to appeal from rulings of the trial court. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we concluded that victims were not parties with standing to appeal from an order in a criminal case, and we dismissed the victim's appeal. Id., at 348,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the present case, the state contends that\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that, because the victim's rights amendment contains no self-executing remedial procedures; see id., at 340-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; if the legislature has not expressly provided a remedy by which the rights protected by that constitutional provision may be vindicated, no such remedy exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   , however, was premised on the principle that the right of\n   <em>\n    appeal\n   </em>\n   is created purely by statute. See id., at 339,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because no statute provides victims with a right to appeal from rulings of the trial court, no such right exists. In contrast, a writ of error is a common-law\n   remedy. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCahill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828600\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/492/#p499\">\n    261 Conn. 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499-500,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=811%20A.2d%20667\">\n    811 A.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (\"[t]he writ of error ... is a concept deeply rooted in our common law\" and \"the right to bring a writ of error ... exists independent of [any] statutory authorization\" [citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] );\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Assuntino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"698207\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/173/104/#p112\">\n    173 Conn. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20A.2d%201091\">\n    376 A.2d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (\"The writ [of error] has long lain to this court ... in accordance with statutes which have been merely declaratory of the common law. It is therefore concluded that the writ, at common law, lies to this court ....\");\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Caplan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"497161\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/85/618/#p622\">\n    85 Conn. 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.%20280\">\n    84 A. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1912) (\"[t]he writ of error is the common-law method ... of carrying up a cause from an inferior to a higher court for the revision of questions of law\"). Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   , the lack of any express constitutional or statutory authorization for a victim to file a writ of error from a ruling of the trial court implicating his or her rights under the victim's rights amendment does not affect the victim's right to file a writ of error or this court's jurisdiction to entertain it. Rather, in the absence of any constitutional provision or statute\n   <em>\n    depriving\n   </em>\n   this court of its common-law jurisdiction over writs of error,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court has jurisdiction if a victim falls within the class of persons who are entitled to file a writ of error.\n   The state has not claimed that any statute deprives this court of its jurisdiction over writs of error seeking relief for a violation of the victim's rights amendment, and we conclude that nothing in the state constitution does so. Article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, provides in relevant part: \"The general assembly shall provide by law for the enforcement of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection or in any law enacted pursuant to this subsection shall be construed as creating a basis for vacating a conviction or ground for appellate relief in any criminal case.\" Conn. Const., amend. XXIX (b). With respect to the first quoted sentence, that provision merely authorizes the legislature to enforce through legislation the rights created by the constitutional provision. It does not abrogate the basic constitutional obligation of courts to interpret and implement constitutional provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Marbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Madison\n   </em>\n   , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803) (\"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is\"). Indeed, to the extent that there is any ambiguity as to whether the constitutional provision deprives courts of their authority to adjudicate claims arising from the victim's rights amendment, the legislative history reveals that the legislature expressly contemplated that victims would be able to seek relief both in the trial court and in the appellate courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second quoted sentence, providing that the victim's rights amendment shall not be \"construed as creating a basis for vacating a conviction or ground for appellate relief in any criminal case\"; Conn. Const., amend. XXIX (b); also does not deprive the appellate courts entirely of their authority to interpret and implement the constitutional provision. First, as we have indicated, the legislative history of the provision clearly indicates that the legislature contemplated that both the trial courts and the appellate courts would have a role in interpreting and implementing it. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Second, in ordinary usage, the phrase \"appellate relief\" connotes relief granted on appeal from a\n   <em>\n    judgment\n   </em>\n   disposing of the case, not relief provided to a nonparty in connection with a collateral issue that will not directly affect the substantive issues or the ultimate disposition of the case. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595278\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/158/461/#p463\">\n    158 Conn. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=262%20A.2d%20166\">\n    262 A.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969) (\"[a]n appeal lies only from a final judgment, and there can be no judgment in a criminal case until sentence is pronounced\"). Indeed, the legislative history indicates that the purpose of the provision barring \"appellate relief\" was to ensure that any relief provided would not deprive defendants of their existing substantive rights; its purpose was not to deprive victims of any appellate redress for a violation of their rights, even when providing relief would not affect the judgment or the rights of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, we can perceive no reason why, before\n   the victim's rights amendment was adopted, a victim could not have obtained relief by filing a writ of error in this court to vindicate rights conferred by chapter 968 of the General Statutes governing victim services, including the right to present a statement to the prosecutor and the trial court prior to the acceptance of a plea and the right to submit a statement to the prosecutor before sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 54-203 (b) (7) (B) and (C). There is no evidence, and it would be anomalous to conclude, that the victim's rights amendment was intended to\n   <em>\n    eliminate\n   </em>\n   preexisting mechanisms for obtaining such relief from this court. Rather, it is reasonable to conclude that the bar on appellate relief was intended to be the constitutional equivalent to General Statutes \u00a7 54-223, which provides that the \"[f]ailure to afford the victim of a crime any of the rights provided pursuant to any provision of the general statutes shall not constitute grounds for vacating an otherwise lawful conviction or voiding an otherwise lawful sentence or parole determination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, therefore, that the bar on appellate relief set forth in article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, merely\n   prohibits this court from granting any relief that would directly affect the judgment in a criminal case or otherwise abridge the substantive rights of a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that this provision does not deprive this court of its jurisdiction over writs of error arising from the victim's rights amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With this background in mind, we must address an issue that we left unresolved in our decision in\n   <em>\n    Gault.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, we stated in that case that it was unclear whether the prohibition on appellate relief contained in article first, \u00a7 8, as amended, \"is intended to apply to victims or only to criminal defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gault\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20330\">\n    304 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   339-40 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201105\">\n    39 A.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our conclusion here that the prohibition on appellate relief was intended to bar any form of relief that would directly affect the judgment or abridge the defendant's rights makes it clear, however, that the focus of the prohibition is on the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of the relief, not on the identity of the party seeking the relief. Accordingly, we now conclude that the prohibition was intended to apply to any person seeking a prohibited form of relief, including victims. Similarly, because the prohibition goes to the substance\n   of the relief sought, and not to the vehicle by which the relief is sought, we conclude that, to the extent that there is any doubt as to whether a writ of error is technically a form of appellate relief in this context, the constitutional prohibition imposes the same limitations on writs of error that it would impose on appeals by victims, if they were statutorily authorized.

Although the victim's rights amendment does not deprive victims of their right to file a writ of error\n   to enforce their constitutional rights, it also does not expand their rights to seek a form of appellate relief that previously had been barred by statute. Because victims were barred by \u00a7 54-223 from seeking to vacate a criminal sentence for the violation of their rights when the victim's rights amendment was adopted; see footnote 16 of this opinion;\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that this form of relief is barred, and, therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on this alternative ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, EVELEIGH, ESPINOSA, ROBINSON and D'AURIA, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McDONALD, J., concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The victim's rights amendment to our state constitution was adopted to ensure that crime victims would no longer be relegated to the sidelines as largely silent, passive observers of a process in which their sole role was as witness and informant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Conn. Const., amend. XXIX (b). However, because the courts are barred from construing it to create a basis for any form of appellate relief and the legislature has not enacted any enforcement mechanisms in accordance with the constitutional directive, the promise of the amendment is largely illusory under the law as it currently stands. This state of affairs undermines the foundational principle, declared more than 200 years ago, that a government of laws \"will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Madison\n   </em>\n   , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803). In light of the constitutional and statutory constraints on this court, I agree with the majority that this court lacks the authority to grant the form of relief sought by the plaintiff-in-error, Tabatha Cornell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless,\n   this court can shine a light on\n   the circumstances that gave rise to the violation of her constitutional rights. We can also exercise our supervisory authority to adopt procedures to prevent a similar recurrence. I would do both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our state constitution conferred on the plaintiff-in-error \"the right to object to ... any plea agreement\n   entered into by the accused and the prosecution and to make a statement to the court prior to the acceptance by the court of the plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the accused\" and \"the right to make a statement to the court at sentencing ....\" Conn. Const., amend. XXIX (b) (7) and (8). In other words, the plaintiff-in-error had the right to state her opinion, orally or in writing, as to both the substance of the plea and the attendant penalty, before the court accepted the plea and sentenced the defendant, Justin Skipwith. Statutes elaborate on the obligations of both the prosecution and the court to ensure that crime victims have notice and an opportunity to take advantage of these rights. The Office of Victim Services is charged with providing a training program for judges and prosecutors, among others, to ensure that they are familiar with these obligations. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-203 (b) (16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Central to the present case is General Statutes \u00a7 54-91c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That statute prescribes the prosecutor's obligations\n   and then\n   requires the trial court to \"inquire on the record whether any victim is present for the purpose of making an oral statement or has submitted a written statement.\n   <em>\n    If no victim is present and no such written statement has been submitted, the court shall inquire on the record whether an attempt has been made to notify any such victim\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    of the date, time and place of the judicial proceeding concerning the acceptance of a plea pursuant to a plea agreement, provided the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    victim has informed the assistant state's attorney that the victim wishes to make or submit a statement\n   </em>\n   ] ....

General Statutes \u00a7 51-91c (b). This court has recognized that \"acceptance of a guilty plea must be contingent upon hearing from the victim in order to provide the victim with a meaningful right to participate in the plea bargaining process.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086744\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/375/#p390\">\n    296 Conn. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20A.2d%2065\">\n    995 A.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The record in the present case reveals the following undisputed facts relevant to compliance with these requirements. In connection with his actions causing the death of the plaintiff-in-error's daughter, Briana Washington, the defendant was charged with manslaughter in the first degree, manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle, misconduct with a motor vehicle, and operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor. In October, 2012, Attorney Jeffrey D. Brownstein notified the assistant state's attorney of record in the case, in writing, that he represented the plaintiff-in-error. Brownstein asked to be contacted prior to any offer and disposition on the case, stating that he and the plaintiff-in-error planned to be present at disposition and \"want the opportunity to be a part of the plea negotiations and to address the court at sentencing.\" Brownstein further indicated that the plaintiff-in-error was opposed to any suspended sentence and to any plea that would permit the defendant to avoid an admission of guilt (\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   or nolo contendere plea).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before trial commenced,\n   the case was transferred\n   to another assistant state's attorney, Jason Germain. Brownstein did not receive a response to his letter from anyone in the office of the defendant-in-error, the state's attorney for the judicial district of Waterbury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to the commencement of jury selection on March 4, 2013, a victim's advocate for the state, Barbara Jean Quinn, initiated several communications to Brownstein, including an acknowledgement of his letter and an offer to discuss the case, but Brownstein was unavailable to do so at that time. Quinn also provided Brownstein with information about case status and various pretrial dates, including jury selection. Neither the plaintiff-in-error nor Brownstein were available on March 4, but the plaintiff-in-error's son and a close friend of Washington, who identified herself as Washington's \"sister,\" attended jury selection that day. Quinn and Germain spoke with the two of them at that time. Either at that time or in a telephone call between Quinn and Brownstein that same day, Quinn or Germain explained that there may be serious problems with the charge of manslaughter in the first degree, that one of the state's witnesses may have given false information to the police, and that the defendant may not receive a lengthy sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Approximately one month later, on April 2, 2013, Germain, defense counsel, and the defendant appeared before the trial court, at which time they presented the court with a proposed plea agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the defendant would plead nolo contendere to the charge of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle, as well as to the charge of operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The agreed upon total effective sentence was ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after two years, and three years probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the court conducted a plea canvass with the defendant and accepted the plea, but before the defendant was sentenced, the court directed the following inquiry to Germain:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The Court: You're in contact with the family?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[Germain]: I did contact them. I talked to them before this case started. It's the sister that's still involved. I did have [Quinn], our victim advocate from part A, contact her and advise her. We talked about the problems with the case being [the defendant] was stabbed, the situation, how it unfolded, and the problems we did have with the case. She understood it would be a tough case. I don't think there's going to be any problem. I think they'll be happy with the disposition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court then confirmed the parties' waiver of the presentence investigation report and imposed sentence on the defendant. Later that day, Brownstein received word from Quinn that the defendant had been sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The foregoing facts reflect a clear abrogation of the plaintiff-in-error's constitutional and statutory rights, which she unambiguously invoked through her counsel's letter to the assistant state's attorney of record. The trial court may have intended its open-ended question to ascertain whether the members of Washington's immediate\n   family had been notified of, and intended to exercise, their rights, but it plainly did not elicit such information. It is unclear whether Germain's oblique response was intentionally or inadvertently misleading. Germain's representation to the court that the \"sister\"\n   was the only family member involved\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was directly contradicted by Quinn's communications with Brownstein up until the final notice that the defendant had been sentenced, and Brownstein's letter, which presumably was in Germain's case file. Even assuming that Germain misunderstood that Washington's \"sister\" was the only family member intending to be involved, there is no indication that the fact or substance of the proposed plea agreement had been discussed with her, that she had been informed that family members had a right to make a statement to the court before they decided whether to accept the plea, or that she had been given notice of the plea hearing date in order to avail herself of that right. The preface to Germain's final remarks-\"I don't think\" and \"I think\"-strongly suggests that no such conversation occurred, as it reflects speculation rather than an informed basis upon which he could make a representation to the court that the plea agreement would meet the expectations of Washington's family. There was, of course, reason to believe it would not. Even if Washington's family members had resigned themselves to the possibility that the defendant would not serve a lengthy sentence because of information communicated to them about the difficulties in prosecuting the case, it was a paramount concern to them that he not be offered a plea agreement under which he could avoid acknowledging responsibility for causing Washington's death. That concern, however, was never brought to the court's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the trial court later acknowledged at the hearing on the plaintiff-in-error's motion to correct an illegal sentence, the blame for this outcome did not rest solely with the state. Germain's vague reply to the court's open-ended inquiry should have prompted the court to\n   press him further to ascertain whether he had fulfilled his statutory obligations as a prosecutor. See footnote 3 of this concurring opinion. Had the court done so, it presumably would have ascertained facts that would have caused it to withdraw and defer acceptance of the plea until such time as the plaintiff-in-error was afforded her constitutional right to review and respond to the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To their credit, once these defects were subsequently brought to their attention, the defendant-in-error and the trial court made commendable efforts to acknowledge the failures and to make amends. Germain and the trial court both repeatedly apologized to the plaintiff-in-error. Maureen Platt, the state's attorney for the judicial district of Waterbury, demonstrated laudable leadership by appearing at the hearing on the plaintiff-in-error's motion to personally accept responsibility for the actions of Germain, her subordinate, and to apologize for unnecessarily adding to the plaintiff-in-error's grief. In addition to these measures, the trial court gave the plaintiff-in-error every leeway to address the court and to voice her views on the record in the presence of the defendant. By providing that opportunity and then explaining why it would have accepted the plea agreement even if it had known her position in advance, the trial court arguably cured, or at least ameliorated, the constitutional violation\n   in the present case.

The plaintiff-in-error's writ to this court makes clear, however, that a post hoc hearing was not an adequate remedy in her view.\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hopefully, the present case will prompt our legislature and the Rules Committee of the Superior Court to take steps to prevent a similar recurrence. In the meantime, because no form of appellate relief is available, it is all the more important that our trial courts be vigilant and proactive in protecting victims' rights. Several states have prescribed in greater detail the procedure whereby the trial court should elicit information from the state regarding steps undertaken to protect the victim's rights before accepting a plea or imposing sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It has been recognized that \"[c]ourt certification of compliance efforts provides a system of checks and balances that can help preserve victims' consultation rights without placing an undue burden on the criminal justice process.\" United States Department of Justice, Office for Victims of Crimes, Office of Justice Programs, Legal Series # 7 Bulletin, \"Victim Input Into Plea Agreements,\" (November 2002), p. 3 (available at https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc archives/bulletins/legalseries/bulletin7/ncj189188.pdf (last visited July 28, 2017).

Indeed, a victim of crime who is denied her constitutional rights by a prosecutor or the court is, in a very real sense, victimized all over again. Without understating the significance of the primary victimization, this second victimization may be in some ways more odious because it is inflicted upon her by the levers and gears of the judicial system itself, the very institutional mechanism she-and all people in civilized society-relies on to have her offender held to account.

Indeed, the state in the present case does not dispute that prosecutors and trial courts have regularly afforded victims their rights under the victim's rights amendment, including those that have not been expressly implemented by statute. The state has also consistently and forthrightly conceded that the failure to afford the plaintiff in error her rights in the present case was a rare and unfortunate exception to that general practice and\n    <em>\n     violated the plaintiff in error's state constitutional rights\n    </em>\n    , despite the fact that those rights are not the subject of any implementing legislation. The state claims only that the state constitution contains no self-executing provisions providing a\n    <em>\n     judicial remedy\n    </em>\n    for such violations. Thus, properly understood, the state's contention is not that the victim's rights amendment is not self-executing in its entirety; rather, its contention is that claims that the self-executing provisions of the amendment have been violated are nonjusticiable.

Indeed, the most natural construction of the language in this provision barring us from construing it to create a ground for \"appellate relief\" would seem to apply only to parties to the underlying criminal prosecution entitled to appeal, which does not include the crime victim. Nonetheless, I am persuaded that the majority's ultimate conclusion that we cannot vacate the sentence as requested in the present writ is correct because: (1) vacating a sentence is a form of appellate relief; (2) the amendment directs the legislature to provide for the enforcement of the victim's rights amendment and it has not authorized this court to provide any such relief; (3) the legislative debates on the proposed victim's rights amendment clearly indicate an intent simply to elevate existing statutory rights to constitutional status; and (4) the existing statutory scheme, which was not altered concurrently with this amendment, unambiguously precluded the courts from vacating a plea solely on the ground that a right conferred on victims had been violated. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-223 (\"[f]ailure to afford the victim of a crime any of the rights provided pursuant to any provision of the general statutes shall not constitute grounds for vacating an\n    <em>\n     otherwise\n    </em>\n    lawful conviction or voiding an\n    <em>\n     otherwise\n    </em>\n    lawful sentence or parole determination\" [emphasis added] ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    I note that several other jurisdictions have provided, by way of constitutional amendment or statute, remedies for constitutional violations of victims' rights.
