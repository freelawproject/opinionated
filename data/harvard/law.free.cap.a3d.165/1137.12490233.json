Ferri and Anthony J. Medaglia, who are the trustees of a trust created by Paul John Ferri, Sr., in 1983 (1983 trust) solely for the benefit of his son, the defendant, Paul John Ferri, Jr. (Ferri).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that they were authorized to decant certain assets from the 1983 trust and that the named defendant, Nancy Powell-Ferri, had no right, title, or interest in those assets. On appeal, the plaintiffs and Ferri assert, inter alia, that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the plaintiffs did not have authority to decant the 1983 trust because Ferri had a vested and irrevocable interest in its assets. We disagree. In light of the opinion issued by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in response to this court's certified questions; see\n   <em>\n    Ferri\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Powell-Ferri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462702\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/651/\">\n    476 Mass. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%20541\">\n    72 N.E.3d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ; we conclude that, under Massachusetts law, it was proper for the plaintiffs to have decanted assets\n   from the 1983 trust, and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court on that issue. We also reverse the trial court's award of attorney's fees to Powell-Ferri in this matter. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in all other aspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \"Powell-Ferri filed an action for dissolution of her marriage to Ferri on October 26, 2010 .... Ferri is the sole beneficiary of [the 1983 trust, which was] created by his father, Paul John Ferri, Sr. .... The plaintiffs were named as trustees of the 1983 trust. Michael Ferri is Ferri's brother and business partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The 1983 trust provides that, after Ferri attained the age of thirty-five, he would have the right to withdraw principal from the trust in increasing percentages depending on his age. In March, 2011, while the underlying dissolution action was pending, the plaintiffs created a second trust whose sole beneficiary was Ferri\n   (2011 trust). The plaintiffs then distributed a substantial portion of the assets in the 1983 trust to the 2011 trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Unlike the terms of the 1983 trust, the terms of the 2011 trust do not allow Ferri to withdraw principal. Instead, under the terms of the 2011 trust, the plaintiffs have all of the control and decision-making power as to whether Ferri will receive any of the trust income or assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The trial court found that Ferri did not have a role in creating the 2011 trust or decanting any of the assets from the 1983 trust. The trial court further found that it was undisputed that Ferri took no action to recover the trust assets when Michael Ferri informed him of the creation of the 2011 trust and the decanting of\n   the assets. The trial court characterized the reasoning behind this inaction as follows: '[Ferri] does not want to [bring a legal action against] his family ... and he believes the [plaintiffs] are acting in his best interest.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"After the plaintiffs created the 2011 trust and transferred the assets from the 1983 trust to it, they instituted the present declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling from the court that they had validly exercised their authority in transferring the assets and that Powell-Ferri had no interest in the 2011 trust assets. Powell-Ferri filed a counterclaim asserting claims of common-law and statutory fraud, civil conspiracy, and seeking a declaratory judgment. After the trial court struck counts alleging fraud and conspiracy, Powell-Ferri filed a second amended counterclaim, later revised, asserting claims of breach of fiduciary duty, breach of loyalty, tortious interference with an expectancy, and seeking a declaratory judgment, as well as [a cross complaint alleging that Ferri had breached his duty to preserve marital assets during the pendency of their marital dissolution action by failing to take any affirmative steps to contest the decanting of certain assets from a trust by the plaintiffs].\" (Footnote in original.)\n   <em>\n    Ferri\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Powell-Ferri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20223\">\n    317 Conn. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225-26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.3d%20297\">\n    116 A.3d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court agreed with Powell-Ferri that the plaintiffs were not allowed to decant assets from the 1983 trust because Ferri had a vested irrevocable interest in 75 percent of those assets and that, therefore, the 1983 trust document did not authorize the plaintiffs to decant that portion of the trust. The trial court determined that\n   Massachusetts law allowed for decanting, generally, but only if the specific trust language gave the plaintiffs absolute and uncontrolled discretion or an analogous power. The trial court held that the 1983 trust, which granted the plaintiffs the power to \"segregate irrevocably,\" did not encompass the type of absolute power necessary to decant the 1983 trust. Instead, the court held that in construing the \"segregate irrevocably\" language, it needed to look at the entire context of the trust document. The court decided that because the language \"segregate irrevocably for later payment to [Ferri]\" was followed by a paragraph stating that the plaintiffs \"shall pay to [Ferri] ... as he may from time to time request in writing,\" the 1983 trust made clear that the funds were for\n   payment to Ferri and that the plaintiffs were obligated to pay if and when Ferri requested payment. The trial court further stated that, even though Ferri had not requested a distribution from the 2011 trust, the plaintiffs could avoid paying him under the terms of the 2011 trust, which would frustrate the payment provisions of the 1983 trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the trial court found that the decanting violated the terms of the 1983 trust, it did not order restoration of the entire 1983 trust. Instead it ordered the plaintiffs to restore 75 percent of the assets to the 1983 trust. The court found that, at the time of decanting, Ferri did not have any right to direct, control or receive 25 percent of the trust corpus, and, therefore, the plaintiffs were authorized to decant that portion of the 1983 trust. These appeals followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs and Ferri claim that, under Massachusetts law, the plaintiffs were authorized to decant the entirety of the 1983 trust. Specifically, the\n   plaintiffs and Ferri assert that Massachusetts law allowed the decanting because the terms of the 1983 trust unambiguously granted the plaintiffs such power. The plaintiffs and Ferri further claim that Ferri's unexercised right of withdrawal did not restrict the plaintiffs ability to decant. Next, the plaintiffs and Ferri claim that Powell-Ferri lacked standing to challenge the plaintiffs' actions. Finally, the plaintiffs and Ferri claim that Powell-Ferri was not entitled to an award of attorney's fees. In her cross appeal, Powell-Ferri claims that the trial court improperly refused to remove Michael Ferri from his position as a trustee of the 1983 trust. Powell-Ferri also asserts, as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the trial court, that the 2011 trust was effectively self-settled. We address each of these questions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The resolution of the first issue in this appeal presented a novel issue of Massachusetts trust law-namely, whether the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiffs did not have authority to decant the assets of the 1983 trust. Therefore, we certified the following three questions to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court: (1) \"Under Massachusetts law, did the terms of [the 1983 trust] empower [the plaintiffs] to distribute substantially all of its assets ... to [the 2011 trust]?\" (2) \"If the answer to [the first question] is 'no,' should either [75 percent] or [100 percent] of the assets of the 2011 [t]rust be returned to the 1983 [t]rust to restore the status quo prior to the decanting?\" (3) \"Under Massachusetts law, should a court, in interpreting whether [Paul John Ferri, Sr.] intended to permit decanting to another trust, consider an affidavit [from him], offered to establish what he intended when he created the 1983 [t]rust?\" The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court answered the first and third questions\n   in the affirmative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Ferri\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Powell-Ferri\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462702\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/651/\">\n    476 Mass. at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.E.3d%20541\">\n    72 N.E.3d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We adopt the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's thorough and well reasoned decision in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the basis of that decision, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly determined that the plaintiffs did not have authority to decant the 1983 trust and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court on that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs and Ferri also claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that Powell-Ferri had standing to challenge the plaintiffs' actions of decanting the 1983 trust and to assert her counterclaims against the plaintiffs\n   in connection with their actions as trustees. Specifically, the plaintiffs and Ferri claim that, because Powell-Ferri is not a beneficiary of the 1983 trust, she cannot challenge the plaintiffs' actions as trustees. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court determined that Powell-Ferri had standing to challenge the plaintiffs' actions related to the 1983 trust. The trial court concluded that \"[t]he 1983 trust is marital property under Connecticut law. Therefore, [Powell-Ferri] had an inchoate interest in that property, both for itself and for the value it represented in the equitable distribution of the entire estate by and between the parties. That is, in fashioning the orders, the court would be cognizant of the trust value as it apportioned both other assets and as it determined any alimony order that might enter.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review. Although the choice of law provision in the 1983 trust dictates that matters of substance will be analyzed according to Massachusetts law, procedural issues such as the standard of review are governed by Connecticut law. See\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montoya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729246\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/605/\">\n    280 Conn. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=909%20A.2d%20947\">\n    909 A.2d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). The issue of standing is also a procedural issue and is, therefore, governed by Connecticut law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    People's United Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kudej\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780829\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/134/432/#p438\">\n    134 Conn.App. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201139\">\n    39 A.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (applying Connecticut law to issue of standing under contract with choice of laws provision indicating that substantive matters should be governed by Massachusetts law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion.

The plaintiffs did that when they filed their declaratory judgment action seeking a post hoc ratification of their decision to decant the 1983 trust. The plaintiffs named Powell-Ferri as a defendant and acknowledged that she claimed an interest in the trust assets. In view of this fact, Powell-Ferri had a right to be heard. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kerrigan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Public Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668734\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/447/\">\n    279 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=904%20A.2d%20137\">\n    904 A.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (noting that parties enjoy \"the full panoply of rights\" such as right to file brief and to participate in oral argument). While the plaintiffs may have only requested the relief they wanted, once they put the question before the court concerning the validity of their actions, the court had the authority to fashion appropriate relief. See\n   <em>\n    Pamela B.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ment\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104036\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/244/296/#p308\">\n    244 Conn. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308-309,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20A.2d%201089\">\n    709 A.2d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Therefore, we conclude that Powell-Ferri had a right to be heard on the remedy as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Powell-Ferri has standing to challenge the plaintiffs' actions because their actions regarding the 1983 trust directly affect the dissolution court's ability to make equitable financial orders in the underlying dissolution action. Under Connecticut law, the 1983 trust was a marital asset because Ferri had an absolute right to withdraw up to 75 percent, and later 100 percent, of the principal, which constituted a \"sufficiently concrete\" right to include the trust assets in the marital estate.\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"357751\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/733/#p749\">\n    258 Conn. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=785%20A.2d%20197\">\n    785 A.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81,\n   the dissolution court had authority to assign any and all of these assets from Ferri to Powell-Ferri. Further, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82, the dissolution court had to consider these assets in fashioning alimony. Thus, the trial court's resolution of the declaratory judgment\n   action had a direct impact on Powell-Ferri's rights in the underlying dissolution action. Accordingly, she had a colorable claim of injury, which is all that was required to confer standing to challenge the decanting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, the plaintiffs' reliance on the Restatement (Third) of Trusts is unavailing. Specifically, the reporter's note on \u00a7 94 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, which pertains to the question of standing, explicitly provides that the rule established is \"consistent in principle with \u00a7 200 of Restatement [ (Second) of Trusts] ....\" Comment (d) to \u00a7 200 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts, in turn, provides as follows: \"A person who has an interest in the subject matter of trust, although he is not a beneficiary of the trust, can maintain a suit against the trustee to prevent injury to his interest in the subject matter of the trust. This is not a suit, however, to enforce the trust. Thus, if the trustee of a term for years threatens to commit waste, the remainderman can maintain a suit to enjoin him.\" In the present case, it is claimed that the plaintiffs' actions have frustrated Powell-Ferri's equitable claims to a marital asset, namely, the 1983 trust. Therefore, she had the right to take action to protect her interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that Powell-Ferri had standing to challenge the plaintiffs' actions in decanting the 1983 trust and to bring her counterclaim for relief against the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiffs and Ferri also challenge the decision of the trial court to award attorney's fees. We declined to certify this issue to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court because it did not present a novel question of Massachusetts law. The plaintiffs and Ferri assert that the trial court mistakenly applied Massachusetts law rather than Connecticut law, and that Connecticut\n   law does not allow for an award of attorney's fees. In the alternative, they claim that, even if Massachusetts law applies, it does not authorize an award of attorney's fees. We conclude that, under the law of either state, the trial court improperly awarded attorney's fees in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We begin with the standard of review applicable to this claim. \"This court reviews a trial court's decision to award attorney's fees for an abuse of discretion.... This standard applies to the amount of fees awarded ... and also to the trial court's determination of the factual predicate justifying the award.... Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court's ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion....

The trial court, reviewing the record before it, denied the removal request. In so doing, the trial court found as follows: \"Such a remedy is not appropriately addressed to the [plaintiffs]. As of yet, there has been no finding of a breach of duty by them, notwithstanding Powell-Ferri's vigorous argument that such a finding has already been made by this court....

Rather, she argues that the mere assertion of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against one of the cotrustees gives rise to a remedy of removal of the cotrustee. As the trial court concluded, however, those allegations, without actual proof, do not support removal of a trustee. Furthermore, in light of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's conclusion that the plaintiffs had the authority to decant the 1983 trust, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to remove Michael Ferri as a trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Powell-Ferri asserts, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that, because Ferri was entitled to 75 percent of the trust at the time of the divorce, the 2011\n   trust was effectively self-settled.

Because the beneficiary of the 2011 trust had no involvement whatsoever in the creation or funding of the 2011 trust, the trust cannot be self-settled under Connecticut law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although Powell-Ferri acknowledges that \u00a7 3 (1) of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, defines the settlor as \"[t]he person who creates a trust,\" she notes that comment (a) to that rule recognizes that \"[i]n some contexts significant questions may arise concerning the person who is properly to be treated as the settlor of a trust.\" However, comment (f) to \u00a7 58 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts discusses those \"[c]ircumstances in which [a] beneficiary is [the] settlor\" and provides in relevant part that, in addition to a situation in which a beneficiary \"actually conveyed the property to the trust or executed the trust instrument, or was designated as settlor,\" a beneficiary also may be deemed to be the settlor if \"the beneficiary pay[s] the consideration in return for which another transferred the property to fund the trust.\" Similar to Connecticut case law, these principles recognizes that a beneficiary can only be deemed to be a settlor of a trust if he or she has some affirmative involvement with the creation or funding of the trust. In the present case, the trial court determined that, although Ferri may have been entitled to withdraw the funds, he was still required to request the moneys from the plaintiffs, which was never done. Therefore, it was proper, as held by the Massachusetts Supreme\n   Judicial Court, for the plaintiffs to have decanted the entire trust.
