We hold that they do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Incident at the YMCA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 12, 2014, Vincent Trim, age 53, suddenly collapsed while he was playing basketball at a YMCA in Ellicott City. Julie Heard, a YMCA fitness instructor, was near the doors to the basketball court at the time. Ms. Heard had 20 years of training and experience in administering life support and resuscitation measures, including the use of an AED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Ms. Heard, several people ran out of the court, asking someone to call 911. Ms. Heard heard that someone had fainted. Another YMCA employee heard that a person was having a seizure. Yet another employee ran to the front desk to call 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Heard ran onto the court. She saw Mr. Trim lying unconscious on the floor. He had no pulse and was gasping (exhibiting \"agonal breathing\"), which is a potential sign of cardiac arrest. Ms. Heard began to administer cardiopulmonary\n   resuscitation (\"CPR\"), and she directed a bystander to go to the front desk to call 911. While she was administering CPR, another member told her that she was already calling 911. Although the YMCA had an AED that was just outside the doors of the basketball court, Ms. Heard did not retrieve it or ask anyone to retrieve it for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of Ms. Heard's efforts, Mr. Trim began to breathe on his own, but his breathing stopped again after a few seconds. With the assistance of another employee, Ms. Heard continued to administer CPR until the Howard County paramedics\n   arrived, about five minutes after they were first called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When the paramedics entered the court, a YMCA employee heard one of them say that he needed to go back to the ambulance to retrieve his AED. The employee told the paramedic that the YMCA's AED was just outside the doors of the basketball court. The paramedic instructed the employee to retrieve the AED, which he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The paramedics used the AED, but were unsuccessful in resuscitating Mr. Trim. He died a few days later as a result of a cardiac arrest and the consequent cessation of blood flow to his brain and other vital organs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Wrongful Death Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 27, 2015, Mr. Trim's widow, appellant Valerie Trim, filed a wrongful death and survival action against the YMCA. Citing the COMAR regulations that were propounded to implement \u00a7 13-517 of the Education Article, appellant principally alleged that the YMCA \"had a statutory and/or regulatory duty to utilize the AED on its premises ... after [Mr. Trim's] collapse in the gymnasium.\" Because it did not comply with that alleged duty, appellant alleged that the YMCA was negligent\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The YMCA moved to dismiss the complaint, or alternatively, for summary judgment. It advanced three grounds: (1) that \u00a7 13-517 does not impose an affirmative duty to use an AED; (2) that the statute contains an immunity provision, which shields it from liability \"for any act or omission in the provision of automated external defibrillation\"; and (3) that an exculpatory clause within YMCA's membership agreement, which was signed by Mr. Trim, released it from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After a hearing on April 28, 2016, the Circuit Court for Howard County granted the YMCA's motion. Appellant noted a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    QUESTIONS PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant presents three issues, which we have rephrased as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. Did the circuit court err in determining that \u00a7 13-517 of the Education Article or its implementing regulations do not establish a statutory duty of care by the YMCA and its employees?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. Did the circuit court err in determining that the YMCA and its employees were immune from civil liability under \u00a7 13-517 of the Education Article ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. Did the circuit court err in determining that the YMCA membership agreement exculpated the YMCA and its employees from civil liability?\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response to the first question, we hold that the statute and regulations do not establish a statutory duty of care that required the administration of automated external defibrillation in the circumstances of this case. In view of our answer to the first question, it is unnecessary to address the second and third questions. We shall affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its dispositive motion, the YMCA included materials outside of the pleading. The circuit court did not exclude those materials. Hence, the court was required to treat the motion, and did in fact treat it, as a motion for summary judgment. Md. Rule 2-322(c) (\"[i]f, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hrehorovich v.

Rule 2-501(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The propriety of a grant of summary judgment is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

In an appeal from the grant of summary judgment, this Court conducts a de novo review to determine whether the circuit court's conclusions were legally correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Aoust v.

The statute, therefore, does not impose an affirmative obligation on the YMCA to use the AED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Implementing Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In arguing that a registered facility has an affirmative duty to use an AED whenever a person suffers or reasonably appears to have suffered sudden cardiac arrest, appellant relies largely on the implementing regulations that the EMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Board adopted, not on the language of the statute itself. Appellant incorrectly refers to the regulations as \"the words utilized by the Legislature,\" which they are not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nonetheless, assuming that the EMS Board could prescribe a duty of care on registered facilities like the YMCA, its regulations do not, in our view, impose an affirmative duty to use an AED when a person suffers or reasonably appears to have suffered sudden cardiac arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Among other things, the regulations require a facility to designate an AED coordinator who has received CPR and AED training and who must ensure that the AED equipment is regularly inspected (presumably to ensure that it works).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 30.06.02.01(A). They require a facility to inform its employees and volunteers about the operation, maintenance, and location of its AEDs.\n   <em>\n    Seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.02.01(B). They require a facility to place its AEDs in locations that are visible and readily accessible to anyone who might be willing to operate them in case of an instance of cardiac arrest.\n   <em>\n    Seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.02.01(C). They require a facility to have a telephone or \"other communication service\" to notify public safety officials in case of an emergency.\n   <em>\n    Seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.02.01(D). They require the facility to submit data to the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems.\n   <em>\n    Seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.02.01(E). They require the facility to ensure that all \"expected operators,\" which are defined as \"individual[s] identified\n   by a registered facility to operate an AED at a registered facility\" (\n   <em>\n    seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.01.01(B)(3)), have completed CPR and AED training.\n   <em>\n    Seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.02.01(F). Finally, in a section titled \"Protocol,\" they state that \"[a]ll personnel who are expected to operate an\n   AED\" must \"utilize the AED in accordance with their training.\"\n   <em>\n    Seeid.\n   </em>\n   30.06.02.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nothing in these regulations imposes an affirmative duty to use an AED whenever a person suffers or reasonably appears to have suffered sudden cardiac arrest. The regulations simply require a facility to obtain training for the persons who may operate the device, to take steps to ensure that the device will work if it is needed, to inform employees and volunteers about where the devices are located and how they work, to have a means of communicating with the authorities in case of an emergency, and to make reports to the governing body. Most of the regulations are concerned only with what a facility must do in order to obtain a certificate. Neither the statute nor the regulations, therefore, creates the duty that appellant seeks to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Legislative History of the Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Appellant goes on to argue that the drafting history of \u00a7 13-517 reveals a legislative intention to require registered facilities to use AEDs whenever a person suffers or reasonably appears to have suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Although Maryland courts ordinarily do not look to legislative history if, as in this case, the meaning of a statute is clear on its face (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Swedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173903\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/441/#p453\">\n    439 Md. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453-55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173903\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/441/#p453\">\n    96 A.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ), we have considered appellant's arguments and found them wanting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The General Assembly enacted the original version of \u00a7 13-517 in 1999. Appellant focuses on amendments that occurred in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Before the 2008 amendments, the statute contained the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (c) The EMS board may: ... (5) Approve educational and training programs required under this section that ... (ii) Include training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (f) To qualify for a certificate a facility shall: ...

Laws, ch. 593, \u00a7 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Appellant focuses, first, on the removal of former subsection (j), which said that an \"authorized\" person at an \"authorized\n   facility\" \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   administer automated external defibrillation [.]\" (Emphasis added.) She argues that by deleting the paragraph that contained the permissive verb \"may,\" the legislature \"essentially endorsed an implicit reading and interpretation,\" under which a facility \"shall\" provide automated external defibrillation if a person suffers (or reasonably appears to have suffered) sudden cardiac distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Appellant tacitly concedes the case with the equivocal language about \"implicit\" readings. To ascertain what a statute means, a court looks at the actual language of the statute and does not add language that the legislature did not include. Nothing in the actual language states or even implies that a facility has an affirmative obligation to use an AED in any circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Appellant goes on to cite the amendment to what is now subsection (e)(4). In that amendment the legislature changed the phrase \"an individual who operates an automated external defibrillator\" to \"an individual who is expected to operate an AED.\" In her view, the change \"establishes an affirmative and 'expected' duty on the part of a registered facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Appellant's contention is unpersuasive. In full, subsection (e)(4) states that \"[t]o qualify for a certificate a facility shall: ... (4) Ensure that each individual who is expected to operate an AED for the registered facility has successfully completed an educational training course and refresher training as required by the EMS Board.\" In context, this language means that a facility can obtain a certificate only if the person who is expected (i.e. anticipated) to use its AED has the proper training to use the AED. This language does not create a duty to use an AED in any specific set of circumstances; it simply creates a condition precedent for the acquisition of a certificate. The legislature did not surreptitiously incorporate an affirmative duty to use an AED when it required an expected (or anticipated) operator to receive training before a facility could receive a certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Appellant concludes with a rhetorical question about why the legislature would establish a statewide program for public\n   access to AEDs unless it intended that registered facilities would have an affirmative obligation to use them. The short answer is that the legislature wanted to encourage businesses, public facilities, and places of public accommodation to make these life-saving devices available, while ensuring that the devices would work, that people knew where they were located, and that they would be used by persons with proper training if they are used at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court of Appeals of New York has expressed a similar insight.

Consequently, we affirm the grant of the YMCA's dispositive motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED.
