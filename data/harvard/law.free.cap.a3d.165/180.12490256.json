Salinas, an appraiser, provided two opinions to banks regarding the value of a certain property. In a subsequent, unrelated tax appeal regarding that property, a party sought to compel him to testify in a deposition regarding those opinions. The issue presented in this writ of error is whether an expert, who previously has rendered an opinion on an issue material to a later, unrelated case in which neither party has engaged his services, may be compelled by subpoena to provide an opinion in that case. We hold that Connecticut recognizes a qualified testimonial privilege for unretained expert witnesses and, accordingly, we grant the writ of error and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In April, 2013, Redding Life Care, LLC (Redding Life), initiated an action against the defendant in error town of Redding (town) to challenge the town's assessment of a property owned by Redding Life (tax appeal). Prior to the initiation of that action, Salinas had completed two appraisals of that property on behalf of banks that were considering lending to Redding Life. In July, 2014, after learning about these appraisals, the town filed a motion for commission\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to depose Salinas. Redding Life and CapitalSource Bank, a nonparty to the\n   tax appeal and one of the banks for which Salinas had conducted an appraisal, objected. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Arnold W. Aronson\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted the town's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Approximately four months later, the town served Salinas with a subpoena compelling him to appear at a deposition scheduled for January, 2015. Salinas filed a motion for a protective order seeking to prohibit the town from taking his deposition. He argued that he had not been retained in the tax appeal, did not have any relevant knowledge, and could not be compelled to testify as an expert. He specifically argued that Connecticut law \"prohibit[s] the compulsion of unretained expert testimony,\" and referred the court to the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Drown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Markowitz\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV-05-4010740 (August 18, 2006) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20855\">\n    41 Conn.

The town shall pay the witness his fees and expenses as provided in Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (c) (2). The town shall enter into any reasonable protective order proposed by the witness or the other parties designed to limit the use of the information obtained in the deposition to this case only.\" Salinas subsequently filed a motion seeking the following articulation: \"Did the trial court conclude that ... Salinas can be compelled under Connecticut law to provide expert witness testimony against his will? If so, what is the basis for that conclusion?\" The court responded as follows: \"The answer to the first question is no. It was unnecessary to reach that conclusion because [Salinas] had already authored appraisals that contained his opinions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Salinas filed a writ of error with our Supreme Court on February 3, 2015, seeking appellate review of the trial court's denial of his motion for a protective order. The town filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the court's discovery order did not constitute an appealable final judgment. Our Supreme Court transferred the matter to this court, and this court denied the town's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Salinas argues that the court erred in failing to recognize that an unretained expert privilege\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   exists under Connecticut common law and, consequently, erred in denying his motion for a protective\n   order. He notes that, although Connecticut appellate courts have not addressed directly the question whether an unretained expert privilege exists under Connecticut common law, several Superior Court decisions have recognized such a privilege. Salinas also argues that, if this court holds that such a privilege does exist, the privilege is absolute. In the alternative, he argues that there should be a qualified privilege that \"can only be overcome by an affirmative showing of 'compelling need.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The town responds that \"[t]here is no need for this court to opine whether any unretained nonparty expert testimonial privilege exists in Connecticut with regard to potential trial testimony at this time,\" because, as the court noted in its articulation, Salinas' testimony, regardless of whether it is admissible at trial, is discoverable because it \" 'appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence'; Practice Book \u00a7 13-2 ; especially under the liberal standard that applies to discovery in civil cases.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The town then argues that, if we do address the issue of privilege, we are bound by the precedent of\n   <em>\n    Town of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomaston\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ives\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1598281\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/156/166/\">\n    156 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20515\">\n    239 A.2d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). In that case, the town posits, our Supreme Court held that the question of whether a privilege exists should be determined on a\n   case-by-case basis, and that if a privilege does exist, it is never absolute. We agree with Salinas that an unretained expert privilege does exist under Connecticut common law, but we hold that it is a qualified privilege rather than an absolute privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth the standard of review. The question of whether an unretained expert privilege exists, and, if it does, whether that privilege is absolute, are questions of law.

Accordingly, our review is plenary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We turn first to the issue of whether we should recognize an absolute privilege. Connecticut appellate courts have not yet addressed directly whether an unretained expert privilege exists under Connecticut law. See C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (5th Ed. 2014) \u00a7 7.13, p. 485. Salinas argues that we should recognize an absolute unretained expert privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the basis of\n   <em>\n    Milliun\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Milford Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244757\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/129/81/#p108\">\n    129 Conn.App. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108-109,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20A.3d%2036\">\n    20 A.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), aff'd on other grounds,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20711\">\n    310 Conn. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20A.3d%20887\">\n    80 A.3d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), however, we decline to recognize an absolute privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Milliun\n   </em>\n   , this court held that nonparty physicians could be compelled to testify as expert witnesses for the plaintiff conservator in a professional negligence action regarding the bases for medical opinions they previously formed after treating the conserved person.

This case provides us with an opportunity to clarify whether a qualified privilege exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Several Superior Court decisions have recognized a qualified unretained expert privilege.

The plaintiff had argued that there was a compelling need for the expert testimony of the decedent's treating physicians because,\n   in addition to being generally conversant as medical experts, the physicians had \"unique insight concerning the decedent and would therefore be in the best position to testify as to treatment and survivability.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20789\">\n    Id., at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court rejected this argument, noting that \"[t]his part of the plaintiffs' argument, taken to its logical extension, would necessitate that any physician who treats a patient after alleged malpractice has occurred is required to become an expert witness in an ensuing malpractice action.

We believe that, in order to strike this balance properly, the trial court here should, in determining whether to grant Salinas' motion for a protective order because his testimony is appropriately\n   barred by the qualified\n   unretained expert privilege, consider (1) whether, under the circumstances, he reasonably should have expected that, in the normal course of events, he would be called upon to provide opinion testimony in subsequent litigation; and (2) whether there exists a compelling need for his opinion testimony in this case.
