The habeas court concluded that the petitioner had procedurally defaulted his claims by way of deliberate bypass, thus depriving that court of subject matter jurisdiction over the petition. The Appellate Court grounded its decision to reverse and remand for further proceedings on its conclusion that the habeas court improperly had acted sua sponte on the basis of that court's incorrect conclusion that the deliberate bypass standard implicates subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20Conn.%20App.%20701\">\n    157 Conn.App. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705, 707,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20A.3d%201003\">\n    117 A.3d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We granted the respondent's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following question: \"Did the Appellate Court properly determine that it was improper, based on the record of this habeas petition, for the trial court to sua sponte dismiss the petition on procedural default grounds?\"\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20903\">\n    318 Conn. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20632\">\n    122 A.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral\n   arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
