Although we find no abuse of discretion, we determine to impose sanctions independently based on appellant\u2019s frivolous resort to this appeals court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-22\">Plaintiff, through his counsel, the appellant, filed suit for alleged failure of the Nationwide Insurance Company to defend a lawsuit brought by the family of passengers who were driving with plaintiff\u2019s son when a fatal accident occurred. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s allegations, however, the insurance company not only defended the lawsuit, but it won on a summary judgment motion. That fact did not deter appellant from pursuing the instant lawsuit for \u201cfailure to settle fast enough,\u201d claiming $10 million damages, which both the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>trate and district court below determined correctly to be meritless and frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">Counsel for plaintiff, given several opportunities to replead or find legal substantiation for her client\u2019s claim, wholly failed to do so. At the instigation of Nationwide, the magistrate assessed costs pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 in an amount apparently derived from, but substantially less than, defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this litigation. Appellant did not contest Nationwide\u2019s motion for sanctions, but merely sought review from the district court. The district court held that the magistrate\u2019s assessment lacked factual findings and thereupon vacated that award and reduced the sanction to $1,000. The district court justified this action because it found that counsel\u2019s humiliation by a Rule 11 proceeding in what appeared to be a first-time violation, together with a $1,000 sanction, were \u201cappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">We are not inclined to disturb the district court\u2019s determination of an appropriate sanction in this case. Either Rule 11 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (1982) authorizes the award of such sanctions, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, as the court deems appropriate to the violation before it. See, e.g., <em>Pin v. Texaco, Inc., </em>793 F.2d 1448, 1455-56 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Stites v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>793 F.2d 618, 621 (5th Cir.1986); <em>McGoldrick Oil Co. v. Campbell, Athey &amp; Zukowski, </em>793 F.2d 649, 653-54 (5th Cir.1986). Indeed, even the appellant does not contest that the district court awarded an <em>amount </em>of sanctions within its discretion. To be sure, the award was much less than the fees incurred by Nationwide for its counsel\u2019s activities. The subsequent history of this litigation might indicate an excessive optimism on the part of the district court that appellant's unmerito-rious use of the court system would not be repeated, but we cannot find an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s revision of the magistrate\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Assessing penalties against counsel under any of the enabling rules or statutes is an exercise in tailoring the punishment to fit the crime. The district court should not hesitate to impose sanctions on counsel where they are warranted, and the amount must be reviewed by an appellate court with considerable circumspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">Had not Nationwide obliged us by filing a motion to award sanctions for the conduct of this appeal, we would have done so <em>sua sponte. </em>This Court\u2019s authority to prevent abuse of the taxpayer-supported facilities of justice derives from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and Fed.R.App.P. 38. As in any other case, a party on whom sanctions have been imposed should not be unreasonably deterred from seeking review of the sanctions to prevent an injustice. A finding by the trial court that sanctions were appropriate will not automatically result in the further imposition of sanctions if the appellant is unsuccessful on appeal. Rather, appellate sanctions will be imposed only if the appeal of sanctions is found totally without merit. <em>United States v. Nesglo, Inc., </em>744 F.2d 887 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">Having said this, we hasten to add that the appellant should be cautious and circumspect in any appeal involving only sanctions. Such an appeal may justify further sanctions if the sanctions imposed are patently within the trial court\u2019s range of discretion and no special circumstances exist. We cannot permit the judicial system, already burdened with frivolous litigation, to be burdened with further frivolous proceedings on the issue of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">This case abundantly supports an award of damages to the appellee. The procedural history of this case in the trial court demonstrates numerous opportunities given to appellant to retreat from pursuing baseless litigation. At all stages, appellant declined to do so, and has persisted in appealing to this Court despite an order, reinstating her appeal, which warned that the Court would examine the appeal to determine whether or not it is frivolous. Even though she did not appeal the dismissal of the complaint against Nationwide, appellant persists in contending that she filed a facially valid complaint in the district court, and it was therefore erroneous to impose sanctions. Both the premise and the conclusion of her argument are false. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>There is no legal merit to the charge that an insurance company, which represented and defended its insured successfully, nevertheless failed to conclude litigation fast enough for the convenience of the insured. Appellant cites no case from any jurisdiction that suggests to the contrary. An insurance company\u2019s delay in resolving a baseless claim against the insured may indeed be painful psychologically, but we find no authority anywhere that suggests such delay breaches a legal duty to the insured. Appellant\u2019s counsel should have realized the hopelessness of her case after it was disposed of on the pleadings by the magistrate and district court with the unvarying conclusion that it was meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">Appellant\u2019s pursuit of this hopeless appeal has been very costly in judicial resources. Equally important, it has required considerable time, effort and expense on the part of appellee, whose counsel thoroughly briefed the issues for this Court. In assessing sanctions, this Court would not intend to inhibit the development of the law by imposing sanctions whenever a position is \u201cmerely erroneous\u201d <em>Stephens v. Portal Boat Co., </em>781 F.2d 481 (5th Cir.1986). On the other hand, some cases, such as this one, simply waste the courts\u2019 and litigants\u2019 time and money. Appellant was lucky that the district court reduced the magistrate\u2019s award of sanctions, and her appeal of that action compounds the poor exercise of judgment which inspired the frivolous litigation in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">Consequently, in our discretion, we award $3,000 plus double costs against appellant to be added to the judgment of $1,000 below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-1\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED, as hereinabove modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1339-13\">. The district court\u2019s decision on the merits became final in August, 1985 and was not appealed. The issue of sanctions against counsel for appellant is separately appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
