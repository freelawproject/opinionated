He cannot tell at what time he gave a mortgage to the complainants, but that he gave it subsequent to the execution of the mortgage to Mary Hopper. He says he had conversation with Van Wagenen, one \u00a9f the complainants, the last of April or 1st of May, 1846, or thereabouts, That at that conversation, he told Van Wagenen that he had a house and lot in Passaic street, Paterson, which he Wanted the complainants to take and release him from his lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>bility to them, which Van Wagenen refused, on the ground that he did not want the property, but wanted the money. That Van Wagenen then asked him, whether he had any other property with which he could secure him. Witness told him ho had no other property except Iris farm. Van Wagenen then asked him what he gave for it, and witness told him. Van Wagenen then asked how much incumbrance there was on it. Witness told him that when he bought he gave Albert Terhune a mortgage on it for $2,500. Witness also told him he had given his mother-in-law, Mary Hopper, a mortgage on it for the payment of $50 a year. Van Wagenen then asked what ho had given her that mortgage for. Witness told him that he had bought her husband\u2019s property at Administrator\u2019s sale, and thought he had it clear; he thought so then and thinks so yet. Witness gave her this mortgage because she released her right of dower to the last mentioned property. Witness says, that Andrew Hopper was the name of her husband, and that the Administrators who made the said sale were William G. Hopper and the defendant Mary Hopper. Witness says, that the said Administrators, at the said Administrator\u2019s sale, guaranteed the said property free of all incumbrance, except to the amount of $650. At the same conversation Van Wagenen asked witness, whether the mortgages he had given were on record. Witness told him he did not know. Th# above conversation took place in the morning. Van Wagenen came up in the 8 o\u2019clock car, and he and witness talked until about 2 o\u2019clock. Witness had a further conversation with Van Wagenen in the after part of the day. He wanted witness to give him a mortgage for the whole amount witness owed them; that he was satisfied to take it. At this conversationVan Wagenen asked witness no further questions about the Mary Hopper mortgage. At this time witness and Van Wagenen agreed on the terms of payment. After this, on the same day or day after, Van Wagenen had a mortgage drawn up, and witness executed it; at which time Van Wagenen and A. B. Woodruff came to witness\u2019s house. The mortgage was read over, and Terhune\u2019s mortgage was mentioned in said Van Wagenen\u2019s mortgage ; the other, to Mary Hopper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>was not. Witness told them, he would not sign it unless they were both mentioned iu it; so that there could <em>be </em>no trouble about it. Van Wagenen then showed witness a piece of paper to show that there was nothing on the property but Terhune\u2019s mortgage; that he (Van Wagenen) had been to the records, and that there was nothing on it hut the Terhune mortgage. Witness then told him that he wanted him (Van Wagenen) to give to witness a piece of paper to show that the mortgage of Mary Hopper was given, or that else he might have trouble about it. Van Wagenen did not say anything in answer to this. MsWoodruff said that it would be an irregular way of doing business ; unless witness signed the mortgage of his own free will it would be good for nothing. Witness and his wife signed it, and it ended there. He says that the mortgage given to the complainants and the one to Mai\u2019y Hopper are on the same property. Being asked whether he did not state, distinctly, to Mr\u201e Van Wagenen, at different times before the execution of the complainant\u2019s mortgage, that he had given the said mortgage to Mary Hopper, he says he did; that he remembers twice of telling Mr. Van Wagenen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b688-4\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>At the first of said conversations with. Van, Wagenen no one was by when he told him about the Mary Hopper mortgage. He recollects distinctly that he told Van Wagenen that he had given Mary Hopper a 'bond and mortgage. At this time when he told Van Wagenen this, he and Van Wagenen were in the yard back of A. B. Woodruff\u2019s office. This was the first time witness spoke to him about Mary Hopper\u2019s and the Terhune mortgage. This was the first time witness spoke to him about the Mary Hopper mortgage. Van Wagenen then asked witness, there, if witness had no other property. Witness told him he had none hut his farm. After this couversation he said nothing to Van Wagenen, nor Van Wagenen to him, until the time when the complainant\u2019s mortgage was executed, at witness\u2019s house, about the Mary Hopper mortgage. He does not r,emember that he stated at his house anything more about the Mary Hopper mortgage than he has already stated. When Van <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Wagonon and he agreed upon tho terms of payment they were in she yard back of Mr. Woodruff\u2019s office; and after dinner Van, Wagenen said he would take tho mortgage. There was no one fey then. There was no one by at any time when he told Van Wagenen about the Mary Hopper mortgage, except at the execution of tho complainant\u2019s mortgage. There was no ono present at the execution of the complainant\u2019s mortgage, when ho spoke to Van Wagenen about the Mary Hopper mortgage, but A. B. Woodruff. Pie has not told any person that the timo ho told Van Wagenen about tho Mary Hopper mortgage was at tho execution of tho complainant\u2019s mortgage, at his house. Tho complainant\u2019s counsel asked him this question. Did you not toll xae (A. B. Woodruff) that the time you told Van Wagenen about tho Mary Hopper mortgage was at the execution of tho complainant\u2019s mortgage at your house, and that your mother-in-law and hor two sons were in the next room and heard you tell him <em>1 </em>Ho answers no ; and says that he docs not recollect any such conversation ; that he never stated anything like it to A. B. Woodruff or any body else. That he does not recollect of asking A. B. Woodruff what would be the effect if Mary Hopper should prove that complainants had notice of her mortgage at the time they took their\u2019s. That he never told A. B. Woodruff, or any other person, that Mary Hopper could prove that the complainants had notice of hor mortgage at the time they took their\u2019s, for that her two sons heard him tell Van Wagenen. At the time complainant\u2019s mortgage was executed, the property in Passaic street, which he offered to sell to complainants for what he owed them, was worth fully what he owed them, over incumbrances. At the time he gave the Mary Hopper mortgage there was another mortgage given up by her to him, on property on the corner of Patorson and Van Houton streets. This mortgage so given up by her to him was the whole consideration for the present mortgage to Mary Hopper.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b689-4\"><em>Benjamin W. </em>Vandervoort,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al5\">sworn on the part of Mary Hopper, says he is a witness to the bond and mortgage of Mary Hopper; and that he believes they were executed on the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>and year of their date; and that the mortgage was acknowledged before him, as a Master in Chancery. (The acknowledgment of this mortgage is dated March 2, 1846.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b690-4\">\n<em>Absalom B. Woodruff,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQd\">sworn for the complainants, says, that, previous to the December term, 1845, of the Passaic Circuit Court, there were three notes in his hands for collection, payable to the complainants, made by John Coe. Two of them became due before or during that term. Two suits were commenced on these; one on each; returnable to said term. A summons was issued on the 3d note, returnable to March term, 1846. Interlocutory judgments were taken in the first two suits at the March term, 1846. Some time that spring, and previous to the giving of the complainant\u2019s mortgage, Coe went to New York, as witness was afterwards informed by Coe and Van Wagenen. After his return from New York, Van Wagenen came to Paterson to make some arrangement of the suits in Court; and he and C\u00f3e came to witness\u2019s office, and were there an hour or two; during which time various propositions for arranging the suits were made and discussed. Finally it was agreed between them, that Coe should give and complainants receive a mortgage on the farm on which Coe then lived, to secure the payment of the said three notes and the costs of the three suits. That mortgage was taken by the complainants by the advice of witness, who thought it a better security than any other that Coe had offered; in which opinion Van Wagenen agreed with witness. While Coe and Van Wagenen were talking of the time at which the money to be secured by the mortgage should be made payable, a person came into witness\u2019s office. Coe wanted eight years to pay the money; which Van Wagenen was unwilling to give. The person coming in while the parties were discussing this matter, and Coe having expressed a wish that the transaction should be kept private, he and Van Wagenen went out into the yard in the rear of deponent\u2019s office. They were there but a very few minutes and came in, the person who had been with witness having gone out; and when they came in, witness thinks they had agreed definitely on the time of payment as stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>mortgage. -Previous to executing the mortgage witness went to the office of the Clerk of Passaic and searched the records, and found no imcumbrance of any kind on Coe\u2019s farm, of record, except a mortgage to W. I. Ackerman, which witness thinks was then on record. Witness thinks there were some old uncanceled mortgages, which he presumes were paid; hut they were all dated prior to the conveyance to Coe. Ackerman conveyed the property to Coe by deed dated February 2d, 1846, with covenants of warranty against incumbrances. Witness supposed Ackerman able to make his covenants good. The consideration money in the deed from Ackerman to Coe is #3,900; which is the price Coe said he paid Ackerman for the property. Van Wagenen and witness thought the property would bring sufficient to pay Ackerman and the debt of the complainant. The complainants paid witness the costs of the three suits, and took a bond and mortgage to secure the payment of the amount of the three notes and these costs. The complainant\u2019s bond was signed by Coe in witness\u2019s presence; and he, at the same time, signed his name as a witness thereto; also a mortgage, of the same date, between the same parties, given to secure the moneys mentioned in the said bond. Coe signed the mortgage first. He signed it without asking or ascertaining the items which made up the amorrnt therein mentioned. After the mortgage was signed by Coe witness asked him where his wife was, and told him she must sign it too. Coe said she was in the kitchen. Witness rose to go to the kitchen door to ask her to come in. <em>Coe </em>said, \u201c <em>Don\u2019t you </em>go, the old <em>\"woman </em>(meaning Mrs. Mary Hopper) is there, and she\u2019ll be as mad as thunder if she finds out this.\u201d Coe himself went to the door and his wife came and signed the mortgage. When witness proceeded to take the acknowledgment of the mortgage, and asked Coe whether he signed, sealed and delivered it as his voluntary act and deed, Coe answered that he did not; that he would not have done it if it had not been for the suits. Witness said, that is no regular way of doing business, he could not take such an acknowledgment as that, and told him that unless he signed it as his voluntary act and deed it was no mortgage, and the complainants could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>take it. Coe then made the acknowledgment in the form certified on the mortgage; as did his wife also. The mortgage was executed and acknowledged at Coe\u2019s house. The writing on the margin of the second page of the mortgage was not done until after witness and Van Wagenen got to Coe\u2019s house on the day of the signing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-4\">Previous to the examination of John Coe in this suit, he saw witness on the piazza of Congress Hali, and asked witness what would he the effect if Mary Hopper could prove that Van Wagenen &amp; Yeoman had notice of her mortgage at the time they took their mortgage. Witness told him she could not prove it. That they had no notice of it. He said they had such notice, and she (Mrs. Hopper) could prove it; that he, Coe, gave Van Wagenen notice. Witness asked either when or where he gave him notice. Coe answered that he told him at his, Coe\u2019s house, at the time the mortgage was given to the complainants. Witness replied to Coe that he did not do any such thing. Coe replied, \u201c Well, she can prove it, for she and her two sons were in the next room and heard me tell him.\u201d Witness answered, <em>a </em>Well, then she can prove a lie, that is all I have to say.\u201d Coe replied, that she should not get any of her mortgage if he could help it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-5\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>He is solicitor of the complainants in this suit. The complainant Yeoman was not present and took no part, personally, in the transaction when the mortgage was given. The conversation in witness\u2019s office between Coe and Van Wagenen was in the forenoon of the day of the date of the mortgage. Witness cannot specify the exact time Coe and Van Wagenen were in the yard in rear of his office on that day; but thinks it was a short time; not many minutes. Can\u2019t say whether they were there ten, fifteen or twenty minutes. His impression is that all matters were arranged before they went out into the yard, except the time of payment. Witness did not, during this transaction, state to the parties that he was acting in the matter for both; though he may have said he would do nothing but what was right between them. Witness is not certain as to the time, but thinks it was four to six weeks before Coe\u2019s exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ination in this suit, that the conversation on the piazza of Congress Hall took place. This was not the first witness had heard, that Mary Hopper claimed priority over the complainant\u2019s mortgage. Thinks she had prior to that time filed her answer in this suit, and that the first knowledge he had of it was derived from the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-4\">Witness\u2019s impression is, that, at the time of the execution of complainant\u2019s mortgage at Coo\u2019s house, he said he had promised to give Mrs. Hopper a mortgage; and it is his impression that Coe gave that as a reason why she would be angry if she knew of the giving of complainant\u2019s mortgage. If this was said at that time, it was only in connection with Coe\u2019s remark that she would be angry. Witness is not positive he gave any reason; and does not know but that he, witness, derived that impression from the remark itself that she would ho angry. Witness does not remember that Coe said ho would not execute complainant\u2019s mortgage unless it was stated in it that he had given a mortgage to Mrs. Hopper. Does not remember saying to Coe that ho hurried down to the Clerk\u2019s office to got complainant\u2019s mortgage on record before Mrs. Hopper could get her\u2019s there; don\u2019t think he could have said any such thing as that. Witness recollects that they hurried to the office under an apprehension that there might be somebody in the kitchen prepared to execute a mortgage and hurry it on record before the complainant\u2019s mortgage. Witness had this suspicion because Coe stopped him when he started to call Mrs. Coe. Witness does not know that there was a quarrel between Coe and Mrs. Hopper. Coe has talked with witness as if he was angry with her. Complainant\u2019s mortgage was executed in a room which, as witness supposed, joined the kitchen.. Don\u2019t remember whether they entered this room through the kitchen; it may bo that they did. Witness has no recollection of anything besides what is here stated, that took place that day, that can have any bearing on the matters in controversy in this suit. He can\u2019t state positively, hut thinks, that when they left Coe\u2019s house that day they did not go out through the kitekon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-5\">In addition to the circumstance of Coe\u2019s stopping him when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>started to call Mrs. Coe, witness\u2019s suspicions were excited <em>by </em>the circumstance of Coe\u2019s signing the mortgage without inquiring into the particulars which made up the amount. At the time of entering Coe\u2019s house witness does not recollect that any bill of particulars was handed to Coe by Van Wagenen; though there might have been. If there were any, does not think it had all the particulars in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-4\">Depositions impeaching, and in support of John Coe\u2019s character for truth and veracity were read.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b694-5\">\n<em>A.

Woodruff,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APq9\">at a subsequent day, (about three weeks after his first examination,) and after all the other testimony had been taken, offering to testify further in the matter, in explanation of a statement made in his former examination, says: that by stating in his former cross-examination, that at the time of entering Coe\u2019s house he, the witness, did not recollect that any bill of particulars was handed to Coe by Van Wagenen, though there might have been such a bill of particulars handed to Coe and the circumstances not recollected by him, the witness. Witness thinks, if such statement had been handed to Coe, he would have seen it; for witness and Van Wagenen were together during the whole time they were at Coe\u2019s house. At the time the mortgage was executed, Van Wagenen sat at one end of the table and witness at the other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b694-6\"><em>A. B.

This mortgage and the acknowledgment are dated March 2d, 1846. The mortgage to the complainants is dated April 23d, 1846. The question is, had the complainant\u2019s notice of this prior mortgage when they took theirs ?</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">John Coe, the man who gave both these mortgages, and who is, clearly, as I apprehend, a competent witness for the purpose, testifies distinctly that he informed Van Wagenen, one of the complainants, before ho executed the complainant\u2019s mortgage, that he had given a mortgage on the same premises to Mrs. Hopper. An effort has been made, on the part of the complainants, to overcome this testimony by calling witnesses to impeach the character of Coe for truth. I do not think it necessary to examine particularly the nature and amount of the testimony produced by the respective parties against and in support of Coe\u2019s character for truth. I will only say that, in view of the testimony in support of his veracity, I think it would be going very far to deny to the party whose rights depend on his evidence the benefit of it upon testimony of the nature of the impeaching testimony offered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">But I think the cause may be satisfactorily decided by a careful examination and comparison of the testimony of Coe, on the part of Mrs. Hopper, and the testimony of A. B. Woodruff, on the part of the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Coe testifies, that, in the morning of the day on which the mortgage to the complainants was given, he told Van Wagenen he had a house and lot in Passaic street, Paterson, which he wanted the complainant to take, and release him from his liability to them; which Van Wagenen declined. That Van Wagenen then asked him whether he had any other property with which to secure him. That he answered, no other except his farm. That Van Wagenen then asked him how much he gave for it, and he told him. That Van Wagenen then asked him how much it was incumbered for, and witness told him he had given a mortgage on it to Terhune, from whom he bought it, for $2,500, and a mortgage to Mrs. Hopper for the payment of $50 a year. That Van Wagenen asked him whether the mortgages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>he had given were recorded, and that he told Van Wagenen he did not know. That he had a further conversation with Van Wagenen in the after part of the day. Van Wagenen wanted him to give a mortgage for the whole amount he owed the complainants i that he was satisfied to take it. After this. Van Wagenen had a mortgage drawn up; and Van Wagenen and A. B. Woodruff came to his house. That the mortgage was read over, and the Terhune mortgage was mentioned in it, but the mortgage to Mrs. Hopper was not. That he told them he would not sign .it unless they were both mentioned in it. That Van Wagenen then showed him a paper, to show that there was nothing on record but the Terhune mortgage. That he then told Van Wagenen, that he-wanted Van Wagenen to give him a paper to show that the Mary Hopper mortgage was given, or he might have trouble about it. That Van Wagenen said nothing in answer to this. That Woodruff said it would be an irregular way of doing business $ unless he signed <em>the mortgage </em>of his own free will it would be good for nothing. That the mortgage was signed and it ended there.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Mr. Woodruff, examined for the complainants, says, he went with Van Wagenen to Coe\u2019s house, and was with them there during all the time until the mortgage was executed. He says nothing in contradiction of Coe\u2019s statement as to what passed there in reference to the Mary Hopper mortgage. This is certainly remarkable if nothing was said by Coe showing that he had tgiven a mortgage to Mrs. Hopper. And further, Mr. Woodruff nowhere says in his testimony, that he had no notice of the mortgage to Mary Hopper. If he had no knowledge or notice of it, I cannot imagine that he would have failed to say so. This, in view of the testimony of Coe, is, I think, conclusive. Woodruff was acting for the conplainants; and if he had notice it was notice to them. The same reasoning proves that there is no good reason for doubting Coe\u2019s statement that Van Wagenen had notice. It was certainly in the power of Mr. Woodruff,'if nothing passed in reference to <em>the </em>Mary Hopper mortgage while he and Van Wagenen were at Coe\u2019s house, to have given a full and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>direct contradiction to Coe\u2019s statements. His failure to contradict them, and his failure to say that he had no notice, decides the question, clearly, for the defendant Mary Hopper. Her mortgage is entitled to priority over that of the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
