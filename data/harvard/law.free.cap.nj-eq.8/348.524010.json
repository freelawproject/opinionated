(as stated in bill.) That this defendant has un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>derstood and believes, that a large portion of said account, if any there be, is for money furnished by the intestate to his said son Aaron while the said Aaron was in Europe, whither he had gone for the benefit of his health, and where he remained for several years; and the sums furnished at the times &amp;c. were bestowed for the procurement of necessary apparel &amp;c., and to enable his said son to live respectably &amp;c.; and he submits, that such sums cannot be considered as advancements.

The said Ebenezer said he was pleased to see him come to pay money at that time, for he was about making up $1,000 to send to France to his son Aaron, who was in Paris at that time with his family,, and had written t\u00f3 him for money. Witness asked if Aaron was-not wealthy, and expressed surprise that Aaron should send to said Ebenezer for money. Ebenezer Tucker said, Aaron was in limited circumstances, so much so that he had frequently called on him, said Ebenezer Tucker, for assistance prior to that; tim\u00e9, and that he had advanced money to him several times before'that. He said he had charged against Aaron, on his book,, what he had let him have, and that it was to come out of Aaron\u2019s sharb of his estate. . He said, \u201c if Aaron has it in my life-time he cannot expect to have it after I am gone <em>i </em>he can\u2019t have it but once; it makes little difference to me whether he has it now or after my death ; if he can enjoy it now, he might as well have-it.\u201d Witness heard him speak on the same subject more than-once before to the same purport.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\">\n<em>Wm.

Witness heard him speak on the subject a number of times. Thinks Aaron returned from France in 1837. While Aaron was in France, witness frequently heard Ebenezer Tucker speak of raising money to send him. At these times he said he intended the money should go as a part of Aaron\u2019s share of his estate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-3\">\n<em>Isaiah Adams</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP45\">testifies, that ho was a tenant under Ebenezer' Tucker for 15 or 16 years, and is familiar with his hand-writing. That all the items in the account set forth in the bill, as found in <em>the </em>books of Ebenezer Tucker, are in the hand-writing of Ebenezer Tucker. He has frequently heard Ebenezer Tucker speak of raising money to send his son Aaron in France. He said his son was there in big company, and it would not do to let him starve. He said the physicians had told his son he must go to France; that if he remained in this country he must die ; and that a change of climate might restore his health. He said that Aaron had no means of his own, and that he must send him money. He said that if Aaron outlived him he would be entitled to a share of his estate, and that he might as well have a part of it for the purpose of regaining his health, for if Aaron died before him, the money would do him no good, and he might as well have it now as after he, Ebenezer Tucker, was gone; and that if he had it now, he could not expect to have it at another time, Witness had heard him speak on this subject a great-many times.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-4\">\n<em>William Allen\u2019s</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqxp\">testimony is to the same effect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-5\"><em>A. </em>Brooming,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWK\">for the complainants, cited <em>Rev.
