The testator, in effect, puts this $500 in the Church as trustees for a special purpose. If the Church is to take \u201ca share of the residue, under the residuary clause, it will take it absolutely, without any limitation, and without any direction as to how it shall be used, but to be used and disposed of at pleasure. I cannot think that the testator, after having, in reference to the comparatively small sum of $500, given the direction contained in the will, could have intended to include the Church in the residuary clause, and to give to it so large a sum as its share of the residue would amount to, to be used and disposed of at pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The words <em>u </em>those,\u201d in the residuary clause, should,.in its connection, be'regarded as applying to persons, and the clause should be read, <em>u </em>all those persons that I have given legacies to.\u201d The word <em>i! </em>person\u201d does not naturally apply to corporations, and, as a general rule, does not include corporations. I am of opinion that the Church is not entitled to a share of the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Decree for complainants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
