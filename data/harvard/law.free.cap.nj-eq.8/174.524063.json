But the counsel for the prior mortgagee apprises the Court that he intends to proceed by a new bill, and asks costs on dismissal. He is at liberty to proceed with the cause as it stands, in the name of complainant. There is no reason why he should not do so, except that of getting costs on the dismissal and the making a full new bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\"><em>Mr. Chetwood </em>waived his motion and took an order under the rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
