That said Stryker and Talmage, believing said Brown to be sincere, and putting full confidence in his declarations and integrity, assented to his said proposal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-3\">That, at the time and place of said sale, on said 29th of June, 1840, several able and responsible persons attended, and. were present for the purpose of bidding upon and purchasing the said property, which was then worth upwards of <em>$5,000. </em>That said Brown attended the said sale and considered himself the friend of the complainant; represented her as an orphan, and in danger of losing her property; and that it was his intention to purchase the said property for her.

That said brick house and lot are principally relied- upon by the complainant to obtain the balance of her said claim from the said Stryker; and she has good reason to believe, that unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>said Brown conveys to her the said house and lot she will lose nearly or quite $7,000 of her said claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">That, ever since the said hrick house was built, the said Stryker has lived in the same; the complainant, since the death of her mother, August 4th, 1832, having lived with her grandfather, the said Stryker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">That the complainant attained twenty-one on the 10th of November, 1846.
