It has neve5-' paid' any dividend, to the best of my knowledge. I think the first intimation I had that he had given his proxies, was what he said to me that day. I never saw the Ryersons use his proxy. I bought that stock from Mr. Zabriskie, Mr. Campbell\u2019s Administrator, one or two years after the interview with Mr. Camp\u25a0bell. Mr. Zabriskie, I think, took time to consider before he sold tome.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
