The Committee which had been appointed to procure subscriptions for the repairs of the church were called upon for their report; from which it appears that $253 had been subscribed for that object. It also appears, from statements made by members of that Committee, that the repairing of the church is a measure so unpopular, and so much opposed by the people of the congregation, that they were constrained to desist from their labors.

That among the items of business enumerated and specified in said Constitution as belonging to the consistory are the. calling of ministers, the building of churches, and whatever relates to the temporalities of the church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">That the other ecclesiastical assemblies of said denomination next in importance are the \u201c Classis,\u201d the Particular Synod and the General Synod.

That C. T. Sharp and G-. Hall be a committee to appraise and estimate the value of this church.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-6\">That the aforesaid consistory, at a meeting duly held by them since the filing of the bill in this cause, passed the following preamble and resolutions, (sotting <em>them </em>forth.) The preamble recites the filing of the bill in this cause. That the consistory believe they have acted in the premises according to the wishes of a large majority of the congregation, as will appear by the minutos and proceedings of the congregation held in the church on the 28th of October <em>last; </em>and that it is evident by an instrument in writing dated Oct. 28, 1848, that a large majority, viz. a majority of more than two-thirds of the original and legal pew holders in the present church or house of worship are in favor of re-building and moving the said house from the site whore it now stands, and placing it upon a lot, &amp;c. And that consistory believes they have acted in conformity with the laws of this State and of the articles and constitution for the government of this church, and have been sustained and approved of by the Classis of New Brunswick, through a committee by them appointed, in all the proceedings had by this consistory in this matter, Therefore resolved, that Rev. G. T. and J. S. be a committee to protect and defend the rights and interests of this congregation against said complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">The defendants say, that the contract with Goltra for the erection of a new church and the abandonment of the old, as referred to in the bill, was duly executed by a majority of the consistory ; and that John Ryer, one of the members of the consistory, has, since the expiration of said contract, signed a certificate, hereinafter set forth, signifying his approval of said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">That the new church, so as aforesaid ordered to be built, lias been partially erected, the foundation being partly up ; and that they are impeded and embarrassed in further carrying on the work by being prevented from using the materials of the old church in the erection of the new.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>They say that four years ago it became apparent to the congregation that extensive repairs to and enlargement of the old church must be made or that a new church would be necessary. That, as early as January, 1844, a committee of the consistory was appointed to ascertain the expediency and expense of altering the church. That the subject was then talked of, and continued to be for two years or more ; but no decided action was taken. On the 1th January, 1841, the subject of the alteration and repair of the church was again brought forward ; when, in consideration of the importance of the subject and the absence of some of the members of the consistory, it was determined to call a' meeting of the consistory, and of a committee of the congregation which had been pi-eviously appointed, to confer and advise with the consistory in relation to the finances of the church. This committee was no more than a merely voluntary committee, without power, and not recognized in any manner by the constitution or regulations of the denomination with which said church was connected; and it has now ceased to exist. This meeting of the consistory and said committee was called for January 16,1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-3\">On that day a meeting was accordingly held, and it was determined to re-model the church, when the subject was again dropped and suffered to die away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\">On the 2d September, 1848, a meeting of the congregation was called by the consistory, to consult on the propriety of surrendering to the Board of Domestic Missions of the Reformed Dutch Church the sum theretofore annually received by the said church at Rockaway. At this meeting of the congregation it was resolved, that a meeting of the congregation be called, two weeks from that day, to consider the re-modeling of the church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">On the 16th September, 1848, the meeting was accordingly held, in the church, and a resolution was passed to build a neAV church, on the hill, in the same place where Goltra has now contracted to build said church. At this meeting a committee was appointed to raise money for the purpose of building the same. This committee did not raise means enough to render it safe for the consistory to proceed, and they did not act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">On the 9th October, 1848, another meeting of the congregaion was held, when it was resolved that the church edifice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>insufficient and incommodious, and that, as a congregation, they should proceed at once, either to make alterations in the old church or to build a new one. This resolution was passed almost unanimously; and a majority then present being in favor of an alteration of the old church, a committee was appointed to solicit subscriptions for that purpose ; but so unpopular had the measure become with tho congregation that the committee were unable to procure funds; and on the 28th October, 1848, tho proceedings were had by the congregation as are set out in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\">They say that more than two-thirds of the heads of families have signed a certificate signifying their approval of the abandonment of the old church and the erection of a new one on the site selected; which certificate is as follows : <em>\u201c Wo, </em>the undersigned, do hereby certify that we are members of tho congregation that worship in the old church at Rockaway, and are in favor of the abandonment and disposal of said old church and tho erection of a new church, at the site selected, and where the corner-stone has recently been laid.\u201d And that said certificate is signed by many others who are members of the congregation and are not heads of families, but who pay their portion of the salary. That this certificate is signed by all the persons who wore members of the consistory on the 9th November, 1848, when the resolution to build was passed, except Peter C. Wyckoff, and by five of the present consistory, exclusive of the minister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">The defendants say there is also a subscription list for the purpose of raising money to erect the church, signed by 98 names, almost all of whom are members of the congregation, and have subscribed, in the aggregate, $1,570.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">That more than two-thirds of the legal pew-holders under and according to the articles in the bill set forth, adopted for the regulation of pews, have relinquished their interest in the pews of said church, by tho following release: <em>a </em>To the minister and consistory, &amp;c., and to all whom it may concern: Whereas an effort is about being made to re-build and to move tho said house of worship from tho site where it now stands, and to place it upon, &amp;c., therefore, to aid in the accomplishment of this object, we do relinquish and surrender up all the right and title to any pew which we or any of us hold in the said church. Witness &amp;c., this 23d of October, 1848.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The defendants say that, excepting Goltra, they have done nothing in their individual capacity; hut have acted only by authority of the church. That the Classis have a superintending and advisory power over the affairs of the church, which power was exercised with reference to the matter of building the new church at Rockaway, as appears by the following report, made by a committee appointed by the Classis of New Brunswick, as follows, (setting it forth.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">. .The report states that said committee unanimously agree \u2014 1st. That there is a great want of room in the present house. 2d. That it would be unwise to try to repair or re-model the existing house; because it would only postpone the question of a new church, which must come up again within five years at farthest. 3d. That therefore a new house is desirable. 4th. The only remaining point is the location of the new edifice. If this question was now entirely new, the committee might hesitate in expressing an opinion; but since, at a meeting of the congregation, held after due notice, there was a vote of more than two-thirds (36 to 14) in favor of the site on the hill; since this has been actually bought by the consistory, and nearly $1,800 has been subscribed towards erecting a building there; and since it would make the church nearly equi-distant between the two villages of Mechanicsville and White House, we cannot but think it entitled to the preference. . They accordingly advise the church and congregation to act in accordance with these views. That the church can prosper, things remaining as they are, is manifestly out of the question. They therefore urge the consistory to go steadily forward, and press the new enterprise to completion at the earliest possible period. This report was dated April 26, 1849, and signed by the committee of the Classis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">And \u201c The Trustees, &amp;c.,\u201d who in the bill are styled a The consistory of &amp;c.,5\u2019 further show, that the proceedings set out in this answer as their acts were done in a lawful manner, and were such as they insist they had a right to <em>do; </em>and that they have been and are still greatly annoyed and wronged by the proceedings of the complainants, who, in instituting said suit, are endeavoring to obstruct them in the lawful discharge of their duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and are opposing the will of the ecclesiastical assemblies of the Reformed Dutch Church and the will of a large majority of the congregation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">On this answer, a motion was made to dissolve the injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-6\"><em>F.

The nature or extent of the injury sought to be prevented by injunction are not such as should induce this Court to interpose by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Without expressing any opinion, therefore, as to the strict legal rights of the parties, I think the case, as developed by the bill and answer, is such as should, in the discretion which the Court of Chancery exercises in reference to injunctions, determine the Court to leave the parties to their legal remedies, if they have any.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Injunction dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
