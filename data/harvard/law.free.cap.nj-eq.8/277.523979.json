Smith, for $3,913.03 ; one in favor of Patrick Mahan, for $478; and one in favor of Andrew Carrigan,. for $2,780.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">That all the before mentioned mortgages and judgments were existing liens upon the real estate of said Falls Co. at the time of the appointment of the Receivers ; that large arrears of interest had accrued upon them ; and that, independent of the simple contract debts, not secured by mortgage or judgment liens, they amounted to a sum greatly beyond the real value of all the property of the said Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">They say that, the Receivers having reported to this Court-that it was necessary that the real estate, corporate rights and other property of the said Company should be sold for the payment of debts, an order was made on the 7th November, 1843,. directing the Receivers to make sale according to law of all the real estate of the said Company, and all the chartered rights, privileges and franchises belonging to them and appertaining to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>their raceways, and all the right, title and interest of the said' Company of, in and to the same. And, the said Receivers having represented to the Legislature that the property of the said Company was incumbered for more than it would bring at public sale; that it was doubtful whether it could be sold without Legislative aid; and that the interests of the creditors of said Company would be promoted by a sale of such real estate, franchises and works clear of all incumbrance ; the Legislature, on the 15th February, 1844, passed the act entitled &lt;\u00a3 An act to relieve the creditors of \u00a3 The Trenton Delaware Falls Co. \u201d by which act the Receivers were not only authorized to sell the real estate, franchises and works of the said Company at public sale, but wore authorized to sell the same free and clear of all incumbrance ; and to make to the purchaser as good and sufficient a title as the said Company had in the real estate, franchises and works, free and clear of all mortgages, judgments or other liens whatever; the purchasers to hold the said works, franchises and real estate as a joint stock Company, in the same manner as the original stockholders held the same; that after the said purchase the said company should be known as <em>\u201c </em>The Trenton Water Power Company,\u201d and by that name might sue and be sued, have a common seal, and exercise all its corporate powers ; but that nothing in said act should be construed to affect the rights of the several creditors of the said <em>\u201c </em>The Trenton Delaware Falls Company\u201d to receive their distributive share of the proceeds of the said sale according to law, or to invalidate-any existing leases made by said Company or assignment thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\">They admit that, on or about Feb\u2019y 20, 1844, the Receivers-did sell all the real estate, works and franchises of the said Falls Co., as stated in the bill, and executed to the purchaser thereof a deed for the same; and that the purchaser, in pursuance of the said act of the Legislature, organized himself and his associates in said purchase into a corporation by the name of \u00a3\u00a3 The Trenton Water Power Company;\u201d and that these defendants are the same Company, and now hold, possess, occupy and enjoy the said estate, works and franchises, and claim to be the land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>lords of the complainants, in place of said Falls Co., and to be entitled to collect and receive the rents due and to become'due from the complainants upon the said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-3\">They say that the Receivers sold the said real estate, works and franchises of the said Falls Co. free and clear of all mortgages, judgments or other liens whatsoever, as they were directed and authorized to do ; that said sale was confirmed by this Court, and the deed therefor was made by order of this Court, and the purchase money paid over to the Receivers on the delivery of the said deed; and that, by the express terms of the said deed and the said act of the Legislature, these defendants hold the said property free and clear from all incumbrances created by the said Falls Co., and subject only to the right, as they submit, of the lessees of the said'Falls Co. and the assignees of such lessees to draw water from the raceway of these defendants, in the manner prescribed by their leases, upon their paying the rents, and performing the duties therein reserved, to these defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\">They admit that said Wm. Potts, in behalf of himself and his <em>cestuis que trust, </em>claims to be entitled to collect and receive the whole amount of the rents due and to become due upon the said lease to the complainants, until they receive full payment and satisfaction of their debts ; but these defendants insist that the said Wm. Potts, as trustee as aforesaid, is not entitled to receive the said rents, or any part thereof; and they admit that they, these defendants, claim to be entitled to the said rents which have accrued since their purchase as aforesaid, and have given notice to the Company of their said claim, and requested them not to pay over the said rents, or any part thereof, to the said Wm. Potts, trustee as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">They say that the whole, real estate and property of the said Falls Co. was incumbered with mortgage and judgment liens, at the time they made the assignment of the said lease, to an amount which, with the interest and costs accrued thereon, have exhausted the whole of the purchase money, being $150,000, paid for the said real estate and property on the Receivers\u2019 sale; and that the said Falls Co., after the assignment of the said lease, incumbered their real estate and property to a very large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>additional amount, by giving other mortgages and contracting debts upon which other judgments were recovered against them, none of which incumbrances so subsequently contracted have ever been paid, except some portion of the judgment of P. T. Smith ; and that it was in consequence of the existence of these large incumbrances, greatly exceeding the value of the works, that the Legislature, upon the representations of the Receivers, passed the act authorizing the sale to be made free and clear of all incumbrances whatever ; and they submit, that the reservation in the said act in favor of the leases of the Falls Co. and the assignment thereof was not intended to set up the said assignment to Wm. Potts, trustee as aforesaid, of the lease made to the complainants as an incumbrance upon the said real estate prior to all the legal incumbrances existing upon the same; and that the Legislature had no constitutional power to do so if they had so intended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-3\">They submit that the said assignment of the said lease created no legal incumbrance whatever upon the said real estate. And that the said Wm. Potts and his <em>cesluis que trust </em>never had any of their claims secured by mortgage or judgment against said Falls Co.; but were creditors at large, and only entitled, after the sale* as aforesaid, to be paid^ro <em>rata </em>with other creditors at large of said Falls Co., after all the mortgage and judgment creditors were satisfied out of the proceeds of said sale. And that, the whole. real estate and property of the said Falls Co. having been sold, as aforesaid, free and clear of incumbrance, and the purchase money exhausted in the satisfaction of existing liens, the said trustee and those whom he represents are not entitled to have their debts charged upon the estate so purchased in the hands of these defendants; which is, in effect, the claim set up by the said Wm. Potts and those whom he represents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">They admit that the complainants are entitled to a deduction of rent for stoppage of water, for one month and fifteen days, and not for the time claimed by the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-5\"><em>C.

It cannot now be disturbed by any action of this Court. An appeal should have been taken from that decree of confirmation, as the only mode of correcting it if it was wrong. I cannot now declare that that sale was made subject to incumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>From some facts stated in argument it would seem that, when the act for the sale free from incumbrances was applied for, it was understood by the parties who applied for it that Potts, trustee &amp;c., should not he affected in his right to receive the rents from Fish and Green for the purposes stated in what is called the assignment to him of the lease to Fish and Green ; and I can very well imagine that the language used in the proviso of the act was understood by the parties applying for the act, or by those interested in the rents derivable from that lease, to be sufficient to protect Potts, trustee &amp;c., in the receipt of those rents. But I do not see that the Court is at liberty to inquire what any person soliciting the passage of an act, or assenting to its passage, understood to be the meaning of its language. And, again, such understanding -would not affect the purchaser at the Boceivors\u2019 sale, or prior or subsequent mortgages of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The words \u201c assignment thereof,\u201d in the clause, in the act of February, 1844, providing that nothing therein contained should be construed to invalidate any existing leases or assignment thereof, moan, assignment by the lessee or lessees, and not, assignment by the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">My conclusion on the re-hearing is the same as on the first hearing \u2014 that the Water Power Company are entitled to the rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
