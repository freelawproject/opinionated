S. died intestate, leaving a widow and four daughters, three of whom were married^ the complainant being the husband of one; and leaving a farm. The married \u00a1f daughters, with their husbands and the single daughter, conveyed the farm to J. B. for $6,750, with covenants by the husbands and the single daughter of seizin, and against incumbrances, except a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court authorizing the administrator of the intestate, the defendant, to sell lands to pay debts, and of warranty. J. B. paid the consideration money for the farm, and the three husbands and the single daughter, each, deposited one-third of their respective shares of said consideration money in the hands of the defendant, in trust to pay the widow the interest thereof during her life, and after her death to repay the same to the persons who so deposited the same, or their legal representatives; and thereupon the widow executed to J. B. a release of her dower in the said farm; and the defendant, being the administrator of the intestate, by writing under seal, acknowledged that, with assets he had received and should receive, all the debts would be satisfied, and ex\" onerated the lands so conveyed to J. B. from the operation of the said decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court. Afterwards, the single daughter died, and by her will gave to the wife of the complainant her share of the said moneys deposited as aforesaid, on the death of the widow; and appointed the complainant executor of her will. Afterwards, the wife of the complainant died, and administration of her estate was granted to the complainant. The widow afterwards died. The complainant, in his own right, exhibited his bill against the defendant, for the proportion of the said money deposited with the defendant which belonged to the said single daughter in her litetime, and also for the proportion thereof belonging to the complainant, divided to him during the coverture as husband of his said deceased wife, and deposited by him with \u00a1the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-6\">On demurrer, it was held, that the complainant might come into this Court, in his individual right, to recover the money so deposited by him with the defendant. But that he could not sue in his own right for the money so given to his wife by the will of the single daughter, of which he was executor: that for this claim he could sue only as such executor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">Charles Hoyt exhibited his bill, stating that, in 1832, Ralph Smith died, intestate, seized of the lands described in the bill, leaving a 'widow, Susan P.

That it appears by the bill, that the shares of the proceeds of the sale of the land alleged to have been placed in the hands of the defendant by Adelia Smith and by the complainant, to secure to the widow a sum equal to the value of her dower, and which share of said Adelia was by her devised to the wife of the complainant, is to be considered as real estate, and as \u2022such descends to the heirs of the said wife of the complainant, and not to her husband as administrator of his wife 5 and that the agreement, in said bill stated, that 'the fund alleged to have been placed in the hands of the defendant was, on the death of Said widow, to be paid to Adelia Smith, Charles Hoyt, the complainant, and others, being an agreement in derogation of the C. L., and not in writing, is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">2d. That said bill joins distinct and separate matters together, in that the complainant claims the share of Adelia Smith, which cannot accrue to him in any other right than as the executor of her will, and in the same bill claims the share of his wife, which can accrue to him in no other right than as the administrator of his wife, or in some other right than as the executor of Adelia Smith; and in that the complainant, if he joined these two distinct matters because the fund out of which they are to be paid is the same, has omitted to make William B. Bradner and James Lewis, Jr., parties, though they appear by the bill to be equally interested in the said fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">3d. That the bill is filed in the individual right of the complainant, while it appears by the bill that he has in that right no interest in the said fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">4th. That the complainant appears by the said' bill to have had a full and complete remedy at law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>5th, Thai the bill shows no sufficient matter of equity, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-4\">\n<em>F.

By the sale, the lands were converted into money. The case stated in the bill is, that the husbands received the whole money for the share of their respective wives, and that the husbands deposited with the defendant such portions of the money as, with a like portion deposited with the defendant by Adelia Smith, an unmarried daughter of the intestate, made a sum the interest of which would bo equal to the yearly value of the dower of the widow of the intestate; which interest was to be paid by the defendant to the said widow; and on her death the sums so deposited with, the defendant were to be paid by him to the persons depositing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">By this statement the money deposited was the money of the husbands ; and the case is the same as if they had deposited money received by them from any other source.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">From this view it follows, that the complainant may sue in his individual right, to recover from the defendant, on the death of the widow, the money deposited by him with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">This disposes of tho third cause of demurrer also.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">1 am also of opinion that the case stated in the bill is a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for relief in this Court. This disposes of the 4th and 5th causes of demurrer assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The 2d cause of demurrer assigned is good.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Adelia Smith died before the widow, leaving a will, by which she gave to her sister Anna Maria Hoyt, the wife of the complainant, all her part, (being one-fourth) of the moneys so deposited with the defendant during the life of her mother, the said widow ,* and appointed Charles Hoyt, the complainant, executor of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">After the death of Adelia, and before the death of the widow, Anna Maria Hoyt, the wife of complainant died, intestate, and the complainant took letters of administration of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The bill is exhibited in the name of Charles Hoyt in his own right for the money in the defendant\u2019s hands given by the will of Adelia to his wife; of which will he is executor: he can sue only as executor. And a claim in his right as executor of Adelia\u2019s will, would be improperly joined in the same bill with a a claim in his own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">For this cause of demurrer assigned the demurrer is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Order accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
