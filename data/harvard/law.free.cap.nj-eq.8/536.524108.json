Mulford <em>v. </em>Thomas C. Williams and others.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b536-5\">Where a bill for foreclosure sets out incumbrances held by defendants with sufficient particularity and their1 order of priority, and a decree <em>pro. con. </em>is taken, and a reference to a Master, the Master cannot, by issuing a summons to a defendant incumbrancer to appear before him, put such a defendant in a position to lose his rights, admitted by the hill and established by the decree p. c., by failing to attend the Master.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">In March, 1849, Isaac S.

That there was due to Doughton, for interest on his mortgage, $18 ; that the principal sum secured by his mortgage is not yet due, &amp;c.; and that said Doughton\u2019s mortgage is second, in order and priority. That the judgment of Edwards had been fully paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">That it was satisfactorily proved before him, that the summons issued by him, directed to said Franklin, summoning him to appear before said Master on the date of the report, was duly served on said Franklin; but the said Franklin neglected to appear and prove his claim, if any he has against said mortgaged premises; and that, therefore, he, the Master, cannot report, what, or whether anything remains due to Franklin on his said judgment, or whether it has been entirely satisfied. He further reports that, under the circumstances of the case, the whole of the mortgaged premises should be sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\">On the 5th of July, 1849, the solicitor of the complainant took a final decree, confirming the report, and decreeing the sale of the mortgaged premises, to pay the moneys due and to become due to the complainant and Doughton, respectively; and that a <em>fi, fa. </em>issue &amp;c.; and that all the defendants stand debarred and foreclosed &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-8\">On the 2?th of December, 1849, Franklin presented his petition, stating the filing of the said bill, and the contents thereof; that his judgment is wholly unpaid, and is the next incumbrance to the complainant\u2019s; that he, before the mortgage to Doughton. was given, caused a <em>fi. fa. </em>against goods and lands to be issued on his judgment on the day of the entry of his judgment; and that the sheriff, the said Williams having no goods, levied his said execution on the mortgaged premises, whereby the petitio\u00bb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>er\u2019s judgment became and is a fixed incumbrance, prior to the mortgage of Dougbton. That neither the petitioner nor Dough-ton appeared, pleaded, answered or demurred to the said bill of complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">The petition then states the decree <em>pro confesso </em>and order of reference; and that the petitioner is advised, that so much of the said order of reference as directed the Master to ascertain the order and priority of the incumbrances was irregular; because their order and priority were expressly stated in the bill, and fixed by the decree <em>pro confesso </em>thereon; so that the Master could not rightfully change them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-6\">' That the petitioner, relying on the correctness of said bill of complaint as to the order and priority of his judgment, and the decree <em>pro confesso </em>thereon fixing the same, did not appear before the Master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">The petition then states the report of the Master and the subsequent-proceedings in the cause; and that the sheriff under the <em>fi. fa. </em>issued \"out of this Court has advertised the mortgaged premises to be sold on the 20th of January, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-8\">That the first knowledge or information the petitioner had of the said error or mistake in the said Master\u2019s report and decree and execution was some time after the issuing of said execution,, and since the last term of this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-9\">That the said mortgaged premises are all the property of the said Williams levied on by the sheriff under the petitioner\u2019s said judgment, except a lot of less than one-fourth of an acre, worth only about $40 or $50 ; and that the said mortgaged premises,, with said lot, will not, as the petitioner believes, produce sufficient to satisfy, all of the said three incumbrances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-10\">He prays, that the said report, decree and execution may be so amended or corrected that his judgment shall be directed to be paid next after the complainant\u2019s mortgage and costs; or,, that the sheriff may be directed, after paying the amount due the complainant and his costs, to apply the residue of the proceeds of sale of the mortgaged premises to the payment of the petitioner\u2019s judgment and his costs in this behalf; and for such further and other relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>On this petition, an application was made to the Court, on notice, for an order pursuant to the prayer of the petition.
