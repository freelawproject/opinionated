McIntosh, of the city of New York, as a partner, and in connection with him, under the firm of Wilson, Brown &amp; Co., continued to carry on the said works until on or about July 30, 1846, when the said firm of Wilson, Brown &amp; Co., having been unfortunate in business, became insolvent and stopped payment, and, as the complainant is informed and believes, assigned all their property to one Frederick Tracey, of the city of New York, for the benefit of their creditors, and have since that time hitherto carried on and are still carrying on the said works under and by the authority of the said Tracey as such assignee, the said Wm.

That similar works are carried on without interruption in this and foreign countries, sometimes in the midst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of populous cities, and sometimes in the country in the vicinity of farming lands; and that the machinery and apparatus used in said Passaic Chemical Works are calculated to retain all of said gases, and are capable of preventing their escape entirely 5 and that the said machinery and apparatus are much more perfect in their construction and operation than they were during the first year said works were established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-3\">They deny that said works are a nuisance in the neighborhood, or to the complainant\u2019s property; but say that the same are a general and useful improvement to that part of the said city where they are situated, and particularly to the complainant and his property ; that numerous dwelling houses have been erected in said vicinity since the establishment of said works and in consequence thereof ; and the value of property generally has been increased thereby in the neighborhood; and that the products of said works are useful articles of manufacture and commerce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">They deny that Wm.

It would seem that no very serious consequences to the complainant or his property are to be apprehended from the little further delay which will be caused by leaving him to tho ordinary proceedings at law in cases of alleged nuisances. And this course is the more proper in this case from the consideration that the neighborhood, the public, have so long permitted the works to be continued without complaint in the usual way.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Again, on a bill by an individual, complaining of injury to his property and the health of himself and family by such an alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>nuisance, an injunction should not he granted unless a clear case of nuisance and of irreparable injury he made out. The case, as it appears from the bill, answer and affidavits, fails, I think, in these respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Motion for injunction denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
