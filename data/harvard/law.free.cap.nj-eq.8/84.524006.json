But he has no recollection that he stated that he gave $100 for each lot, and therefore denies the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">He admits that said Falls Company declined to take said lots, or to pay him for them, either at $100 or at $50 per lot; but he denies that said Company ever tendered themselves ready or willing to pay him $50 per lot or any other sum ; and also denies that said Company ever informed him that $50 was the true amount paid by him for said lands, which they were ready and willing to pay, or that they considered him as holding said lands as the trustee of said Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\">He admits that said Company, for the purpose of constructing their main race-way, entered into the possession of a certain other small piece of land in Nottingham ; but he denies that the location of said race-way, as originally surveyed and located by the engineer of said Company, was over and across said lot; and he has no knowledge, information or belief that any survey or location of said race-way was ever made over and across the said land belonging to him. But says, that the location and survey of the route of the main raceway, as made and deposited in the Secretary\u2019s office, did not touch, take or run over any more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>two of the lots of this defendant, purchased by him of said Black; and that, after the said location thus made, and without any new route having been located or surveyed according to the provisions of the charter of said Falls Company., the said Company varied from the route of the main race-way ~ thus located and filed, and constructed their said main race-way on, over and across throe other of the said lots of land purchased by said defendant of said Black, and also on, over and acrosf. three other lots of this defendant which, he had purchased of-----Shoemaker ; and which three last mentioned lots lie on the west-side of a street called Asfcury street. And of the five lots purchased of Black, throe lie on the east side of said Ash ary street,- and the others lying still further east, and are divided from the last mentioned by an alley or street called George street, as by a map of said lots correctly made by an engineer of said Company, and now in the possession of this defendant, will appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">He admits that ho knew that the said Company entered upon and occupied the said lot; but denies that he ever gave said!

Company to convey to them the said lot or to allow them to enter upon and occupy it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">He denies that he ever permitted, authorized or directed tha Company to enter upon the said lands and to use and occupy the-same with the full understanding that he would convey the samato said Company when called upon to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">He admits that the Company have erected their raceway, &amp;e.\u201e at an expense of more than $200,000, and put the same in operation ; but he denies that it was done according to the purposes? and provisions of their charter. And admits that a very large-amount of capital has been invested in the erection of numerous mills and manufactories, &amp;c. But ho says that all the money-expended in erecting said race-way, branches and improvements-of said Company was expended in the erection of their race-way., branches and improvements above the lots of land of said defendant, except about $3,000 or $4,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">He admits the appointment by this Court of Receivers of said Falls Company; and that the Receivers were ordered to make-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>sale, See.; and that the complainants became the purchasers of the property of the Company and entered into possession thereof ; and that the complainants entered into possession of the lots of land of this defendant in the complainant\u2019s bill described. But he denies that the Receivers ever sold said lots of land to said complainant, or had any authority under said decree to sell said lots of land, or that the complainants ever purchased said lots or have any title whatever to the same; and insists that their entry and possession of them is wholly illegal and tortious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\">He admits he has brought ejectment. He denies that the complainants ever became the purchasers of the lots of land and premises belonging to him in the complainant\u2019s bill described, or were ever put in possession thereof under said sale, although he admits that they did become the purchasers of lands and premises to which the said Falls Company had a legal title at the time of said sale made by the Receivers, and that they entered into possession, under said sale, of such lands as said Falls Company had a legal title to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">He says that the bill mentioned in the bill of complaint as having leen filed to set aside the proceedings and decrees of this Court ia the case of Corrigan has been dismissed; and he therefore denies that there are any proceedings pending and undetermined in this Court in which the validity of the sale of the Receivers is questioned. But he insists that if the validity of the Recevers\u2019 sale to the complainants of the property of said Falls Company was questioned by any proceedings in this Court, it affords no legal or equitable ground to take from this defendant his property which was not included in said Receivers\u2019 sale; and which said Receivers, as the complainants well knew at the time of their purchase, had no right so to do. And he insists, that the complainants are entitled to no aid or protection from this Court under the pretext set forth in their bill, that, if they should be required to return the possession of said work to the custody of <em>the </em>Receivers, the complainants may be enabled to do so in the same condition as they were received from said Receiversj because the said Receivers never sold the said lots of land of the defendant in the complainants\u2019 bill described to the complainants, nor did the complainants receive possession of said lots from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the Receivers ; and that tho complainants have no legal or equitable right to the possession of tho said lots of land of tho defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-3\">He denies that, if ho is permitted to proceed in the ejectment and obtain possession of said lands of defendant, it will be in Ms power to destroy entirely tho value of tho raco-vray, works <em>sm\u00f1. </em>improvements of tho Company now completed, or to stop the mills and manufactories now in operation, or produce irremediable injury to the complainants ; though lie admits ho might stop three of the mills which have been erected below his said lots of land, and which are situated on tho property purchased by tho said Falls Company of J.

Dickerson, the President of the Trenton Bank, having been President of the Falls Company, And this defendant is tho more induced to believe that the complainants knew that the Falls Company had no title to tho lots of land of this defendant in their bill mentioned, from the fact that all the works and improvements of said Falls Company,, with their franchises, were sold free of all incumbrances, by the Receivers, of whom said Ph. Dickerson was one, for the small sum of $50,000; the lands and improvements of said Company, independent ox their corporate franchises, having cost, according to tho statement of the bill, more than $200,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">He says he has never received any compensation for his said lots of land from said Falls Company, and that said Company have, by a decree of this Court, been declared insolvent; and that it would be inequitable and unjust to turn him over to <em>au </em>insolvent corporation to seek payment for lands which the complainants are now enjoying, and which they never purchased and . for which they never paid anything.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">He says that the value of bis lands taken possession of by said Falls Company cannot now be ascertained and estimated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>mode and manner directed by their act of incorporation, because \u00bfhe provisions of said act were wholly violated and disregarded In relation to six of the lots of land of this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-3\">He further insists, that this Court has no power to take away 4he lands of this defendant and give them to a private corporation, nor to compel him to part with them against his consent, \u00a1nor determine or ascertain the sum for which he shall be compelled to sell them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\">He denies that the complainant ever applied to him previous to the commencement of said ejectment and requested him to \u00aborne to a fair and just settlement of the matters in controversy. \u00a1But he says that previous to the commencement of said ejectment ike repeatedly urged upon the Trenton Delaware Falls Company <em>\u00fao </em>come to a settlement with him, which they wholly neglected and omitted to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">\u2022'On this answer, a motion was made to dissolve the injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-6\"><em>W.

Tho route of the main raceway, as located, crossed certain lots belonging to Thomas Black. The Company appointed a committee to negotiate with the land owners, including Black, for tho purchase of the lands on and over which the raceway had been located. The defendant, who was then President, and one of the acting managers of the said Company, told the said committee that they need not communicate with Black; that he, the defendant, would attend to that arrangement on the part of said Company, and would take upon himself to effect an arrangement with Black, for the purchase and possession. of his said lots for the said Company ; and in pursuance of this offer, tho negotiation for the purchase of these lots was intrusted by the committee to the defendant. The defendant bought the lots of Black for $50 a lot, and took a deed for them in his own name, the deed stating the consideration to bo $100 a lot. The bill states, that the defendant subsequently offered to convey the lots to the Company on the payment to him of $100 a lot; but that the Company, having been previously informed that they were bought by the defendant for $50 a lot, declined to pay more, and informed tho defendant that they wore ready to pay him what he had paid or agreed to pay; and that the Company considered him as holding the lots as trustee for tho Company for their use. The answer to this statement of tho bill is so unsatisfactory that I must take the statement as a part of the case. The Company constructed their raceway over the said lots, and also over another small lot of land belonging to the defendant, with the knowledge of the defendant, and without any objection made by him, he still being the President and one of the acting managers of the Company; the Company, under these circumstances, not taking any of the measures proscribed by the charter to ascertain the value of these lots, and acquire tho legal title thereto, which the bill says they would have done if they had not been permitted, authorized and directed by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to enter upon, use and occupy the same with the full understanding that the defendant would convey the said lots to the Company-when called upon to do so. The answer admits that the Company took possession of and constructed their raceway on and over the said lots with his knowledge, but denies that he permitted, authorized or directed the Company to enter upon, use and occupy the said lots with the full understanding that he would convey the same to the Company when called upon to do so. This part of the answer also, is unsatisfactory. The defendant may use the words \u201cwith the full understanding\u201d in a different sense from that in which they are used in the bill. It is not a sufficient denial of the substance of the charge, Besides, he knew of the occupancy of the lots 'by the Company,' and of their making their raceway thereon, and not only made no objection thereto, but was President and one of the acting managers of the Company at the time, and he does not deny that, as such President and acting manager, he took part in directing the proceedings of the Company in making their raceway through the said lots ; which is one of the charges made in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The said Company went on and finished their raceway, branches and improvements, at an expense of more than $200,000, and put their works in operation; and many mills- and manufactories were erected along the route of the raceway, which are supplied with water therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In 1843, on a bill filed by creditors of the said Company, receivers were appointed; and, in February, 1844, the lands of the Company, including the raceway, were sold at public sale, and were bought by the Trenton Banking Company, the complainants in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In October, 1844, McKelway, the defenndant in this suit, commenced an action of ejectment against the said bank for the-said lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The complainants say, in the bill, that if it shall appear that McKelway has not received from the said \u201c The Trenton Delaware Falls Company\u201d a suitable compensation for the said lots so taken and occupied by them, although they insist that Mc-Kelway should seek his redress therefor from the said Trenton Delaware Falls Company, and not from these defendants, yet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>complainants are ready and willing that the value of the said lots should be ascertained in the mode directed by the act incorporating tho said Company, or in any other manner this Court may direct, and are ready and willing to pay tho amount, so to be ascertained, in the manner this Court shall direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">On tho case thus made by the bill and answer, I am of opinion that the defendant should not bo permitted to proceed in his action of ejectment to recover possession of such parts of the lands mentioned in the pleadings as are occupied by tho raceway.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As to the lots purchased of Black, ho assumed the agency to buy them for the Company, and bought them without giving any notice or intimation to the Company that he considered his agency for them at an end, and while the Company rightly supposed ho was acting for them in his negotiations with Black. He must therefore bo held to have acted for tho Company in the purchase; and, having taken tho deed in his own name, he must be considered as holding the title as trustee for the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As to the other lot, tho question involved is, whether the defendant, who was Presidont, and one of the acting managers of the Trenton Delaware Falls Company at the time the raceway was located and constructed on and over this lot, and who not only made no objection to such location and construction, but took part in the direction of the proceedings of the Company therein, shall he permitted, after the Company have incurred the expense of locating and constructing their raceway, to oust them by ejectment from their possession so acquired. I am of opinion that he should not, and that the injunction should be continued. As to the course to be adopted beyond this, I am willing to hear the suggestions of counsel. Perhaps the prayer for further relief, connected with the offer made in tho bill to pay the value of tho lots thus occupied by the works of the Company, to bo ascertained in such mode as the Court shall direct, may authorize the direction of an issue to ascertain such value.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The counsel consented that an issue should be directed, and it Was ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
