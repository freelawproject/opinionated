They deny the statement in the bill that the complainant permitted the said Anthony Woodward to remain there to be true; and, while they admit that said Anthony Woodward did a great deal towards the support and maintenance of the complainant, yet they deny that it was in any manner as a rent, compensation or ' consideration for the occupancy of said premises; and they deny that there ever was any tenancy existing between said Anthony Woodward as tenant and the complainant as landlord; and they deny that Anthony Woodward ever admitted any such tenancy to exist; but they aver that, during all said time, and up to his death, the said Anthony Woodward'held said premises adversely to the complainant.

Nevius and a Jury, the same was brought to trial and duly tried; and on said trial the said deed was produced in evidence on the part of the plaintiff; and the defendant in said suit, Caroline Woodward, resisted said deed as having never been 'delivered by said Anthony Woodward, and as having been fraudulently obtained by complainant, and the said defendant in that suit then** gave in evidence proof of the title of her said deceased husband, the marriage, his seizure and death, his possession during the marriage, and of the heirs-at-law of said deceased; and further insisted that, if it had been proved that said deed had been duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>and legally delivered at the time it bore date, and just on the eve of tho marriage of tho said Caroline, she being ignorant of it, it woulds till be a fraud and void as to ber, and she, as widow, by virtue of her right of dower, would be entitled to the possession of said, homestead farm and mansion house. And his Honor Judge Nevius charged that, although actual possession of a deed by the grantee named in it is presumptive evidence of delivery, yet, in tho case then on trial, it being proved that the deed was found in the desk of the grantor after his death, and that tho grantee had on his own more motion taken possession of it, it became necessary for the plaintiff to show that Anthony Woodward had delivered it in his lifetime; that when it was executed the plaintiff (complainant here) was not present, and that there was no delivery then, as the signing and sealing a deed written by the grantor and with the words, in the attestation, &lt;\u00a3 signed, sealed and delivered\u201d also written by tbe grantor, constitute no legal evidence of a delivery; that the showing or reading a deed, - even, by the grantor and retaining it in his hands was no delivery ; and that the declarations of the complainant made when the deed was found should be taken as evidence with great caution; yet, taking them as made, the intention or promise of the grandfather to give his grandson this farm would not amount to a gift j and that tho jury, in order to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s title, must find that there was such a delivery of said deed, before the defendant\u2019s marriage, as divested Anthony Woodward of all his legal right in the farm, and vested the legal title in the plaintiff, absolute and complete, before the marriage, so that the plaintiff could, by virtue of said deed, have ejected his grandfather from the farm; and that tho plaintiff\u2019s present (then) possession o\u00a3 the deed, explained as it had been, constituted no presumption of a delivery. And the jury in said action rendered a verdict against the plaintiff, and in favor of tho defendant, Caroline Woodward; it being, the bill says, against the validity of the said deed, and in favor of tho the title of the said widow and the heirs-at-law of said Anthony Woodward deceased; and final judgment was entered accordingly in said action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">The defendants deny that said Anthony Woodward, deceased, up to and within a few years of his death, acknowledged the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>istence and validity of said deed, or the existence of any settlement, but, on the contrary, charge that said Anthony Woodward, in his lifetime, would often and did often speak of the interest and right that these defendants, his children, would have to and in said farm when he should be done with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">These defendants have no knowledge of any branches of the family that knew of the existence of said deed, or of what Joseph and Lydia Bullock did as pretended in said bill, or of what representations were made to them, or of what they knew or pretended to know, or on what grounds they acted, or how they acted, touching the matters pretended in said bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">They deny that said Anthony Woodward expended large sums of money in the support and maintenance of the poor relatives of said Caroline Woodward, or on any of her relatives, or any money except so far as he supported the children, these defendants;
