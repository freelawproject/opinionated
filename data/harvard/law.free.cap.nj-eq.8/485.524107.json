Wildrick that he should give them a deed for the said lands, for the sum he owed them, upon the understanding that the said Isaac should have the right to pay the amount of the debt within a limited time, and that these defendants would execute a written agreement by which the right of redemption would be secured to the said Isaac.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">They say that the said Isaac proposed to these defendants to sell the lands to them, subject to the incumbrances then upon it, for $268, and that these defendants should take out of the purchase money the respective sums (before stated) which the said Isaac owed them, and that they should pay him the balance in cash, and that he, the said Isaac, would thereupon execute to these defendants a good and sufficient deed for the lands. That these defendants then agreed with the said Isaac for the absolute purchase of the said lands, for $268, to be paid to the said Isaac in cash, after deducting the. sums he owed these defendants, respectively, subject to the incumbrances then upon the lands. That, the said James, accordingly, drew the said deed from the said Isaac to these defendants for the consideration of $268.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">That these defendants, before the delivery of the said deed to them, delivered up to the said Isaac the notes they, respectively, held against him, amounting to $190, and paid to the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Isaac the balance, being $78, in cash. That the said Isaac took the said notes and cash, and delivered the said deed to these defendants, duly acknowledged; which deed was intended, and was so expressed by the said Isaac, to convey to these defendants an absolute estate in fee of all the right, title and interest of the said Isaac of in and to the said lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">They deny that said conveyance was ever intended as a mortgage ; but was perfectly understood between these defendants and the said Isaac to be an absolute conveyance, without any condition or defeazance connected therewith. They say, that the price they paid said Isaac for the said land was a full and fair price and valuable consideration for the same, together with the said incumbrances (they are before stated and admitted in the answer) then upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">They admit that, after the purchase of the said property had been completed, and after the said deed had been delivered by the said Isaac to these defendants, to wit, on the 1st of April, 1844, the said Isaac, as he was about to leave the store of the said James, remarked: Perhaps I may be able to buy back this land of you next spring, or I may perhaps be able to sell for a little more by that time, and probably you would be willing to \u2022sell the land to me at that time, if I can buy it back. That said James answered, that he would be entirely willing to sell the land to him again. And the said Isaac then proposed thaf he should give an agreement to that effect; which the said Charles opposed; but the said James said : Certainly, I am willing to sell you the land again, and will give you a certificate to that effect. That said James, accordingly, drew up a certificate to the effect set forth in the bill, and it was signed by these defendants; which certificate was only intended as an agreement for the re-purchase of the property by the said Isaac on the said 1st of April, 1845, and was so understood by the said Isaac.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">They further say, that the said Isaac on the said 1st of April, 1845, came to these defendants and informed them that he was not able to purchase the property of them again, as he thought he would be, and must therefore give them up possession of the premises; and that the said Isaac, accordingly, delivered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>these defendants peaceable possession of the said lands, on the-said 1st of April, 1845; and these defendants took peaceable possession of the same, and have so continued possessed of the same in their own right to this time. That the said Isaac, at the same time, was desirous to rent the property of these defendants ; and, as it was inconvenient for either of them to occupy said premises, they were willing to rent the same to the said Isaac. And, on the said 1st of April, 1845, the said Charles and the - said Isaac entered into an indenture of lease, in which the said Charles, on the part of these defendants, covenanted and agreed to rent the said lands to the said Isaac for one year from the said 1st of April, 1845; and the said Isaac covenanted and agreed, on his part, to pay therefor, on the 1st of April, 1846, the rent of $50; and did also agree,to farm said lands in a proper manner ; and to cut no green timber for his firewood; and that he would deliver up quiet and peaceable possession of said lands, at the expiration of the said year, to the said Charles. That, on the 23d of January, 1846, the said Isaac entered into a further \u25a0agreement with the said Charles for the rent of said lands from April 1,1846, to April 1,1847, the said Isaac covenanting, on his part, to pay therefor the rent of $70; that he would cut no green wood for firewood as long as there was dotted and old timber; that he would pay all the land taxes ; and that, at the expiration of the said term, he would deliver up peaceable possession of said lands to the said Charles. And that, by a like indenture, made between the said Isaac and the said Charles, on the 25th December, 1846, the said Charles leased the said lands to the said Isaac for another year, ending April 1,1848, the said Isaac covenanting to pay therefor the rent of $45, to cultivate said farm-in a proper manner, and to cut no green wood, (as before} and to deliver up peaceable possession of the farm on the said 1st day of April, 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">They say, that, from April 1, 1845, when they received pos. session of said lands from the said Isaac, to the present time, they have been in quiet and peaceable possession of the said lands; , and during all that time the said Isaac was, and still continues to be, the tenant of these defendants as aforesaid. That, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the said Isaac had given up the possession of the said lands to these defendants, they had a conversation with the said Isaac on the subject of the sale of said lands and the certificate. And that the said Charles asked the said Isaac whore the said certificate was ; and that said Isaac answered that he had mislaid it, as it was of no use to him he had taken no care of it; that he would give it up to the said Charles whenever he could find it, if he should be able to find it at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">That, in a further conversation with the said Isaac, the said Charles told him he understood that he, the said Isaae, had found fault with these defendants, and had said that they had shaved him in the purchase of said property, and had not paid him what they agreed, and that these defendants had told him it was a mortgage in place of a deed. And that the said Isaac denied that he had ever used such language or anything like it; and stated, that the agreement between him and these defendants was a fair one; that these defendants had paid him for the property all they had agreed to, and that they had paid him the full worth of the land, including the incumbrances, and that he, the said Isaac, at the time of the sale, considered that he made to these defendants a fair and <em>bona fide </em>deed for the said lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">They admit that the said Charles sued the said. Isaac, before a Justice of the Peace, upon the lease made between the said Isaac and the said Charles, for the rent of the premises, and obtained judgment for the amount of the rent specified in the said lease first made; and that, on an execution issued on that judgment, the personal property of the said Isaac was levied on to pay the rent due these defendants on the said lease. But they deny that they, or either of them, ever prosecuted and obtained a judgment against the said Isaac and levied on his personal property to pay the interest on the consideration money mentioned in said deed and the interest on the mortgage of the said George Wildrick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">They admit that the said Charles, on the 16th of April, 1845, took a note from said Isaac, at six months, for 887.36, and gave him the receipt mentioned in the bill. That, said Isaac having failed to repurchase the property on the 1st of April, 1845, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>having given up the possession of the premises to these defendants as before stated, the said Charles told the said Isaac that he ought to pay some rent for the year previous; that these defendants were liable to pay the interest on the George Wildrick mortgage, and that he had the use of the premises the year previous, and therefore should pay these defendants a reasonable rent for the same. And they say that the said Isaac agreed to pay a reasonable rent for the premises during the year 1844, which they fixed at said sum of $37.86, and for which sum the said Isaac made his note aforesaid to the said Charles. That, after said note was made, the said Isaac said it would suit him better if the said Charles would allow him to pay the interest on the George Wildrick mortgage to the said George himself; that he could get along much better with his uncle. The defendant Charles told said Isaac it was a matter of indifference to these defendants ; that they were bound to pay the George Wildrick mortgage; \u25a0 that it would suit them quite as well if the said Isaac paid that amount of interest on that mortgage as if he paid the money directly to these defendants. That said Charles, accordingly gave said Isaac the receipt mentioned in the bill. And they say, that the said Isaac never paid that amount of interest on George Wildrick\u2019s mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">They deny that they ever intended by the said arrangement to construe their deed into a mortgage; and deny that they rented the said property to the said Isaac for one year to pay the interest on the consideration money in the deed from the said Isaac to them and the interest money on the mortgage to the said George Wildrick, or that they rented the premises to the said Isaac in any other way than they have hereinbefore set forth, or that they ever claimed the consideration money in their deed, either principal or interest, from the said Isaac.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">Testimony was taken on both sides.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-7\">P. <em>B.

Wildrick and the defendants at the time when these writings were made and delivered, as evidenced by the writings and the facts in evidence. The complainant claims that it was a case of a deed, absolute on its force, and a defeazance, constituting the transaction a mortgage. The defendants contend, that it was an absolute sale by Isaac M. Wildrick and purchase by them; and that the certificate, as it is called, was merely an independent agreement by the defendants to sell the lands to the said Isaac on his paying to them, at the expiration of one year, the consideration money paid by them for the deed, with interest, and such other claims as they might then have against him. I think the writings constituted a mortgage at the time when they were made and delivered. And that such was the intention of the parties seems clear, from the inadequacy of the consideration, shown in evidence, and the fact that Wildrick remained in possession without any lease, or agreement for the payment of rent, until after the time for payment had expired, and from other facts in evidence. Such being the effect of the writings, and the intention of the parties at the time they were made, the nature of the transaction was not changed by the subsequent leases given by Wildrick. It may be that he, and perhaps the defendants also, supposed that when the time for payment expired the agreement of the defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>reconvey was no longer of any effect. He, and perhaps they, may not have understood, that writings of this nature, originally constituting a mortgage, remain a mortgage though default he made in payment at the time fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Decree for complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
