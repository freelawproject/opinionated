L. 75; Mellor v. Philadelphia, 160 Pa. 614; In re Melon Street, 182 Pa. 397; Butchers\u2019 Ice Co. v.

Wetherill et al., appellees.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADa\">It is clear that the title to lands fronting on navigable tide water rivers in Pennsylvania runs to low-water mark only, and that such rivers are public highways is also clear, but in Philadelphia riparian owners on the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers have a lawful right to build and maintain wharves, extending to the Port Wardens\u2019s line. As to the Schuylkill river, the Colonial Act of March 14, 1761, 1 Sm. L. 235, was passed to render that river navigable. The right of the city of Philadelphia to impair the navigability of the river by building bridges over it was adjudicated in the cases of the Port Wardens v. Phila., 42 Pa. 210, Flanagan v. Phila., 42 Pa. 219, and in Phila. v. Field, 58 Pa. 320. In the last case the legal history of the public ferries and bridges over the Schuylkill in the city of Philadelphia will be found in the opinion, per Read, J. In the case of Gilman v. City, 3 Wall. 713, the right of Philadelphia to build the Chestnut street bridge was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">The building of the bridge on Walnut street by the city was clearly an extension or \u201c enlargement \u201d of its highway, connecting portions of the street, formerly separated, into one continuous avenue. By reason of this general public improvement, a special injury, not general to all the lands fronting on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Schuylkill, but limited to the lands lying between Walnut street and the Chestnut street bridge, was directly caused, in the only way by which land can be injured, to wit: in the serious diminution of its market value. Thus the damage inflicted upon the appellees is not only within the spirit and meaning, but within the very language, of the'constitutional provision: Butchers\u2019 Ice &amp; Coal Co. v. Philadelphia, 156 Pa. 54; Good v. Allen, 175 Pa. 479.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-4\"><em>Francis L. </em>Wayland, assistant city solicitor, with him <em>John L.

Schuylkill Navigation Co., 14 S. &amp; R. 70; Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S. 273.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AIe\">April 24, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-5\">Peb Cubiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We are clearly of opinion that since the Acts of February 7, 1818, 7 Sm. L. 34, and April 9,1835, P. L. 127, which conferred upon private riparian owners the right to erect wharves and buildings on the banks of the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill within the city limits, a private right of property therein was conferred upon the owner which cannot be invaded by either the commonwealth or the city without compensation being made. The constitution of 1874, article 16, section 8, explicitly provides that \u201c municipal and other corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements.\u201d Since the adoption of the present constitution it cannot be doubted that mere injury to a private property or franchise entitles the owner to compensation, whether there be a taking or not. The distinctions upon this subject between taking and injury, which formerly prevailed, have been obliterated by the new constitution, and they no longer prevail. The fact of a substantial injury in the present case has been determined by the report of viewers, and is therefore not to be questioned. The value or amount of the injury has also been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>conclusively determined, and must now be considered as established.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">The order of the court below confirming the report of viewers is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
