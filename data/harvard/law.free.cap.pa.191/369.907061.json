(any usage or custom of trade or manufacture to the contrary notwithstanding) there be kept, used or allowed on the above described premises, benzine, benzole, dynamite, ether, fireworks, gasoline,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The plaintiff was a director of the defendant company. He offered in evidence the minutes of the company of October 31, 1896, as follows, to wit: \u201c Loss of John M. Hutton reported for one thousand dollars and laid aside for the present, it being reported that Mr. Hutton violated the rules of the company, having permitted a store in the building, and that not only coal oil was sold, but also gasoline.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s points and the answers thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">1. The court is respectfully requested to withdraw all the testimony tending to show that gasoline was kept on the premises insured, because the minutes of May 11, 1897, of the defendant company and affidavit of defense shows that the refusal to pay the loss was put solely upon the ground of a change of occupation, in that a store was opened and kept in the destroyed building, after knowledge that gasoline was kept there. After such waiver and the plaintiff having been put to the expense of suit, etc., it is too late to raise such reason on the trial. <em>Answer: </em>We do not think that the evidence in this case establishes a waiver by defendant of its right to set up in defense to the claim in suit that gasoline was kept upon the insured premises at and immediately prior to the time of their destruction by fire. The request is therefore refused. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">2. If the jury believe that the company defendant after knowledge that the tenant of plaintiff had kept gasoline in the building insured, assessed for losses upon said policy and the same was paid by the plaintiff, the verdict must be for the plaintiff. <em>Answer: </em>There is no evidence of an assessment such as is referred to in this point and therefore the matter involved in the point will not be submitted to the jury. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">Defendant\u2019s points and the answers thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">1. The evidence showing that the defendant company made no claim upon the plaintiff for an assessment under the policy in suit, and that after the defendant had rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the plaintiff voluntarily paid an amount that had not been assessed, and which was not an amount specified in the assessment made by the company, such payment is not evidence of a waiver of defendant\u2019s rights and does not estop the defendant from denying its liability under the policy. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-10\">2. Under the law and evidence in this case, the verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the jury must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed.

Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-4) above instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-6\"><em>J.

For reasons given by the learned trial judge, he was clearly right in refusing plaintiff\u2019s request, \u201cto withdraw all the testimony tending to show that gasoline was kept on the premises insured,\u201d etc., as recited in the first specification. He was also right in refusing plaintiff\u2019s point for charge recited in the second specification, for the reason that there was no evidence of an assessment such as is referred to in that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Both of defendant\u2019s points recited in the third and fourth specifications, respectively, were warranted by the evidence, and therefore rightly affirmed; and that left no question of fact for the consideration of the jury. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
