J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-10\">By ordinance of councils of the city of Philadelphia, approved September 27, 1897, it was ordained \u201cthat the debt of the said city should be increased in the sum of $12,200,000 for the following purposes,\u201d specifying eighteen purposes and the amounts needed for each, and \u201c that for the purpose of obtaining the assent of the electors to the increase of indebtedness .... an election shall be held in pursuance of the act of June 9, 1891, .... on the Tuesday next following the first Monday of November, 1897 ; that notice of said election shall be given by weekly advertisement in three newspapers of the said city at least thirty days prior to the general election, and said notice shall contain a statement of the last assessed valuation of the taxable property in the said city, amount of the existing debt, amount and percentage of the proposed increase, and the purposes for which the indebtedness is to be increased.\u201d On Novber 2,1897, the day of the general election, there were a majority of votes cast in favor of \u201c the general proposition to increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the indebtedness of the city in the sum of $12,200,000.\u201d On June 7, 1898, by ordinance then approved, councils directed \u201c that the mayor of the city of Philadelphia be and he is hereby authorized to borrow in such proportions as in his judgment the best interests of the city demand, from the highest bidder or bidders, at not less than par, on the faith and credit of the city of Philadelphia, a sum or sums which in the aggregate shall not exceed $11,200,000, for the following purposes,\u201d specifying the same purposes and amounts as those of the ordinance of September 27, 1897, except an omitted item of \u201c $1,000,000 for improvement to gas works.\u201d The ordinance further directed that \u201c interest on the said loan at a rate not exceeding 3J per centum per annum, shall be paid by the city of Philadelphia half yearly on the first day of the months of January and July, at the office of the fiscal agency of the city of Philadelphia.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0X\">The complainants are citizens and taxpayers. They aver in their bill that the mayor and city controller are about to borrow money on the faith and credit of the city, in reliance upon the authority of these ordinances, and ask for an injunction restraining the defendants from borrowing the said sum or any part thereof. Several grounds are alleged by them by reason of which they contend that the election and the ordinances are invalid. In the first place, they contend that \u201c the said election was not lawfully held, because there was no separate vote upon the several propositions for the increase of indebtedness of the city contained in said ordinance of September 27,1897, but the electors were compelled by the manner of holding the election either to vote in favor of the whole group of propositions submitted to the people by the said ordinance or to vote against all of said propositions.\u201d No ballots or ballot boxes were provided at the election to enable the voters to vote separately upon each item for which it was proposed to increase the debt, but the ballots were indorsed on the outside \u201c Increase the debt,\u201d and on the inside there were printed the words \u201cNo increase of debt \u201d and \u201c Debt may be increased,\u201d respectively, the entire amount of the increase, to wit: $12,200,000, and the purposes. The question then arises whether it is enough if the voters shall vote for the increase of the debt, knowing the objects to which the money is to be applied, or whether it is necessary that the voters shall vote for or against each and every one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the items set apart for the particular purposes sought to be accomplished and together making up the whole increase. Section 8 of article 9 of the constitution provides that the debt of a city shall not exceed seven per centum of the assessed value of the taxable property, and that no municipality shall \u201c incur any new debt or increase its indebtedness to an amount exceeding two per centum upon such assessed valuation of property without the assent of the electors thereof at a public election, in such manner as shall be provided by law.\u201d The Act of June 9, 1891, P. L. 252, sec. 3, provides that the indebtedness of a city may be increased to an amount exceeding two per centum and not exceeding seven per centum upon the last preceding assessed valuation of the taxable property, \u201c with the assent to the electors thereof duly obtained at a public election \u201d on a day fixed \u201c for the purpose of obtaining the assent of the electors thereof to such increase of indebtedness. Said notice (the notice prescribed by the act) shall contain a statement of the amount of the last assessed valuation, of the amount of the existing debt, of the amount and percentage of the proposed increase, and for the purposes for which the indebtedness is to be increased. Such election shall be held at the place, time and under the same regulations as provided by law for the holding of municipal elections, and it shall be the duty of the inspectors and judges of such elections to receive tickets, either written or printed, from electors .... labeled on the outside Increase the debt,\u2019 and containing on the inside the words \u2018 No increase of debt,\u2019 or \u2018 Debt may be increased,\u2019 also briefly the purpose and amount of increase, and to deposit said tickets in a box provided for that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">It is reasonably clear from the language, both of the constitution and of the act of 1891, that it was not the intention that the electors should determine the purposes to which the moneys are to be applied. The electors are to be given notice of the purposes to which the corporate authorities intend to apply them. If it were the intention of the legislature to have the electors determine the purpose, there would have been a direction not to describe it briefly in their ballots, but clearly, precisely and exactly. The assent of the electors is to be given to such increase of indebtedness,\u201d and nowhere is it indicated that they are to assent to or dissent from the purpose or pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>poses for which the moneys are to be utilized. The ballots are so worded that the electors vote for an increase or no increase of the debt, and the brief description of the purpose is intended for their information, so that they may vote upon this question intelligently. The purposes are nearly upon the same plane, with the amount of the last assessed valuation and the amount of the existing debt, of which the electors are to have notice because it is important information for them in determining whether or not it would be well to increase the debt. If the electors were called upon to decide upon the merits of the different objects for which the corporate authorities purposed to use the moneys, there would be room for the contention that \u201c several propositions \u201d were submitted at the same time, but there is only the one object presented to them, to wit: the increase of the debt. It has been held, where a municipality has legislative authority to aid railroads by a subscription to the stock, upon first securing the assent of the electors, that to submit the question of aiding two or more railroads at the same time would lead to log rolling and be invalid: McMillan v. Boyles, 3 Iowa, <em>320; </em>Supervisors v. Railroad Co., 21 Ill. 338; Williams v. People, 132 Ill. 574.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">These cases are decided upon the ground that the aiding of each railroad is a separate and distinct proposition. The same reasons were given in Gray v. Mount, 45 Iowa, 591, where the question submitted was the appropriation of moneys from the sale of swamp lands to the erection of a courthouse at Guthrie Center and a county high school in Panora, and the people voted not only for the appropriation, but for the objects, which the court held to be the \u201c essence of the proposition.\u201d In Mc-Bryde v. City of Montesano, 7 Wash. 69, \"the court held that the blending in one submission of a proposition to borrow money to fund old debts and another to borrow money for future indebtedness was illegal. But in that case, where the purposes of the future debt were to secure $1,500 for a fire apparatus and $3,500 for the erection of a city hall and jail, the court treated these two items as constituting but a single proposition. That case was followed in our own state in Bloomsburg Town Election, 4 Dist. Rep. 671, where it was held illegal to blend the submission of the question of increasing the debt under our statutes for the purpose of funding an old debt and the further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>purpose of creating a new one. The court was much influenced by the view it held that the funding of an old debt is not within the terms of the act of 1874 and of the act of 1891. In Millvale Borough, 162 Pa. 374, the question of increasing the borough indebtedness was submitted to the electors, and the purposes were stated to be the public improvement of the streets and the erection or purchase of waterworks and electric light plant. Here were two different objects to which the moneys were to be applied. The Supreme Court, in reviewing the case upon appeal, condemned certain conduct of the corporate authorities with respect to the loan, and expressed regret \u201c that we can discover no way of arresting such proceedings.\u201d We think, therefore, both upon principle and authority, that this contention of the complainants cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">The Act of June 9, 1891, P. L. 254, sec. 3, provides that \u201cwhenever the corporate authorities of any .... city . . . . by their ordinance or vote, shall have signified a desire to make such an increase of indebtedness, they shall give notice,\u201d etc. It is contended by the complainants that since the legislature has used a word, \u201c desire,\u201d which indicates a personal emotion, it was the intention that only those individuals who constituted the corporate authorities at the time the desire was signified should be permitted to make the increase in the debt. Such a construction would lead to insurmountable practical difficulties. The death of a single member of councils\u2014an event in so large a body always likely to occur\u2014would render the whole proceeding, with its attendant labor and expense, abortive. It is inconceivable that the legislature, if they had entertained such a purpose, would not have expressed it in unmistakable phraseology. If an unusual and unnecessary delay had intervened between the submission of the question to the electors and the proceeding to secure the loan, there might, perhaps, be ground for intervention. The Act of May 11,1897, P. L. 53, sec. 4, provides, \u201cWhenever, by the returns of such election, it shall appear that there is a majority voting for \u2018 No increase of debt,\u2019 such increase shall not be made, nor shall any other election on the same subject be held in that municipality for one year from the date of such preceding election.\u201d While this language provides only for elections, it indicates a thought in the legislative mind as to a period of time. The ordinance now under con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>sideration was passed within a year from the date of the election. We think that the corporate authorities named in the act of June 9, 1891, are those in whom, for the time being, the municipal authority is vested, having reference to their function and not to their personality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">It is further urged by the complainants that the ordinance of June 17, 1898, \u201c wrongfully attempts to empower the mayor of said city, in his discretion, to borrow at once the entire sum of $11,200,000, or any proportional part thereof, without reference to the needs of the city or to any action of councils calling for its use for any of the purposes designated in said ordinance and notice. The ground for this contention is that, before the money is raised and the debt is increased, there ought to be specific provision by ordinance for the expenditure of the moneys for the purposes designated in the submission. But every work, public or otherwise, must begin somewhere, either at one end or the other, or at some intermediate point. It might be argued with some appearance of propriety, that it would be idle to pass an ordinance for the purchase of a site for a library when the only means of raising money for the purpose is to borrow, and it is still uncertain whether any one is willing to lend. Both the ordinance of September 27, 1897, and the ordinance of June 17, 1898, express the purposes to which the moneys are to be applied after they have been secured. If the city should be fortunate enough to find persons willing to lend, and the moneys thereafter should not be applied to the designated purposes, the complainants could then come into court, setting forth the facts and present their complaint. Upon the facts now before us, each step seems to have been an advance toward the end originally intended and kept in view from the initial movement. In the Millvale Borough case, supra, this question was raised. The complainants there averred \u201c that no resolution or ordinance was ever passed authorizing the construction of said works,\u201d but the court refused to restrain the issue of the bonds for the loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">It is further urged for the complainants that the ordinance of June 17, 1898, \u201c unlawfully attempts to delegate to the mayor of said city the power of fixing the rate of interest to be paid upon the loan therein provided for, which power your orators aver to be a legislative power and not capable of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>delegated.\u201d This contention appears to be based upon an imperfect reading of the language of the ordinance. The ordinance provides: \u201cInterest on the said loan, at a rate not exceeding 3-i per centum per annum, shall be paid by the city,\u201d and that the mayor \u201cis hereby authorized to borrow in such proportions as in his judgment the best interests of the city demand from the highest bidder or bidders, at not less than par, .... a sum or sums which in the aggregate shall not exceed 111,200,000.\u201d If the ordinance is to be declared invalid because of improperly delegated power, it ought to be clearly shown that such power has been delegated. The ordinance, however, says nothing whatever about giving the mayor power to fix any rate of interest. He is to borrow the money upon certificates of loan, at the rate of interest determined upon, from the highest bidder or bidders. This scheme, which seems to be practically wise, saves to the city the benefit of the possible lower market rate of interest by requiring him to accept the highest bidder at the rate fixed. The ordinance ought to receive a reasonable interpretation. The evident meaning is that the rate of interest is fixed by the ordinance at three and one half per cent per annum, unless the proper corporate authorities should subsequently determine upon a less rate. The inference that the mayor is to so determine is a mere assumption without any support in the words used. We also think that since the ordinance has for its object only the securing of a loan, it is not invalid upon the ground that it contains more than one subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">The final objection is, that the ordinance and its amendment provide that \u201c the tax to be collected by virtue of its provisions shall be seven-tenths of a mill upon the dollar, whereas a tax at that rate will not comply with the requirements of law as to the amount necessary to be annually levied and collected.\u201d The Act of May 11, 1897, P. L. 53, sec. 4, provides that the corporate authorities \u201cshall before issuing any obligations therefor assess and levy an annual tax, the collection whereof shall commence the first year after the said increase, which tax shall be equal to, and sufficient for, and applied exclusively to the payment of the interest and principal of such debt within a period not exceeding thirty years from the date of such increase; and the moneys arising from such tax shall be applied at such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>periods as the municipality may stipulate in such obligations to the redemption at par of the said outstanding obligations according to their terms.\u201d It is perhaps enough to say, with respect to this contention that it is definitely averred in the answer \u201c that the tax levy of seven-tenths of a mill, as provided by the amendment of November 2,1898, will be fully sufficient to provide for the interest and principal of the said loan within thirty years, as required by law,\u201d and that under the rule in hearings upon bill and answer, as well as under the special agreement in this case, the averments of the answer must be taken as true. Calculations are excepted from the agreement, but this is not a mere matter of calculation. If we may go beyond this question of the state of the pleadings, we shall be required to ascertain what was intended by the use in the act of the words \u201c which tax shall be equal to, sufficient for, and applied exclusively to the payment of the interest and principal.\u201d If construed strictly, the effect of the word \u201c equal \u201d would be that the amount to be raised by the tax should be exactly the same as, and no more and no less than the amount of the principal and interest of the debt, and if the moneys so raised are to be applied exclusively to such payment, then any possible surplus could be used for no other purpose. The difficulty of working out so exact a problem relating to the complicated affairs of a vast municipality, and extending over a period of thirty years, is tremendous. An increase in values of property may make the sum too much, a depression may make it too little. An impecunious taxpayer who fails to make returns, or a defaulting tax collector, upsets it entirely. The use of the words \u201c sufficient for\u201d suggests a different thought, implies that a discretion is to be exercised to determine what will be sufficient, and gives the clue with which to reach the real meaning. The corporate authorities having before them the assessed values of properties within the municipality, and with a knowledge of what sum will be needed within thirty years to meet the interest and principal of the proposed increase of debt, are reasonably and fairly to determine what tax rate will be sufficient to meet the demands. Any failure to exercise such discretion or any abuse of it would no doubt call for the interference of the courts, but so long as no such neglect or wrong is alleged, it is a matter for the municipal authorities to deal with alone. There is no al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>legation in this bill that those charged with the duty have not in good faith endeavored to reach a correct solution of the problem, or even that the tax rate fixed may not be reasonably expected to produce sufficient funds with which to meet the principal and interest of the debt as required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">The able argument of counsel and the full presentation of authorities have been of great assistance to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">The bill is dismissed at the cost of complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-8\"><em>Alex.

But when it refers to the voting itself, the individual ballot to be cast shall state \u201c briefly the purpose and amount of increase \u201d for which the elector votes. A fair inference from this is that the elector is to vote separately upon each purpose of increase, so that there may be a fair test of the voter\u2019s willingness to make such increase upon its merits: Bloomsburg Town Election, <em>4 </em>Dist. Rep. 671; McMillan v. Boyles, 3 Iowa, 320; Gray v. Mount, 45 Iowa, 591; Supervisors v. R. R. Co., 21 Ill. 338; Williams v. People, 132 Ill. 574; McBryde v. City of Montesano, 7 Wash. 69; Truelsen v. Duluth, 63 N. W. Rep. 714.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-9\">The view here expressed is borne out by another consideration. By section 3 of the Act of May 23,1874, P. L. 230, Pepper &amp; Lewis\u2019s Digest, 558, pl. 4, in prescribing the requirements for the passage of ordinances, it is said that no bill shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title. The constitutional requirement as to acts of assembly is extended to ordinances of councils, and it may well be supposed that the act of April 20, 1874, relating to increase of debt, if it can be held to allow dissimilar subjects to be embodied in one submission, is modified by the clause of the later act above set forth: White v. City of Meadville, 177 Pa. 643; McMillan v. Boyles, 3 Iowa, 320.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-10\">The corporate authorities to whose desire to increase the debt the people favorably responded, having determined not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>increase it, later corporate authorities cannot be allowed to make the increase: White v.
