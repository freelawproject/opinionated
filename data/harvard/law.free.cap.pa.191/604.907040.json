Incline Plane Co., 166 Pa. 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-23\">A property owner must subordinate his rights in a natural watercourse to the ordinary modification of ground surface oc-\u2019curring within the territorial limits of a municipality: Bentz v. Armstrong, 8 Watts &amp; Serg. 40; Leedom v. Young, 67 Pa. 351; Davidson v. Sanders, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 432.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-24\">When a lot owner elects to improve by the construction of a building, he must inquire for the height and grade confirmed by the public authority for- the street upon which his property abuts, and build in conformity thereto. If he ignores these plans and, as a consequence, incurs loss subsequently when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>street is open or graded, he cannot recover such portion of his loss as may be due to his disregard of the street level: Groff v. Phila., 150 Pa. 594; In re Forbes Street, 70 Pa. 125; Axford v. City, 46 Leg.

C. 185; Melon Street, 182 Pa. 397.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-4\">Property is \u201c injured \u201d when drainage is affected: Pa. S. V. R. R. Co. v.

The elevation of the grade on Chatham street rendered drainage into it impossible, and petitioner was thus compelled to provide other means of drainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">There cannot be any question as to his legal right to compensation ; and we cannot say that the amount awarded him is excessive.

Neither of them is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The decree of the court below, dismissing exceptions to the report of the viewers, and confirming said report, is affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs, and its appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
