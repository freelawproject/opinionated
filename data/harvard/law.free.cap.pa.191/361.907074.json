It says that it entered into a contract with Cyrus N. Stark to grade and surface the road and lay the tracks upon it at a certain price per lineal foot for the different kinds of work; that it had no control whatever over the mode by which he performed the work; that it had no control or supervision over the work as it progressed; that Stark was only accountable to the company that the work went on and that he fulfilled the specifications mentioned in the contract; that Stark employed all the men, and the company had no control over them and no right to interfere with the manner in which Stark chose to perform his covenant under this agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">The evidence shows a diligent search and inquiry for the contract, but it cannot be found and is not produced on this trial. Secondary evidence, therefore, on both sides was admitted to prove its contents. The plaintiffs have offered the deposition of C. N. Stark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\">[In the re-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel this question was put to the witness: \u201cQ. Did this engineer, King, have anything to do with directing the manner of doing the work ? A. No, sir; all the authority he had was to put those grade stakes in and say to me, \u2018 There are your grade stakes.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-10\">The reply of Mr. Stark to the question put to him by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel must be considered with his whole testimony; and from it all, we are convinced, that the witness meant by this answer that the work to be supervised by the engineer was the manner of its completion and not the manner of its performance ; that is, the engineers were to supervise the work only so far as to the track and grades to be observed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-11\">The plaintiffs having offered this deposition as part of their testimony in chief, admit the truthfulness of the statement of the witness. On the same point, that is, as to the contents of the lost written contract, the defendant has called A. C. Shand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>chief engineer of the company, who testifies that he drew the contract; and he corroborates the testimony of Stark in every material point, and states further that the company did not reserve any right or power to control the performance, only that Stark was to grade the track and lay the rails at Hollidaysburg, subject to his approval in every respect, and that the work was to be done in a workmanlike manner. The evidence of these two witnesses is the only evidence on this point that there is in the <em>case; </em>and under it I am of the opinion that Stark was what is known in law as an independent contractor; that is, that he had a right to perform the work, to conduct the performance of it in such manner as he chose, independent of the right of the company to interfere with the means which he employed or with his manner of conducting it, the company having no other jurisdiction over it except to approve or disapprove of it when completed under the contract; and that the defendant company was not liable for his negligence. I am, therefore, obliged to say to you, as a question of law, that inasmuch as the defendant had no right to interfere with Stark or his employees in the means which he chose to employ on his part, their negligence could not and should not be imputed to the defendant company so as to hold it liable in damages for the injury that Mrs. Thomas sustained.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second point and the answer thereto were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">If the jury believe that the contract between the defendant and Cyrus N. Stark, for grading the track and laying the rails of the defendant company, reserved to the defendant company control of the manner or means of the performance of the work, then the contractor, Cyrus N. Stark, and his employees or servants were the employees or servants of the defendant company, and the defendant would be liable as the master or employer for their negligent acts, whether there was this reservation of control over the manner or means of performing the work, is a question of fact for the jury; and in determining it, the jury is to consider and weigh all the evidence in the case bearing upon the subject. <em>Answer: </em>This point is declined. I have held in my general charge that there is no evidence in the case of the facts upon which the point is predicated to be submitted to the jury.

[3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">Opinion of Bailey, P. J., of the 20th judicial district, specially presiding, on the motion for a new trial:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">The proximate cause of Mrs. Thomas\u2019s injury was the upsetting of a plank upon which she stepped while crossing Allegheny street, in the borough of Hollidaysburg. This and other planks placed by its side formed a temporary crossing over the rails. It was uptilted by a loaded cart striking the end of it. The cart was under the control of the employees of C. N. Stark, who had contracted to construct the defendant\u2019s road in Hollidaysburg. It is not alleged that the crossing itself was not reasonably safe for the purpose for which it was made, or that Mrs. Thomas would not have passed over it in safety if the cart wheel had not struck the plank. There was ample space between the end of the plank crossing and the pavement to allow the passage of the cart. Permitting it to get on the plank was the negligence of the person or persons in charge of it, for which the contractor might be liable. The defendant was not their employer. They were servants of the contractor. The relation of master and servant existed between them, and the contractor would be liable for negligence on their part while in his employ. To him only the rule of respondeat superior applies. There cannot be two superiors severally responsible for the same wrongful act: Wray v. Evans, 80 Pa. 102.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">Notwithstanding the able argument of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs on the motion for a new trial, I continue of the same opinion I entertained at the trial; that Stark was an independent contractor and the defendant was not answerable to the plaintiffs for the negligence of his employees in permitting the cart to be run upon the plank crossing, if there was negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">The defendant did not reserve in its contract with Stark any control over his employees or the means to be employed by him to do the work he contracted for. It had no control or supervision of the work, except to see that it was completed according to the specifications. \u2022 With the men or means employed by Stark to accomplish it, it had nothing to do, except in the event of Stark\u2019s neglect or refusal to prosecute the work with a force sufficient for its completion within the time specified in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>agreement, which contingency did not happen. The agreement provided that the engineer of the defendant company might declare it forfeited (among other causes) \u201c for noncompliance with his directions in regard to the manner of constructing it.\u201d The agreement was not rescinded, and Stark completed the work. It is earnestly contended that by these stipulations the defendant reserved control of the work, and was, therefore; liable for the negligence of the contractor\u2019s employees during its progress. \u201c Noncompliance with the directions of the engineer \u201d must be construed in connection with other parts of the contract. It evidently means noncompliance with his directions in such matters as under the agreement he had the right to direct. It does not, either expressly or by inference, give him the right to interfere with the means Stark chose to use to accomplish the work. Such right is not reserved in the agreement, and it was not within the contemplation of the parties that the engineer could compel a forfeiture of the agreement by assuming at his will to give directions in matters over which the agreement did not give him jurisdiction. The right of the engineer was to fix the grades and alignment of the road, to establish the amount of work done each month, to approve the work when completed and to employ workmen in case Stark failed to provide sufficient force to accomplish the work within the specified time. There is nothing in the agreement which even hints at the light of the engineer to control or in any way interfere with the means which Stark might choose to employ in the work. Stark testified that the work was exclusively in his control and that the engineer did not interfere with the means he chose to accomplish it. Stark had the right to and did use whatever means he chose to make the excavations. The defendant or its engineer had no right to direct that they should be made by picks or dynamite. He also had the right to remove the excavated dirt by such means as he saw fit, whether by wheelbarrows, carts or cars or by any other sort of conveyance he chose. The defendant had no concern in such matters, and did not exercise any control over them. We are clearly of opinion that this case comes within the rule laid down in City of Erie v. Caulking, 85 Pa. 247, Reed v. Allegheny City, 79 Pa. BOO, School District v. Fuess, 98 Pa. 600, Painter v. Pitts-burg, 46 Pa. 213, Edmundson v. R. R. Co., Ill Pa. 316, Harrison v. Collins, 86 Pa. 153, and other cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The provision in the agreement that the contractor shall \u201c indemnify and save harmless the defendant from payment of all sums of money by reason of all or any such accidents, injuries, damages or hurt that may happen or occur upon or about said \u25a0works,\u201d does not impose any additional liability upon the defendant : City of Erie v. Caulkins, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">All of the eases cited by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel are clearly distinguishable from this one. It is necessary to refer to only a few of them. In Reynolds v. Braithwaite, 131 Pa. 416, Braithwaite was held responsible for the cutting of Reynolds\u2019s water pipe by a contractor, because \u201c he was present when it was done and promptly adopted the act as his own.\u201d In the case of Congregation v. Smith, 163 Pa. 561, the injury complained of was the caving in of a sewer which had been constructed by the defendant under a contract with the city of Easton. It appeared from the evidence and it was found by the jury that th\u00e9 negligence in constructing the sewer was the fault of the direction of the engineer of the ciiy, who directed the manner of its construction and filling up the excavation. It was held that if the contractors followed the directions of the engineer, but in carrying out his directions they negligently did the work, and the injury complained of resulted from such negligence, the contractors would have been responsible. In his opinion Mr. Justice Dean says: \u201c The plaintiff alleged it was negligence to leave the sheeting and to puddle the filling of the trench; the defendants replied that this was not negligence, but even if it were the city did it, not we. . . . True, if the puddling was negligently done after the engineer directed the contractors to follow that method, and such negligence occasioned the injury, the contractor could not have escaped liability because the city had changed the method.\u201d That case emphasizes the rule that \u201c when a person contracts with another to do a work for him according to the contractor\u2019s own methods, and not subject to his control or orders, except as to the results to be obtained, the former is not liable for the wrongful acts of such contractor or his servants.\u201d In the case of Homan v. Stanley, 66 Pa. 464, an owner contracted with one person to dig the cellar; with another to do masonry, and the third to put up the structure. Having split up the work, and having made no provision for the supervision or the erection of barriers by either contractor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>it was held the owner was personally liable to one who fell in an excavation and was injured. In Improvement Co. v. Rhoads, 116 Pa. 377, the turnpike company continued to take tolls on its road while repairs upon it were in progress, and was, therefore, responsible to the traveler to furnish him a safe road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">This motion must, therefore, be denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">Now, December 31, 1898, the motion for a new trial is overruled and judgment directed to be entered on the verdict upon payment of jury fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">Judgment for defendant.

Braithwaite, 131 Pa. 416; Campbell v. Lunsford, 3 So. Rep. 522; Schwartz v. Gilmore, 45 Ill. 455; R. R. Co. v. Hanning, 15 Wall. 649; Speed v. Atlantic &amp; Pacific R. R.

Rollins, 137 Mass. 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-10\">Even if there had been no reservation of control in the contract the defendant is still liable, because, through its agents, it exercised actual control over the execution of the work: Hart v.

R. 641.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-11\">Even if the contractor in the case at bar had been exercising an independent employment, the defendant could not claim exoneration from liability on that ground, because the injury resulted from the very acts which it employed the contractor to do: Ellis v.

In his opinion denying the motion for a new trial the salient facts of the case, together with the principles involved, etc., are so fully set forth that little, if anything, can be profitably added in vindication of his rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 request for instructions, recited in the first specification, was rightly refused, because there was no sufficient evidence of the facts of which it is predicated to justify submission of the questions involved to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The undisputed evidence was that, under his contract with the defendant company for grading the track and laying the rails, Cyrus N. Stark was an independent contractor and, as such, had a right to do the work and direct its performance in such manner as he chose, independently of any right of the defendant railway company. The latter had no other control over the work than to approve or disapprove of it when completed by Stark; and, inasmuch as the defendant company had no right to interfere with him or his employees, the negligence of the latter could not be imputed to it. It therefore follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that there was no error in the instructions recited in the second specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">For same reasons, there was no error in directing the jury to find for defendant, as complained of in the third and last specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Without further comment, the judgment is affirmed on the opinion of the learned judge who specially presided at the trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
