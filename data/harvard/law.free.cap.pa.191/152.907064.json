Plaintiff testified that on March 30, 1897, about twelve days before the note became due, the defendant called upon him at his place of business \u201c and told me that he could not pay that note when it became due. He said that he had met with unfortunate business affairs, and it would be absolutely impossible for him to pay the note or raise the money to pay it in any way. He told me that it would be useless for me to put the note in bank, to have- it protested, as it would be absolutely impossible for him to pay it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\">The court submitted the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-11\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,096.33.

The court correctly left this question to the jury and they found in favor of the plaintiff. We do not see how they could have found otherwise. The case of Reiff v. McMiller, 45 Legal Int. 26, cited by appellant, has no application. It does not raise the question at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
