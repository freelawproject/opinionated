He claims that the trial court (1) violated his right to be tried before an impartial jury by failing to require the state to rebut the defendant\u2019s prima facie case of prosecutorial misuse of peremptory challenges, (2) violated his constitutional right to a fair trial by prejudicially interfering with the presentation of his defense, and (3) erred in its instructions to the jury on the element of intent requisite for a conviction of burglary in the second degree, thereby impermissibly shifting the burden of proof to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The following facts relevant to the defendant\u2019s first claim are not disputed. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges alleged in a substitute information and elected to be tried by a jury. During the voir dire of the veniremen, the defendant\u2019s counsel expressed his concern that the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>lenges was motivated by racial bias, thereby infringing upon the defendant\u2019s right to be tried before an impartial jury. The defendant\u2019s counsel did not request a hearing on the issue or otherwise ask the court to take any particular action relative to this concern.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor \u201cstrenuously object[ed] for the record.\u201d The voir dire then continued and a jury of six persons was selected. While the record does not indicate the racial composition of the jury, the state in its brief claims that \u201cprior to the use of any peremptory challenges and prior to any comments by defense counsel, a black venireperson was selected to sit on the jury.\u201d This is confirmed by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred by failing to require the state to rebut the defendant\u2019s \u201cprima facie case of prosecutorial misuse of peremptory challenges.\u201d The defendant seeks review of this claim under the exceptional circumstances of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>edging that this claim was \u201c \u2018neither pressed nor passed upon by the court [below] . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 69. While the defendant\u2019s claim implicates a fundamental constitutional right, there is nothing in the record which indicates the complete racial makeup of the jury. The defendant\u2019s failure to request a hearing on the issue of alleged prosecutorial misuse of peremptory challenges, or otherwise to press this claim before or upon the completion of the process of jury selection, has rendered this court unable to review his claim. There is no record establishing the claimed prima facie case of prosecutorial misuse of peremptory challenges to support our review of that claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Upshaw, </em>7 Conn. App. 257, 264-65, 508 A.2d 791 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 294-95, 370 A.2d 928 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>8 Conn. App. 158, 160-61, 511 A.2d 369 (1986). We, therefore, decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim alleges that the trial court violated his constitutional right to a fair trial by prejudicially interfering with the presentation of his defense. The facts relevant to this claim are as follows: During the presentation of the state\u2019s case, Detective Kenneth Zercie, a member of the New Haven police department, was qualified as a fingerprint expert. After testifying to the standards used by the New Haven police department for identification by fingerprints, the prosecutor asked Zercie to testify about the standards utilized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The defendant objected on the ground that the witness was not competent to testify to the FBI standards without collaboration. Before overruling this objection, the court remarked as follows: \u201cI am sure he has talked to people. On that basis, and I am not sure he is acquainted with it, but New Haven is supposed to be the premier exponent of fingerprints. You will concede <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that?\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cI will concede that point, but I still don\u2019t think he can answer the question as to what the FBI or other areas use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The defendant claims before us that the court\u2019s \u201c \u2018high-lighted statements\u2019 exceptionalizing [sic] the \u2018New Haven Police Department\u2019s Identification Unit\u2019 [as the] \u2018premier exponent of fingerprints,\u2019 \u201d unfairly-prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case. He again asks that we review this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, alleging that the trial court\u2019s statements interfered with his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In order to establish the right to re-view under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, a party must not only allege that he was deprived of a fundamental constitutional right, but he must also provide this court with a record which demonstrates support for his claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>201 Conn. 289, 301 n.9, 513 A.2d 1226 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>190 Conn. 639, 655, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>8 Conn. App. 399, 406, 513 A.2d 176 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosby, </em>6 Conn. App. 164, 172, 504 A.2d 1071 (1986). Whether a record will be deemed supportive of a claim for an <em>Evans </em>review requires the exercise of principled appellate discretion. Such discretion must necessarily be exercised on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In the present case, the record falls far short of demonstrating support for the defendant\u2019s claim of a -violation of his constitutional right to a fair trial. On its surface, the allegedly improper statement could not rise to the level of a deprivation of his right to a fair trial. The defendant\u2019s counsel conceded on the record that the court\u2019s statement in issue was accurate. The defendant, however, did not utilize the opportunity to cross-examine the expert witness and thereby erase any alleged prejudice of which he now complains. Since the record does not demonstrate support for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ant\u2019s claim of a deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right, we decline to afford him an <em>Evans </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the element of intent necessary to prove burglary in the second degree impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by its \u201cfailure to instruct the jury that \u2018inferred facts\u2019 as well as \u2018basic facts\u2019 must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The trial court\u2019s charge on the element of intent as related to the second count alleging burglary in the second degree was as follows: \u201cBurglary in any degree is an intent crime. In other words, it must be proved by the state that the defendant entered or remained within a building with intent to commit a crime therein. Intent is a mental state with a resolve or determination that the doing of an act shall be with a certain purpose. Intent is seldom, if ever, capable of direct or positive proof. Rather, the intent, if any, maybe arrived at by such reasonable inferences and deductions as may be drawn from the facts proved by the evidence in accordance with common experience and observation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u201cThe best way to prove that entry or remaining in a building was with intent to commit a crime was to prove that the person actually did commit the intended crime therein. If, however, the defendant never actually committed some crime on the premises or was apprehended before he had the time to commit one, his unlawful entry or remaining may still be found to be burglary if the evidence establishes to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was there with such intention. Whether the criminal intent existed at the time of the commission of the alleged criminal act must, of necessity, be inferred and found from other facts which in their nature are the subject of specific proof and for this reason other constituents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>of the crime being proved, it will be left to you to determine from all of the circumstances whether this criminal intent existed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u201cThe state here contends that the defendant was unlawfully in a building intending to commit the crime of robbery. Whether or not the state has proved such intention is one of the matters you must decide, but even if you find that the intention to commit such specific crime was not proved, you may still convict [the defendant] of burglary if you are convinced that he intended to commit some crime and was in the building for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cThe state is not required to prove specifically what crime was intended by the defendant or that he actually committed any crime whatever in the premises. The required intention must be spelled out, if at all, from the evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct and other facts and circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cIf you find that the proof presented is sufficient for you to infer that the defendant intended to commit a crime within the building, you may find him guilty of burglary. If you find it is not so, you must find him not guilty of burglary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The defendant\u2019s exception to these instructions was imprecise. It did, however, sufficiently apprise the court of its basic legal nature. The exception was extended over several responses to the court\u2019s inquiries as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Lewis, do you have an exception?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">\u201cMr. Lewis: Yes, your Honor, to the charge on the intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cMr. Lewis: I believe the way it was phrased your Honor placed the burden on the defendant to prove the intent \u2014 the defendant to prove he had no intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cThe Court: Which charge were you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201cMr. Lewis: Both the robbery and the burglary charge, your Honor. I believe, based on the instruction your Honor gave, that they would consider that the burden is on the defendant to prove intent, lack thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t believe I said that, Mr. Lewis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\u201cMr. Lewis: No, I just say the way it was phrased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\u201cThe Court: Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\u201cMr. Lewis: You did not say it that way, but I believe the way it was phrased in coming out your Honor placed the burden on the defendant, not on the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if you would like for me to charge the jury that the burden of intent remains on the state, I would be happy to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I think that would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have any problem with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">\u201cMr. Lyons: Well, the only problem is the vague objection. What\u2019s he referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-15\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I don\u2019t know either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-16\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I am basing it on <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-17\">\u201cThe Court: What language did I use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-18\">\u201cMr. Lewis: The language, as I recall it, was that at the time the intent can be proven by the circumstances under which the offense took place. Not that the state has the burden of proving that the intent was there at the time it took place. It\u2019s a matter of semantics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-19\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if that\u2019s your reason, I will deny your request. You can take an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cMr. Lewis: Exception, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim of error, like his exception to the charge, is inartfully stated. The gravamen of his claim is that the court\u2019s charge on intent, taken in conjunction with its earlier instructions on circumstantial evidence and inferences, \u201cimpermissibly shifted the state\u2019s burden of proof\u201d because \u201cthe jurors were obligated to draw their factual conclusions as to intent in the burglary charge based on the erroneous circumstantial evidence/inference instructions.\u201d This shift of burden, he claims, was in violation of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979), because of \u201cthe court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that \u2018inferred facts\u2019 as well as \u2018basic facts\u2019 must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to establish every element of the crime. It is clear, however, that the court\u2019s charge was totally free of the language of presumed intent which was found to be erroneous in <em>Sandstrom. </em>In support of this argument, the defendant also cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 59, 502 A.2d 360 (1985). Although the defendant did not preserve this claim of error at trial, it is reviewable on appeal pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>9 Conn. App. 147, 157-58, 517 A.2d 632 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The court\u2019s charge on circumstantial evidence and inference challenged by this claim was as follows: \u201cThis case is one that is based upon circumstantial evidence, that is the fingerprints. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that you must have direct evidence supporting the fact. You may apply the rule of circumstantial evidence. This rule involves the offering of evidence, offer of facts [from] which you are asked to infer the existence of another fact or set of facts. Such an inference may be [made] provided two elements [in] the application of this rule [are] satisfied when: One, that the fact from which you are asked to draw the infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ence has itself been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and two, that the inference asked to be drawn is not only logical and reasonable, but is strong enough so that you can find that <em>it is more probable than not that the fact to be inferred is true. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">This instruction on circumstantial evidence and inferences drawn therefrom is identical to that found erroneous in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra. In <em>Rodgers, </em>the court found error in the instruction \u201cthat an inference may be drawn if \u2018it is more probable that the fact to be inferred is true\u2019 [because] [t]he facts essential to an element of the crime . . . whether basic or inferred, must be found proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Although this singular part of the charge was erroneous per se, we do not view portions of the jury instructions in a vacuum. We review the entire charge as a whole to determine whether it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 756, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 1598 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 132, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986). In order to make this determination, we need to give a further account of the evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The defendant steadfastly denied having been in the victim\u2019s apartment. There was no eyewitness identification of the defendant. The only direct evidence linking the defendant with the crime were his four fingerprint impressions lifted from two empty silverware storage chests in the victim\u2019s apartment. The element of intent was never placed in issue by the defendant at trial until he excepted to the court\u2019s charge on intent. Only then did the defendant dispute intent. This objection, of course, was made after the close of all evidence per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>taming to the issues raised before the jury, including the question of identification, which it had to resolve factually based upon the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">We find that the principal issue before the jury in this case was the identity of the defendant as one of the perpetrators, which the state claimed it established through the four fingerprints identified in evidence as his. Reading the trial court\u2019s instructions as a whole, we conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s charge with respect to the state\u2019s burden of proving intent beyond a reasonable doubt. In both its general instructions and its specific instructions on intent, the court instructed the jury several times that the state carried the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court gave the erroneous instruction on inferences but once, and did not repeat it when defining the essential elements of the burglary and other charges. The error, therefore, does not require a reversal of the conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 132; <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>9 Conn. App. 373, 519 A.2d 83 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>supra, 160-61; <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>7 Conn. App. 149, 156, 508 A.2d 49, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 512 A.2d 229 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> During voir dire, the following colloquy took place: \u201cMr. Lewis [Defense counsel]: I feel, based on the excuses of the last two people, there seems to be a racial bias entering into the selection of witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201cThe Court: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\u201cMr. Lewis: I feel, based on the excusal of the last two witnesses, and I understand that\u2019s Mr. Lyons [the assistant state\u2019s attorney] prerogative, I understand that, your Honor, but I feel there is beginning to show a definite racial prejudice, bias.

The court\u2019s failure to give the statutory definition of intent was not error.
