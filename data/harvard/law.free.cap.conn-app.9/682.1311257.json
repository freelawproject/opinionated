(Augustana), to furnish architectural services for the construction of a housing project on land owned by the plaintiff lessor, St. Catherine\u2019s Church Corporation of Riverside. Augustana had leased the land from the plaintiff, and, with the plaintiffs consent, had initiated the housing project. The defendant furnished architectural services to Augustana and, after a dispute arose between them, the defendant filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against the real estate owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff thereafter filed an application to discharge the mechanic\u2019s lien. The trial court granted the application and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The defendant claims the trial court erred (1) in discharging the mechanic\u2019s lien, and (2) in requiring a greater burden of proof on the defendant than is required to maintain a mechanic\u2019s lien. Both contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">A mechanic\u2019s lien is a creature of statute. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>180 Conn. 545, 550, 429 A.2d 796 (1980); <em>Swift &amp; Upson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Hatch Co., </em>115 Conn. 494, 498, 162 A. 19 (1932). Its remedial purpose is to furnish security for a contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tor\u2019s labor and materials. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>141 Conn. 188, 191, 104 A.2d 545 (1954). General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> governs the availability of mechanic\u2019s liens and provides protection to those lienors who have an agreement with or consent of the owner of the land or of some person having authority from or rightfully acting for the owner. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Peacock Fixture &amp; Electric Co., </em>193 Conn. 290, 293, 475 A.2d 1100 (1984); <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>181 Conn. 592, 595, 436 A.2d 271 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in failing to find that the plaintiff had consented to work performed by the defendant. Under General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (a), the consent required from the owner or one acting under the owner\u2019s authority is more than the \u201cmere granting of permission for work to be conducted on one\u2019s property\u201d; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Peacock Fixture &amp; Electric Co., </em>supra, 295; or the mere knowledge that work was being performed on one\u2019s land. <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Conn. 223, 227, 113 A. 313 (1921); <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>62 Conn. 75, 77, 25 A. 392 (1892); <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>58 Conn. 445, 449, 20 A. 469 (1890); <em>Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates, Inc. v.F &amp; J, Inc., </em>34 Conn. Sup. 638, 640, 382 A.2d 541 (1977). \u201cThe consent meant by the statute must be a consent that indicates an agreement that the owner of at least the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor. As stated in <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>90 Conn. 651, 98 Atl. 561 [1916]: Tt is not necessary that the materials shall be furnished under an express contract, but it is enough if they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>furnished with the consent of the owner of the land, so that there is an implied contract by him to pay for them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Whether the plaintiff consented to the performance of the defendant\u2019s work for Augustana is a question of fact. Our review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings is limited to the question of whether the findings are clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4185 (formerly \u00a7 3063); <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 676-77, 443 A.2d 486 (1982); <em>Abacus Mortgage Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitewood Hills Development Corporation, </em>2 Conn. App. 460, 463, 479 A.2d 1231 (1984). While the defendant has pointed to a statement in the plaintiff\u2019s trial brief as evidence that the plaintiff had consented to pay the defendant for its work, it has not referred us to any evidence introduced at trial that would support this conclusion. We cannot, therefore, find that the trial court\u2019s conclusion on this issue was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The defendant also claims that the mechanic\u2019s lien was proper because Augustana, who did consent to the work, was acting on behalf of the plaintiff when it contracted for the defendant\u2019s services. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Peacock Fixture &amp; Electric Co., </em>supra, 293. Again we are confronted with a factual finding of the trial court arrived at after a trial on the merits. The court found that while there was a commonality of membership on the board of directors of Augustana and the plaintiff and that both Augustana and the plaintiff had a relationship with the Diocese of Bridgeport, the defendant had not proved that there was such an identity of interest between the plaintiff and Augustana so as to justify the conclusion that Augustana had acted on behalf of the plaintiff in contracting for the defendant\u2019s services. We do not find this conclusion to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim, that the trial court imposed a greater burden of proof on it than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>required by law, is unsubstantiated by the record in this case. General Statutes \u00a7 49-35b (a) requires that the lienor filing the mechanic\u2019s lien must \u201cestablish that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of his lien\u201d at the hearing on an application to discharge the lien. A review of the record, transcripts and briefs fails to disclose any basis for concluding that the trial court imposed a greater burden of proof than the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for . . . services rendered . . . in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, and the claim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent of the owner ... or of some person having authority from or rightfuly acting for the owner . . . then the plot of land, is subject to the payment of the claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
