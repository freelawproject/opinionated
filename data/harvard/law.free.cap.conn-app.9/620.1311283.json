Thus, he fails to comply with the rules of practice. In the face of this failure to comply with the rules of practice we will not review the claims of error relating to the jury charges. <em>Rozbicki </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>2 Conn. App. 87, 88, 476 A.2d 1069 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the court erred in allowing the defendant to amend his answer during trial to include special defenses. A trial court has the discretion to allow an amendment to the pleading before, during or even after the trial. <em>Saphir </em>v. <em>Neustadt, </em>177 Conn. 191, 206, 413 A.2d 843 (1979). A trial court\u2019s decision to allow an amendment will be reversed only upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. Id. The plaintiff did not move for a postponement or a continuance of the trial in order to remedy his alleged surprise at the special defenses; nor has he shown any injustice or prejudice from the allowance of the amendment. See <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>American Urban Corporation, </em>170 Conn. 243, 249 n.3, 365 A.2d 1153 (1976). We therefore conclude that permitting the amendment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The plaintiffs final claim of error will not be considered as it \u201cevade[s] meaningful appellate review because counsel has not researched the issues or formulated any legal arguments thereunder.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-3), </em>3 Conn. App. 194, 197, 485 A.2d 1369 (1985). \u201cBare assertions of error without citation to legal authority may constitute an abandonment of a claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chauvin, </em>8 Conn. App. 307, 311, 512 A.2d 969 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>7 Conn. App. 223, 226-28, 508 A.2d 772 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
