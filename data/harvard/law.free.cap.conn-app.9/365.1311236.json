We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">In August, 1983, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of larceny in the first degree by embezzlement in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (1) and General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2), as amended by Public Acts 1981, No. 81-248, \u00a7 1. In October, 1983, he was sentenced by the court, <em>Melville, J., </em>to a term of six years to run consecutively with an unrelated federal sentence he was then serving. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>sentence was later affirmed by the sentence review board. Thereafter, the defendant moved to correct the sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 935.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Landau, J., </em>denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The defendant\u2019s sole claim of error is that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not permit a court to order a sentence to run consecutively with an earlier sentence unless the earlier sentence was imposed by a \u201ccourt of this state.\u201d Thus, he argues, since the federal court is not a \u201ccourt of this state,\u201d there is no authority for the court to order as it did. The state argues that the defendant\u2019s motion was improper in that it was taken in lieu of an appeal long after the expiration of the appeal period, and additionally, long after the ninety day period provided in Practice Book \u00a7 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The state misreads Practice Book \u00a7 935. That section, which formerly contained a ninety day time limit, was amended, effective October 1,1983, to provide in pertinent part: \u201cThe judicial authority may at <em>any time </em>correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since the trial court\u2019s sentence was imposed on October 14, 1983, the claim of illegality falls within the scope of Practice Book \u00a7 935 as amended and was not subject to the ninety day period of limitation. As such, it could be addressed by the trial court at any time. Thus, this appeal is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The defendant\u2019s reliance on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37 as authority for his position is misplaced. \u201cA cardinal rule of statutory construction is to construe statutes in a manner which gives effect to the apparent intention of the legislature .... Where the language used is clear and unambiguous, we will not speculate as to some supposed intention.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Water-bury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 231, 477 A.2d 988 (1984). It is clear that the legislature intended this statute to apply only when a court is faced with either (1) multiple sentences imposed at the same time, or (2) an \u201cundischarged term of imprisonment imposed at a previous time by a court of this state . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37. Since neither of these situations is present in this case, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37 is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">A state court\u2019s inherent right to impose consecutive sentences has been recognized at common law in Connecticut and elsewhere. See <em>Redway </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>132 Conn. 300, 43 A.2d 748 (1945); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>98 Idaho 399, 565 P.2d 989 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Upham, </em>415 A.2d 1029, 1033 (R.I. 1980). Thus, we conclude that consecutive sentencing is not illegal in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The power to order a consecutive sentence includes the authority to impose a sentence consecutive to one imposed by a court in a different jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>McKaughen, </em>108 Idaho 471, 472, 700 P.2d 93 (1985). We note that other state appellate courts have concluded that state sentences must run consecutively with already imposed federal sentences since \u201cno authority exists for a state court to order that a sentence imposed by it shall run <em>concurrently </em>with a sentence being served in another state or with a sentence being served in federal custody.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>633 S.W.2d 253 (Mo. App. 1982). In <em>Merchant </em>v. <em>State, </em>374 N.W.2d 245, 246 (Iowa 1985), the state appellate court, relying upon the traditional rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>a state court is endowed with inherent authority to order that a sentence be served consecutively, held that a party\u2019s \u201cchallenge to the court\u2019s authority to order his . . . sentence to be served consecutively to [a] federal sentence [was] without merit.\u201d Finally, we note that illegality is a necessary prerequisite to correcting a sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 935; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaskin, </em>7 Conn. App. 131, 133, 508 A.2d 40 (1986); and we find no illegality here.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 935 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence ... or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a person at the same time, or when a person who is subject to any undischarged term of imprisonment imposed at a previous time by a court of this state is sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed by the court shall run either concurrently or consecutively with respect to each other . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
