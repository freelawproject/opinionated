The trial court read the regulation in question to require such an intent. We hold that the regulation does not require such an intent, and find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The plaintiff, which is the owner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the property in question, applied to the Essex zoning enforcement officer for a permit to continue using the property as a nonconforming business use. The zoning enforcement officer denied the plaintiffs application. The plaintiff appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals. The board upheld the officer\u2019s decision on the basis that \u00a7 50E.1 of the zoning regulations does not require an intent permanently to discontinue a nonconforming use, and that the plaintiff had not used the property, within the meaning of that section, for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the zoning regulations require an intent to discontinue the nonconforming use, and that th\u00e9 record was factually insufficient to support the board\u2019s decision. The court sustained the appeal, holding that \u00a7 50E.1 of the zoning regulations requires a showing of intent to relinquish a nonconforming use, and that the board did not consider any such intent. We granted the petitions for certification to appeal filed by the defendants, the Essex zoning commission, the zoning enforcement officer, the board, and two abutting property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Sections 50E, 50E.1, and 50E.2 of the Essex zoning regulations provide in pertinent part: \u201c50E. TERMINATION. Except as provided in 50F. [which is not applicable to this case], no use of any land or improvement having a non-conforming characteristic and no non-conforming use or characteristic of land or improvement should be resumed or restored: 50E.1. CESSATION. If such use or characteristic has not existed for a period of one year from the date of cessation or from the effective date of the applicable regulation, whichever is later; or 50E.2. ABANDONMENT. If it is abandoned.\u201d The trial court reasoned that the word \u201ccease\u201d means \u201cdiscontinue,\u201d that \u201cdiscontinue\u201d is synonomous with \u201cabandon,\u201d and that both \u201cdiscontinue\u201d and \u201cabandon\u201d have been held to require an intent by an owner permanently to cease the nonconforming use of his property. See <em>Magnano </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>188 Conn. 225, 449 A.2d 148 (1982). The court held, therefore, that \u201ccessation\u201d as used in \u00a7 50E.1 is synonomous with \u201cdiscontinuance,\u201d and requires an intent permanently to cease the nonconforming use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred in this reading of \u00a7 50E.1. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Our Supreme Court has stated, albeit in dictum, that \u201ca town may be able to fashion its zoning ordinance so as to make the cessation of use for a certain period alone a ground for extinguishing a nonconforming use . . . .\u201d (Footnote <em>omitted.) Magnano </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 228; see also <em>State ex rel. Eramo </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>127 Conn. 239, 241, 16 A.2d 286 (1940). <em>In Magnano </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 228-29, the court held that \u201cWestbrook has not done so,\u201d and interpreted the word \u201cdiscontinued\u201d in the Westbrook zoning regulations to be synonomous with \u201cabandoned\u201d and thus to require intent. In this case, however, Essex has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>First, \u00a7 50E.2 provides for an alternate method of extinguishing a nonconforming use: \u201cIf [the use] is abandoned.\u201d The concept of abandonment of a nonconforming use as requiring an intent permanently to cease the use is well established in our zoning law. See <em>Magnano </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra; <em>Dubitzky </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>160 Conn. 120, 125-26, 273 A.2d 876 (1970). Thus, under \u00a7 50E.2, where intent is required, no particular time period of nonuse is required. To hold that \u00a7 50E.1, which requires a one year period of nonuse, also requires intent would render \u00a7 50E.2 superfluous. See also <em>Canada\u2019s Tavern, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glen Echo, </em>260 Md. 206, 271 A.2d 664 (1970), cited with approval in <em>Magnano </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 228 n.3. In <em>Canada\u2019s Tavern, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glen Echo, </em>supra, the Montgomery county code provided for extinguishment upon \u201cthe <em>cessation </em>of a nonconforming use for a period of six months or more.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 207. The court held that this language did not require an intent to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Second, reading \u201ccessation\u201d as synonomous with \u201cdiscontinuance,\u201d and thus with abandonment, effectively ignores the remainder of \u00a7 50E.1 and its implicit reference to \u00a7 50A. Section 50A provides: \u201c50A. NONCONFORMING USES AND IMPROVEMENTS. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Regulations, a non-conforming use of any land or improvement or a non-conforming characteristic of any land or improvement, which has not been changed to conformity with these Regulations or otherwise terminated, may remain and be continued and shall not be required to conform to these Regulations.\u201d Section 50E.1 provides that a nonconforming use should not be resumed or restored \u201c[i]f such use . . . has not existed for a period of one year from the date of cessation <em>or from the effective date of the applicable regu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>lotion, </em>whichever is later . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase in \u00a7 50E.1, \u201cthe applicable regulation,\u201d refers to the \u201cRegulations\u201d mentioned in \u00a7 50A.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">It is clear that under this clause, \u201cor from the effective date of the applicable regulation,\u201d no intent is necessary. Where, for example, the town amends its zoning regulations and thereby makes a parcel of then unused property nonconforming, if the owner does not use the property \u201cfor a period of one year . . . from the date of the applicable regulation,\u201d the nonconforming use is extinguished without regard to the owner\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The conclusion of the trial court in this case would require intent where the owner ceased the nonconforming use and did not exercise it for a period of one year, but would not require intent where the owner did not exercise for one year a use which became nonconforming by virtue of a change in the zoning regulations. We see no justification in the regulations for such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Third, this interpretation is consistent with the long standing policy of this state with regard to nonconforming uses. That policy is that \u201c \u2018 \u201cnonconforming uses should be abolished or reduced to conformity as quickly as the fair interest of the parties will permit . . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Weyls </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>161 Conn. 516, 520, 290 A.2d 350 (1971); see also T. Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation, p. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The plaintiff also claimed in its appeal to the trial court that the board erred in determining that the plaintiff had not used the property, within the meaning of \u00a7 50E.1, for a period of one year. The trial court did not rule on this claim because of its legal conclusion regarding the meaning of \u201ccessation.\u201d Although the plaintiff in its brief in this court has attempted to supply this claim as an alternate ground for sustaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>judgment of the trial court, we believe that it is better left to the trial court to determine. We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> At the time of its initial application to the zoning enforcement officer, the plaintiff was not the owner of the property but was a proposed user thereof. The plaintiff subsequently purchased the property while its appeal to the zoning board of appeals was pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
