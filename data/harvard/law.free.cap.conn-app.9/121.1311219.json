We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The first count of the information, charging the defendant with burglary in the third degree, alleged that between 9 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. on February 21, 1983, the defendant unlawfully entered premises at 139 Watch Hill Road, in Branford, with intent to commit a crime therein. The second count, charging the defendant with larceny in the first degree, alleged that at the same time and place the defendant, with the intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate it to him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>self, wrongfully took such property from the owner, and that the value of the property exceeded ten thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On February 21,1983, Nancy and Henry Levine resided at 139 Watch Hill Road. Robin Dorman, who is Nancy Levine\u2019s daughter and Henry Levine\u2019s stepdaughter, lived with the defendant in West Haven. Only the Levines and Dorman lawfully possessed keys to the Levines\u2019 residence. Dorman had known the defendant for approximately two years, and had been living with him for about two months. Dorman had, at some time prior to February 21,1983, lost her set of keys, including her key to the Levines\u2019 residence. The defendant had been in the Levines\u2019 residence two or three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">On February 21,1983, Henry Levine was in London on a business trip. At 9:30 a.m., Nancy Levine left her residence to go to work at a bridal shop which she and her husband owned. She turned the lights off and locked the front door behind her. Dorman also worked at the bridal shop. During the day the defendant telephoned Dorman several times at the shop, which was not unusual. During one of the telephone calls he asked to speak with Nancy Levine, which was unusual, and arranged to meet her for lunch the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Nancy Levine closed the shop at 9 p.m. and arrived home at approximately 9:30 p.m. The front door was locked. She unlocked it and, upon entering the premises, saw a light on upstairs. She went upstairs and saw that her husband\u2019s armoire was open. Additionally, the top drawers of her dressers and her jewelry chest drawers were open. These were all closed when she had left that morning. She saw that expensive jewelry was missing. She called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">No evidence was offered regarding any points of possible entry to the residence other than the front door. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The Levines\u2019 residence was part of a condominium complex consisting of three streets and approximately seventy-five units. During calendar year 1983, this was the only burglary and theft at the complex reported to the Branford police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Ultimately, the Levines prepared a list of the jewelry which Nancy Levine discovered missing that evening. The list included an antique key wind watch which her husband had given her as an anniversary gift, and a gold watch with a Lenox band belonging to Henry Levine.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Mark DiMiero owned a jewelry store in Orange, and knew the defendant. At some time shortly after the burglary, the defendant came to DiMiero\u2019s store. Dorman was with him. Privately, out of Dorman\u2019s hearing, the defendant told DiMiero that he would like to see DiMiero the next day. On the next morning, the defendant brought Nancy Levine\u2019s key wind watch to DiMiero for possible appraisal and sale. DiMiero took the watch, put it in his safe, and it was ultimately turned over to the police and introduced into evidence. On March 9, 1983, the defendant returned to DiMiero\u2019s store, and sold DiMiero some jewelry. Among that jewelry was Henry Levine\u2019s gold watch with a Lenox band. The discovery that DiMiero had the Levines\u2019 watches was made by Henry Levine on a visit to DiMiero\u2019s store shortly after the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">All the jewelry which was stolen from the Levine residence on February 21, 1983, had a fair market value of $25,000. The key wind watch was valued separately at $400, and the Lenox watch band at $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to form the basis of a conviction for burglary in the third degree. The defendant concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the state established the fact of a burglary on February 21,1983. He claims, however, that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish that it was he who entered the Levines\u2019 home on that date. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The two part standard for gauging the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is well established. \u201cWe first view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. We then determine whether a jury could have reasonably concluded, from that evidence and all the reasonable inferences which it yields, that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parent, </em>8 Conn. App. 469, 472-73, 513 A.2d 725 (1986). \u201cThe jury may base an inference on facts it finds as a result of other inferences.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 673, 485 A.2d 913 (1984). Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a possible doubt. Id., 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The state\u2019s case was based on circumstantial evidence. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThere is no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence so far as probative force is concerned.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>193 Conn. 612, 625, 480 A.2d 452 (1984). Indeed, our Supreme Court has stated that circumstantial evidence \u201c \u2018may be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, 153 </em>Conn. 72, 78, 214 A.2d 362 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 86 S. Ct. 1372, 16 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1966), quoting <em>Michalic </em>v. <em>Cleveland Tankers, Inc., </em>364 U.S. 325, 330, 81 S. Ct. 6, 5 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">It is true, as the defendant argues, that the state did not introduce any direct evidence which excluded a possible entry into the Levine home by means other than through the locked front door. There was no evidence of a lack of forced entry through windows or through the back door. There was, however, circumstantial evidence presented from which the jury could infer an unlawful entry by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>First, the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant possessed the two stolen watches after the burglary. DiMiero testified that the defendant came into his jewelry store \u201cin the latter part of February,\u201d \u201cin the beginning months of 1983,\u201d \u201cthe end of January the beginning of February,\u201d and \u201cwithin a few weeks\u201d prior to March 9, 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While DiMiero\u2019s testimony is imprecise and at times contradictory about the date of the defendant\u2019s visit and, consequently, subject to more than one interpretation by the jury, it nonetheless constitutes a sufficient basis on which the jury could conclude that the defendant visited the jewelry store after February 21,1983. \u201cIt is clear that, in viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the jury\u2019s function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>3 Conn. App. 607, 616-17, 491 A.2d 404 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Second, the jury could reasonably have inferred a criminal connection with the property from the defendant\u2019s possession of two stolen watches shortly after the burglary. \u201c[T]he possession of property recently stolen, if unexplained and standing alone or without other facts pointing to a contrary conclusion, will justify the trier in drawing an inference that the possessor stole the property . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palkimas, </em>153 Conn. 555, 558-59, 219 A.2d 220 (1966). \u201cIn other words, the circumstantial evidence of possession of recently stolen property raises a permissible inference of criminal connection with the property . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Although this rule of inference is usually employed to prove larceny by taking or by receiving; see id., 558-59; under the facts of this case it was permissible for the jury to infer, from the defendant\u2019s possession of the two watches, his commission of the crime of burglary. The \u201cinference is one of fact . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 559. Its \u201csoundness . . . involves the probative value of the circumstantial evidence.\u201d Id. The probative force of the inference involves \u201ca question of logic rather than a question of law.\u201d Id. The process of drawing inferences is particularly a function of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>supra, 673. Thus, where the jury could infer that the two watches were among the jewelry stolen in the burglary, it could also infer from those facts that the possessor of those watches shortly after their theft committed the burglary in which they were stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Third, the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant had the opportunity to enter the Levine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>household. He had an opportunity to obtain a key to the house from Dorman who, along with her mother and stepfather, were the only persons with legitimate access to a key. While the defendant presented an alibi defense, a rebuttal witness called by the state gave testimony from which the jury could conclude, even after crediting the alibi testimony, that the defendant nonetheless had an opportunity to enter the Levines\u2019 household on the date of the burglary. The inference that the defendant entered the residence with the key was further buttressed by the evidence that this was the only burglary and theft reported in the condominium complex for the entire year.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Fourth, the defendant made statements to DiMiero which evinced a consciousness of guilt. DiMiero testified that approximately one and one-half months before trial, the defendant saw DiMiero and, upon learning that DiMiero had been subpoenaed to testify, told DiMiero that \u201c[sjetting me up with Robin\u2019s father, Mr. Levine, was the lowest thing you could have ever done to me.\u201d He told DiMiero to disobey the subpoena and not to appear in court. He also told him that he \u201cwas going to have Balbusti talk to\u201d him. Balbusti was a person whom DiMiero believed to have a reputation for being rough and intimidating. DiMiero took the remark as a threat. Our law has repeatedly \u201capproved the admission of threats against or attempted intimidation of witnesses as evidence of consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 534, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>188 Conn. 591, 598, 452 A.2d 642 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>181 Conn. 475, 479, 436 A.2d 6 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In summary, the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant possessed two of the stolen watches shortly after the burglary took place, that the two watches were taken at the time of the burglary, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the defendant had the opportunity to commit the burglary, and that the defendant evinced a consciousness of his guilt. From the cumulative effect of this evidence, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the defendant unlawfully entered the Levines\u2019 home with intent to commit a crime therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"Agv\">The defendant also challenges the evidentiary sufficiency of the conviction of larceny in the first degree on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to establish that he took property worth more than $10,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">As we noted above, the jury was entitled to infer, from the defendant\u2019s possession of the two watches, that he stole them during the burglary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palkimas, </em>supra, 558-59.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the state presented evidence that other jewelry was taken during the same burglary, the jury was also entitled to infer that the defendant took all the jewelry stolen during the burglary. That jewelry had a total value of $25,000. See <em>Aiken v. State, </em>226 Ga. 840, 845, 178 S.E.2d 202 (1970) (inference of guilt of robbery arises from possession of some, as well as all, of stolen property); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 Conn. App. 359, 365-66, 488 A.2d 837 (1985) (jury may infer theft of goods not found in defendant's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>possession, where evidence exists that all property was stolen at once and the defendant found in possession of most of other stolen property).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>178 Conn. 416, 423 A.2d 102 (1979), on which the defendant relies, is distinguishable. In that case the defendant was charged with larceny in the first degree by receiving stolen property. A codefendant, who was employed at a store, spoke to the defendant about stealing goods from the store and fencing them through the defendant. The codefendant made six deliveries of stolen merchandise to the defendant, the value of which was established at no more than $1000. The store manager\u2019s inventory survey revealed that merchandise worth more than $12,000 was missing from the store. The court held that this evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant had received stolen property worth more than $2000. Id., 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The defendant in <em>Saracino </em>was charged with larceny by receiving stolen property. We read <em>Saracino </em>as holding that there was no basis for an inference that all the property stolen by the codefendant was fenced through the defendant. Thus, there was no basis for an inference that the defendant received all the stolen property. In this case, however, the defendant was charged with larceny by taking property. There was evidence that all of the property was taken at the same time. There was a basis, therefore, from which the jury could infer, because of the defendant\u2019s possession of some of the recently stolen property, that he stole it all.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the first degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and ... (2) the value of the property . . . exceeds ten thousand dollars.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 defines larceny in pertinent part: <em>\u201cA </em>person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property ... he wrongfully takes . . . such property from an owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-5\"> That testimony is: \u201cQ. Now, directing your attention to February, <em>the latter part of February in 1983, </em>did you have occasion to have any contact with [the defendant] at that particular time?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cA. <em>Right </em>I believe that\u2019s when he came into the store ....</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u201cQ.

I didn\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure of the exact date.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">\u201cThe Court: Strike that, please.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">DiMiero testified further as follows: \u201cQ. Was [the defendant\u2019s visit to the store] in the first part of 1983?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">\u201cA. Yes it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">\u201cQ. And reconstructing when that date would have been, can you tell us what part of 1983 [it] would have been in?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">\u201cA. You know, I\u2019m not sure. I would imagine it was probably \u2014 It was definitely after Christmas. I would imagine maybe the end of January the beginning of February. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">\u201cQ. <em>Would you estimate that it was in the beginning </em>\u2014 sometime <em>in the beginning months of 1983?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">\u201cA. <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">\u201cQ. The exact date, you\u2019re not sure?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">\u201cA. No.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-19\">DiMiero also testified that on March 9,1983, he bought some jewelry from the defendant, and that this occasion was \u201cwithin that same time . . . within, I\u2019d say, a few weeks\u201d of the defendant\u2019s initial visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\"> The defendant also claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he took the Levines\u2019 jewelry on February 21, 1983. Our discussion in part I of this opinion is dispositive of that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\"> The defendant suggests that, to the extent that the rule articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Palkimas, </em>153 Conn. 555, 219 A.2d 220 (1966), required him to explain his possession of recently stolen property, it runs afoul of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979), <em>and Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 105 S. Ct. 1965, 85 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1985), and his constitutional right to remain silent. Therefore, he claims the rule must be modified. We decline to review this claim because the defendant did not raise it in the trial court and does not claim review in this court pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
