We hold (1) that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a, is a lesser included offense of misconduct with a motor vehicle, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57, and (2) that multiple deaths resulting from a single motor vehicle accident yield a separate sentence on each count pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On January 19,1983, at approximately 2:55 p.m., the defendant was operating a tractor-trailer truck on Interstate 95 at the Stratford toll station and caused a motor vehicle accident involving several other vehicles which resulted in the deaths of seven people. The state charged him with seven counts of misconduct with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57. The jury acquitted him of the charges of misconduct with a motor vehicle, but convicted him of seven counts of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a as lesser included offenses. The trial court ruled, however, that double jeopardy principles required that only one sentence be imposed and, accordingly, imposed on all seven counts a single sentence of six months incarceration and a fine of $1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction, claiming that the court erred (1) in submitting to the jury negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as a lesser included offense of misconduct with a motor vehicle, (2) in admitting into evidence an out-of-court statement of the defendant, (3) in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial which was based on the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s allegedly improper com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ment, made in his final closing argument, concerning the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, and (4) in giving confusing and misleading instructions to the jury on the concept of negligence. The state also appealed, with the permission of the trial court, claiming that the court erred in imposing only one sentence on the guilty verdicts of seven counts of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. We find no error on the defendant\u2019s appeal. We find error on the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The Defendant\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE WITH A MOTOR VEHICLE AS A LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF MISCONDUCT WITH A MOTOR VEHICLE</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a, cannot be a lesser included offense of misconduct with a motor vehicle, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57, because negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is not a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d but is a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d pursuant to the definitions set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state advocates the contrary position, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>namely, that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is a \u201ccriminal offense,\u201d and not a \u201cmotor vehicle violation,\u201d because it fails to meet the statutory definition of a \u201cviolation\u201d as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-27.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">At the state\u2019s request and over the objection of the defendant, the court instructed the jury that, if they were not persuaded that the defendant was guilty of misconduct with a motor vehicle, they could convict him of the lesser included offense of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Although we agree with the defendant that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 and therefore is not an \u201coffense\u201d or \u201ccrime\u201d within the meaning of that statute; see footnote 3, supra; we hold that it is an offense for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The defendant concedes that, if negligent homicide with a motor vehicle were a \u201ccrime\u201d rather than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u201cmotor vehicle violation,\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24, it would qualify as a lesser included offense of misconduct with a motor vehicle. He does not claim that the first, third or fourth prongs of our traditional lesser included offense analysis were not satisfied. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 396-97, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S. Ct. 874, 66 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1981). His sole claim in this regard is that the second prong of that analysis, namely, that \u201cit is not possible to commit the greater <em>offense, </em>in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the <em>lesser\u201d; </em>(emphasis added) id.; cannot be satisfied because negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is, by legislative classification, a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d and not an \u201coffense.\u201d Therefore, before turning to a discussion of the principal issue of whether negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is a lesser included offense of misconduct with a motor vehicle, we must determine the legislative scope of the terms \u201coffense\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a) defines the term \u201coffense\u201d as \u201cany crime or violation which constitutes a breach of any law . . . for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment or to a fine, or both, may be imposed, <em>except one that defines a motor vehicle violation </em>or is deemed to be an infraction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The term \u2018crime\u2019 comprises felonies and misdemeanors. Every offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>which is not a \u2018crime\u2019 is a \u2018violation.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added; footnote added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-27 provides that \u201c[a]n <em>offense, </em>for which the only sentence authorized is a fine, is a <em>violation</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>unless expressly designated an infraction.\u201d (Emphasis added; footnote added.) The state contends that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle does not fall within the statutory definition of a \u201cviolation\u201d because it carries a penalty of imprisonment. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-27. The state further claims that since negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is not a violation, it is a crime within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a). Crimes are either felonies or misdemeanors. Id. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-26 (a) defines a misdemeanor as \u201c[a]n <em>offense </em>for which a person may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than one year . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-26 (c) further provides that \u201c[a]ny <em>offense </em>defined <em>in any other section </em>of the general statutes which, by virtue of an expressly specified sentence, is within the definition set forth in subsection (a) shall be deemed an unclassified misdemeanor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the state argues, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is an unclassified misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">While at first blush the state\u2019s argument is attractive, on closer scrutiny it becomes apparent that a basic step has been overlooked in determining the applicability of the statutes cited in support of the analysis. It is clear from the language emphasized in the statutes defining \u201cviolation\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d that, before the definitions apply, the statute violated must be an \u201coffense.\u201d It is equally clear, however, that by the express terms of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a) the term \u201coffense\u201d excludes \u201cmotor vehicle violation[s].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Thus, on the basis of the statutory scheme, it is our conclusion that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is not a \u201ccrime\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a) because it is not an \u201coffense,\u201d but rather, it is a \u201cmotor vehicle violation.\u201d This conclusion is buttressed by an examination of the logic and purpose of subsection (b) of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24, and of the legislative history and intent behind the enactment, repeal and reenactment of the statute concerning negligent homicide with a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">First, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (b) provides, inter alia, that \u2018 \u2018[n]otwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) [which excepts motor vehicle violations from the definition of \u2018offense\u2019], the provisions of sections 53a-28 to 53a-44, inclusive, shall apply to motor vehicle violations.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28 through 53a-44 are the sections of the penal code which, inter alia, set out the authorized sentences for the classified and unclassified offenses (i.e., felonies, misdemeanors and violations) and provide for such sentencing mechanisms as probation, conditional discharge and unconditional discharge. This subsection would be rendered meaningless by the state\u2019s analysis, since \u201cmotor vehicle violations,\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a), could only be transgressions carrying a fine. Yet, the purpose of this subsection is to make clear that \u201cthe sentencing principles enumerated in sections 53a-28 to 53a-44, inclusive, shall apply to motor vehicle violations.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes, p. 8. There would be no purpose served by legislatively authorizing the application of sentencing provisions of the penal code, i.e., suspension of execution of sentences of imprisonment conditioned on terms of probation and conditional discharge, to a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d if a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d consisted only of statutes authorizing punishment by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>f\u00edne.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous. . . .\u2019 <em>Water bury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., Inc., </em>193 Conn. 208, 231-32, 477 A.2d 988 (1984). ... \u2018A legislative act must be read as a whole and \u201cconstrued to give effect and to harmonize all of its parts.\u201d <em>Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>176 Conn. 43, 50, 404 A.2d 898 (1978).\u2019 <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104, 110, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984).\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a further supports our conclusion that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d and not an \u201coffense\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24. We first note that the degree of negligence prohibited by this statute is equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the ordinary civil standard of negligence, namely, the failure to use due care. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 426, 431, 450 A.2d 857 (1982). The state does not contend otherwise, and in this case the jury was so charged by the trial court. Thus, General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a proscribes, upon pain of a fine or imprisonment or both, ordinary civil negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle resulting in death. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14) which defines \u201ccriminal negligence,\u201d for purposes of the penal code, as the failure \u201cto perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that [a prescribed result or circumstance] exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The statute regarding negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was originally enacted in 1941, and was codified with the motor vehicle statutes. General Statutes (Sup. 1941) \u00a7 235f. That section was part of title XII, entitled \u201cMotor Vehicles.\u201d In 1969, when the penal code was adopted to take effect October 1,1971, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was left untouched as then General Statutes (Rev. to 1966) \u00a7 14-218. By contrast, the penal code repealed General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 53-17, entitled \u201cMisconduct of railroad or railway servants or motor vehicle operators,\u201d the substance of which dated from 1917 and which had always been codified with the criminal statutes, and replaced it with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57, entitled \u201cMisconduct with a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">From 1969 to 1971, therefore, misconduct with a motor vehicle, which requires proof of criminal negligence; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14); was part of the penal code, and negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was located in Chapter 248 of title 14 of the General Statutes, then entitled \u201cUse of the Highway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>by Vehicles.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a). It was within this context that the legislature defined the term \u201coffense,\u201d which specifically excluded \u201ca motor vehicle violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In 1971, however, the legislature repealed General Statutes \u00a7 14-218, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. The legislative history of this repeal indicates that the 1971 legislature believed that, when the 1969 legislature enacted the penal code, it meant, but inadvertently neglected, to repeal General Statutes \u00a7 14-218. See 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 697-98; 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 712-13. Therefore, from 1971 to 1973 there was no proscription against ordinary civil negligent homicide with a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In 1973, the statute concerning negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was reenacted; Public Acts 1973, No. 73-639, \u00a7 5; as a class B misdemeanor within the penal code. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-58a. This placement of it within the penal code, however, was something of an anomaly, because penal code offenses generally require a particular criminal mental state, such as intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or criminal negligence; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-5; all of which are defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3. The 1973 penal code offense of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, then General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58a, however, required no particular mental state; it provided only that a \u201cperson is guilty of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle when in consequence of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle he causes the death of another person.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-58a (a). Nonetheless, the class B misdemeanor of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle remained in the penal code until 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>In 1981, the legislature repealed General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58a, the penal code offense of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, and reenacted it, almost verbatim, as what is now General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-26, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. The stated purpose of the bill which became the public act was \u201c[t]o classify negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle violation rather than a criminal offense in the penal code.\u201d House Bill No. 5079 (1981). The explanation on the floor of the General Assembly by the co-chairmen of the judiciary committee focused on several factors. One factor was that the conduct proscribed by the statute involved only ordinary civil negligence, which could be conduct relatively low on the blameworthiness scale, what was referred to as \u201crelatively simple acts of negligence,\u201d not involving alcohol; 24 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1981 Sess., p. 707, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr.; and \u201can act of simple negligence, nothing to do with criminal negligence, nothing to do with intent, nothing to do with drinking . . . .\u201d 24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1981 Sess., p. 884, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano. Another factor was that criminal statutes should involve some criminal mens rea, and involve blameworthy conduct beyond \u201csimple negligence.\u201d Id. A third factor was a perceived constitutional frailty involved in penalizing, as criminal, conduct which did not require a mens rea. Id., 885. A fourth factor was a failure to understand why the statute was transferred from the motor vehicle chapter of the General Statutes to the penal code. Representative Tulisano commented that \u201cat one point it was repealed and they reenacted it. They put it in [the penal code] and that\u2019s inexplainable to me.\u201d Id. Senator Owens concluded: \u201c[T]his should be classified as a motor vehicle violation and in fact, not a criminal offense and this is the purpose of the statute.\u201d 24 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1981 Sess., p. 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>From this history, we glean the legislature\u2019s rationale for classifying negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle violation, rather than as a criminal offense. When one drives negligently and causes the death of another, the result is so serious that it calls for severe potential consequences to the wrongdoer, namely, a $1000 fine or six months imprisonment or both. Nonetheless, the kind of wrongful conduct proscribed by the statute can be relatively minor, and the statute does not require any traditonal mens rea. Thus, the person who violates the statute should not be considered as having committed a criminal offense. He could, for example, truthfully answer \u201cNo\u201d if asked whether he had ever been convicted of a crime. In this limited sense, therefore, conviction of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is akin to conviction of a penal code \u201cviolation,\u201d which \u201cshall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a criminal offense.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Our conclusion that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a is a \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d and, therefore, not an \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of the penal code<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not necessarily mean, as the defendant argues, that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>not an offense for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine. That question requires further analysis because, although the term \u201coffense\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 is a statutory word of art, its function in the jurisprudence of lesser included offenses is quite different. What may or may not be a criminal offense for purposes of a particular statutory categorization<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is not necessarily determinative of whether it is a criminal offense for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine. See, e.g., <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 100 S. Ct. 2260, 65 L. Ed. 2d 228 (1980) (traffic violation may be an \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy analysis). Whether the lesser included offense doctrine should apply to include a transgression of the law which the legislature has categorized for certain purposes as noncriminal depends, not on that categorization, but on the functions and purposes of the doctrine itself. We conclude that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is an offense for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">First, as a matter of precedent, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 513 A.2d 638 (1986), our Supreme Court strongly suggested that the lesser included offense doctrine applies to motor vehicle violations and infractions. In that case, the defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. The trial court denied a request by the defendant for a lesser included offense instruction on the infraction of driving while impaired, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (b) and (i), on the ground that the infraction \u201ccould not be considered an <em>offense </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>supra, 619. On appeal, the Supreme Court stated that <em>\u201c[wjhile we do not agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning, </em>we believe that its decision may be sustained under our conventional analysis.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. It then analyzed whether the infraction of driving while impaired was a lesser included offense of driving under the influence, under the traditional lesser included offense rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), and concluded that under the particular facts of that case it was not a lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>supra, 621-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We read <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>supra, as standing for the proposition that the lesser included offense doctrine applies between motor vehicle violations and infractions, both of which are clearly excepted from the penal code definition of \u201coffense.\u201d See footnote 3, supra. Therefore, if the doctrine applies between two offenses as defined by the penal code in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24, and if it applies between two transgressions of the law which are excepted from that definition, such as motor vehicle violations and infractions, we see no reason why it should not also apply between an offense as defined by the penal code and a transgression of the law which is excepted from that definition, such as a motor vehicle violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Second, the function and doctrinal roots of lesser included offense analysis lead to the conclusion that the doctrine applies in this case. \u201cThe doctrine of lesser included offenses in Connecticut serves the state by precluding acquittal due to failure of proof of the greater crime, the accused by permitting conviction of a lesser crime, and the constitution by preserving the function of the factfinder.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>MacFarlane, </em>188 Conn. 542, 546, 450 A.2d 374 (1982); see also C. Schuman &amp; L. Lager, \u201cConnecticut\u2019s Lesser Included Offense Doctrine,\u201d 54 Conn. B.J. 313 (1980). A \u201cprin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>cipal function of the lesser included offense doctrine ... is to \u2018[ejnable the jury to correlate more closely the criminal conviction with the act committed.\u2019 \u201d C. Blair, \u201cConstitutional Limitations on the Lesser Included Offense Doctrine,\u201d 21 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 445, 448-49 (1984). That process of correlation fits the facts of this case. By focusing on whether the defendant, although innocent of misconduct with a motor vehicle, nonetheless was guilty of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, the jury was permitted to correlate the convictions with his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Although it has not been held that a defendant has a constitutional right to a lesser included offense instruction; see <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 635, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 581; the doctrine\u2019s roots grow out of the concept of establishing guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201c[PJroviding the jury with the \u2018third option\u2019 of convicting on a lesser included offense ensures that the jury will accord the defendant the full benefit of the reasonable-doubt standard . . . . \u201d <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 633-34. In a case where \u201cone of the elements of the offense charged remains in doubt, but the defendant is plainly guilty of <em>some </em>offense\u201d; (emphasis in original) id., 634, quoting <em>Keeble </em>v. <em>United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 212-13, 93 S. Ct. 1993, 36 L. Ed. 2d 844 (1973); the doctrine serves to implement the reasonable doubt standard by relieving the jury, in an appropriate case, of the Hobson\u2019s choice between an unjust conviction and a gratuitous acquittal. <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra. Thus, where as here the charge of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and where the four traditional requirements of the doctrine were met, the court properly designated negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as a lesser included offense of misconduct with a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">ADMISSION OF OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS OF DEFENDANT</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The defendant next claims that the court erred in admitting certain out-of-court statements of his which were made prior to the accident, because they were hearsay, were self-serving and lacked reliability, and thus did not come within any exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The state presented Trooper Harold Adams of the Virginia state police as a witness. After an examination out of the jury\u2019s presence, he testified before the jury that at approximately 11 p.m. on January 18,1983, which was sixteen hours before the accident, he had a conversation with the defendant on Interstate 95 in Virginia. The defendant was proceeding northbound in the same tractor-trailer that was involved on the same interstate highway in the Connecticut accident. The defendant stated to Adams that he had recently replaced a head on his vehicle\u2019s speedometer, and the defendant estimated his speed to Adams in terms, not of miles per hour as would be indicated by the speedometer, but of revolutions per minute as indicated by his tachometer. Thus, the jury could infer that the defendant\u2019s speedometer was not working properly. The evidence was relevant to the state\u2019s claim that the defendant was traveling too fast at the time of the accident sixteen hours later. The defendant does not question its relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The defendant objected at the examination on the basis, inter alia, that the statement was not against his interest when it was made and was self-serving. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>court overruled the objection and the defendant excepted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thereafter, Adams testified before the jury as recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim is effectively disposed of by <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 249-54, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984). In that case the Supreme Court recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he statements made out of court by a [criminal defendant] are universally deemed admissible when offered against him\u2019; 4 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1972) \u00a7 1048, p. 2; so long as they are relevant and material to issues in the case. Although the theories for admissibility differ, the vast weight of authority, judicial, legislative, and scholarly, supports the admissibility without restriction of any statement of a party offered against that party at trial.\u201d Id., 251.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The defendant makes an elaborate argument based on the premise that, when deciding whether to admit hearsay evidence, the court must in each instance determine whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to be admitted. This argument simply misperceives the law. It is true that when hearsay is offered which does not come within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule the court may determine that it should be admitted nonetheless because it carries sufficient indicia of reliability, it is necessary to the case, and admission of it would be in the interest of justice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 664, 491 A.2d 345 (1985); <em>In re Jason S., </em>9 Conn. App. 98, 105, 516 A.2d 352 (1986). It is also true, however, that \u201c[s]ome types of admissible hearsay occur frequently enough that certain defined exceptions to the general rule of inadmissibility have come to be recognized.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra, 250. The out-of-court statements of a criminal defendant constitute one such exception. Id., 250-52. The statements of the defendant in this case fall squarely within that exception, and were thus admissible without any further reference to whether they were self-serving or reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">THE ARGUMENT OF THE STATE IN FINAL CLOSING ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The defendant next claims that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial which was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>the state\u2019s final closing argument. He claims that the argument was an improper indirect comment on his failure to testify and that a mistrial was required. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In final closing argument; see Practice Book \u00a7 874 (4); after the defendant had presented his final argument, the assistant state\u2019s attorney stated the following: \u201cI say to you ladies and gentlemen the State has proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt that not only was Charles Kluttz negligent on that day and <em>without a reasonable explanation to show you that he was innocent, </em>but he was criminally negligent and his criminal negligence in the operation of the [truck] with the trailer attached caused the deaths of seven people. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Court was adjourned for the day immediately thereafter. The next morning the defendant moved for a mistrial, claiming that the emphasized portion of the argument amounted to improper comment on his failure to testify. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The ultimate question on a motion for mistrial is whether there was \u201c \u2018substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 887. A mistrial is warranted \u2018only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during trial a party has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>5 Conn. App. 500, 505, 500 A.2d 571 (1985). Such a motion invokes the court\u2019s wide discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The constitutional prohibition against indirect comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify \u201cdoes not mean, however, that the state is precluded in argument from commenting on the strength of its case or the weakness of the defense case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>[198 Conn. 209, 220, 502 A.2d 404 (1985)]; see <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>418 F.2d 1266, 1268-69 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. Ct. 1388, 25 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1970). \u2018The prosecutor is entitled to comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to call witnesses to contradict the factual character of the government\u2019s case, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dioguardi, </em>492 F.2d 70, 81-82 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 873 [95 S. Ct. 134, 42 L. Ed. 2d 112] (1974), as well as his failure to support his own factual theories with witnesses. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>556 F.2d 638, 641 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lipton, </em>467 F.2d 1161, 1168 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 927 [93 S. Ct. 1358, 35 L. Ed. 2d 587] (1973).\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buhar, </em>567 F.2d 192, 199 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 872, 98 S. Ct. 217, 54 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1977). The ultimate test of whether a prosecution argument indirectly and impermissibly comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is whether, because of its language and context, the jury would naturally and necessarily interpret it as comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>supra, 216; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartino, </em>[7 Conn. App. 292, 294-95, 508 A.2d 809 (1986)]. A significant factor in applying this test is whether the argument calls for information or explanations which only the defendant could be expected to supply. See <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartino, </em>supra, 295.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>9 Conn. App. 169, 178-79, 517 A.2d 1043 (1986). The argument of the assistant state\u2019s attorney did not fail that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A careful reading of the challenged language in its context yields the conclusion that it referred solely to the strength of the state\u2019s case, and not to the failure of the defendant to testify. In proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the state must produce proof which precludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, is consistent with guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>3 Conn. App. 607, 616, 491 A.2d 404 (1985). The challenged language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>came at the very end of the state\u2019s final closing argument. We read it, and we believe that the jury heard it, as argument that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt four facts: (1) the defendant was negligent; (2) there was no reasonable explanation of the evidence leading to a conclusion of innocence; (3) he was not only negligent but was <em>criminally </em>negligent; and (4) his criminal negligence caused the deaths of seven persons. Thus, the state was, we believe, merely arguing that it had met its burden of precluding every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Furthermore, even if we assume, as the defendant argues, that the challenged language asked the jury to seek a reasonable explanation of innocence from the defendant, taken in context it was not improper. There was evidence, introduced through the defendant\u2019s doctor and a hospital social worker, that he suffered from retrograde amnesia, that he did not remember the accident, but that he did remember trying to use his brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The challenged language was in response to statements made by defense counsel in his closing argument. He had argued that there were reasonable explanations for the accident which were consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. These arguments referred to the defendant\u2019s amnesia, and counsel further argued that it was reasonable to infer that the defendant\u2019s brakes had unexpectedly and suddenly failed, that he downshifted gears in an attempt to slow his tractor-trailer as he approached the toll station, and that he applied his emergency brake, which explained certain skid marks on the road. In sum, his argument was that it was a reasonable explanation from the evidence that the accident was caused, not by the defendant\u2019s negligence, but by mechanical failure which was beyond his control.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The state, in its final closing argument, rebutted each of these claims made by the defendant\u2019s counsel. The state argued that the defendant failed to produce evidence that his brakes were malfunctioning, whereas the state had produced evidence that they were in fact working. The state argued further that there was no evidence presented to support the defendant\u2019s claim that he downshifted his gears or applied the emergency brake. It was within this context that the assistant state\u2019s attorney argued that the defendant was \u201cwithout a reasonable explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The state was entitled to comment on the weakness of the defendant\u2019s case and his failure to support his own factual theories. <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra. This is especially true where the defendant has provided the jury with a reason for his failure to explain the events leading up to the accident, namely, that he suffered amnesia. The defendant\u2019s case necessarily would require persons other than the defendant to supply information or explanations; <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra; as to what occurred. The failure of the defendant to call expert or lay witnesses in support of his theory is a legitimate area of comment. Where the defendant presented the jury with an explanation for his failure to explain the events surrounding the accident, and where that explanation was unrelated to the defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to testify, we cannot conclude that the jury naturally and necessarily interpreted the state\u2019s argument as a comment on his failure to testify. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">JURY INSTRUCTION ON NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim of error requires little discussion. In explaining the concepts of negligence and criminal negligence to the jury, the court a number of times used the term \u201csimple negligence.\u201d The defendant timely excepted to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The defendant argues that the term \u201csimple negligence\u201d was confusing and misleading to the jury because the word \u201csimple\u201d has several commonly understood meanings, such as \u201ceasy,\u201d \u201cmere,\u201d \u201ceasy to understand\u201d and \u201cnot complicated,\u201d which are inapplicable to the case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">It is clear from reading the entire charge, as we must; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>9 Conn. App. 275, 279, 518 A.2d 658 (1986); that the court used the term \u201csimple negligence\u201d solely as a label for the concept of negligence involving breach of a duty, either the common law duty of reasonable care or the breach of a statutory duty. This was a case involving thirteen days of trial, thirty-five witnesses, over 100 full exhibits, much circumstantial evidence as to the cause of the accident which resulted in seven deaths, and yielding over 1700 pages of transcript. It stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point that the jury was misled by this term, which the court clearly used as a label for a thoroughly explained concept, into thinking that their function was reduced to anything easy, mere or uncomplicated. The defendant\u2019s claim is a classic case of hypertechnical dissection of the charge, which we do not countenance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>8 Conn. App. 620, 630, 514 A.2d 345 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The State\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The state challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that double jeopardy principles prevent imposing more than one sentence upon the defendant after his conviction on seven counts involving the deaths of seven persons. We agree with the state, and remand the case for imposition of new sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s argument that this appeal is moot because the court, in imposing the sentence, stated that even if it had determined that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>permitted to impose multiple sentences it would have imposed the same total effective sentence, namely, incarceration for six months and a total fine of $1000. The defendant argues from this that the state\u2019s appeal is moot because no practical relief can flow even if its appeal is successful. <em>Doyon </em>v. <em>South Windsor, </em>1 Conn. App. 417, 419, 472 A.2d 361, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 801, 474 A2d 1259 (1984). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">It is well established that, from a defendant\u2019s standpoint, multiple convictions yielding concurrent sentences do not result in mootness, because they also yield significant collateral consequences beyond the time spent in incarceration. <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 103, 112, 513 A.2d 132 (1986). The state\u2019s interests in securing convictions of the guilty also go beyond the factors of incarceration and a fine. They include the vindication of the law which has been violated; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hansen, 8 </em>Conn. App. 26, 29, 510 A.2d 465 (1986); and the sense of redress for the victims of that violation. See, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7 919 (2) and General Statutes \u00a7 54-91c (b), which give victims the right to address the court upon the imposition of sentence. Furthermore, we believe that just as the defendant is entitled to appeal in order to shed himself of improper collateral consequences of a conviction, the state is entitled to appeal where appropriate in order to impose proper collateral consequences. We therefore turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a \u201cMotion for Ruling Re: The Court\u2019s Power To Sentence Consecutively,\u201d in which he requested the court to rule \u201c[wjhether double jeopardy permits more than one sentence for Misconduct with a Motor Vehicle in this case and, if so, whether the sentences can be consecutive or must be concurrent?\u201d The court ruled that double jeopardy principles required that a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57 resulting in the death of multiple vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>tims constitutes a single violation of the statute and, in a further articulation of its decision, that in the event of a conviction there will be but one sentence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After the trial, the court maintained this view as applied to his conviction under General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a and imposed a single sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling, and the state\u2019s claim of error, implicate \u201cthe protection afforded by . . . [the double jeopardy] provision against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). \u2018With respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u2019 <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d (1983). . . . [T]he issue, though essentially constitutional, becomes one of statutory construction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 109, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). Our inquiry, \u201cwhen a defendant is convicted of multiple violations of the <em>same </em>statutory provision is whether the legislature intended to punish the individual acts separately or to punish only the course of action which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>constitute. <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 337, 101 S. Ct. 1137, 67 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1981); <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 691, 100 S. Ct. 1432, 63 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1980).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>198 Conn. 111, 121, 502 A.2d 374 (1985). We conclude, on the basis of the statutory language of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, that the legislative intent was to punish the individual acts separately. Therefore, there may be as many violations of the statute as there are victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a provides for imprisonment or a f\u00edne or both for \u201c[a]ny person who, in consequence of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle, causes the death of <em>another person </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) For purposes of double jeopardy analysis, this language falls squarely within the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). In that case, our Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err in sentencing the defendant, who had been convicted of three counts of felony murder arising out of the same course of action, to three consecutive terms of imprisonment based on the fact that there were three victims. The court stated: \u201cThe statute refers to the death of \u2018[another] person\u2019 in the singular. A fundamental purpose of the criminal law is to protect individual citizens from the criminal conduct of another. People are neither fungible nor amorphous. Where crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been invaded for each violation. Therefore, when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d Id., 565-66; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 109-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The defendant argues that the reasoning underlying the <em>Couture </em>decision, namely, to protect \u201ccitizens from the criminal conduct of another\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>supra; does not apply to this motor vehicle violation. We disagree. Even though negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is not a \u201ccrime\u201d; see Part A of this opinion; it is nonetheless a transgression of a very serious nature, imposing punishment for wrongful conduct resulting in the loss of human life. We conclude, on the basis of the language of the statute, that it predicates guilt upon the combination of the conduct which causes a motor vehicle accident and the fatal consequence of that accident. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 426, 430, 450 A.2d 857 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The repeal of the penal code version of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle and its reenactment as a motor vehicle violation does not change this result. The legislative history makes clear that with the movement of the statute to title 14, \u201c[t]he penalties do not change. Nothing changes in the existing law . . . The penalties remain the same . . . .\u201d24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1981 Sess., p. 885, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano. We conclude, therefore, that by proscribing conduct which leads to the death of \u201canother person,\u201d the legislature intended to punish the \u201cindividual acts\u201d of causing death separately rather than \u201cthe course of action which they constitute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>supra, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The conclusion that a vehicular homicide resulting in multiple deaths yields multiple sentences is in accord with the great weight of authority in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>3 Ariz.

He points out that under the penal code, \u201cperson\u201d is defined as \u201ca human being\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (1); whereas General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (1) defines \u201cperson,\u201d for purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a, by reference to General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (41). That statute, in turn, defines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201cany <em>individual, </em>corporation, association, copartnership, company, firm <em>or other aggregation of individuals </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) From this he argues that General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a is not <em>dearly </em>aimed at the protection of individual lives from negligent vehicular operation but is ambiguous. Therefore, he claims, the rule of lenity, as articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>supra, requires that \u201cthe issue should be resolved in favor of lenity and against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\u201d Id., 122. We reject this argument because the statutory definition on which the defendant relies was not in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case. The statutory reference, in General Statutes \u00a7 14-212, to the definitions contained in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1, was not present in 1983, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>when the accident in this case occurred. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 14-212 did not define \u201cperson\u201d at all. It was not until 1984 that the legislature incorporated into General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 the definitions contained in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>We also note that, unlike the present case, <em>Rawls, </em>which was a drug possession case, did not involve harm to or the death of a person.

He was not required, as the state suggests, to repeat the claim when the court, in response to specific questions from the jury regarding the meaning of negligence, repeated its instructions on that meaning. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em>3 Conn.

The court in that case read the phrase, \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d to incorporate the definition of \u201cviolation,\u201d and reasoned that \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d meant an offense involving the use of a motor vehicle which was punishable only by a fine. Id., 530. We, as a constitutional intermediate appellate court; see <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>4 Conn.

App. 426, 430, 519 A.2d 612 (1987). More importantly, however, we believe that its reasoning unduly disregards the statutory analysis which builds on the term \u201coffense,\u201d and unduly disregards the import of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (b). We, therefore, decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We also recognize that the commentary to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (b) is less than a model of clarity and contributes to the confusion of whether a motor vehicle violation is an \u201coffense.\u201d See Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes. The first three sentences of the commentary point toward the conclusion that a motor vehicle violation is not an \u201coffense.\u201d The fourth sentence lends some support to the contrary conclusion, namely, that it is an \u201coffense.\" In this instance, we hesitate to draw any firm inferences as to legislative intent from this Delphic commentary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> We do not suggest that a motor vehicle violation cannot be treated as a criminal offense for purposes of the procedures which must be followed for prosecution thereof.

Although the rules of criminal procedure do not specifically state that the requisite burden of proof for a motor vehicle violation is the traditional criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable-doubt, that is implicit in the rules, particularly in the definition of \u201cTrial\u201d as \u201cthat judicial proceeding at which the <em>guilt or innocence </em>of the defendant to the offense or offenses charged is to be determined.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, on its enactment, provided for a maximum penalty of a fine of $250 or thirty days imprisonment, or both. In the 1949 revision of the General Statutes, this law was recodified with the motor vehicle statutes as \u00a7 2415. The maximum penalty was thereafter increased to a fine of $500 or six months imprisonment, or both. Public Acts 1949, No. 131.

The term \u2018crime\u2019 comprises felonies and misdemeanors.

The concept of a \u2018violation,\u2019 which is taken from the Model Penal Code, is new. . . . It is a new category of noncriminal offense . . . .\u201d Id., p. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Model Penal Code defines a violation in \u00a7 1.04 (5) in these terms: \u201cAn offense defined by this Code or by any other statute of this State constitutes a violation if it is so designated in this Code or in the law defining the offense or if no other sentence than a fine, or fine and forfeiture or other civil penalty is authorized upon conviction or if it is defined by a statute other than this Code that now provides that the offense shall not constitute a crime. A violation does not constitute a crime and conviction of a violation shall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a criminal offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">It is clear that a distinction must be made between the statutory categorization or classification of a transgression of the law as a \u201cviolation,\u201d and the general definition of any transgression of the law as a \u201cviolation of that law.\u201d The majority opinion has failed to make this refinement of the two uses of the word \u201cviolation.\u201d In the context of a criminal prosecution, by definition, the accused is always charged with the \u201cviolation of a law.\u201d The same holds true in the prosecution under motor vehicle statutes; by definition, the defendant is charged with the \u201cviolation of a motor vehicle law.\u201d In either case, the categorization or classification of the breach of any law, penal or motor vehicle, as a \u201cviolation\u201d is determined by the maximum penalty autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>rized by the legislature, i.e., the imposition of a fine only. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-27.

The purpose of this provision is to except from the operation of the Code, except as provided in subsection (b), motor vehicle infractions. Subsection (b), however, provides that the sentencing principles enumerated in sections 53a-28 to 53a-44, inclusive, should apply to motor vehicle violations. <em>Thus, a motor vehicle violator would have the limits of his sentence determined by the motor vehicle section, since his \u2018offense\u2019 would be an \u2018unclassified misdemeanor\u2019 within the meaning of section 53a-26 (c); but he would be sentenced under the principles and procedures of sections 53a-28 to 53a-JpU. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)

It provides for four categories of misdemeanors: A, B, C and unclassified. Sections 53a-36 and 53a-42 give the authorized penalties therefor. The concept of \u2018unclassified misdemeanor\u2019 is analogous to the \u2018unclassified felony\u2019 explained immediately above.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, supra, p. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Relating back to the commission\u2019s reference to its explanation of an \u201cunclassified felony,\u201d I find the following analysis in its comment to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-25: \u201cThe concept of an \u2018unclassified felony\u2019 like that of \u2018unclassified misdemeanor\u2019 referred to in section 53a-26, is meant to refer to the virtually hundreds of criminal offenses which will continue to exist outside the Code but which will be subject to sections 53a-28 to 53a-47 for sentencing.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The classification of a transgression of the law as a \u201cviolation\u201d in \u00a7 53a-24 of the penal code is further specifically defined in \u00a7 53a-27 thereof as follows: \u201c(a) An offense, for which the only sentence authorized is a fine, is a violation unless expressly designated an infraction, (b) Every violation defined in this chapter is expressly designated as such. Any offense defined in any other section which is not expressly designated a violation or infraction shall be deemed a violation if, notwithstanding any other express designation, it is within the definition set forth in subsection (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">At the time of the adoption of the penal code in 1969, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, then codified as \u00a7 14-218 of the motor vehicle laws, was manifestly a misdemeanor providing for a fine of $500 or imprisonment of six months, or both. By virtue of the classification of misdemeanors in \u00a7 53a-25, it thereafter became an \u201cunclassified misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The penal code was enacted in 1969, to become effective on October 1, 1971. Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7 215. In its session of 1971, the legislature undertook to refine this pending general revision of the criminal laws by adopting legislation deemed necessary or desirable to implement before its effective date. One such measure was the repeal of General Statutes (Rev. to 1966) \u00a7 14-218, the motor vehicle negligent homicide law; Public Acts 1971, No. 30; but this was done through a misunderstanding of the scope of \u00a7 53a-57 of the penal code, entitled, \u201cMisconduct with a motor vehicle: class D felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">House Bill No. 7660, Session of 1971, entitled, \u201cAn Act Concerning the Extension of Negligent Homicide to Private Parking Areas\u201d was introduced in the legislature for its stated purpose. Thereafter, a substitute bill was approved favorably by the joint standing committee on the judiciary. The substitute bill, repealing \u00a7 14-218, was approved by the General Assembly. Public Acts 1971, No. 30. At the debate on this measure, the House chairman of the judiciary committee supported passage with this explanation: \u201cThe bill, as submitted, was entitled An Act Concerning the Extension of Negligent Homicide to Private Parking Areas, and it amended Sec. 14-218. The committee considered the proposition and felt that it was a good proposition to be passed. Upon further investigation with the Legislative Commissioner\u2019s office we found that Section 53a-57 of the Criminal Code will go into effect October 1st. That is entitled Misconduct With a Motor Vehicle and really is a new negligent homicide statute, which statute is broad enough to include private parking areas. Upon further investigation we found that Section 14-218 had not been repealed and would thus have caused a conflict with the new [section] 53a-57. As a result, the bill before us repeals [section] 14-218 so as to avoid such conflict.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2,1971 Sess., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>p. 698, remarks of Representative John A. Carrozzella. Similar remarks were made by the Senate chairman of the committee. \u201cMr. President, this bill simply rescinds Sec. 14-218 of the General Statutes. Two years ago when we passed the penal code-in the repealer section it was inadvertently left out. So on Oct. 1, the new penal code will take effect and at the same time this will remain in effect until Oct. 1, this is Sec. 14-218. So I urge its passage.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 2,1971 Sess., p. 713, remarks of Senator Jay W. Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The enactment of Public Acts 1971, No. 30, effectively removed negligent homicide with a motor vehicle from our statutes. This void, however, was corrected by the General Assembly two years later when it reenacted the negligent homicide law along with other amendments to the penal code. Public Acts 1973, No. 73-639, \u00a7 5. In its new form, it now extended to private parking areas by its modified terms and specifically classified a violation of the law for purposes of punishment as a misdemeanor. Codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-58a, it provided: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle when in consequence of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle he causes the death of another person, (b) Negligent homicide is a class B misdemeanor.\u201d As a class B misdemeanor, the maximum fine previously specified in General Statutes \u00a7 14-218 was increased to $1000. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-42 (1). The maximum imprisonment remained at six months. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-36 (2). The negligent homicide with a motor vehicle law continued in this form until 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-5), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 527, 416 A.2d 168 (1980), the former Appellate Session of the Superior Court had before it the determination of the nature of the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a of the motor vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>cle laws. After finding that the felony, misdemeanor, and violation definitions of the penal code apply also to charges based upon sections of the General Statutes not included in the code, the court \u201cconcluded that the term \u2018motor vehicle violations,\u2019 not being otherwise defined, incorporates the definition of \u2018violation\u2019 contained in \u00a7 53a-27 (a) as an offense punishable only by a fine. The comment of the draftsmen of the penal code upon \u00a7 53a-24 (a) states that \u2018 \u201c[violation,\u201d which must be read in connection with section 53a-27, means an offense calling only for a fine for breach thereof.\u2019 27A Connecticut General Statutes, Annotated (West Ed.), commission comment (1971). Our view is consistent with this comment. The exception of \u2018motor vehicle violations\u2019 from the definition of \u2018offense\u2019 is limited to breaches of statutes involving motor vehicles when the only penalty which can be imposed is a fine. Operating under the influence as prohibited by \u00a7 14-227a does not fall within the exception because it is not punishable as a \u2018violation\u2019 defined by \u00a7 53a-27, but as an \u2018unclassified misdemeanor\u2019 under \u00a7 53a-26 (c). Since it is a misdemeanor, it is also a \u2018crime\u2019 as defined by \u00a7 53a-24 (a).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-5), </em>supra, 530-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In that case, the state had unsuccessfully claimed that operating under the influence of liquor was not a crime because it fell within the \u201cmotor vehicle violation\u201d exception to the definition of \u201coffense\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 of the penal code. The court\u2019s reply to that contention was as follows: \u201cThe thrust of this argument would seem to apply to a number of other statutes prohibiting certain acts with a motor vehicle which have usually been regarded as criminal, such as misconduct with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57 or negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58a.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-5), </em>supra, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-5), </em>supra, the trial court had concluded that it had no jurisdiction to grant the defendant\u2019s application for accelerated rehabilitation because the underlying charge did not constitute a \u201ccrime.\u201d Therefore, the defendant did not qualify for such pretrial relief which is available under General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 54-76p only to \u201cpersons accused of a crime, not of a serious nature.\u201d The Appellate Session found error in that ruling. Since it held that operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a was a \u201ccrime,\u201d the defendant was eligible for such discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In the following session of the legislature, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was transferred from its then location in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58a of the penal code to its present position in \u00a7 14-222a of the motor vehicle laws, title 14. This was effected by the enactment of Public Acts 1981, No. 81-26, which provided: \u201cSection 1. Any person who, in consequence of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle, causes the death of another person shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Sec. 2. Section 53a-58a of the general statutes is repealed.\u201d The expressed purpose of the bill at its adoption was, as noted by the majority opinion, \u201c[t]o classify negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle violation rather than a criminal offense in the penal code.\u201d House Bill No. 5079 (1981). The purpose of this legislation was explained in the two chambers of the legislature. In the House proceedings, Representative Richard D. Tulisano remarked as follows: \u201cMr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to move from the criminal statutes of the Motor Vehicle statutes a legislation known as negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. . . . What it recognizes is that an act of simple negligence, nothing to do with criminal negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>gence, nothing to do with intent, nothing to do with drinking, is really what is known as [malum prohibitum] rather than [malum in se]. In effect, [it recognizes] that in our criminal statutes there should be some form of intent to incur criminal responsibility. Criminal negligence, recklessness, includes in the definition in our criminal statutes some form of intent. There is a divided issue as to whether or not this statute is constitutional. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\u201cRecognizing, however, that simple negligence, in itself, should incur some repercussion to the operator, by moving it over to the motor vehicle statutes section of our statutes, we insure that we do not run a constitutional problem with it not requiring what is known as the mens rea, that is the intent to commit a crime, and becomes just as something that is prohibited on its face. The penalties do not change. Nothing changes in the existing law, but its intent is to make sure that this conduct will not be declared unconstitutional. The penalties remain the same, but it\u2019s putting in of [title] 14 of our General Statutes. I might point out that when this bill was first enacted and for many years it was in fact situated and at one point it was repealed and they reenacted it. They put it in [title] 53a and that\u2019s inexplainable to me. But I think that\u2019s where it belongs so we can keep it on the books.\u201d 24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1981 Sess., pp. 884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In answer to the question whether a person accused of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle as reenacted under the bill in title 14, the motor vehicle laws, would be able to take advantage of the pretrial accelerated rehabilitation program, Representative Tulisano replied: \u201cThere is an Appellate Session decision which indicates any time there is, in fact, a potential penalty for prison, imprisonment, so that we could have drunken driving statutes as well as this statute, even though they are in the motor vehicle section of our statutes, acceler<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ated rehabilitation may be available even though it is not a \u2018crime\u2019 in which a mens rea is required.\u201d Id., p. 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In the Senate Proceedings, a more pointed purpose was expressed, as noted by the majority opinion, in the following remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr.: \u201cThe Bill itself, under existing law, a person who causes the death of another person by negligently operating a motor vehicle, may be fined up to $1,000 or imprisoned up to six months or both. This Bill would change the classification of the offense from a Class B misdemeanor to a motor vehicle violation. . . . [Tjhis should be classified as a motor vehicle violation and in fact, not a criminal offense and this is the purpose of the statute.\u201d 24 S. Pr\u00f3c., Pt. 3,1981 Sess., pp. 707-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The legislature to this time has failed to define \u201ca motor vehicle violation\u201d within the context of the exception to \u00a7 53a-24 of the penal code, and the reenactment of \u00a7 14-222a as a motor vehicle law did not expressly classify the law as a \u201cmotor vehicle violation.\u201d The transfer of the negligent homicide with a motor vehicle statute from title 53a, named \u201cPenal Code,\u201d to title 14, named \u201cMotor Vehicles. Use of the Highway by Vehicles. Gasoline.\u201d did not effect any change in the nature or classification of the law other than to change it from a class B misdemeanor to an unclassified misdemeanor under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-26. \u201cWe must look at [\u00a7 14-222a] as drafted, not at its purported aim. \u2018 \u201c[I]n the interpretation of statutes, the intent of the legislature is to be found not in what it meant to say, but in what it did say.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 222, 479 A.2d 814 (1984). \u201c \u2018 \u201cA legislative intention not expressed in some appropriate manner has no legal existence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id.; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57-58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). The transfer of a law from one title or chapter of the general statutes to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>title or chapter without any change in the provisions in the statute, or exclusion of purpose in the law, is an unexpressed statement of any legislative intention for the move. By itself, the relocation of a statute in the codification of statutes without a textual change in its provisions neither adds nor subtracts from its meaning, effect or application.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Title 14 contains other laws that are defined and classified as offenses and crimes under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24. These include both unclassified felonies; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-25; and unclassified misdemeanors. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-26. \u201cOperating under the influence of liquor, or \u2018drunken driving\u2019 in ordinary parlance, has been commonly regarded as a \u2018crime\u2019 in the general sense of that term. It is punishable under \u00a7 14-227a (e) by a fine or imprisonment or both for a first offense, and subsequent convictions carry mandatory jail terms. In our cases, it has been consistently referred to as a crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Englehart, </em>158 Conn. 117, 119, 256 A.2d 231 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCoster, </em>147 Conn. 502, 503, 162 A.2d 704 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>129 Conn. 483, 484, 29 A.2d 582 (1942).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-5), </em>supra, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">A review of title 14 discloses many provisions carrying penalties beyond the scope of a \u201cviolation,\u201d defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-27 (a) as \u201c[a]n offense, for which the only sentence authorized is a fine . . . unless expressly designated an infraction.\u201d Any person who violates \u00a7 14-16 (a) relating to the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle \u201cshall be subject to the penalty provided for false statement.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-16 (g). \u201cFalse statement is a class A misdemeanor\u201d exacting a fine of not more than $1000 or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both.

These are specified in \u00a7 14-196, as follows: \u201c(a) A person who, with fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>lent intent: (1) Alters, forges or counterfeits a certificate of title; (2) alters or forges an assignment of a certificate of title, or an assignment or release of a security interest, on a certificate of title or a form the commissioner prescribes; (3) has possession of or uses a certificate of title knowing it to have been altered, forged or counterfeited; or (4) uses a false or fictitious name or address, or makes a material false statement, or fails to disclose a security interest, or conceals any other material fact, in an application for a certificate of title, shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars or more than one thousand dollars or be imprisoned not less than one year or more than five years or be both fined and imprisoned, (b) A person who: (1) With fraudulent intent, permits another, not entitled thereto, to use or have possession of a certificate of title; (2) wilfully fails to mail or deliver a certificate of title or application therefor to the commissioner within ten days after the time required by this chapter; (3) wilfully fails to deliver to his transferee a certificate of title within ten days after the time required by this chapter; or (4) wilfully violates any provision of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (a), shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than two years or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The severity of these provisions is intensified by \u00a7 14-200, which states: \u201cThe penal provisions of this chapter in no way repeal or modify any existing provision of criminal law but are additional and supplementary thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Chapter 248, entitled \u201cVehicle Highway Use,\u201d contains the most commonly cited penal provisions of title 14, including \u00a7 14-222a, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, under consideration here. The operation of a motor vehicle after the vehicle\u2019s registration or the operator\u2019s license has been refused, suspended or revoked subjects the operator to a fine of not less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>$150 nor more than $200 or imprisonment of not more than ninety days, or both. For a subsequent conviction, the fine shall be not less than $200 nor more than $600 and imprisonment shall be for not more than one year. General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (b). If, however, the operator\u2019s license was suspended for any one of these violations: operation while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug (General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a [a]); refusal to submit to a blood, breath or urine test (General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b [d] or [f|); manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated (General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56b); or assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated (General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60d); the operator, upon conviction, shall be fined not less than $500 nor more than $1000 <em>and </em>imprisoned not more than one year, \u201cthirty days of which may not be suspended or reduced in any manner.\u201d Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, amending General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">A subsequent conviction of reckless driving in violation of \u00a7 14-222 increases the penalty to a fine of up to $600 and imprisonment of not more than one year, or both.

An operator who evades responsibility after an accident which causes serious physical injury, to or results in the death of another person may be fined not more than $5000 or be imprisoned not less than one year nor more than five years, or both. General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (d). \u201cSerious physical injury\u201d is defined in \u00a7 53a-3 of the penal code.

Their range of possible imprisonment extends from one year to five years, the equivalent terms for class A misdemeanors and class D felonies. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a; 53a-36. Many other motor vehicle laws provide for lesser terms of imprisonment, such as six months for a violation \u00a7 14-222a, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. Such penalties are equivalent to those provided for class B and class C misdemeanors. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-36.
