We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"A4f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>After the court began hearing evidence, the defendant, who never claimed indigency, requested blood tests and \u201ctime to seek a lawyer.\u201d Both motions were denied as untimely. The matter had previously been continued when the defendant, though in the courtroom when the case was called on its originally scheduled trial date, failed to make his presence known either to the court or to the plaintiffs counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-168 provides that the court \u201cmay\u201d order blood tests upon motion by any party. Thus, the order is discretionary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While an indigent defendant in a state-supported paternity suit has a right to court-appointed counsel; see <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>196 Conn. 403, 493 A.2d 213 (1985); this does not mean that a nonindigent defendant has the right to halt a trial midway through the evidence in order to \u201cseek a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">After carefully reviewing the transcript and record in this case, we find there is no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\"> In <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 2202, 68 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1981); the United States Supreme Court upheld the right to a blood test only where the basis for a denial of a request for the test was the putative father\u2019s inability to pay for it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
