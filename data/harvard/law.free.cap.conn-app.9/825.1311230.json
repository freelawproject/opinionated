On appeal, he claims that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the presence of attorneys in the General Assembly violates the dual office ban of the constitution of Connecticut, article third, \u00a7 ll,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby rendering null and void all statutes enacted since 1958, including that under which he was charged and those statutes reorganizing the court system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that, because of their status as commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>sioners of the Superior Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> attorneys are precluded by law from serving in the General Assembly and therefore any General Assembly whose membership includes attorneys can pass no valid law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\">An attorney\u2019s designation as a commissioner of the Superior Court in and of itself does not constitute an \u201coffice\u201d or \u201cappointive position\u201d as those terms have been defined by our Supreme Court, so as to disqualify him or her from serving in the legislature. See <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 198, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985); <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>175 Conn. 586, 594, 402 A.2d 763 (1978), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>454 U.S. 958, 102 S. Ct. 496, 70 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1981); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>164 Conn. 247, 251, 320 A.2d 820, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1043, 94 S. Ct. 548, 38 L.

On the basis of the foregoing authority, the court did not err in refusing the defendant\u2019s request to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">There is no erroi.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\"> Article third, \u00a7 11 of the Connecticut Constitution provides: \u201cNo member of the general assembly shall, during the term for which he is elected, hold or accept any appointive position or office in the judicial or executive department of the state government, or in the courts of the political subdivisions of the state, or in the government of any county.
