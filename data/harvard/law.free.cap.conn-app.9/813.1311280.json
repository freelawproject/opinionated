The court also concluded, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, that a waiver of the one year requirement was necessary to promote the best interests of the child. See General Statutes \u00a7 45-61f (g). The mother appealed. We have fully reviewed her claims to the extent possible, considering the record filed on appeal with this court, and find those claims to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
