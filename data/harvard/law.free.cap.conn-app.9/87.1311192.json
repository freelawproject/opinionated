The agreement provided that the plaintiffs would receive one third of the profit on any such sale. The case was referred to an attorney trial referee pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">After trial, the referee filed a memorandum of decision, including a finding of facts, which awarded damages to the plaintiffs. This appeal concerns the disallowance of certain deductions taken by the defendant from the \u201cprofit\u201d on the sale of the partnership assets. The referee\u2019s memorandum of opinion and findings pf fact were subsequently corrected and amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>pursuant to motions filed by both the plaintiffs and the defendant, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 438. As a result, the defendant\u2019s debt to the plaintiffs was increased. The trial court rendered judgment accepting the referee\u2019s amended report. No objections or exceptions were filed by the defendant as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the following conclusion and finding of fact of the referee: (1) that General Statutes \u00a7 20-325a (b) prevented the defendant and his son from recovering commissions on the sale of the assets; and (2) that certain expenditures were for the \u201coperation of\u201d rather than for the \u201cmaintenance, improvement or sale of\u201d the property, as required by the agreement. The defendant claims that this conclusion and this finding were incorrect. He asserts, therefore, that the disallowances based on them are improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Proceedings before attorney referees are governed by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 434 through 444. We have characterized the effect of an appellant\u2019s failure to follow Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 440 and 441 as follows: \u201cHaving filed no motion to correct . . . the defendant has waived any right to attack the subordinate factual findings in the report.\u201d <em>Ruhl </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>5 Conn. App. 104, 106, 496 A.2d 994 (1985); see also <em>Blessings Corporation </em>v. <em>Carolton Chronic &amp; Convalescent Hospital, Inc., </em>7 Conn. App. 364, 367, 508 A.2d 829 (1986). While here the defendant filed a motion to correct the referee\u2019s report, he failed to file an objection to its acceptance by the trial court. Such a failure was deemed fatal in <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 518, 508 A.2d 415 (1986), where the Supreme Court held that the defendant was \u201cprecluded from effective appellate review by its failure to file a motion to correct the report of the referee pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438 <em>or an objection to acceptance thereof pursuant to Prac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>tice Book </em>\u00a7 <em>UUO.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Killingworth, </em>152 Conn. 237, 243, 206 A.2d 114 (1964), \u201c[t]he defendants filed no exceptions to the acceptance of the report by the court in accordance with Practice Book [\u00a7 440] and therefore the conclusion [had to] stand.\u201d <em>\u201cA </em>litigant cannot wholly ignore established procedures for the protection of its rights, as this defendant has done, and hope to receive on appeal the same treatment accorded to those who follow the rules of practice.\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The defendant and the plaintiffs timely filed motions to correct the referee\u2019s report. Such corrections were adopted by the referee in the amended report. The defendant failed, however, to object to the court\u2019s acceptance of the amended report which he now disputes on appeal. Thus, the defendant did not avail himself of the procedures provided by the Practice Book, and has therefore waived the right to attack the subordinate factual findings and conclusions of law of the referee\u2019s report. <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Ruhl </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra. Absent an objection to the report, this court\u2019s review is limited \u201cto determining whether the subordinate facts found by the attorney referee were sufficient to support the referee\u2019s ultimate factual conclusions.\u201d <em>Blessings Corporations. Carolton Chronic &amp; Convalescent Hospital, Inc., </em>supra. We conclude that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
