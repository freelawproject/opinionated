The defendant failed, however, to supply this court with a transcript. We therefore have no basis on which to disturb these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error, namely, that the plaintiff did not consent to a hearing by an attorney referee, is disposed of by <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 516-17, 508 A.2d 415 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
