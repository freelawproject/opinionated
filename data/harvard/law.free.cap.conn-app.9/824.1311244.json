The trial court made detailed factual findings in an oral memorandum of decision. The court correctly applied pertinent contract law to the facts found. The court\u2019s judgment credited the testimony of the plaintiff and found in favor of it and adverse to the special defenses and counterclaim of the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant has shown no good reason as to why we should abandon the long standing and salutory rule of appellate practice that we do not retry the facts. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>1 Conn.
