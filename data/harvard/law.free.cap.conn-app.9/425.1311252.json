The plaintiff is the wife of a deceased employee of the defendant. The commissioner found that the plaintiff had given proper notice of her claim pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-294.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the defendant claims that the notice given by the plaintiff was insufficient, a review of the documents and the letters sent by the plaintiff to the defendant and the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>missioner indicates that adequate statutory notice was given. The defendant failed to file a notice to contest the claim of the plaintiff within twenty days as required by General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant has appealed from the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Since the defendant did not comply with General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), compensability of the claim was conceded. <em>LaVogue </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, Inc., </em>9 Conn. App. 91, 93, 516 A.2d (1986); <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Quality Bakers of America, </em>2 Conn. App. 363, 372-74, 479 A.2d 820, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 804, 482 A.2d 709 (1984).
