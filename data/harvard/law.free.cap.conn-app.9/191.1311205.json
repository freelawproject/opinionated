The plaintiff appeals from the judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In a two sentence memorandum of decision, the trial court held as follows: \u201cAfter a trial on the merits, the Court finds that the Plaintiff is unreasonably withholding its consent to the alterations made in the fall of 1980 and, therefore, the Court does not find a breach of the terms of the lease. Judgment may enter for the Defendant.\u201d The plaintiff claims that the court erred in (1) finding that it unreasonably withheld consent to the erection of the structure, and (2) failing to find that defendant\u2019s construction on the leased premises was a breach of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The court, in its memorandum of decision, provided no factual basis for its finding on the issues of consent and breach of the lease; nor did the plaintiff seek under Practice Book \u00a7 3082<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to have the court articulate its decision further to establish the factual basis of its decision. <em>See Pointina Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>1 Conn. App. 341, 343, 471 A.2d 970 (1984). It is the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>responsibility, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3060D,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to provide an adequate appellate record. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>2 Conn. App. 380, 383, 478 A.2d 1046 (1984); <em>Pointina Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>supra. \u201cOrdinarily we do not \u2018 \u201cresort to matters extraneous to the formal record, to facts which have not been found and which are not admitted in the pleadings or exhibits which are not part of the record.\u201d \u2019 <em>Grunschlag </em>v. <em>Ethel Walker School, Inc., </em>189 Conn. 316, 320, 455 A.2d 1332 (1983). References in the \u2018statement of facts\u2019 in the brief or references to testimony in the transcript, even if uncontradicted, do not constitute facts in the case. Where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is unclear, \u2018proper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal. \u201cIt remains the appellant\u2019s responsibility to secure an adequate appellate record, and under normal circumstances we will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the appellant should have remedied.\u201d \u2019 <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 494, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983).\u201d <em>Pointina Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>supra, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Without benefit of factual detail, the record furnishes no basis for us to conclude that the trial court erred in its findings of fact or conclusions of law. See <em>Jazlowiecki </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>4 Conn. App. 76, 76-77, 492 A.2d 516 (1985). Nor under these circumstances will we remand the decision for articulation. <em>Pointina Beach Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>supra, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> Since the plaintiff\u2019s brief was filed prior to the rules change effective October 1, 1986, the prior rules apply. We note, however, that Practice Book \u00a7 4051, effective October 1,1986, is virtually identical to Practice Book \u00a7 3082.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> See footnote 1, supra. The language of Practice Book \u00a7 4061, effective October 1,1986, regarding the plaintiffs responsibility to provide an adequate record for review is identical to prior Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
