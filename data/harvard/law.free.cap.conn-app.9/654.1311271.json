The sole issue is whether the trial court, after granting the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the complaint, may refuse to permit the filing of a substitute complaint within fifteen days, and then render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On or about May 15,1985, the plaintiff filed a revised complaint against the defendants alleging interference with his restaurant business, by renovation work being done by the named defendant. The defendants filed a motion to strike the revised complaint and an accompanying memorandum of law as required by Practice Book \u00a7 155.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The plaintiff failed to file a memorandum of law objecting to the granting of this motion as required by Practice Book \u00a7 155. Thus, the plaintiff was \u201cdeemed by the court to have consented to the granting of the motion.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 155. The revised complaint was stricken in its entirety on September 16,1985. On September 26,1985, the plaintiff requested leave to file a substitute complaint, adding a count claiming breach of lease by the defendants. Simultaneously, the plaintiff filed a substitute complaint. An objection to the request was filed by the defendants and sustained on November 19,1985. Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants on January 27, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In this situation, we look to Practice Book \u00a7 157 which provides: \u201cWithin fifteen days after the granting of any motion to strike, the party whose pleading has been stricken may file a new pleading; provided that in those instances where an entire complaint . . . has been stricken, and the party whose pleading has been so stricken fails to file a new pleading within that fifteen-day period, the court may upon motion enter judgment against said party on said stricken complaint . . . .\u2019\u2019In this case, the plaintiff filed a substitute complaint ten days after the previous complaint was stricken; thus, he complied with \u00a7 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to permit the filing of the substitute complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 155 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEach motion to strike must be accompanied by an appropriate memorandum of law citing the legal authorities upon which the motion relies. ... An adverse party who fails timely to file such a memorandum pursuant to this section shall be deemed by the court to have consented to the granting of the motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
