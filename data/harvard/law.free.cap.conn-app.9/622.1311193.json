Gillies, insurance commissioner. The commissioner suspended the insurance licenses issued by the defendant insurance department to the plaintiffs and imposed fines on the plaintiffs for unlawfully conducting insurance business in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-60<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 38-264,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and for engaging in business with an insurance company not authorized to do business in Connecticut in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 38-70.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in finding that the defendants had not adopted written rules of procedure governing hearings as required by \u00a7 4-167 (a) (2)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Administrative proceedings against the plaintiffs were commenced by service of an amended notice of hearing. The first paragraph of the notice informed the plaintiffs that \u201c[t]he hearing will be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the UAPA (Chapter 54, C.G.S.).\u201d After a hearing, the plaintiffs were found in violation of various sections of the General Statutes. The insurance commissioner accepted and adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thereafter, the plaintiffs were fined $4100 and their insurance licenses were suspended for three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court on four grounds. The court held that because the defendant insurance department failed to adopt as a regulation written rules of procedure governing its hearings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>required by \u00a7 4-167 (a) (2), it was \u201cwithout authority to take administrative action on their charges against the plaintiffs.\u201d The trial court sustained the appeal on this ground alone and deemed it unnecessary to reach the other claimed errors. This appeal by the defendants followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">A \u201cregulation\u201d is statutorily defined as an \u201cagency statement of general applicability, without regard to its designation, that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (7). The defendants maintain that \u00a7 38-4-8 of its regulations, which was in effect at the time of the hearing, was a regulation providing adequate \u201crules of practice setting forth the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available\u201d as required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-167 (a) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 38-4-8, at the time of the hearing, provided: \u201cAll hearings conducted in the insurance department are conducted in accordance with the requirements of and procedures suggested in Public Act 854 of the 1971 session of the General Assembly, Sections 12 through 17 inclusive, as the same may be amended from time to time. Conferences, interviews and formal hearings conducted or held as a part of the administrative processes of the insurance department are <em>conducted on an informal basis, in accordance with standards designed to meet the purposes to be accomplished by the proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-4-8. \u201cWhether administrative action is a regulation does not depend on the label the agency attaches to it or on the procedure giving rise to it .... \u2018The test is, rather, whether \u201ca rule has a substantial impact on the rights and obligations of parties who may appear before the agency in the future.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(Citation omitted.) <em>Eagle Hill Corporation </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>2 Conn. App. 68, 76, 477 A.2d 660 (1984). When a rule passed by an agency has this impact it must comply with the notice and hearing requirements of the UAPA. <em>Cheshire Convalescent Center </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>34 Conn. Sup. 225, 239, 386 A.2d 264 (1977). Thus, the pivotal issue is whether the rule passed by the insurance department in this case had a \u201csubstantial impact on the rights and obligations\u201d of parties appearing before the insurance commissioner. The test to be applied in determining whether an administrative action was in fact a regulation, is to examine what the agency actually did in a particular case and how it did it. Id.; see also <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>177 Conn. 356, 362, 417 A.2d 358 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">An administrative agency can act only within the bounds of authority granted to it by its enabling statute and within constitutional limitations. It is wholly without power to modify, dilute or change in any way the statutory provisions from which it derives its authority <em>unless </em>the state clearly and expressly grants it that power. <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971). Although an administrative agency has the statutory power, indeed the obligation, to promulgate rules and regulations, it does not make law. Its rulemaking power extends only to the point of effecting the legislative will as expressed by statute. The UAPA provides uniform rules which guide agencies in the proper execution of their delegated duties. <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">This principle is grounded in common sense and simple concepts of fairness. \u201c \u2018The objective is . . . the promulgation . . . of a code governing action and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>duct in the particular field of regulation so those concerned may know in advance all the rules of the game, so to speak, and may act with reasonable assurance. . . . Persons subject to regulation are entitled to something more than a general declaration of statutory purpose to guide their conduct before they are restricted or penalized by an agency for what it then decides was wrong from its hindsight conception of what the public interest requires in the particular situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Professional Practices Commission, </em>524 P.2d 932, 934 (Okla. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The defendants assert that since \u00a7 38-4-8 of its regulations specifically referred to Public Acts 1971, No. 854, \u00a7\u00a712 through 17, the department had stated the \u201crules of the game.\u201d Those sections, now \u00a7\u00a7 4-177 to 4-182 of the UAPA, encompass rules relating to notice, evidence, the record, conduct of officials and agency members, and license hearings. The defendants argue that the procedures set forth in the UAPA are sufficiently clear to inform parties appearing before the department of the \u201crules of the game.\u201d Yet, reason dictates otherwise, for \u201cif the legislature had considered that to be true, it would not have provided in the act for the adoption and filing of rules of procedure.\u201d <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>486 P.2d 235, 239 (Wyo. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>4 Conn. App. 464, 465, 495 A.2d 718 (1985), is misplaced. <em>Cope </em>is distinguishable from the present case because it involved action by a board of education. Boards of education are specifically excluded from the statutory definition of \u201cagency\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and are thus exempt from the regulation requirements of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The second sentence of \u00a7 38-4-8, that the hearings would be \u201cconducted on an informal basis, in accordance with standards designed to meet the purposes to be accomplished by the proceeding,\u201d is fatally vague and uncertain. The trial court was correct in concluding that the section was invalid on the ground that it was an unlawful regulation not promulgated in accordance with the rulemaking provision of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In this opinion, Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> Both the insurance department and Peter W.

The majority misstates the issue in this appeal. The pivotal issue is not, as the majority argues, whether the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 38-4-8 had a substantial impact on the parties. The cases on which the majority relies; <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>177 Conn. 356, 417 A.2d 358 (1979); <em>Eagle Hill Corporation </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>2 Conn. App. 68, 477 A. 2d 660 (1984); and <em>Cheshire Convalescent Center </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>34 Conn. Sup. 225, 386 A.2d 264 (1977); involved the question of whether particular decisions, rules or policies which the administrative agency did not present as regulations were in fact regulations because they had a substantial impact on the rights and obligations of parties in the future. In this case, the defendant agency labeled its action a regulation, and there is no question that \u00a7 38-4-8 was meant to have general applicability beyond this particular case. Nor is there any question that it was adopted pursuant to proper procedures, and that it was applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The pivotal issue is, therefore, whether \u00a7 38-4-8, which simply incorporated by reference the requirements and procedures of the UAPA, sufficiently com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>plied with the mandate of the UAPA requiring that the defendant \u201cadopt as a regulation rules of practice setting forth the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available provided such rules shall be in conformance with the provisions of\u201d the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7 4-167 (a) (2). I would hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It is true that the drafting of \u00a7 38-4-8 displays a discomforting laziness in the attempt to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 4-167 (a) (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, in my view it sufficiently complied with that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 38-4-8 at the time of the hearing provided in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ll hearings conducted in the insurance department are conducted in accordance with the requirements of and procedures suggested in Public Act 854 of the 1971 Session of the General Assembly, Sections 12 through 17, inclusive, as the same may be amended from time to time.\u201d Public Acts 1971, No. 854, \u00a7\u00a712 through 17 are the contested hearing provisions of the UAPA, including the special provisions concerning licenses. They are now General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-177 through 4-182. Thus, the regulation in question incorporated by reference the statutory provisions of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Those statutory provisions are quite clear and very detailed. They provide for detailed notice, the opportunity to present evidence and argument, informal dispositions, a definition of the record, transcription of the proceedings, and findings of facts based solely on the evidence and on matters officially noted. General Statutes \u00a7 4-177. They also provide for rules of evidence; General Statutes \u00a7 4-178; a procedure for a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>posed decision; General Statutes \u00a7 4-179; and time and form limitation on final decisions. General Statutes \u00a7 4-180. They bar certain ex parte communications. General Statutes \u00a7 4-181. Finally, they make special, even more detailed and stringent provisions applicable to licensure matters including, as in this case, matters involving the suspension of licenses. General Statutes 4-182.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The plaintiffs do not claim that those statutory provisions were not followed. Indeed, the record makes clear that they were scrupulously applied and that all applicable procedural protections were provided. Nor can I discern in this record any prejudice to the plaintiffs flowing from the fact that the procedures mandated by the UAPA were incorporated by reference into the defendants\u2019 regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>486 P.2d 235 (Wyo. 1971), is misplaced. In that case, the administrative agency had not adopted <em>any </em>regulation governing its procedures, either by reference <em>to </em>the state\u2019s administrative procedure act or otherwise. In the absence of governing procedures, the agency proceeded to violate fundamental fairness by appointing its own attorney as the hearing officer who, in turn, acted as both prosecutor and hearing officer, interrogated and cross-examined witnesses, ruled on his own and opposing counsel\u2019s objections, sat with the agency as it made its decision, and made public statements to the audience at the hearing as to why the hearing was even necessary. Id., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Nor am I persuaded by the argument of the majority as to the fatal vagueness of the second sentence of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies \u00a7 38-4-8.1 would agree that this inartfully drafted language leaves much to be desired. To the extent that it may be vague, however, that is not an issue in this case. It is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>from the record that, despite the statement in the regulation that insurance department hearings \u201care conducted on an informal basis, in accordance with standards designed to meet the purposes to be accomplished by the proceeding\u201d; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-4-8; this proceeding was held with the utmost administrative formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">There was a detailed notice of the hearing, which stated the charges to be heard. The hearing was held over three days. Counsel were permitted opening remarks. There was an orderly presentation of evidence, both oral and documentary, from both sides. Full opportunity to examine and cross-examine all witnesses was provided, as well as the opportunity to object to testimony and exhibits. Counsel were permitted final oral arguments and filed extensive briefs. The majority ignores the fundamental principle that a vagueness challenge to a statute or regulation must be viewed, not on the face of the language in question, but as it applies to the facts of the case. <em>Jack </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>4 Conn. App. 451, 456-57, 495 A.2d 1084, cert. dismissed, 197 Conn. 808, 499 A.2d 59 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\"> Subsequent to the administrative hearing in this case the insurance commissioner promulgated more detailed and comprehensive regulations to replace \u00a7 38-4-8. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 38-4-6 through 38-4-74.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
