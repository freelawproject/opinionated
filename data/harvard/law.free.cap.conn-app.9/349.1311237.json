He raises the following claims on appeal: (1) that his guilty pleas with respect to the larceny and firearm charges were involuntary; and (2) that the court improperly assumed venue over certain charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">A house was burglarized in Old Lyme in early March, 1979. A witness saw the defendant on the burglarized premises on the date of the burglary and reported this to the state police. Meanwhile, the Old Saybrook police obtained information that the defendant had sold weapons to two individuals. The weapons were identified as stolen from the burglarized Old Lyme residence. On the basis of this information, the state police obtained a warrant, stopped and searched the defendant\u2019s automobile and found in his possession most of the remaining items of personal property reported missing after the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The defendant was charged in both the Middlesex and New London judicial districts, as the property was stolen in the New London judicial district and recovered in the Middlesex judicial district. In the Middle-sex district, he was charged on a substitute information with larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123, and stealing a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-212. He pleaded guilty to those charges in the Middlesex court on July 25, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">At the time of his guilty plea, the court questioned the defendant to determine, inter alia, whether he had fully discussed the matter with his attorney, whether he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice and assistance, and whether he knew the maximum penalties for the crimes with which he had been charged. The court was satisfied that there were no threats or promises made other than those promises contained in the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>bargain agreement itself, and that the defendant was making his plea voluntarily and knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The special public defender who had been assigned to represent the defendant advised the court that the defendant faced a burglary charge and possible parole violation in New London. The court advised the defendant that it had no control over those proceedings. The defendant stated that he understood this limitation. The court thereafter accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. The plea bargain \u2014 that on each count there would be a sentence of two and one-half to five years to be served consecutively, for a total effective sentence of five to ten years \u2014 was put on record.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In the New London judicial district, the defendant was charged with burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102, and larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122. He pleaded guilty to the burglary charge under the doctrine of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), on August 2, 1979. The larceny charge was nolled and the New London case was transferred to the Middlesex court for a consolidated sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The New London plea canvass was found deficient in State v. <em>Evans, </em>5 Conn. App. 113, 497 A.2d 73 (1985). In finding error, this court ordered that the judgment be set aside and the case remanded with direction to permit the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed in accordance with the law. The record is devoid of any reference to further proceedings on the burglary charge in the New London judicial district. We will consider the defendant\u2019s claims, however, because he alleges that his guilty pleas in the Middle-sex judicial district were made involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The defendant appeared in the Middlesex court on September 13,1979, for sentencing. In addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>five to ten year sentence that had been agreed upon on the Middlesex charges, he was sentenced to five to ten years for burglary in the second degree for the New London charge. That sentence was to run concurrently with the sentence for larceny and stealing a firearm, for a total effective sentence of five to ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that his guilty pleas in the Middlesex court were induced by a promise of a bargained disposition contained in a letter dated July 23, 1979, from the special public defender to the defendant. He claimed that this letter concerned plea bargaining on the burglary charge in the New London judicial district, that the Middlesex court was not made aware of this plea bargain, and that the plea bargain was not fulfilled regarding his sentence on the burglary charge. He asserts that as a result of this, his Middlesex pleas were not made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the defendant did not make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 719 through 722. Nor did he otherwise preserve this claim at trial. The involuntary nature of the plea is raised for the first time on appeal under the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The defendant\u2019s claim of error refers to and depends upon the contents of the letter from the special public defender and the defendant\u2019s belief as to the meaning and effect of that letter. No claim referring to the letter was raised in the trial court, however. The letter is not referred to in the transcripts filed by the defendant, nor was it made an exhibit in the trial court. The defendant has attempted to make it part of the appellate record by including it in the appendix to his brief. After the defendant filed his appellate brief, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>filed a motion to expunge the defendant\u2019s appendix. This court denied that motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">It is \u201ca necessary application of appellate procedure that claims made in briefs must be supported by the record. <em>Furber </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>164 Conn. 446, 451, 324 A.2d 254 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>179 Conn. 1, 7, 425 A.2d 924 (1979). It is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to secure an adequate record for appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fraenza, </em>9 Conn. App. 228, 233, 518 A.2d 649 (1986). That record must be made in the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>162 Conn. 514, 516, 294 A.2d 584, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 984, 93 S. Ct. 332, 34 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>172 Conn. 234, 374 A.2d 190 (1977), the plaintiffs included in the appendix to their brief letters exchanged by counsel. As in the present case, the Supreme Court denied a motion to expunge the appendix. In deciding the merits of the case, however, the court would not consider the contents of the appendix. It stated that \u201c[as] the merits of this appeal must be determined solely on the record, we do not consider the contents of the appendix to the plaintiffs\u2019 brief.\u201d Id., 235-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">This court recently considered a similar situation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuritz, </em>3 Conn. App. 459, 489 A.2d 1053 (1985). In <em>Kuritz, </em>the state attempted to introduce evidence, for the first time on appeal, of the defendant\u2019s release date from prison by including in its appendix an affidavit from the records supervisor of the Connecticut correctional institution. This court denied a motion to expunge the affidavit. On reconsideration, however, the court stated \u201cthis method of presenting evidence of the defendant\u2019s release date was improper. Such a prison record is not a court record; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 188, 438 A.2d 859 (1981); nor is the date of such release otherwise within the ambit of judicial notice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>That evidence was not, but could and should have been, presented to the court during the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuritz, </em>supra, 460 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In deciding a case, this court cannot resort to matters extraneous to the formal record, to facts which have not been found and which are not admitted in the pleadings, or to documents or exhibits which are not part of the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>7 Conn. App. 309, 317, 508 A.2d 463 (1986). As the defendant\u2019s present claim is predicated entirely on a document extraneous to the record, we cannot consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The defendant next contends that the court in the Middlesex judicial district improperly assumed venue over the larceny charge because the same charge was pending in the New London judicial district. This claim, however, was not raised in the trial court. Nor was any objection made during the plea or sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Recognizing his failure to raise the venue claim in the trial court, the defendant relies upon the exceptional circumstance exception in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, to secure review of this claim. This court may review a claim that was not raised in the trial court \u201cwhere the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d Id., 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>187 Conn. 264, 445 A.2d 887, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 861, 103 S. Ct. 136, 74 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1982), our Supreme Court refused to review an improper venue claim raised for the first time on appeal. The court found that the claim involved no fundamental constitutional right despite the defendant\u2019s efforts to invoke constitutional claims. \u201cVenue require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ments are created for the convenience of the litigants and may be waived by failure to assert the statutory privilege in timely fashion. 77 Am. Jur. 2d, Venue \u00a7 45. Subject matter jurisdiction, which cannot be conferred upon the court by the parties, must be distinguished from venue. Ibid.; <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Wencke, </em>117 Conn. 683, 684, 169 A. 58 (1933); <em>Mower </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>108 Conn. 74, 77, 142 A. 473 (1928).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>supra, 269-70. The court went on to state that \u201cwe are not convinced that this privilege, which is wholly statutory in origin, is so fundamental that it may not be waived without the full panoply of safeguards applicable to a plea of guilty or an election of a trial without a jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>supra, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">As venue is a statutory right and not a fundamental right so as to qualify for review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, we will not review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
