We conclude that the trial court was correct in refusing to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>For disciplinary reasons, the New Haven police chief suspended Officer Thomas Morrissey for five days without pay. In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, he submitted a grievance through the plaintiff Council 15 (hereinafter \u201cthe union\u201d) to the board of mediation and arbitration. The board designated a tripartite panel to arbitrate the dispute. This panel consisted of Thomas J. Staley, panel chairman and public member, Angelo Monitto, management member, and Frank J. Avallone, labor member. At the start of the hearing, the union moved that Avallone be disqualified. The basis for the motion was that Avallone was a \u201cmayoral appointee.\u201d No further representations concerning his appointed capacity were made in support of the motion. The arbitration panel denied the motion and proceeded with the hearing. The board ruled that the five day suspension was not for just cause and ordered it modified to a one day suspension without pay. The plaintiff then filed suit in Superior Court seeking an order vacating the board's award. It claimed that the rendition of the award by a panel of arbitrators that included a city appointee represented evident partiality on the part of that arbitrator in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed a cross application to confirm the award. The court denied the application to vacate and granted the cross application. This appeal followed. The parties stipulated to the court that Avallone had been appointed to the south central regional water authority by the mayor of New Haven before the commencement of the arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff conceded at trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>in this court that there was no evidence of impropriety or misconduct on the part of the arbitrators. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision stated simply that: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s sole claim is that the panel member created an appearance of bias. It is the finding of the court that there is no evidence to support the alleged appearance of bias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The south central regional water authority, the south central regional water district and the representative policy board were created by Connecticut Special Act No. 77-98, as amended by Connecticut Special Act No. 78-24, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4 and 5. The authority was created to provide and assure the provision of an adequate supply of pure water at a reasonable cost within the regional water district. The authority is described in the special act creating it as a public corporation, a public instrumentality and a political subdivision. The functions of the representative policy board include the power to approve (1) water rates established by the authority, (2) the disposition of land and establishment of land use standards, (3) the initiation of large-scale construction projects, (4) the acquisition of any other water system, (5) the location of a new filter plant, if necessary, and certain other items. The voting power of each member of the board is a weighted vote based upon the number of customers and the number of acres owned by the authority in the municipality from which the member has been appointed. Avallone, the board member named by the city of New Haven, had the largest weighted vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The plaintiff claims that close judicial scrutiny should be paid to the question of \u201cevident partiality\u201d because Avallone was the \u201clabor member\u201d of the tripartite arbitration panel. When an employer and employee organization submits a grievance to the Connecticut board of mediation and arbitration for arbitration, a tripartite panel of board members is assigned to the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>unless the parties agree to a single member. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-93 and 31-97.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a panel was set up in this case. The members of the tripartite panel are empowered by statute to represent the interests of employers, employees, and the public. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-91 and 31-92.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When an alternate mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ber serves on a panel in place of a member, he is required to represent the same interest as the member in whose place he serves. General Statutes \u00a7 31-92. The plaintiff points out that Avallone was an alternate labor member of the board. He was not designated by the plaintiff to serve in the arbitration proceeding in question. Thus, the plaintiff argues that it was the labor member, the plaintiffs representative on the arbitration panel, who gave \u201cthe appearance of bias\u201d in favor of the employer who appointed him. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>asserts that since the claim of an \u201cappearance of bias\u201d relates to an arbitrator who is charged by statute with representing the interest of the party asserting the claim, a conflict of interest can be inferred which amounts to \u201cevident partiality.\u201d We conclude that no special close judicial scrutiny is required other than that which we are sworn to give in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The defendant also claims that the limited judicial scrutiny of arbitration awards requires a strict rule concerning the appearance of bias of arbitrators. The limited scope of judicial review of awards is clearly the law in Connecticut. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Police Local, No. </em>1361, 187 Conn. 228, 231, 445 A.2d 322 (1982). <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brookman, </em>1 Conn. App. 219, 221-22, 470 A.2d 253 (1983), cert. denied, 193 Conn. 801, 473 A.2d 1226 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Connecticut Council 4, CEU, AFSCME, </em>7 Conn. App. 286, 289, 508 A.2d 806 (1986); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 760, </em>6 Conn. App. 11, 13-14, 502 A.2d 429 (1986). The burden of proof is on the movant. <em>Milford Employee Association </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>179 Conn. 678, 682-83, 427 A.2d 859 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant argues that the relationship of Avallone with the city is free from factors allowing the city to pressure him or cause him to identify his interests with those of the city. This argument, however, does not meet head on the plaintiff\u2019s argument. The plaintiff presents the very narrow issue that it doesn\u2019t \u201clook right\u201d if the labor member of the arbitration panel has earlier been appointed by the employer to an important position affecting the employer\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The plaintiff particularly relies on <em>Commonwealth Coatings Corporation </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>393 U.S. 145, 89 S. Ct. 337, 21 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1968). In <em>Commonwealth Coatings, </em>the petitioner, a subcontractor, had sued the sureties on the prime contractor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>bond to recover money allegedly due on a painting job. Under the arbitration clause in the contract, the petitioner appointed one arbitrator, the prime contractor appointed another, and the two appointed a third. The third arbitrator was an engineering consultant whose services were used sporadically by the prime contractor. He was paid about $12,000 over four or five years for his services. The relationship \u201cwent so far as to include the rendering of services on the very projects involved in [the arbitration].\u201d Id., 146. The petitioner challenged the arbitration award on the ground that this close business connection was not disclosed until after the award was made. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s refusal to set aside the award. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that even in the absence of actual fraud or bias on the part of an arbitrator, an arbitration award should be vacated where the arbitrator failed to disclose a prior business connection with one of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The applicable federal legislation authorized vacation of an award which was \u201c \u2018procured by . . . undue means\u2019 or \u2018[w]here there was evident partiality . . . in the arbitrators.\u2019 \u201d Id., 147. The majority analogized the appropriate test to that required of the judiciary stating that \u201cthis canon of judicial ethics rests on the premise that any tribunal permitted by law to try cases and controversies not only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the appearance of bias.\u201d Id., 150. The court also stated a stricter rule for arbitrators than judges, holding that \u201c[i]t is true that arbitrators cannot sever all their ties with the business world, since they are not expected to get all their income from their work deciding cases, but we should, if anything, be even more scrupulous to safeguard the impartiality of arbitrators than judges, since the former have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate review.\u201d Id., 148-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>There is a paucity of Connecticut authority on the exact point in issue. In <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>191 Conn. 316, 464 A.2d 774 (1983), the issue of disqualification of an arbitrator for evident partiality was not involved. The court stated in not upholding a party\u2019s claim of unlawful bias that \u201c[t]his court has summarily rejected attempts to overturn arbitration awards on grounds of partiality in cases, like the present one, which lacked sufficient evidentiary support. <em>Von Langendorff v. Riordan, </em>147 Conn. 524,163 A.2d 100 (1960).\u201d <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 327. <em>Von Langendorff </em>likewise did not involve the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Although it did not face the exact situation with which we are faced, <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 506 A.2d 139 (1986), is dis-positive. The Supreme Court, after certification, heard an appeal from a judgment of this court reversing a decision of the Superior Court. That court had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the termination of her employment by the board of trustees of the Norwich Free Academy. Certification was granted to review the judgment of this court that the failure of two members of the board to disqualify themselves from the plaintiff\u2019s case, because of their inherent conflicts of interest, violated state and federal constitutional due process principles. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of this court in <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>2 Conn. App. 551, 481 A.2d 1096 (1984). The Supreme Court summarized the setting of the issue before it as follows: \u201cThe Appellate Court reversed the Superior Court\u2019s decision, concluding that the presence of Tillinghast and Dutton on the board of trustees per se violated the plaintiff\u2019s federal due process rights because it created an appearance of impropriety. The court reached its decision by equating the due process test for disqualification of an admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>istrative adjudicator with the standard for judicial disqualification. \u2018When administrators act in a quasi-judicial capacity, as the board in this case did, their functions and that of judges most closely merge and the judicial model to test impropriety becomes an acceptable one.\u2019 <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u201cThe defendants\u2019 request to this court for certification raised a single question: Is the federal due process test for disqualification of an administrative official acting in a quasi-judicial capacity the same as the test for the disqualification of a judge? The plaintiff filed a preliminary statement of issues under Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a) [now \u00a7 4013], in order to provide an alternative basis for affirming the Appellate Court\u2019s decision. The relevant issue, broader in scope than that before us on certification, is: \u2018Did the defendants violate the plaintiff\u2019s right to due process under Connecticut General Statutes [Rev. to 1983] \u00a7 10-151 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when trustees Dutton and Tillinghast participated in the hearing and decision, although they were disqualified?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201cThe defendants [in <em>Petrowski </em>did] not dispute the proposition, as stated in the dissenting opinion of the Appellate Court, that \u2018had Tillinghast and Dutton been judges participating in a judicial proceeding they would have been disqualified, because the relationship between their law firm and the academy would have violated the governing standard for judicial disqualification, which is the reasonable appearance of impropriety. \u2019 <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 566 <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting) .... <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 233-35, 506 A.2d 139 (1986).\u201d They claimed only that administrative adjudications are not governed by the principles governing judicial disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The Supreme Court stated further: \u201cThe courts recognize the presumption that administrators serving as adjudicators are unbiased. See <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 421, 61 S. Ct. 999, 85 L. Ed. 1429 (1940). This presumption can be rebutted by a showing of a conflict of interests; see <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 578-79, 93 S. Ct. 1689, 36 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1973); <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Monroeville, </em>409 U.S. 57, 60, 93 S. Ct. 80, 34 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1972); but the burden of establishing a disqualifying interest rests on the party making the contention. <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 102 S. Ct. 1665, 72 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982). The impermissible interest asserted must be realistic and more than \u2018remote.\u2019 <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Jerrico, Inc., </em>[ 446 U.S. 238, 242, 250, 100 S. Ct. 1610, 64 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1980)].</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe fact that [an administrative hearing officer] might have been disqualified as a judge . . . does not, either in principle or under the authorities, infect the hearing with a lack of due process.\u201d <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Henry Phipps Plaza South, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 937, 944 (2d Cir. 1974).\u2019 <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 567 <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting); see <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 271, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1970). . . . In <em>Florasynth, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pickholz, </em>750 F.2d 171, 173-74 (2d Cir. 1984), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals noted that although arbitrators do act in a quasi-judicial capacity, the disqualification standard forjudges need not be applied. \u2018The mere appearance of bias that might disqualify a judge will not disqualify an arbitrator.\u2019 Id.; see <em>Morelite Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>New York City District Council Carpenters Benefit Funds, </em>748 F.2d 79, 85 (2d Cir. 1984); <em>International Produce, Inc. </em>v. <em>A/S Rosshavet, </em>638 F.2d 548, 552 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1017, 101 S. Ct. 3006, 69 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1981).\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>199 Conn. 231, 236-37, 506 A. 2d 125 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The Supreme Court then stated: \u201cThe canons of judicial ethics go far toward cloistering those who become judges, the ultimate arbiters of constitutional and statutory rights, from all extraneous influences that could even remotely be deemed to affect their decisions. Such a rarefied atmosphere of impartiality cannot practically be achieved where the persons acting as administrative adjudicators, whose decisions are normally subject to judicial review, often have other employment or associations in the community they serve. It would be difficult to find competent people willing to serve, commonly without recompense, upon the numerous boards and commissions in this state if any connection with such agencies, however remotely related to the matters they are called upon to decide, were deemed to disqualify them. Neither the federal courts nor this court require a standard so difficult to implement as a prerequisite of due process of law for administrative adjudication.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cTillinghast and Dutton\u2019s membership in the law firm that represents Norwich Free Academy on unrelated matters is too remote and tenuous a connection to have required under due process principles their disqualification from the board.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 240. It also agreed with the trial court\u2019s factual conclusion that their interests were too remote and nebulous to require such disqualification under state law. Id., 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We consider first the impact of <em>Petrowski </em>on this case. <em>Petrowski </em>involved administrative adjudicators in Connecticut while this case involves arbitrators. Thus, although the language quoted from <em>Petrowski </em>concerning disqualification of arbitrators is not directly involved in the decision, the fact that the three Second Circuit Court of Appeals cases holding that the judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>cial standard did not apply to arbitrators was cited favorably, is strongly persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We next note the nature of the claimed disqualification here. There was no substantial claim before the arbitrators or the Superior Court to justify even the appearance of bias. The mere speculative statement of bias by a participant in the arbitration proceeding does not in and of itself justify a claim of disqualification. Otherwise a mere claim would automatically require disqualification. The record is totally devoid of any evidence that Avallone was \u201cunder the thumb\u201d of the mayor of New Haven or felt indebted to him because of his appointment to this $50 a day plum. We conclude that even under the \u201cappearance of bias\u201d standard the claimed reasons for disqualification were too remote and nebulous to have required disqualification. The appearance of bias must be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We move to the question of whether <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>required disqualification as a matter of federal due process. Three Second Circuit cases, cited by the Supreme Court in Petrowski, considered this question. We agree with the rationale of the Second Circuit in <em>International Produce, Inc. </em>v. <em>A/S Rosshavet, </em>supra. In that case, the neutral arbitrator disclosed that he was also a nonparty witness in another arbitration dispute involving the same law firms as were involved in the instant dispute. After adequate notice before the arbitration proceeding began, he declined to disqualify himself. The party ordered by the arbitration panel to pay damages petitioned the district court for an order vacating that award because one of the arbitrators should have recused himself. The district court granted International\u2019s petition to vacate the award finding that the arbitrator\u2019s appearance of bias toward one of the law firms in the arbitration violates 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The Second Circuit reversed. It found that in holding that the standard for reviewing the award was whether there was \u201can appearance of bias\u201d the district court was equating that standard with \u201cevident partiality.\u201d The Second Circuit did not find support in <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>for such a proposition in view of the facts of that case. The court stated: \u201cMr. Justice Black\u2019s plurality opinion found that the arbitrator\u2019s failure to disclose required setting aside the award for \u2018evident partiality.\u2019 He wrote that an arbitration panel \u2018not only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the appearance of bias.\u2019 <em>[Commonwealth Coatings Corporation </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>supra, 150].</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u201cHowever, Mr. Justice White, writing for himself and Mr. Justice Marshall, concurred for somewhat different reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u201c \u2018The Court does not decide today that arbitrators are to be held to the standards of judicial decorum of Article III judges, or indeed of any judges. . . . [I]t is enough for present purposes to hold, as the Court does, that where the arbitrator has a substantial interest in a firm which has done more than trivial business with a party [to the arbitration], that fact must be disclosed. [Id., 151-152]. . . . Thus, two of the justices restricted the scope of the Court\u2019s ruling to situations where business and financial dealings with a party are not disclosed by the arbitrator and disassociated themselves from Justice Black\u2019s dictum about \u2018appearance of bias.\u2019 Three justices dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cWe agree, therefore, with the appellant, that the Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>did not expand the \u00a7 10 standard of \u2018evident partiality\u2019 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>include \u2018appearance of bias.\u2019 In <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>there was clear, unexplained evidence of \u2018evident partiality.\u2019 Here we have an assertion of \u2018appearance of bias\u2019 which seems to us, at best, to be speculation without substance. . . . There was no claim of bias on the part of [the arbitrator], or even of any animosity toward any counsel. Thus, the record is completely bare of anything remotely resembling \u2018evident partiality.\u2019 See <em>Ilios Shipping and Trading Corp. </em>v. <em>American Anthracite and Bituminous Coal Corp., </em>148 F. Supp. 698 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 245 F.2d 873 (2d Cir. 1957) (per curiam). We doubt that there is any substantial basis for finding even an \u2018appearance of bias\u2019 in [the arbitrator\u2019s] position or anything he did. Be that as it may, we are convinced that there is no evidence of \u2018evident partiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Produce, Inc. </em>v. <em>A/S Rosshavet, </em>supra, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In <em>Morelite Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>New York City District Council Carpenters Benefit Funds, </em>748 F.2d 79 (2d Cir. 1984), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals again faced the issue of disqualification for \u201cevident partiality\u201d in a case involving a father-son relationship between an arbitrator and an officer of one party to the arbitration. In reversing the District Court and vacating the award, the Court of Appeals emphasized that \u201c[a]n inquiry into issues of fairness, bias, partiality and the like overflows with factual questions.\u201d Id., 81. Chief Judge Kaufman of the Court of Appeals noted that in this area of the law the result of <em>Commonwealth Coatings </em>appears to be \u201congoing uncertainty.\u201d Id., 82. The court stated, \u201cJustice Black, writing for a plurality of four justices, appeared to impose upon arbitrators the same lofty ethical standards required of Article III judges. . . . Four justices, however, do not constitute a majority of the Supreme Court. Justice White, writing for himself and Justice Marshall, concurred in the result, but made clear the Court was not holding that arbitrators\u2019 and judges\u2019 ethi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>cal standards are coextensive.\u201d Id., 82. The court found much of Justice Black\u2019s opinion to be dicta. The court wrestled with this question stating: \u201cIt might be thought that Justice Black\u2019s opinion represents the views of six members of the Court, for Justice White wrote that he was \u2018glad to join my Brother Black\u2019s opinion.\u2019 . . . Because the two opinions are impossible to reconcile, however, we must narrow the holding to that subscribed to by both Justices White and Black.\u201d Id., 83 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The court concluded: \u201cWe hold only that the uncontested relationship [of father and son] here at issue is such that reasonable people would have to believe it provides strong evidence of partiality by the arbitrator.\u201d Id., 85; <em>Florasynth, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pickholz, </em>750 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1984) adds nothing to the issue as it was decided on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Finally, we do not agree with the plaintiff that the balance tips in favor of an \u201cappearance of bias\u201d test in Connecticut because the labor arbitrator has a statutory duty to \u201crepresent\u201d the union. This mere fact alone in no way elevates the standard for disqualification. Any weight it may have is outweighed by the \u201chands off\u201d policy our Supreme Court and this court have repeatedly stressed in arbitration matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We conclude, like the decision in <em>Morelite, </em>that evident partiality in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 (b) is more than the mere \u201cappearance of bias\u201d and less than \u201cproof of partiality.\u201d We conclude that \u201cevident partiality\u201d will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration. To put it in the vernacular, \u201cevident partiality\u201d exists where it reasonably looks as though a given arbitrator would tend to favor one of the parties.
