SCHEINDLIN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">Two actions brought on behalf of massive classes of South Africans (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) assert that several multinational corporations (\u201cdefendants\u201d) aided and abetted torts in violation of customary international law. Plaintiffs claim jurisdiction in United States courts under the Alien Tort Claims Act (\u201cATCA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These lawsuits address the obligations of corporations under the law of nations, the role of American courts in enforcing universal norms of international law, and the legacy of South African apartheid.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">The tortuous procedural history of these cases dates back to the filing of complaints in 2002. On November 29, 2004, Judge John E. Sprizzo granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that aiding and abetting liability is not available under the ATCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit, and on October 12, 2007 the Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relevant to this motion, the Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Khulumani v. Barclay National Bank Ltd. </em>found that aiding and abetting liability is available under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ATCA and vacated the lower court\u2019s holding that prudential concerns warranted dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The short per curiam opinion did not address the <em>mens rea </em>standard for an aiding and abetting claim or the standard for vicarious liability when a domestic corporation allegedly uses its foreign subsidiary as an agent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On April 8, 2009, 617 F.Supp.2d 228, this Court granted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 consolidated motion to dismiss these actions in their entirety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants now move to certify that opinion for interlocutory appeal pursuant to Section 1292(b) of Title 28 of the United States Code. Defendants specifically request certification of three issues: case-specific deference, the <em>mens rea </em>requirement for the tort of aiding and abetting a crime under the law of nations, and the vicarious liability standard under federal common law applicable when the alleged agent is the foreign subsidiary of the alleged principal. In addition, defendants request a stay of the proceedings during the pendency of that appeal. For the reasons that follow, defendants\u2019 motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">II. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Appeals of interlocutory district court orders are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Under section 1292(b), the order being appealed must \u201c(1) involve a controlling question of law (2) over which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\u201d and the movant must also show that \u201c(3) an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, leave to appeal is warranted only when the movant demonstrates the existence of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> sufficient to overcome the \u201cgeneral aversion to piecemeal litigation\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to \u201cjustify a departure from the basic policy of postponing appellate review until after the entry of a final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIn practice the courts treat the statutory criteria as a unitary requirement, and the decisions granting and discussing interlocutory appeals under [section] 1292(b) uniformly cite all three of the elements as being present in any particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Interlocutory appeal \u201cis limited to \u2018extraordinary cases where appellate review might avoid protracted and expensive litigation,\u2019 ... and is not intended as a vehicle to provide early review of difficult rulings in hard cases.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>cisi\u00f3n whether to grant an interlocutory appeal from a district court order lies within the district court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Certification of an interlocutory appeal does \u201cnot stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof\u2019 orders a stay.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Arj\">A. Case-Specific Deference</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Defendants first request certification of an interlocutory appeal concerning the application of case-specific deference to this case. Defendants argue that case-specific deference is distinct from the political question and international comity doctrines. Defendants further argue that unlike the latter doctrines, case-specific deference <em>requires </em>federal courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction over ATCA cases whenever foreign and United States Governments assert that the lawsuit conflicts with their foreign policy interests without analyzing the validity of those assertions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This argument fails because defendants do not raise a controlling issue of law. Moreover, there is no substantial ground for disagreement, and an appeal would not materially advance the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">1. Controlling Issue of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">With the exception of a misstatement discussed below, defendants do not explain the contours of the free-standing case-specific deference doctrine they propose.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In fact, this Court declined to dismiss the actions largely because the Governments\u2019 litigation positions were predicated on the faulty <em>legal </em>assumption \u2014 to which no deference is due<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u2014 that these actions sought to hold defendants liable for merely doing business in South Africa. Once this Court held that plaintiffs were required to show much more to obtain relief, there was no longer any conflict between maintaining these suits and the core foreign policy concerns expressed by both governments.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On this dispositive issue \u2014 which defendants do not contest in this motion \u2014 any reasonable form of case-specific deference would have yielded the same result as that reached under the framework of the political question and international comity doctrines.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, defendants\u2019 argument that case-specific deference should be analyzed separately does not raise a controlling issue of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">2. Substantial Grounds for Disagreement</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">There is not a substantial ground for difference of opinion on whether (1) case-specific deference is appropriately analyzed under the political question and international comity doctrines, (2) case-specific deference requires absolute delegation, or (3) whether the Court correctly rejected the defendants\u2019 deference-based arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"><em>First, </em>in <em>Khulumani, </em>the Second Circuit noted that \u201cthe parties agree that <em>Sosa[ v. Alvarez-Machain </em>]\u2019s reference to \u2018ease-specific deference\u2019 implicates either the political question or international comity doctrine.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court explained that \u201c[tjhis policy of judicial deference to the Executive Branch on questions of foreign policy has long been established under the prudential justiciability doctrine known as the \u2018political question\u2019 doctrine.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In outlining the framework for analyzing \u201cwhen, and to what extent, ... the stated foreign policy interests of the United States [should] be accorded deference,\u201d the Circuit reiterated that courts \u201cshould be guided in this determination by \u2018our application of the political question doctrine.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus there is not substantial ground for disagreement concerning this Court\u2019s application of the political question and international comity doctrines to determine whether to dismiss these actions in deference to the stated policy concerns of the United States and South African Governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\"><em>Second, </em>defendants\u2019 suggestion that this Court should have deferred to the Executive\u2019s and South Africa\u2019s views without analysis vastly exaggerates the level of deference that is due.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Sosa </em>states that \u201cthere is a strong argument that federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>courts should give serious weight to the Executive Branch\u2019s view of the case\u2019s impact on foreign policy,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but serious weight is a far cry from absolute deference. Further, in the only case to which <em>Sosa </em>referred in explaining the scope of case-specific deference, the Supreme Court emphasized that, although the Executive\u2019s views merit \u201cgreater consideration,\u201d it would be error to treat these views as dispositive.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, <em>Khulumani </em>stated that \u201cto give dispositive weight to the Executive Branch\u2019s views would likely raise serious separation-of-powers concerns\u201d and emphasized that deference should not be \u201cdispositive.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> There is no substantial ground for difference of opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><em>Third, </em>as discussed above, this Court declined to dismiss these cases in deference to the Governments\u2019 views because the Governments misunderstood the nature of these actions. Once the proper legal standards are applied, there is no conflict between this case and the TRC\u2019s proceedings. There is no substantial ground for disagreement on this point.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">3. Material Advancement of the Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">For the reasons stated above, an appeal in this matter would likely not materially advance this litigation. Further, it is important to note that these actions have been pending for seven years without any discovery and that most of the conduct at issue in this litigation occurred over 20 years ago. As memories fade and relevant actors pass away, discovery becomes more difficult and plaintiffs lose their chance for relief. In these extraordinary circumstances, I would exercise my discretion not to certify this appeal even if the statutory grounds were met. Therefore, certification for an interlocutory appeal concerning case-specific deference is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">B. <em>Mens Rea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">Defendants next request certification for interlocutory appeal of the deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>mination of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement to be applied to the tort of aiding and abetting a crime under the law of nations. Defendants argue that the proper standard for an aiding and abetting claim under the law of nations is intent or shared purpose.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This issue does involve a controlling question of law. Moreover \u2014 as the division of opinion among members of the <em>Khulumani </em>panel indicates \u2014 there is substantial ground for difference of opinion concerning the proper standard. However, an immediate appeal would not materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">This Court lacks defendants\u2019 certainty that \u201creversal of the district court\u2019s order [on the <em>mens rea </em>issue] would terminate the action.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have advanced numerous allegations evincing specific intent, particularly concerning the automotive defendants.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Even if the Second Circuit or the Supreme Court were to determine that intent or shared purpose is the proper <em>mens rea </em>requirement, plaintiffs would undoubtedly fight on. As an immediate appeal would not materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, certification for an interlocutory appeal concerning the proper <em>mens rea </em>standard for an aiding and abetting claim under the law of nations is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">C. Vicarious Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Defendants last request certification for interlocutory review of the standard applied by this Court for vicarious liability under federal common law when the alleged agent is the foreign subsidiary of the alleged principal. The proper agency standard is a controlling question of law, but there is not substantial ground for difference of opinion concerning the proper standard. Defendants advocate use of the standard for piercing of the corporate veil as the test for vicarious liability between two related corporations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However \u2014 as outlined in today\u2019s decision denying reconsideration of the denial of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u2014 neither precedent nor logic supports blurring the distinction between these two independent doctrines.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A corporate parent does not receive special protection from vicarious liability simply because it chooses its subsidiary to act as its agent.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Therefore, certification of an interlocutory appeal concerning the proper standard for vicarious liability is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">D. Stay Pending Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">As this Court has denied certification of an interlocutory appeal, there is no need to stay this action. Therefore, defendants\u2019 request for a stay is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal is denied. The Clerk of the Court is ordered to close this motion (02 MDL 1499, No. 145; 02 Civ. 4712, No. 96; 02 Civ. 6218, No. 140; 03 Civ. 1024, No. 21; and 03 Civ. 4524, No. 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350.

If defendants\u2019 argument that courts are required to defer to the Governments\u2019 views without conducting any independent analysis were correct, this issue would clearly involve a controlling issue of law.

Defendants complain that the Court erred by holding that a suit should not be dismissed simply because it is in conflict with the Executive Branch's foreign policy views. This misstates the April 8 Opinion, which held that the Executive Branch's cursory <em>assertion </em>that this suit could cause a possible irritant in foreign relations did not require dismissal. <em>See In re S. Afr. Apartheid Litig., </em>617 F.Supp.2d at 243-44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">.This Court also concluded that these actions, which seek relief from corporations that did not participate in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s (\u201cTRC\u201d) proceedings and that received no immunity from the Commission, did not conflict with the results or aims of the TRC, as the Commissioners themselves explained. Defendants further argue that these suits conflict with South Africa\u2019s \u201cdemocratically approved mechanisms for handling the legacy of apartheid.\u201d Defendants' Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Certify the Court's April 8, 2009 Order for Interlocutory Appeal at 4. There is no such conflict with the TRC mechanisms. If defendants are suggesting that plaintiffs could have brought this suit in South African courts, defendants failed to raise such <em>forum non conveniens </em>or exhaustion arguments in their motion to dismiss and have now waived them. Further, it is far from clear whether these actions could have been brought in South African courts. Finally, the Governments\u2019 views related principally to the supposed conflict between these suits and the TRC's proceedings, not to broader, unexplained sovereignty concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\">. <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 262 n. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b381-12\">. <em>Id. </em>at 261 (quoting <em>Whiteman v.

Defendants additionally argue \u2014 for the <em>first time </em>in this motion \u2014 that dismissal was appropriate under a separate line of cases relating to foreign affairs preemption. It is inappropriate to certify for interlocutory appeal an issue that was not briefed in the original motion. Further, defendants\u2019 argument is without merit: at most, foreign affairs preemption precludes courts from adjudicating matters that fall exclusively within the Executive\u2019s foreign affairs powers, such as \u201cdisparag[ing] certain foreign regimes,\u201d or from issuing judgments that are in direct \"conflict with express foreign policy of the National Government.\u201d <em>American Ins.

Nor will this Court be required to disparage any foreign state, as the apartheid South African Government no longer exists. The only issues in dispute in this litigation relate to the scope of corporate involvement in apartheid human rights violations, and it is uncontested that the apartheid South African Government regularly committed such abuses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b383-6\">. <em>See </em>Def.
