BERNARD GOODWYN\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether the circuit court erred when it sustained a plea in bar which asserted res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 30, 2007, Gloria B. Lane (Lane) executed a deed of trust (Deed of Trust) on property (Property) located in Chase City, Virginia to secure a note of $52,397.51 (Note). Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (Bayview) serviced the loan on behalf of the noteholder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Paragraphs 12 and 17 of the Deed of Trust provided that in the event of Lane's default, the noteholder was to notify Lane of the breach and the action required to cure the breach, by certified mail prior to accelerating the Note and foreclosing on the Property. Paragraph 17 also stated that if the noteholder intended to sell the Property, it was to notify Lane of the sale \"in the manner prescribed by applicable law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 10, 2016, Bayview mailed Lane a letter entitled \"Notice of Default and Intent to Accelerate\" (May Notice). The May Notice stated that the Loan was delinquent by $1,060, and if this remained unpaid, Bayview would foreclose on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 9, 2016, Bayview mailed another letter to Lane entitled \"Notice of Default and Intent to Accelerate\" (August Notice). The August Notice stated the Loan was delinquent by $1,146, and Bayview would commence foreclosure proceedings if the balance was not paid by September 13, 2016. A note in the top right corner of the August Notice stated: \"Sent via Certified Mail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 12, 2016, BWW Law Group, LLC (BWW) mailed Lane a letter entitled \"Notice of Foreclosure Sale\" (Foreclosure Notice). The Foreclosure Notice stated that it was sent \"on behalf of the party secured by the Deed of Trust\" and that the Property would be sold at public auction on January 4, 2017 (Foreclosure Sale), by Equity Trustees, LLC (Equity), the substitute trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Foreclosure Notice was accompanied by a copy of an advertisement of the Foreclosure Sale, in which it was stated that BWW was providing legal representation for Equity. The Foreclosure Notice was also accompanied by a document, dated December 2, 2016, that was entitled \"Appointment of Substitute Trustee.\" It stated that Bayview \"appoints [Equity] as Substitute Trustee/Grantee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 30, 2016, Lane filed a petition for injunction, pro se, in the Circuit Court of Mecklenburg County against \"Substitute Trustee: BWW Law Group, LLC\" (Injunction Action). Lane sought to enjoin the Foreclosure Sale, scheduled for January 4, 2017, alleging that: (1) the Foreclosure Sale was not advertised in the newspaper, (2) she \"received a letter of sale on the 27th of December 2016,\" (3) she did not receive a \"certified mail returned receipt,\" and (4) she did not receive any prior letters notifying her of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 3, 2017, the circuit court held a hearing on the Injunction Action, and orally denied the petition for injunction. The Foreclosure Sale occurred, as scheduled, on January 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 10, 2017, the circuit court entered its order denying the injunction (January 2017 Order). The January 2017 Order noted that the court held a hearing on the petition on January 3, 2017, at which Lane and BWW were present. Upon Lane's testimony, \"the written evidence submitted by the Parties, and the arguments of [Lane] and counsel for [BWW],\" the court found the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. Equity is the substitute trustee who is scheduled to conduct the Foreclosure Sale. \"Because [Lane] has failed to name [Equity] as a party to this action, injunctive relief is not warranted in this matter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. Equity published notice of the Foreclosure Sale on \"December 14, 2016 and December 21, 2016, in the South Hill Enterprise in compliance with [ Code \u00a7 55-59.2 ] and with the requirements for advertisement of sale contained in the Deed of Trust.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. Equity notified Lane of the Foreclosure Sale in accordance with Code \u00a7 55-59.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   4. Bayview sent Lane \"a pre-acceleration notice in compliance with Paragraph 17 of the Deed of Trust.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   5. \"Because there is no likelihood that the allegations contained in Plaintiff's Petition will sustain a legal claim against [BWW] or [Equity], it is not appropriate to enter an injunction in this matter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The January 2017 Order concluded by stating \"[t]his matter is ended.\" Lane did not appeal the January 2017 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 3, 2017, Equity executed a Substitute Trustee's Deed conveying the Property to Bayview, the highest bidder at the Foreclosure Sale (Trustee Deed). On March 15, 2017, Bayview conveyed the Property to Eric Charles Von Allman (Von Allman) by special warranty deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 15, 2017, Lane, represented by counsel, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Mecklenburg County against Bayview, Equity, and Von Allman. With leave of court, she filed an amended complaint on November 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Count I of the amended complaint alleges that Bayview breached Paragraphs 12 and 17 of the Deed of Trust by mailing the May Notice first class instead of by certified mail, and by stating that Lane had missed two payments when she had only missed one. Count II alleges that Equity was not lawfully appointed as substitute trustee, in violation of Code \u00a7 55-59. Count III alleges that Bayview breached Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-59, -59.2, and -59.3 when it breached the Deed of Trust as alleged in Counts I and II. Count IV alleges that Bayview breached implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing as the agent for the noteholder when it conducted the Foreclosure Sale in breach of the terms of the Deed of Trust and Virginia statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lane seeks compensatory damages and rescission of the Trustee Deed. Lane also seeks rescission of the special warranty deed to Von Allman, claiming that Von Allman had constructive notice of defects in his title to the Property and was not a good faith purchaser for value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 11, 2017, Bayview filed a plea in bar of res judicata, asserting claim and issue preclusion based upon the Injunction Action and the January 2017 Order. Lane filed a brief in opposition to the plea in bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 12, 2018, the circuit court held a hearing on Bayview's plea in bar. The court found that \"this matter was brought before this same court ... a little over a year ago, and at that time the court had a full and final hearing.\" The circuit court reasoned that its finding in the January 2017 Order that Bayview \"sent the plaintiff a pre-acceleration notice in compliance with Paragraph 17 of the Deed of Trust\" was \"pretty much dispositive of this matter,\" and ruled that the amended complaint was barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 26, 2018, the circuit court entered an order sustaining Bayview's plea in bar \"for the reasons stated on the record,\" and dismissed the amended complaint as to Bayview, with prejudice. On May 14, 2018, the court entered another order dismissing the amended complaint with prejudice as to Von Allman and Equity because the ruling in favor of Bayview on its special plea of res judicata precluded Lane from obtaining relief from either Equity or Von Allman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lane appeals. This Court granted two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. The Circuit Court of Mecklenburg County (the \"trial court\") erred (1) in entering its April 26, 2018 Order in this case granting the Plea of\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata\n   </em>\n   filed by appellee, defendant below, Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Bayview\"), dismissing with prejudice the Amended Complaint filed by the appellant, Gloria B. Lane (\"Mrs. Lane\") as to Bayview, and (2) in entering its May 14, 2018 Order in this case dismissing with prejudice the Amended Complaint filed by Mrs. Lane as to appellees, defendants below, Equity Trustees, LLC, as Substitute Trustee (\"Equity Trustees\") and Eric Charles Von Allman (\"Mr. Von Allman\"), because neither\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   (claim preclusion) nor collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) applied to bar Mrs. Lane's Amended Complaint against Bayview, and, therefore, preclude the relief sought by Mrs. Lane against Equity Trustees and Mr. Von Allman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. The trial court erred in its ruling from the bench on February 12, 2018 granting the Plea of\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata\n   </em>\n   filed by Bayview because neither\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   (claim preclusion) nor collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) applied to bar Mrs. Lane's Amended Complaint against Bayview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lane asserts that the circuit court erred in sustaining Bayview's plea in bar because Bayview failed to prove the prerequisites for the application of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Res judicata involves both issue and claim preclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Funny Guy, LLC v.

Bayview also contends that it shares privity with BWW because BWW, as a party in the Injunction Action, sought to prevent the injunction which would have enjoined the Foreclosure Sale, which Equity was scheduled to conduct on behalf of Bayview. Thus, Bayview asserts that BWW represented Bayview's interests in the Injunction Action, and was Bayview's privy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Lane asserts that Bayview did not establish that it was in privity with BWW regarding the Injunction Action.

Therefore, the attorney-client relationship is insufficient in itself to establish privity for purposes of claim or issue preclusion in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Injunction Action concerned the propriety of the Foreclosure Sale and the notices that were required to be sent prior to it. As the loan servicer and agent of the noteholder, Bayview had a legal interest in the Foreclosure Sale because the Deed of Trust gave Bayview the right to foreclose on the Property, and it had appointed Equity to do so, in order to collect on the Note. By contrast, BWW is a stranger to the Deed of Trust and the obligations it imposed upon Bayview and Equity. BWW has no obligations\n   to Lane and no interest in the Deed of Trust or the Foreclosure Sale, other than its legal representation of Equity and Bayview concerning their obligations to Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the Injunction Action, Lane sought to enjoin the Foreclosure Sale. Bayview was the party responsible for sending the pre-foreclosure notices required by the Deed of Trust, not BWW. Equity was the party authorized by Bayview to conduct the Foreclosure Sale, not BWW. Lane, proceeding pro se, failed to name Bayview or Equity as a party to the Injunction Action. Instead, she named their attorney, BWW, as the defendant in the Injunction Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Upon being named as a defendant in the Injunction Action, BWW engaged an attorney to represent BWW's interests in defending itself. BWW was not representing either Equity or Bayview in the Injunction Action, but, in essence, asserted that it could not be ordered to enjoin the Foreclosure Sale because it was not the substitute trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The distinction between the interests of BWW and those of Bayview and Equity in the Injunction Action was implicitly recognized by the circuit court in its ruling that the injunction requested by Lane could not be granted because Lane had failed to name the substitute trustee, Equity-an entity with the right to authorize the Foreclosure Sale-as a party to the Injunction Action. The circuit court correctly recognized that Equity's attorney, BWW, did not have the same interest in the Injunction Action as did its client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As this Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , BWW's interest in the conduct of the Foreclosure Sale, as counsel, is no substitute for the interest of the actual noteholder or substitute trustee. Something more than \"obtaining an outcome favorable\" to Bayview and Equity was needed to find that BWW enjoyed the requisite \"identification in interest\" as to have effectively represented either Bayview's or Equity's legal right in the Injunction Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The circuit court noted that the proper and necessary defendant was not named or represented in the Injunction Action when it found that Equity was the trustee scheduled to conduct the Foreclosure Sale, and determined that \"injunctive relief is not warranted in this matter\" because \"[Lane] has failed to name [Equity] as a party to this action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The rights and liabilities of Bayview or Equity were not actually litigated in the Injunction Action, nor were they essential to the judgment rendered. The circuit court refused to grant the injunction because the trustee was not named as a party, and the circuit court recognized that the trustee's attorney could not be substituted as a party in the trustee's stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As regards BWW's role as a named party in the Injunction Action, there is no privity between BWW and Bayview or Equity because BWW's interest in the Injunction Action was not identical to the legal rights of Bayview or Equity. Because there was no privity between BWW and Equity or Bayview, and neither Bayview nor Equity was a party to the Injunction Action, the prior judgment and rulings obtained in the Injunction Action had no preclusive effect upon any claims or issues asserted in Lane's amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Claim and issue preclusion exist, in part, to prevent the same person from being \"twice vexed\" concerning the same cause of action. In this case, neither Bayview, Equity, nor Von Allman are \"twice vexed\" by the amended complaint because they were not parties, or in privity with the parties, named in the Injunction Action. In actuality, the Injunction Action was dismissed because Equity was not named as a party to the Injunction Action. The concerns against prolonging litigation are not implicated in this case, where Bayview's,\n   Equity's, Von Allman's, and Lane's mutual rights and obligations concerning the Foreclosure Sale have yet to be litigated on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The circuit court erred when it sustained Bayview's plea in bar of res judicata because Lane's amended complaint was not barred by either claim or issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the decisions of the circuit court granting Bayview's plea in bar of res judicata and dismissing Lane's amended complaint as to all defendants were in error. The judgments of the circuit court will be reversed and vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The noteholder changed from CitiFinancial, Inc. to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, in trust for the benefit of the Holders of CSB4a Grantor Trust 2015-3 Beneficial Interest Certificates, Series 2015-3, and then to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, for the Holders of CSBay4a Grantor Trust 2016-1 Beneficial Interest Certificates, Series 2016-1 (US Bank Trust).
