Chatham Street, Apartment #1, Newport, North Carolina; any individual located at that location during the execution of the search warrant; and any vehicle at that location, including a blue Jeep Compass. Detective Rose, after being duly sworn, stated in his application that there was probable cause to believe \"[h]eroin, scales, paraphernalia, packaging equipment, videos, photos, ledgers and documents\" related to illegal narcotics would be found at the named location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Detective Rose provided information concerning his training and experience as a law enforcement officer for twelve years. Specifically, Detective Rose swore that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   has been a Deputy Sheriff for 9 years and has been a Police K-9 Handler for 6 years with the Carteret County Sheriff's Office. The affiant also was a Police Officer for the Morehead City Police Department for 3 years. The affiant is currently assigned as a Detective with the Carteret County Sheriff's Office Narcotics Unit. The Affiant has been employed with the Carteret\n   County Sheriff's Office since January 2006. The Affiant has received training in the field of Narcotics Investigations and Criminal Interdiction Enforcement from Carteret and Craven Community College and other private and public training conferences and seminars. The Affiant has conducted and assisted in numerous criminal and narcotic investigations leading to arrests and convictions in [ ] trafficking different types of illegal narcotics, as well as crimes against persons, property crimes, both felony and misdemeanor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Detective Rose then provided a statement of facts establishing probable cause as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On 04/25/2017 at approximately 5:35 pm Detectives with the Carteret County Sheriff's Office, Jones County Sheriff's Office, and Havelock Police Department were conducting visual surveillance of a parking lot area located at 900 Old Fashioned Way in Newport, North Carolina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The name of the Apartment Complex is Compass Landing Apartments. During surveillance of the parking lot area Affiant of the Carteret County Sheriff's Office observed a blue in color Jeep Compass bearing a North Carolina Registration of \"BRITCP\" arrive in the parking lot area and park.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Affiant observed the occupants of the vehicle to be Brittany Elizabeth Tommasone as the driver and James Edward White Jr. as the front seat passenger of the vehicle. Affiant is familiar with Brittany Tommasone and James White Jr. from past dealings related to drug activity[,] including the sale of [i]llegal [n]arcotics. Affiant also had recent knowledge from 04/24/2017 that Britt[an]y Tommasone and James White Jr. were not residing at Compass Landing Apartments and have established a residence at 146. E. Chatham Street in Newport, North Carolina according to Brittany Tommaso[n]e and James White Jr.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Once the vehicle parked, Affiant observed a white female exit the passenger seat of a white in color Mercury Milan bearing a North Carolina Registration of \"DCP-1384.\" Once the white female exited the vehicle the female walked and entered the blue in color Jeep. After approximately thirty seconds the same female that recently entered the blue in color [J]eep exited the blue in color [J]eep and walked back to the original vehicle the female subject exited from which was the white in color Mercury passenger vehicle. Once the female subject entered the white in color Mercury passenger vehicle the vehicle began exiting the parking lot area along with the blue Jeep Compass that was occupied by Brittany Tommasone and James White Jr. There were no other occupants in the Jeep that were observed by Affiant. In Affiant's training and experience the actions observed by the occupants of the two vehicles were consistent with that of a [d]rug [d]eal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The facts that support the observation are the secluded location where the subjects met, previous knowledge of James White Jr. and Brittany Tommasone as participants in the active selling of illegal [n]arcotics, drug complaints the Carteret County Sheriff's Office had received about James White Jr. and Britt[an]y Tommaso[n]e, and the\n   duration of time spent inside of the Jeep once the female subject entered the Jeep from the time the female subject exited the Jeep. The two vehicles were traveling at a high rate of speed as the two vehicles were trailering one another out of the parking lot area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Once exiting the parking lot area both vehicles made a left hand turn near the Dollar General and began traveling towards US-70. Once approaching US-70 both vehicles turned right onto US-70 and began traveling east bound on US-70 still trailering one another. As both vehicles approached the intersection of US-70 and 9 Foot Road both vehicles merged into the left hand turning lane which merges from US-70 to Howard Blvd. Once the directional signal turned green the Jeep continued onto Howard Blvd. as the white in color Mercury made a U-Turn and began traveling west bound on US-70 towards Havelock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Affiant followed the white in color Mercury car on US-70 into Havelock where the vehicle made several lane changes without giving a turn signal. Detective Corey radioed to Affiant stating that the blue in color Jeep had driven back to 146 E. Chatham Street [A]partment 1[,] and that both occupants had exited the vehicle and entered the residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Moots had caught up to Affiant by this time and also observed several traffic violations made by the white Mercury vehicle and activated his emergency equipment on US-70 near McDonald's pva. The Mercury put on brakes as Detective Moots had activated his emergency equipment and slowly began to stop but continued rolling forward. Once the vehicle came to a complete stop on Webb Blvd just west of McDonald[']s Restaurant[,] Detective Moots, Henderson[,] and Affiant approached the vehicle and Affiant came into contact with the passenger later identified as Autumn Lynn Taylor as the front seat passenger and Allen Dellacava as the driver of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Affiant requested Autumn Taylor to exit the vehicle in which she complied. Once Autumn Taylor exited the vehicle Affiant asked who she had just met with in which Autumn Taylor replied James White. Affiant then asked Autumn Taylor if she had just recently purchased Heroin from James White due to the recent observations\n   observed in the Compass Landing parking lot area. Autumn Taylor responded that she purchased a twenty dollar bag of Heroin and snorted while traveling down the road and once finished she threw the Heroin baggie out the window. Detective Henderson was speaking with Dellacava during this time along with Detective Moots as Dellacava had already been requested to exit the vehicle and was explained the reasoning for the stop. Verbal consent was given by Dellacava to search Dellacava's person and Dellacava's vehicle in the presence of Detective Moots and Detective Henderson. During the duration of search of the vehicle[,] a Springfield XD 45 Caliber was located in the glove compartment area of the vehicle and was secured. After a short roadside inquiry[,] both occupants were released with strong reprimand and warning from Detective Henderson. Detective Henderson also informed Dellacava of the concealed weapon violation and the custody of the handgun was given back to Dellacava.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The search warrant was issued, and the search was conducted that same night. Tommasone, White, and Defendant were in the residence at that time. More than 41 grams of cocaine were seized from Defendant, along with drug paraphernalia, and approximately $900 in US Currency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant was indicted on October 9, 2017 for trafficking in cocaine. On July 3, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to suppress in which he argued the facts alleged in the affidavit were insufficient to support a finding of probable cause to obtain a search warrant for the Chatham Street Apartment. The trial court denied Defendant's motion to suppress, concluding the facts alleged in the affidavit were sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant for the Chatham Street residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant pleaded guilty to trafficking in cocaine while preserving his right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress. The trial court sentenced Defendant to 35 to 51 months in prison and ordered him to pay a $50,000.00 fine. Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Specifically, Defendant contends that the sworn affidavit provided by Detective Rose did not provide probable cause to issue the search warrant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A reviewing court is responsible for ensuring that the issuing magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding\n   that probable cause existed.

Detective Rose's affidavit stated that the officers observed the drug transaction in which Taylor purchased heroin from White. Taylor was then stopped by Detective Rose shortly after leaving the scene of the drug transaction. When asked, Taylor confirmed to Detective Rose that she had purchased \"a twenty dollar bag of heroin\" from White. At this point, officers had witnessed what they believed was a crime involving the sale of illegal drugs, and confirmed that a sale of heroin had occurred through Taylor's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the same time, Detective Corey followed the blue Jeep Compass to the residence at 146 E. Chatham Street. Based on the chronology set forth in the affidavit, before the traffic stop was initiated against Taylor, Detective Corey radioed Detective Rose and informed him that he observed Tommasone and White go into the apartment at that address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   From this information in the affidavit, the magistrate could reasonably infer that Tommasone and White traveled directly from the scene\n   of the drug transaction to the Chatham Street residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, it is reasonable to infer that Tommasone and White went to the residence with the twenty dollars Taylor admitted she used to obtain the heroin. This money was evidence of the drug transaction, and the magistrate could reasonably infer that this evidence would be present at the Chatham Street address. Thus, contrary to our dissenting colleague's assertion, there was a direct connection between the crime observed and the location to be searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even if we were to assume that money obtained from an illegal drug transaction was not evidence of a crime, there still existed sufficient inferences to establish a nexus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422722\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/369/292/#p294\">\n    369 N.C. at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=794%20S.E.2d%20301\">\n    794 S.E.2d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (nexus may be inferred to support a finding of probable cause even absent evidence \"directly link[ing] defendant's home with evidence of drug dealing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, it would also be reasonable to infer that the two drug dealers whom investigators had just observed sell heroin, and who were known by detectives to be involved in drug activity, would have other additional drugs or paraphernalia stored in their residence or vehicle. The practical considerations involved in selling quantities of heroin require that the product be cut, weighed, and packaged at some location. Common sense suggests that the blue Jeep Compass is not the ideal location for such activity, and that a residence is where this type of preparation would take place.

Chatham Street in Newport (\"Defendant's Apartment\" or \"the Chatham Street Apartment\"). Defendant was not named as the target of the search warrant application, although he was the only individual listed on the lease for the Chatham Street Apartment. The\n   search warrant application instead sought to search the Chatham Street Apartment for \"violations of possession of illegal narcotics\" by Brittany Tommasone and James White, Defendant's roommates at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the majority notes, the facts alleged in the search warrant application to support a finding of probable cause to search the Chatham Street Apartment were (1) that Defendant's roommates were seen selling narcotics to an individual at a different apartment complex, and (2) that they thereafter returned to the Chatham Street Apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his motion to suppress, Defendant argued that these allegations were insufficient to support a finding of probable cause that evidence of narcotics would also be found inside the\n   <em>\n    Chatham Street Apartment\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, Defendant noted that the affidavit \"included no information indicating that drugs had been possessed in or sold from [the Chatham Street Apartment], and failed to establish a nexus between his residence and the narcotics being sought.\" I agree that these circumstances warrant reversal of the trial court's denial of Defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Probable cause to search exists where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, in seeking authorization to search a particular location for contraband, the affidavit must include allegations of some facts or circumstances establishing a nexus between the identified premises and the presence of contraband; an affidavit that \"implicates [the] premises\n   <em>\n    solely as a conclusion of the affiant\n   </em>\n   \" is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8562900\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/282/125/#p129\">\n    282 N.C. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20S.E.2d%20752\">\n    191 S.E.2d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property is suspected of crime but that there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific 'things' to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Zurcher v.
