Banzhoff, for North Carolina Advocates for Justice, amicus curiae.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   HUDSON, Justice\n   This case comes to us by way of the State's appeal from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals holding that defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated when the State voluntarily dismissed defendant's charge after his first trial ended in a hung jury mistrial. Defendant was retried nearly six years later, after new evidence emerged. The State argues that jeopardy is deemed never to have attached because of the mistrial, so that defendant was not in jeopardy at the time that his second trial began. In the alternative, the State argues that, even if defendant remained in jeopardy following the mistrial, the State's voluntary dismissal without leave did not terminate that jeopardy and that the State was not barred from trying the defendant a second time. We are not persuaded by either of the State's arguments and, thus, affirm the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Today we recognize, in accordance with double jeopardy principles set out by this Court and the United States Supreme Court, that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and continues following a mistrial until a terminating event occurs. We hold that when the State enters a voluntary dismissal under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931 after jeopardy has attached, jeopardy is terminated in the defendant's favor, regardless of the reason the State gives for entering the dismissal. The State cannot then retry the case without violating a defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy. When the State dismisses a charge under section 15A-931 after jeopardy has attached, jeopardy terminates. Thus, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals vacating defendant's conviction on double jeopardy grounds and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was arrested on 2 November 2009 for the murder of James Carol Deberry, which was committed three days earlier on 31 October 2009; he was indicted on 30 November 2009. Defendant's trial began on 6 December 2010, at which point a jury was empaneled and evidence presented. On 9 December 2010, the trial court declared a mistrial after the jury foreperson reported that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked. Defendant was released the same day. Following the hung jury mistrial declaration, the trial court continued the case so the State could decide whether it would re-try defendant on the murder charge. The trial court held status hearings on 16 December 2010 and on 10 February 2011. The trial court's orders from both hearings noted that the case had ended in mistrial and that it would be continued to another status hearing for the\n   State to decide whether it intended to re-try defendant. Ultimately, the State entered a dismissal of the murder charge against defendant on 14 April 2011\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , by filing form AOC-CR-307 with the trial court. Like many similar forms, form AOC-CR-307 includes multiple options; the State may use the form to enter a dismissal, a dismissal with leave, or a notice of reinstatement for a case that had previously been dismissed with leave. The State left blank the sections for dismissal with leave and reinstatement but checked the box in the \"dismissal\" section next to the statement \"[t]he undersigned prosecutor enters a dismissal to the above charge(s) and assigns the following reasons.\" The State checked the box marked \"other\" in the list of reasons for dismissal and wrote underneath: \"hung jury, state has elected not to re-try case.\" In addition, the State modified a statement on the form to reflect the circumstances so that it reads: \"A jury has\n   <s>\n    not\n   </s>\n   been impaneled\n   <s>\n    nor\n   </s>\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   has evidence [sic] been introduced.\" The State's\n   voluntary dismissal of the charge was signed by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Several years passed, and the State discovered additional evidence related to the case. In 2013 and 2014, fingerprints and DNA from a cigarette found at the scene of the murder were found to belong to an individual named Ivan McFarland. A review of the cell phone activity for McFarland and defendant revealed that defendant had McFarland's cell phone number in his phone, that five calls had been made between the two phones on the night of the murder, and that cell phone tower data placed both men in the vicinity near where the murder occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A second warrant for defendant's arrest for murder was issued on 16 June 2015, and defendant was re-indicted on 6 July 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On 7 October 2016, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931, the voluntary dismissal statute, on estoppel and double jeopardy grounds, as well as a second motion to dismiss the murder charge for violating defendant's rights to a speedy trial under the state and federal constitutions. On 10 October 2016, the trial court in open court denied defendant's motion to dismiss based\n   on double jeopardy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was tried for the second time 31 October 2016 through 9 November 2016 in the Superior Court in Wake County. At that trial, the jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder, and the trial court sentenced defendant to between 220 and 273 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, where he argued that his right to be free from double jeopardy was violated when the State re-tried him on the same charge following its voluntary dismissal of the charge after defendant's first trial ended in a hung jury mistrial. In a unanimous opinion filed on 15 May 2018, the Court of Appeals agreed with defendant that his second prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, the State argues that, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant was tried once for this murder charge, jeopardy never attached under these circumstances, meaning that jeopardy attached for the first time when the jury was empaneled in the second trial. Second, the State contends that, even if jeopardy did attach when the jury was empaneled and sworn in the first trial, the prosecution's voluntary dismissal of the indictment under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931 was not an event that terminated jeopardy.

The State contends that the multiple statements by the Court appearing to embrace the doctrine of continuing jeopardy are\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    because a number of those cases did not squarely address the Double Jeopardy Clause's limits on prosecutors' ability to bring a second prosecution on the same charge following a declaration of a hung-jury mistrial that was not sought by the defendant. The State argues that even\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    's continuing jeopardy discussion is \"[a]rguably ... dictum because by finding a mistrial was not a terminating event, it was immaterial whether or not jeopardy had continued, as opposed to the case being placed back in the pre-trial posture[.]\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The second element of the State's argument that jeopardy did not attach appears to be as follows: because the U.S. Supreme Court, in the State's view, has not formally adopted the continuing jeopardy doctrine, this Court is free to follow its own precedent on the matter. The State further argues that this Court has explicitly held that upon the declaration of a hung jury mistrial, a legal fiction goes into effect under which jeopardy is deemed never to have attached at the first trial, meaning that no jeopardy exists to continue and eventually terminate. Thus, the State contends that, following his 2010 trial, defendant was placed in precisely the same position in which he stood before trial, and it was only when the jury was empaneled at defendant's second trial in 2016 that jeopardy first attached. We find both components of the State's proffered theory that defendant was not in jeopardy at the time of the mistrial to be wholly without merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court stated multiple times that jeopardy, which existed prior to a mistrial, does not terminate following the\n    mistrial. The Court in\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    \"reaffirm[ed] the proposition that a trial court's declaration of a mistrial following a hung jury is not an event that terminates\n    <em>\n     the original jeopardy to which petitioner was subjected\n    </em>\n    ,\" and reiterated that \"\n    <em>\n     jeopardy does not terminate when the jury is discharged\n    </em>\n    because it is unable to agree.\"\n    <em>\n     Richardson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/#p326\">\n     468 U.S. at 326\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/#p326\">\n     104 S.

Ed. 2d at 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphases added). The State argues, however, that merely because the\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    Court held that \"jeopardy does not terminate\" following a hung jury mistrial \"does not necessarily mean that jeopardy had continued\" because, under the State's theory, jeopardy would not terminate because jeopardy would no longer be deemed in effect. While this is a creative argument, it is foreclosed by a commonsense reading of\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    First, the\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    Court clearly contemplates the continuation of jeopardy at the time of the mistrial. If the Court had intended to say that jeopardy, which attaches when the jury is empaneled, can-only in the singular context of a hung jury mistrial-be retroactively deemed never to have attached, it could have done so. Instead, the Court stated that the\n    <em>\n     original jeopardy\n    </em>\n    did not terminate, thus signaling that jeopardy continued. We see no logical interpretation of the Court's declaration in\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    that the original jeopardy did not terminate other than to acknowledge that the original jeopardy\n    <em>\n     continued\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Second, the outcome and legal significance of\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    cannot be separated from its text. The continuing jeopardy doctrine reaffirmed by\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    provided a rationale for the longstanding practice of permitting\n    retrial following a hung jury mistrial that was consistent with the guarantee of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/#p326\">\n     468 U.S. at 324\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/#p326\">\n     104 S.

Our ruling in\n    <em>\n     Lachat\n    </em>\n    was a fact-specific determination that the trial court had erred in declaring a mistrial before making a proper determination on whether the jury was, in fact, hopelessly deadlocked.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 84-85,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20S.E.2d%20872\">\n     343 S.E.2d at 878\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Thus, the Court opined that following a properly declared mistrial, including a mistrial declared due to a hopelessly deadlocked jury, \"in legal contemplation there has been no trial.\" Because\n    <em>\n     Lachat\n    </em>\n    explicitly involved an\n    <em>\n     improperly\n    </em>\n    declared mistrial, any discussion of the consequences stemming from a\n    <em>\n     properly\n    </em>\n    declared mistrial is not conclusive on this point. More importantly, the \"no trial\" language quoted in\n    <em>\n     Lachat\n    </em>\n    again falls far short of declaring that a defendant in such a situation has not been placed in jeopardy. Nor could this Court have made such a statement, given that, just two years\n    earlier, the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    had embraced the doctrine that jeopardy continues following a hung jury mistrial.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    This Court's prior statements that \"in legal contemplation there has been no trial\" were made in the context of explaining why the State is permitted to retry a defendant following a properly declared mistrial, which was also the context for the U.S. Supreme Court's embrace of the continuing jeopardy doctrine in\n    <em>\n     Richardson\n    </em>\n    . The State contends that \"[i]f a hung jury creates the legal fiction that 'there has been no trial,' then by definition a jury was never empaneled and defendant was never placed in jeopardy.\" But in our view the State reads this explanatory phrase from our prior opinions too expansively. Contrary to the State's view, this Court did not with those eight words adopt an exception to the longstanding rule recognized by this Court and the United States Supreme Court that jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled, nor did we hold that a legal fiction acts to invalidate the jeopardy that a defendant, even one who is later retried, did in fact experience at a first trial.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    The State argues that \"the continuing jeopardy doctrine ... is a slender reed upon which to base a determination that defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated.\" On the contrary, we conclude that this century-old statement from this Court is a \"slender reed\" intended only to explain the State's ability to re-try a defendant following a mistrial. This Court has not adopted an elaborate legal fiction under which jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and then simply ceases to apply when the trial court declares a mistrial. This Court has not embraced the proposition proffered by the State and does not do so today. Instead, relying upon the commonsense meaning of binding Supreme Court precedents, we reaffirm that jeopardy continues following a mistrial until the occurrence of a jeopardy-terminating event.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Because we conclude that the original jeopardy continued following defendant's mistrial, we turn to the second part of our analysis and consider whether the State's subsequent dismissal of defendant's murder indictment terminated the original jeopardy, such that defendant's second trial placed him in jeopardy a second time in violation of both the federal and state constitutions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     II. Voluntary Dismissal Terminating Jeopardy\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Defendant concedes that the State, under the doctrine of continuing jeopardy, could have retried him following the mistrial without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause. He argues, however, that the State's unilateral decision to enter a voluntary dismissal of the murder indictment under\n    N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931 after jeopardy had attached was an event that terminated defendant's original jeopardy, thus preventing the State from subsequently retrying him. We hold that where, as here, the State dismisses a charge under section 15A-931 after jeopardy has attached, a defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy under the federal and state constitutions is violated if the State initiates a subsequent prosecution on the same charge. Thus, we affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that the State's dismissal of a charge under section 15A-931 is binding on the state and is tantamount to an acquittal, making it a jeopardy-terminating event for double jeopardy purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    North Carolina has two statutes governing the State's ability to voluntarily dismiss charges, either with or without leave to reinstate those charges. Section 15A-931 of the General Statutes (\"Voluntary dismissal of criminal charges by the State.\") reads as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    Except as provided in G.S. 20-138.4,\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    the prosecutor may dismiss any charges stated in a criminal pleading including those deferred for prosecution by entering an oral dismissal in open court before or during the trial, or by filing a written dismissal with the clerk at any time. The clerk must record the dismissal entered by the prosecutor and note in the case file whether a jury has been impaneled or evidence has been introduced.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931(a) (2017).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    By contrast, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-932 (\"Dismissal with leave when defendant fails to appear and cannot be readily found or pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement.\") allows a prosecutor to dismiss charges with leave to reinstate them under specific circumstances. Under section 15A-932,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    The prosecutor may enter a dismissal with leave for nonappearance when a defendant:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    (1) Cannot be readily found to be served with an order for arrest after the grand jury had indicted him; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    (2) Fails to appear at a criminal proceeding at which his attendance is required, and the prosecutor believes the defendant cannot be readily found.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-932(a) (2017) and\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    The prosecutor may enter a dismissal with leave pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of Article 82 of this Chapter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20S.E.%20456\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 15A-932(a1). A prosecutor may reinstate charges dismissed with leave under these provisions upon apprehension of a defendant who previously could not be found or if a defendant fails to comply with the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20S.E.%20456\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 15A-932(d), (e).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Section 15A-932 establishes a few specifically enumerated circumstances in which the State may dismiss a charge with leave to refile, such that a dismissal under this statute does not necessarily contemplate the\n    end of the prosecution. All other voluntary dismissals entered by the State are governed by section 15A-931. In\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     v. Lamb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2569966\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/633/#p641\">\n     321 N.C. 633\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 641,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20S.E.2d%20600\">\n     365 S.E.2d 600\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 604 (1988) we contrasted the effect of these two provisions, nothing that section 15A-931 provides \"a simple and final dismissal which terminates the criminal proceedings under that indictment\" (citing N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931 official cmt.) while a dismissal under section 15A-932 \"results in removal of the case from the court's docket, but the criminal proceeding under the indictment is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    terminated.\" (emphasis in original). Before a defendant has been tried, \"[s]ection 15A-931 does not bar the bringing of the same charges upon a new indictment,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20S.E.2d%20600\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    but, even in a pre-attachment context, the key characteristic of a dismissal entered under 15A-931 is its finality. In the context of an analysis of the now-repealed Speedy Trial Act in\n    <em>\n     Lamb\n    </em>\n    , we noted that the finality provided by the statute precluded consideration of any time that accrued between the time when a first indictment was dismissed under section 15A-931 and a new indictment was secured for purposes of a statutory speedy trial claim; by contrast, no such consequence\n    resulted from a section 15A-932 dismissal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    It appears that the legislature contemplated the possibility that a dismissal under section 15A-931 might have double jeopardy implications and, further, that the State might enter a voluntary dismissal sometime other than during the middle of a trial. Section 15A-931(a) dictates that \"[t]he clerk must record the dismissal entered by the prosecutor\n    <em>\n     and note in the case file whether a jury has been impaneled or evidence has been introduced\n    </em>\n    \" and directs that the State may dismiss a charge \"by entering an oral dismissal in open court before or during the trial, or by filing a written dismissal with the clerk\n    <em>\n     at any time\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphases added). The State suggested at oral argument that the statutory language contemplating the attachment of jeopardy was intended only to ward against the double jeopardy implications of a voluntary dismissal entered by the State\n    <em>\n     mid-trial\n    </em>\n    . But this contention is undermined by the specific language in the statute authorizing entry of a dismissal before a trial, during a trial, or\n    <em>\n     at any time\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    While the text of section 15A-931 fully supports the conclusion that the legislature intended a dismissal under this section to have such a\n    degree of finality that double jeopardy protections would come into play, this reading finds further support in the official commentary to the statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

No discussion at all of a first-degree rape charge occurred until after the close of all evidence, when the prosecutor proposed an instruction on first-degree rape.\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , 317 N.C. at 491,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=346%20S.E.2d%20657\">\n     346 S.E.2d at 659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In our decision vacating defendant's conviction for first-degree rape, we held that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    by unequivocally arraigning the defendant on second-degree rape and by failing thereafter to give\n    <em>\n     any notice whatsoever\n    </em>\n    , prior to the jury being impaneled and jeopardy attaching, of an intent instead to pursue a conviction for first-degree rape arguably supported by the short-form indictment, the State made a binding election not to pursue the greater degree of the offense, and such election was tantamount to an acquittal of first-degree rape.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 494,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=346%20S.E.2d%20657\">\n     346 S.E.2d at 661\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original).\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While the State correctly notes that this case presents a different circumstance from that detailed in\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , it does not adequately explain why a prosecutor's unilateral, post-attachment decision to terminate the entire prosecution should be\n    <em>\n     less\n    </em>\n    binding on the State than its post-attachment decision to pursue a lesser charge. By making the unilateral choice to enter a final dismissal of defendant's murder charge after jeopardy had attached, the State made a binding decision not to retry the case. Thus, we conclude that the State's post-attachment dismissal of defendant's indictment was tantamount to, or the functional equivalent of, an acquittal, which terminated the original jeopardy that had continued following the declaration of a hung jury mistrial in defendant's case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    At his first trial, defendant was unquestionably placed in jeopardy, which continued after his first trial ended with a hung jury mistrial. As explained by the continuing jeopardy doctrine, the mistrial was not a terminating event that deprived the State of the opportunity to retry defendant. Rather, as defendant acknowledges, the State at that time could have tried defendant again on the existing charge without violating his double jeopardy rights. Instead of exercising that opportunity to retry defendant, the State entered a final dismissal of the charge, unilaterally and irrevocably terminating the prosecution and, with it, defendant's original jeopardy. Under the Double Jeopardy Clause, the State was then barred from retrying defendant for the same crime.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Because defendant's jeopardy remained attached following the mistrial declaration in his first trial and was terminated when the State subsequently entered a dismissal of the charge under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931, we conclude that defendant's second prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss his 2015 murder indictment on double jeopardy grounds. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals' decision vacating defendant's murder conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-145\">\n     Because we recognize that the State may proceed with a retrial when a defendant secures the relief of a new trial after an original conviction is vacated on appeal, the dissent's assertion that our holding \"would also apply to cases reversed on appeal\" is incorrect. Our holding is limited to the facts presented here.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-146\">\n     At oral argument, counsel for the State instead argued that jeopardy \"unattaches,\" a phenomenon that the State specifically disclaims in its brief.\n     <em>\n      Compare\n     </em>\n     New Brief for the State at 8,\n     <em>\n      State v.

Procedurally, the subsequent new trial has all the same stages as the original one, including a pretrial stage. A dismissal during the pretrial stage does not prevent a subsequent re-indictment and retrial. The majority ignores these general\n    principles and, by its holding, makes North Carolina an outlier in the country. Guided by a misapplication of the concept of continuing jeopardy, the majority effectively eliminates a complete, new trial after a mistrial (or reversal on appeal), removing any pretrial proceedings. Under its theory, once jeopardy attaches with the first trial, it continues, affecting everything that occurs thereafter. The majority's interpretation of continuing jeopardy means any motion\n    or dismissal after a mistrial is treated as if made midtrial. Thus, after a mistrial, a pretrial dismissal is deemed an acquittal. Because of the majority's hyper-technical application of its view of the continuing jeopardy theory, defendant's murder conviction is vacated, and he goes free. The fundamental right against being tried twice for the same crime does not require this outcome.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The State's dismissal here does not address defendant's guilt or innocence and therefore is not the functional equivalent of a jury verdict of acquittal. Regardless of which abstract legal theory of jeopardy informs this Court, it should not stray from the fundamental concepts governing mistrials and double jeopardy. The mistrial here returned the criminal proceedings to a pretrial status and allowed for a dismissal of the charge without prejudice. This approach is consistent with the long-established precedent of the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court that, after a mistrial, the trial process \"proceed[s] anew,\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Thereafter, defendant was properly re-indicted and retried, resulting in the jury convicting defendant of murder; that conviction is now judicially erased. Allowing the State to take a pretrial dismissal after a mistrial and subsequently to retry defendant does not offend the safeguard against double jeopardy. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In 2009 the State charged defendant with the first-degree murder of James Deberry based in part on Deberry's dying statement after being shot. On 6 December 2010, defendant's trial began. Three days later, the trial court declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. On 16 December 2010, the trial court issued a judgment form noting \"\n    <em>\n     Mistrial\n    </em>\n    Con't to next Status Hearing for State to decide if case to be retried.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    On 14 April 2011, the State dismissed the murder charge against defendant by filing the standard Form AOC-CR-307 in accordance with N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931, circling \"Dismissal\" in handwriting, rather than \"Notice of Reinstatement,\" on the form. The form has no checkbox to indicate a mistrial, and the State selected the fourth checkbox option \"Other:\n    <em>\n     (specify)\n    </em>\n    ,\" and specified below \"hung jury, State has elected not to re-try case.\" The State noted that, in the mistrial, \"A jury has not been impaneled nor and has [sic] evidence been introduced.\" Notably, the State did not check any box on the form that could signify a finding of defendant's guilt or innocence despite having these checkbox options:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    \"No crime is charged\"; \"insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution\"; and defendant \"agreed to plead guilty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The State obtained more evidence linking defendant to Deberry's death and, on 6 July 2015, a grand jury issued a new indictment against defendant for first-degree murder. Before his second trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the new indictment on double jeopardy grounds. On 7 November 2018, the jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    On appeal defendant conceded, and the majority agrees, that the State could retry him on the mistried murder charge without transgressing double jeopardy protections. The Court of Appeals held, and now a majority of this Court holds, that the prosecutor's post-mistrial voluntary dismissal of the original murder indictment possessed \"the same constitutional finality and conclusiveness as an acquittal.\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Courtney\n    </em>\n    , --- N.C.App. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12651602\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/817/412/#p422\">\n     817 S.E.2d 412\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 414 (2018). Thus, defendant's second trial put him in jeopardy twice for the same charge in violation of the principles of double jeopardy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In affirming the Court of Appeals, the majority holds\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    that when the State enters a voluntary dismissal under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931 after jeopardy has attached, jeopardy is terminated in the defendant's favor, regardless of the reason the State gives for entering the dismissal. The State cannot then retry the case without violating a defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy. When the State dismisses a charge under section 15A-931 after jeopardy has attached, jeopardy terminates.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In its view, once jeopardy attaches with the empaneling of the first jury, jeopardy infects each aspect of the proceeding thereafter, even after a mistrial. Thus, the majority \"hold[s] that where, as here, the State dismisses a charge under section 15A-931 after jeopardy has attached, a defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy under the federal and state constitutions is violated if the State initiates a subsequent prosecution on the same charge.\" Of note, its analysis would also apply to cases reversed on appeal. The majority attempts to support this position by misapplying precedent from the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The majority's hyper-technical application of the \"continuing jeopardy\" theory is flawed because it does not ask the correct fundamental question: After a mistrial, are the parties returned to the same position\n    procedurally as before the original trial? If so, there is a procedural pretrial period during which the State can take a voluntary dismissal. At this stage, no jury is currently empaneled; various pretrial proceedings must occur. Precedent from the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court indicates that, after a mistrial, the proceeding returns to a pretrial status. Thus, a dismissal following a mistrial and before a new jury is empaneled is a pretrial dismissal which is not akin to an acquittal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The majority's approach confuses defendant with \"an\n    <em>\n     acquitted\n    </em>\n    defendant [who] may not be retried\" regardless of the reason for the acquittal.\n    <em>\n     Arizona v.

Under the majority's reasoning, because jeopardy attached in defendant's original mistrial, the State's dismissal following the mistrial occurred during \"jeopardy\" and thus is treated as a midtrial dismissal. The majority overlooks the mistrial principle that the \"jeopardy\" of the mistrial does not preclude a retrial. The initial jury was discharged, and a new trial must take place to put defendant at risk of conviction. Before the new trial began, during the new pretrial phase, the State could dismiss the\n    pending indictment without being prohibited from re-indicting and retrying defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The statute clearly governs voluntary dismissals at trials generally and does not, on its face, even address the unique circumstances involved in a mistrial. Moreover, the form associated with the statute does not specifically include nor contemplate the procedure following a mistrial. The State signified defendant's first trial terminated with a hung jury by handwriting and without suggesting any substantive or conclusive finding on defendant's guilt or innocence. The dismissal here is not substantive; it does not speak to defendant's guilt or innocence and cannot be equated to an acquittal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    By the statute's text and application, it is unlikely that the General Assembly intended it to place North Carolina outside the longstanding double jeopardy principles that govern mistrials. It is more likely that the General Assembly intended to abolish a specific procedure that threatened a defendant's right to a speedy trial when an indictment remained pending against him and to prevent prosecutorial efforts to dismiss a case midtrial in hope of procuring a more favorable jury. Double jeopardy concerns that may arise in a midtrial dismissal simply do not arise in the pretrial stages. Even under a continuing jeopardy theory of mistrials, a nonsubstantive voluntary dismissal by the State does not preclude a retrial following a mistrial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beckwith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478800\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/615/1134/#p1135\">\n     615 So. 2d at 1148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . A prosecutor can dismiss an indictment following a mistrial under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-931, in keeping with defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial, without compromising the State's undeniable right to retry a mistried case should new evidence surface.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    It is indisputable that the State can enter a pretrial section 15A-931 dismissal and later re-indict. The majority places the State in the impossible position of choosing to proceed to a new trial with what one jury deemed insufficient evidence or lose any opportunity to hold the defendant accountable for the crime. Instead of rushing to a retrial, the ends of justice may be best served by waiting. Over time, as with this case, new witnesses may come forward or improvements may be made in forensic evidence testing. The new evidence might exonerate the defendant or implicate him. A pretrial dismissal, whether during the initial stage or during the pretrial stage after mistrial, can serve the ends of justice. Thereafter, as with this defendant and with Beckwith, armed with new evidence the State can retry the defendant even years later.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The majority's reliance on the State's election rule, as described in\n    <em>\n     State v.

In that case the trial proceeded on a charge of second-degree rape; however, at the close of evidence, the State proposed a jury instruction on first-degree rape, and the trial court gave that instruction.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 491,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=346%20S.E.2d%20657\">\n     346 S.E.2d at 659-60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Conclusion\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Does a mistrial result in a new proceeding with a pretrial period? The clear language from this Court says that, following a mistrial, \"the jury has been discharged ... [and] in legal contemplation there has been no trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Tyson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11270113\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/138/627/#p629\">\n     138 N.C. at 629\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20S.E.%20456\">\n     50 S.E. at 456\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Likewise, the Supreme\n    Court of the United\n    States says the proceeding begins anew after a mistrial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scott\n    </em>\n    , 437 U.S. at 92, 98 S. Ct. at 2194, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 75. Thus, the dismissal here was a pretrial dismissal, which is not an acquittal, and the State is not barred from proceeding with a new indictment and trial. The majority's hyper-technical misapplication of the \"continuing jeopardy\" theory is not supported by applicable law and results in a convicted murderer being freed.
