This appeal requires us to examine in full light the defense and the language trial courts use when explaining it to juries, focusing on when a defendant who is engaged in unlawful conduct may still be entitled to the defense. While we conclude the charge given here was sufficient, we propose a recommended charge for future cases. We also hold the trial court erred by admitting a family photograph of Jarrod Howard (Victim) in violation of Rule 403 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence (SCRE), but find the error harmless. We therefore affirm appellant Ahshaad Mykiel Owens' convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Owens shot Victim while he, Victim, and Victim's best friend, Hunter Bessinger, were transacting a drug deal in the back seat of a\n   parked car near the intersection of Percy and\n   Bogard streets in Charleston. Bessinger testified Owens pulled a gun on him and Victim and shot Victim in the back when Victim tried to flee. Testifying in his own defense, Owens stated Bessinger entered the car first and sat in the middle of the back seat next to him, while Victim got in second and sat next to Bessinger. Owens explained he told Victim he wanted to purchase five Xanax pills, and Victim told him the price. According to Owens, as he reached into his book bag to retrieve his wallet, Bessinger pointed a gun in his face and demanded Owens hand him the book bag. Owens testified he knocked the gun out of Bessinger's hand and, as he wrestled the gun from Bessinger, he accidentally fired the gun, hitting Victim. Owens testified he did not bring a gun to the scene (no gun was ever found).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial judge instructed the jury on murder, involuntary manslaughter, self-defense, accident, and armed robbery. Regarding accident, the judge instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant has also raised the defense of accident. An act may be excluded on the ground of accident if it is shown that the act was unintentional, that the defendant was acting lawfully, and that reasonable care was used by the defendant in handling the weapon. The burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that th[e] act was not an accident ... but was caused by the negligence or carelessness on the part of the defendant in [the] handling of a dangerous instrumentality or by unlawful activity by the defendant himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Owens objected to the instruction, arguing the jury might interpret it to mean Owens could not claim accident because he was involved in the unlawful activity of a drug deal (although neither the State nor Owens mentioned such an interpretation in their closing arguments). Owens requested the trial judge clarify to the jury that a defendant engaged in unlawful activity is still entitled to the defense of accident unless the unlawful activity proximately caused the death. The judge declined, explaining it would be an impermissible comment on the facts and he had adequately charged the elements of the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury convicted Owens of murder, armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent\n   crime. He now appeals, contending the trial court erred in (1) refusing his request for specific language in a jury instruction on the defense of accident, and (2) admitting a photograph of Victim in violation of Rule 403, SCRE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Owens claims the trial court's accident charge did not adequately convey the scope and meaning of the term \"unlawful activity\" and explain its relation to the defense of accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review jury instructions for abuse of discretion, meaning that to warrant reversal the instruction must have both misstated the law and prejudiced the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the harm was caused by accident, the defendant is not criminally responsible because of the absence of criminal intent. It is precisely this lack of intent that separates accident from self-defense, for self-defense \"admits an intentional killing, and sets up as justification a necessity to kill in order to save the accused from death or serious bodily harm, whereas a defense of homicide by accident denies that the killing was intentional.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defense of accident sometimes surfaces in homicide cases, often alongside self-defense.

Blackstone gives the example of a man lawfully working with a hatchet when the head flies off and kills a bystander. 4 W. BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *182.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The confusion in explaining the defense of accident crops up when no distinction is made between a defendant who has lawfully armed himself with a weapon in self-defense and then accidentally harms the victim (e.g., he stumbles and his finger slips and pulls the trigger) and a defendant who has lawfully armed himself with a weapon in self-defense and then intentionally harms the victim. Only the defendant in the former situation is entitled to the defense of accident, and he is also entitled to have the jury charged that his conduct in arming himself in self-defense was lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Layered upon this is the rule that the defense fails if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's unlawful activity proximately caused the harm.\n   <em>\n    State v. Goodson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828752\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/312/278/\">\n    312 S.C. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828752\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/312/278/\">\n    440 S.E.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 n.1 (1994). The confusion deepens when the defendant's unlawful activity (e.g., pointing and presenting a firearm) is so intertwined with a lawful activity (self-defense) that the conduct may appear indivisible. Whether the shooting was caused by the lawful or the unlawful activity is an issue that would vex jurors as well as philosophers.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   W.

As\n   <em>\n    McCaskill\n   </em>\n   explained in such situations, because \"the defense of accident is not applicable unless the defendant was acting\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   , it is necessary to instruct the jury as to what constitutes a lawful enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    McCaskill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2172166\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/300/256/#p258\">\n    300 S.C. at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2172166\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/300/256/#p258\">\n    387 S.E.2d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Burriss\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McCaskill\n   </em>\n   , the \"lawful enterprise\" was self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The situation here is different. Under Owens' version of events, he did not possess the gun until he grabbed it to arm himself in self-defense. He did not ask the court to clarify that arming himself was lawful conduct; he asked the court to specify what his unlawful conduct was and that, to preclude his accident defense, it must have caused Victim's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We share the trial court's concern that Owens' requested clarification may have approached a comment on the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C.

The charge as given informed the jury that to bar the defense of accident, the State bore the burden of proving that the \"act\" (i.e., the shooting) was caused by the defendant's unlawful activity. Again, it appears Owens wanted the trial court to tell the jury that the fact he was involved in a drug deal does not, without more, prevent him from being found not guilty based on the defense of accident.

In crafting jury instructions, as in any architecture, less is often more. But as Frank Lloyd Wright is reputed to have said, \"less is more only when more is too much.\" It is the trial court's job to explain the general principles of law raised by the evidence to the jury; it is the lawyers' job to explain to the jury how the specific facts in evidence relate to those general principles. We recommend the following language when instructing jurors on the defense of accident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant has raised the defense of accident. Harm to another, including death, is excusable on the ground of accident if the harm was caused by the unintentional and lawful act of a defendant exercising due care. For the defense of accident to apply, you must find: (1) the act of the defendant that caused the harm was accidental and not intentional; (2) the act was lawful; and (3) the act was not careless, negligent, or reckless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   If you find the defense of accident applies, you must find the defendant not guilty. However, if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the three elements of the defense of accident do not apply, then the defendant is not entitled to the defense. A defendant engaged in unlawful conduct, including the unlawful possession of a weapon, is entitled to claim the defense of accident unless the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the unlawful conduct was not merely incidental to but was the direct and foreseeable cause of the Victim's harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When the evidence supports an accident charge on behalf of a defendant who has lawfully armed himself in self-defense, we suggest the following additional instruction consistent with\n   <em>\n    Burriss\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McCaskill\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A defendant exercising due care who accidentally harms another while acting in self-defense is acting lawfully. Therefore, a defendant can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if you find he was entitled to arm himself in self-defense and the victim was shot by accident by the unintentional discharge of the weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court, over Owens' objection, admitted a photograph of Victim embracing his brother in a setting unrelated to the shooting. The State argues the photograph was relevant because it showed Victim's size, evidence that bore on how the crime unfolded. The State contends that, given the available space in the back seat of the car, Victim's size was relevant to the jury's fact-finding task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   What little relevance the photograph had was vastly outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice. Rule 403, SCRE. Victim's identity was not at issue and the photograph did not depict an objective measure of his size; Victim's actual height and weight were included in the autopsy results the jury heard. All the photograph could accomplish was to counteract testimony that Victim was\n   selling Owens drugs when he was shot, and arouse sympathy for Victim. The trial court therefore exceeded its discretion in admitting it.\n   <em>\n    Morin v.

Viewing the record as a whole, it is unlikely the emotional pull of the photograph was enough to distract a rational juror from the main issues at trial or otherwise influence the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   One reason the photograph should have been excluded under Rule 403 was because it had scant relevance to the jury's task of determining the germane facts. Our conclusion that the evidence was unduly prejudicial within the context of Rule 403 does not mean the prejudice was potent enough to infect the fairness of the trial or pollute the verdict. The prejudice, like the relevance it dwarfed, had little effect when considered alongside the other evidence. Owens admitted he shot Victim, so the only issue for the jury was whether Owens was guilty of the lesser involuntary manslaughter offense or whether he was entitled to acquittal based on self-defense or the defense of accident. This issue turned on Owens' credibility and intent, a subject a family photograph of Victim could not directly impact. Any error, therefore, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Hawes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12650664\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/813/513/#p129\">\n    423 S.C. at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12650664\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/813/513/#p129\">\n    813 S.E.2d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Error is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Owens' convictions are\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   KONDUROS and MCDONALD, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
