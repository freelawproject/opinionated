Prior to accepting his pleas, the trial court engaged in a thorough colloquy with Trevathan to ensure he understood the charges against him, the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty and the consequence of his pleas and that he was pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because he was, in fact, guilty. That having been established, the court accepted the pleas and found Trevathan guilty. The court did not make an oral statement finding Trevathan's pleas were knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, but that finding is specifically included on all his felony conviction orders.\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n    The Court of Appeals rejected Trevathan's argument that, because the trial court did not find his pleas were knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, his convictions were void. Further, because the record demonstrates they were, in fact, knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, the Court of Appeals determined Trevathan waived his \"right to appeal.\" Rather than deny the appeal, as it has done both before and since dismissing this case, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, citing\n    <em>\n     Hill v.
