Prior to accepting his pleas, the trial court engaged in a thorough colloquy with Trevathan to ensure he understood the charges against him, the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty and the consequence of his pleas and that he was pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because he was, in fact, guilty. That having been established, the court accepted the pleas and found Trevathan guilty. The court did not make an oral statement finding Trevathan's pleas were knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, but that finding is specifically included on all his felony conviction orders.</p><p id=\"p-8\">The Court of Appeals rejected Trevathan's argument that, because the trial court did not find his pleas were knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, his convictions were void. Further, because the record demonstrates they were, in fact, knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, the Court of Appeals determined Trevathan waived his \"right to appeal.\" Rather than deny the appeal, as it has done both before and since dismissing this case, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, citing <em>Hill v. Commonwealth</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1023951\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/47/667/#p676\">47 Va. App. 667</extracted-citation>, 676, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635176,1023951\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/626/459/\">626 S.E.2d 459</extracted-citation> (2006). This was error.</p><p id=\"p-9\">A voluntary and intelligent guilty plea is a \"waiver\" of all non-jurisdictional defects that occurred before entry of the plea. <em>Miles v. Sheriff of the Va. Beach City Jail</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"622314\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/266/110/#p113\">266 Va. 110</extracted-citation>, 113-14, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20S.E.2d%20191\">581 S.E.2d 191</extracted-citation> (2003). \"Although the range of potential grounds for appeal following a guilty plea is limited in Virginia, a defendant who has pled guilty still retains the statutory right to file a notice of appeal and present a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals of Virginia.\" <em>Id.</em> at 116, <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20S.E.2d%20191\">581 S.E.2d 191</extracted-citation> (citing Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-406 and -407). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in determining Trevathan's guilty pleas waived his \"right to appeal.\"</p><p id=\"p-10\">Further, when entry of a guilty plea waives an issue for appeal, the correct disposition is denial, not dismissal. <em>Cf.</em> <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"67397\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/267/302/#p316\">267 Va. 302</extracted-citation>, 316-17, <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20S.E.2d%20220\">593 S.E.2d 220</extracted-citation> (2004) (affirming convictions and death sentence without dismissing any portion of the appeal where appellant's guilty pleas waived some of the issues raised on appeal); <em>Walton v.
