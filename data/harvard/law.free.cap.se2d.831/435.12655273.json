(Tyre), Hugh's company. The trial court also awarded Hugh attorney's fees and held Karp personally liable for the verdict. Karp appeals these rulings, which we now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Some eight months before her death, Deborah Dereede (Deborah), Karp's mother, executed a revocable trust. She named herself trustee and designated Karp as successor trustee. The only asset in the trust was a home located in Lake Wylie, South Carolina, which Deborah put on the market for sale a few months later. Several months after Deborah's death, Karp sold the house, netting $356,242.86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal turns on the following trust provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   As soon as practicable following my death, my Trustee shall sell the house and lot located at 131 WHISPERING PINES DR., LAKE WYLIE, SC 29710. The sales proceeds shall be used first to pay off any mortgage against the property, and second to pay off that certain promissory note given by me to TYRE DEALER NETWORK CONSULTANTS, INC. Said promissory note, at the time of the execution of my Trust, is in the amount of $250,000.00, but in no event shall the amount due exceed one-half of the sales price of the property. After payoff of said mortgage and said note, my Trustee shall then distribute one-half of the remaining net sales proceeds to HUGH DEREEDE, outright and free of trust. The other one-half of the remaining net sales proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the Articles that follow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the sale of the house closed, Hugh demanded immediate payment of his and Tyre's share of the proceeds. Karp, who was also the personal representative of Deborah's estate, believed she could not distribute the proceeds until she was certain of the net assets of the trust and the estate, and the time for creditor's claims had expired. Hugh would not be\n   delayed, however, and filed this action in the probate court seeking a declaratory judgment for immediate payment. After procedural sparring, Karp removed the case to circuit court. She continued to refuse Hugh's distribution request but now also claimed that, by suing her, Hugh and Tyre had triggered the trust's no-contest clause thereby forfeiting their right to the proceeds. In the event of such a forfeiture, the disputed monies would go to Karp and her siblings as remainder beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ten months into the litigation, Karp appointed, with Hugh's consent, Catherine H. Kennedy as trust protector as contemplated by the trust. Kennedy filed a report concluding Karp was justified in waiting on any creditor's claims to clear before making any trust distributions and that the issues of whether Karp exercised good faith in invoking the no contest clause and whether probable\n   cause supported Hugh and Tyre's claims should be decided by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Karp and Hugh testified at the bench trial. Karp called Kennedy as a witness, while Hugh presented S. Alan Medlin as his expert. The trial court ruled (1) Karp breached her fiduciary duty by not timely distributing the house sale proceeds to Tyre and Hugh; (2) Hugh had probable cause to bring this action, and therefore the no contest clause did not apply; (3) because Tyre was a creditor, the no contest clause was inapplicable to it; and (4) Tyre and Hugh were entitled to attorney's fees and costs from Karp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because a breach of fiduciary duty claim can be legal or equitable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verenes v.

Such a delay is common and often required in the probate of a person's estate, but as Medlin testified, the unique trust provision here required expedited distribution to Tyre and Hugh. Medlin acknowledged Karp's position was understandable and not one of bad faith, for \u00a7 62-3-505(a)(3) makes revocable trust assets subject to probate claims if the probate estate is insufficient to pay its creditors. But, as Medlin emphasized, Karp risked no personal liability by following Deborah's intent to expedite distribution\n   of the house sale proceeds, as the Trust Code insulated her and allowed creditors to follow the money and recover against the distributee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2062-7-604\">\n    S.C.

He also testified the trust provision at issue was an expression of Deborah's intent that the distributions to Tyre and Hugh be given priority and expedited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We emphasize our holding is limited to the specific facts of this case and the specific language of this trust provision, which was part of an eighty page trust document that both Kennedy and Medlin deemed \"a maze.\" We acknowledge Karp was placed in a difficult spot, and the \"soon as practicable\" language limited her options. Karp maintained she had not only the right but the duty to wait until the extent of the creditors' claims could be determined. Kennedy agreed. As we noted, that is the usual procedure for trustees and personal representatives. However, there is nothing in the record that tells us what the assets and liabilities (including any potential estate tax liabilities) of either the Trust or Deborah's probate estate were. Without this information, Karp's position falters. Medlin testified it appeared the Trust had sufficient assets to safely distribute the house sale proceeds to Tyre and Hugh. Without contrary evidence, we are constrained by the \"any evidence\" standard of review to affirm the trial court's ruling. Our decision might be different were we viewing this issue through the de novo scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Karp also attempted to justify her delay by pointing to the possibility that Deborah could have, without Karp's knowledge, changed the terms of the trust by exercising her testamentary power of appointment by will or codicil. Even if we accept Karp's premise, the trust provides that if the trustee receives no notice of such a will or codicil within six months of Deborah's death, the trustee may distribute the trust \"as though this power of appointment had not been exercised.\" Because Karp's delay far exceeded this six month window, her continued withholding of trust distributions in reliance on a potential revision of the trust was untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There is no evidence Karp acted in bad faith. While a Trustee is duty-bound to\n   act in good faith, good faith alone will not excuse a breach of trust. Once it is determined the trustee has failed to carry out the express terms of a trust, good faith \"counts for nothing\" in the breach of trust calculus.\n   <em>\n    Rollins v.

She claims Tyre cannot be both (Medlin disagreed). In Karp's view, Tyre was a creditor, and therefore, she could not be liable to Tyre for breach of trust, a cause of action only available to beneficiaries. But this argument leads to a cul-de-sac, for even if Tyre was a creditor, it\n   would not affect Karp's liability for breach of trust to Hugh due to her lack of timely distribution to him, nor would it affect our holding that probable cause existed for this lawsuit. Assuming Tyre was a creditor, the no contest clause would not bind it. If Tyre was a beneficiary, the no contest clause would not apply because Tyre had the same probable cause as Hugh to challenge Karp's actions. A good argument could be made that Tyre was a beneficiary according to the Trust Code, which includes within the definition of beneficiary any person that \"has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2062-7-103\">\n    S.C.

There is no case law interpreting the role of trust protectors in South Carolina or their effect, if any, on subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The parties designated Kennedy as Trust Protector. Article 3, Section 8(h) of the Trust states, \"The Trust Protector\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   unilaterally resolve any dispute, claim or conflict\" between beneficiaries and the Trustee. (emphasis added). In the event the trust protector elects to resolve such disputes, the \"resolution shall be binding on all parties to [the] Trust and shall not be subject to review.\" Additionally, Section 8(h) declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   No one may file or instigate a claim in a court of law without first submitting the claim to the Trust Protector for resolution .... The Trust Protector\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   submit the claim or dispute for mediation and/or binding arbitration. Subsequent to his or her review, the Trust Protector\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   give any claimant the authority to file and maintain an action in a court of law. ... Whenever a dispute, conflict, or claim involves an interpretation or construction of [the] Trust Agreement, the Trust Protector\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the interpretation and construction of such Trust Agreement, or\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   instruct [the] Trustee to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plain language of the trust shows Deborah intended a trust protector could, under certain circumstances, have binding authority to resolve disputes like the one that triggered\n   this lawsuit. It is not necessary for us to detail these circumstances, because none of them exist here. By way of example, the trust protector provision arguably requires that any dispute be first presented to the trust protector before a lawsuit can be filed. Yet here the trust protector was not appointed until months after filing. Likewise, the trust protector provision states the trust protector may unilaterally resolve disputes, submit the dispute to mediation or arbitration, file a lawsuit to resolve the dispute, allow a claimant to file suit, or instruct the trustee to file suit. Here, Kennedy in her report\n   not only declined to resolve the dispute but encouraged Karp to seek judicial resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Whatever the contours of the trust protector's authority, we hold that under the circumstances here they do not extend to stripping the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. Probate Courts and Circuit Courts are specifically empowered to hear trust administration disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2062-7-201\">\n    S.C.
