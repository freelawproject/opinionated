J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuW\">This action is to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien, under a building contract which, by its terms, makes the architect\u2019s certificate conclusive evidence of the builder\u2019s right to the final judgment. The architect gave the required certificate, and there was not evidence offered to vitiate or destroy the effect which the contract provided\" it was to receive, so that by the terms of the contract, and according to the unbroken line of authorities in this state, the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover was clearly established. We find no error in the rulings, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
