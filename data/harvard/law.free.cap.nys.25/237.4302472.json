About a year afterwards, they and another formed a corporation which succeeded to the business of the firm, and the patents were assigned to it by separate instrument, which was not recorded. One S. was in the employ of the firm when the patents were issued, and was superintendent for the corporation, and assisted in using the patent machines from its organization until its property was levied on, about eight years afterwards. At the time of the levy, S, was apprehensive that the company had title to or some interest in the patent, but he did not make any inquiry to ascertain what the fact was. <em>Held, </em>that S. had knowledge of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry as to the ownership of the patent, and an assignment of it to him by the patentees after the levy was not entitled to preference over the assignment to the company, under Rev. St U. S. \u00a7 4898, which provides that such assignment shall be void as to subsequent purchasers without notice, unless it is recorded in the patent office within three months from its date.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b269-8\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-9\">Action by the Auburn Button Company against Philip L.

St. U. S. \u00a7 4898. The view taken of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>is such that, for the purposes of this review, it is necessary to consider no question other than whether or not the defendant was chargeable with notice of the assignment of the patent to the plaintiff at the time he afterwards took the assignment made to him. He went into the service of the defendants Woodruff in 1877, and continued in their service until in March, 1883, when the plaintiff was incorporated and organized. He then went into its service, and continued there until after its leviable property was sold by the sheriff, by virtue of an execution issued upon a judgment against the plaintiff, which sale was prior to April, 1891. When the plaintiff was organized, it became the successor of Woodruff Bros, in the business. They and Paul C. Woodruff were the corporators. The property incident to the business, including the letters patent, was then transferred to the plaintiff. The assignment to it of the patent was by a separate instrument made March 9, 1883. The defendant Sylvester was advised of the organization of the plaintiff, understood that it was the successor of Woodruff Bros, in the business, and as such he went into its service. He was also cognizant -of the fact that the machines by which use was made of the patent in the business were in the possession of and used by the plaintiff from the time of its organization. It seems quite clear from the evidence that the defendant had knowledge of facts sufficient to put him upon inquiry as to the previous transfer of the letters patent by Woodruff Bros., to whom they were issued. !The evidence on the part of the plaintiff that the defendant was informed by Woodruff of the assignment of them to the plaintiff is not to be considered upon the question, because it is in conflict with the evidence given by the defendant. He testified that, about the time the button company was formed, he was asked by J. H. Woodruff to take stock of the company for the note he held, which had been given him by Woodruff Bros, for the patent, and he declined to take the stock. That about the time of the sale, which he thinks was on the morning of the day the sale was made by the sheriff of the property of the company, he saw the notice of the sale, and then said to Paul 0. Woodruff, who was present, and the president of the company, \u2018Woodruff, the patents are not in this notice,\u201d and the latter said, \u201cNo,\u201d and made no further reply. That he called Woodruff\u2019s attention to the fact that the patents were not in the notice of sale, because he (defendant) was interested in the patents, and \u201cwanted to see where they were going,\u2014what was going to be done with them. He made no explanation to me why the patents wasn\u2019t in the notice of sale,\u2014none whatever. I gave him none. I asked him that question simply because I wanted to know whether the patent was going to be sold or not, there.\u201d That some time after the sale he asked J. H. Woodruff, \u2018Who owns the patent,\u201d and that he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He further testified that he did not ask him if Woodruff Bros, had assigned the patent to the button company. \u201cNothing of the kind; never asked him that question.\u201d He afterwards had an assignment from Woodruff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Bros, to himself drawn up, and, at his request, was executed by E. D. Woodruff in the name of Woodruff Bros, by him, after inserting in it that the firm of Woodruff Bros, had been dissolved, and that the assignee, Sylvester, was to save him harmless from any suit or other liability growing out of this assignment. He does not state what inquiry he made of E. D. Woodruff on the subject of the title, or that he did or not receive any information from him about it. His testimony of the interview with him was: \u201cI think I next made inquiry in reference to the title to this patent of E. D. Woodruff. I said to him I had inquired of J. H. Woodruff about the patent; had asked him to resign the right to me to use it; and had been unsuccessful; that he had evaded my questions as to who owned the patent.\u201d By reference to the evidence of J. H. Woodruff, it appears that he testified that the defendant came to him, and inquired if he could not get the right, to use the patent for himself, and the witness replied' \u201cthat that could only be given by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">The defendant had the position of superintendent for the plaintiff while he was in its service, and assisted in working the patent machines. It was quite reasonable for him to suppose that the company was using it pursuant to some right or title derived from Woodruff Bros., its predecessor in the business; and it appears by the remark made by him when he saw the sheriff\u2019s notice of sale that he was apprehensive that the plaintiff had title to the patent, or some interest in it. The answer which he says was given by J. H. Woodruff to the inquiry as to who then owned the patent\u2014that he did not know\u2014would seem to have indicated that it was not then owned by Woodruff Bros., for, if it had been, he could not well have said he did not know. The answer would reasonably seem to have led to the further inquiry whether they had assigned it, and to whom, if the inquirer was faithfully in pursuit of information upon the subject. The notice as to the facts which put the defendant upon \u00abinquiry was that Woodruff Bros, had assigned the patent, and yet it seems that the defendant omitted to make any inquiry to ascertain what the fact was in that respect. The doctrine applicable to the subject is such that when there is some title or interest in conflict with that which a person is proceeding to purchase, and he has knowledge of facts sufficient to put him upon inquiry as to the existence of such title or interest, he is chargeable with notice of it. In such case the presumption is either that he has made the inquiry, and ascertained such prior right, or that he has been guilty of such negligence as to deny to him the character of a bona fide purchaser. The question is in some sense one of good faith on his part. He may repel the presumption by showing that he has diligently and du'y pursued the inquiry, and been unable to ascertain that any such title or interest in conflict with that which he is seeking to obtain exists. Williamson v. Brown, 15 N. Y. 354; Ellis v. Horrman, 90 N. Y. 466. This the defendant failed to give evidence tending to prove. The fact that Woodruff Bros, had several years before as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>signed the patent to the plaintiff was that in respect to which the \u2022defendant was, by the circumstances within his knowledge, put upon inquiry; and it would seem that, if he had in good faith been seeking information in that respect, he would have made an inquiry necessarily calling for it as to that fact. His omission to do so seems somewhat significant, and, to say the least, was such a want of reasonable diligence as to permit the presumption to \u25a0remain effectual against him, and to require the conclusion that he was charged with notice of such prior assignment. As the case \u25a0as settled represents that it contains all the evidence of the trial \u201cpertinent to questions on this appeal,\u201d the record does not permit the inference that any further evidence essential to the question here considered was given on the trial. For these reasons the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
