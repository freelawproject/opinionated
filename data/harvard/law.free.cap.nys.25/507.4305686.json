The jury rendered a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $1,500, and from the judgment entered thereupon, and the order denying a motion for a new trial, this appeal is taken. The testimony shows that plaintiff took passage on an open car of defendant, running easterly through Flushing avenue, all the seats, of which were occupied, and the rear platform of which was crowded, though there may have been standing room on the front platform. He stood facing the body of the car, upon the side step, running along the entire length of the car; and, while he was in this position, the conductor collected his fare, after which, when this car reached Washington avenue crossing, another car of defendant, proceeding along Washington avenue in a northerly direction, was approaching Flushing avenue. The driver of the latter car, instead of stopping, kept right on, and drove his horses against the plaintiff, knocking him off the car, whereby plaintiff received the injuries complained of. The contention that plaintiff, in standing upon the step, was guilty of contributory negligence, as matter of law, cannot be sustained. The question was properly submitted to the jury to decide, as a matter of fact. If it was error for the court to refuse to charge the request of defendant \u201cthat it was the duty of the plaintiff, on getting upon defendant\u2019s car, to use reasonable care to put himself into as safe .a place as he could procure,\u201d the error was cured by the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>of the court that, if there was room on the front platform, it was-the duty of the plaintiff to have taken his position thereupon, for the evidence shows that all the seats were occupied, and the rear-platform was crowded. . After reading and carefully considering the testimony relating to plaintiff\u2019s injuries, we do not think the verdict of the jury for $1,500 should be disturbed as excessive-For these reasons we think the judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
