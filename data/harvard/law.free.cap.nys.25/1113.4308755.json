That plaintiff immediately called upon defendant, with whom he had previously dealt in real-estate transactions, both as his broker in selling, and as the broker of the seller of property to him, and brought to his attention the fact that Stocom\u2019s house was for sale at the asking price of $43,000, when completely finished, but, possibly, could be purchased for $42,500. That plaintiff took defendant with him to look at the house, and together they fully examined same. That, at this stage of the transaction, defendant requested plaintiff to apparently disappear from all further negotiations in the matter, as shown by plaintiff\u2019s testimony, where he states that defendant said to him: \u201cYou know that you are my broker, and you know very well that I am not buying without you, and I am not selling without you. I think I can do better myself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>with Mr. Stocom, and, when I will buy myself, I will pay you the commission in full. You keep away. Don\u2019t talk with Mr. Stocom at all.\u201d That thereupon plaintiff ceased all effort in the matter, as regards the sale by Stocom to defendant, and refrained from making any other or further endeavor to earn a commission from Stocom, by seeking and securing, as his broker, some person other than defendant to purchase the house, and that he remained silent as to his instigation of the purchase by defendant, and refrained from claiming any commission of the owner for the sale, which was eventually made by him to defendant, who \u201ccertified that there is no broker in this sale,\u201d in the contract he made with the owner to buy the house for $42,150. Appellant\u2019s contention is that there is no consideration for the promise of defendant to pay plaintiff\u2019s commission. This promise is made upon valuable considerations. The plaintiff initiated the negotiations which eventuated in the purchase by defendant of Stocom, the owner, who had in June requested plaintiff to secure a purchaser. This would entitle him to a commission from the owner, except for his engagement with defendant to remain silent about it; thus inducing Stocom to rely on defendant\u2019s certification that there was no broker\u2019s commission, and to fix the purchase price accordingly. He might have earned a commission from the owner by securing a purchaser other than the defendant, except for his agreement to make no such effort. The judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
