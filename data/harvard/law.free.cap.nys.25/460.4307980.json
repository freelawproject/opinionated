The action was commenced in October, 1891, and resulted in a judgment against the defendant in June, 1892. The judgment was paid by the defendant and satisfied by the plaintiff of record before the appellants gave notice of motion to be substituted. In view of these facts, and there being no proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>of collusion, and no disclosure of the nature of the proposed defense, the motion was properly denied. Jakobi v. Gorman, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 21 N. Y. Supp. 762, is clearly distinguishable. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
