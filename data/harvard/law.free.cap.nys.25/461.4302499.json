From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the general term of this court, where the judgment was affirmed, with costs. In the opinion then delivered the court said, (3 Misc. Rep. 413, 23 N. Y. Supp. 666:) \u201cIf the plaintiffs can show a different state of facts, and desire to do so, their remedy is by motion for leave to amend their complaint.\u201d This meant: Provided the plaintiffs should acquiesce in the law as laid down, and move for the vacation of the judgment upon terms, and for leave to amend. But the plaintiffs did not do this. They simply moved for leave to amend the complaint, without asking to have the judgment disturbed; and from the judgment they appealed, as has been conceded on the argument before us, to the court of appeals, where they intend to ask for the reversal of the judgment on the ground of error. Under these circumstances, the motion for leave to amend was properly denied. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
