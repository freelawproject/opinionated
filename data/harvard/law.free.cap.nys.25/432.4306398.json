Walker against the Anglo-American Mort-gage &amp; Trust Company, Albert C. Burnham, Lysander W. Tulleys, and James N. Brown to rescind a contract of purchase and sale - of stock, and for damages. From a judgment dismissing the complaint, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ACOM\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-15\">This action was brought to rescind a purchase of 50 shares of stock issued '\u25a0 by the defendant corporation, and to recover from the defendants the amount paid therefor. The firm of Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. was organized in 1875, \u25a0 and from October, 1884, until its dissolution, June 1, 1888, it was composed of the individual defendants in this action. The firm was engaged in securing and selling western farm mortgages, having its principal place of business at Council Bluffs, Iowa. Burnham loaned to the firm $100,000, the capital employed in this business, upon which he received 7.per cent, interest. Tulleys and Brown contributed their time, services, and experience. This firm had done a large business in procuring and selling, in the eastern states and abroad, western farm mortgages, amounting, in the aggregate, to several million dollars. Alfred Walker &amp; Co. was a firm of bankers and brok- \u25a0 ers engaged in business in New Haven, Conn. The plaintiff is a physician . residing in the city of New York, and is a cousin of Alfred Walker, senior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>member of the firm. From time to time he had made investments through the agency of this firm, and among other securities had purchased a western farm mortgage, obtained by the New Haven firm from Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. In 1888 the firm resolved to form a corporation under the laws of the state of Iowa for the purpose of transacting the business theretofore carried on by the partnership. By a contract executed February 24, 1888, between the individual members of Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co., it was agreed that Burnham should receive all of his interest in the firm, $100,000, seemed to be paid in a manner specified, and should turn over all of his interest in the business to the corporation to be formed. It was agreed that the corporation should issue $100,000 of stock for the good will of the business of the firm, of which Burnham, Tulleys, and Brown were to receive $30,000 each, and $10,000 was to be issued to J. V. McDowell, who had an interest in a branch firm connected with Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co.

We find an unwillingness on our part to part with the valuable plant which we have upon our books, the outstanding loans figuring up in the millions. Of a proposed capital of $500,000.00, we will take the larger part ourselves, and therefore have only a limited amount to dispose of. As we indicated to you that you might place $50,000.00, we will adhere to that, although it takes a large portion of what we have to sell. You are therefore authorized to take subscriptions up to $50,000.00, 50% of which to be paid at the time the subscription is made. Herein we hand you form of subscription. When the subscriptions are made, kindly forward to us the checks, give a receipt therefor, and certificates of stock will follow between now and the first of June. The board of directors will call in the balance of 50% between now and that time. Having only a limited amount to sell, we ask your early advice on the subject, as we will be obliged to treat the subscriptions in the priority of their receipt. We believe we have one of the most valuable plants which has been offered, as it embraces an experience of over 25 years, and we have a large amount of business on our books. With the increased facilities which the incorporated form will give us, we think the stock will be valuable, and expect it will be worth a handsome premium in regular course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">\u201cYours, truly, Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">March 3d, Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. wrote Alfred Walker &amp; Co. as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">\u201cBurnham, Tulleys &amp; Co., Investment Bankers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">\u201cCouncil Bluffs, Iowa, 3-3-1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">\u201cMessrs.

Under cover of our late respects you will see that we have practically decided the question of incorporation, and authorize you take subscriptions for stock to the amount of $50,000.00. As we get no commission ourselves, and believe the stock to be very valuable, we would hardly feel inclined to pay any commission, and offer none to anybody. The stock will be worth, in our judgment, as soon as the organization is completed, a premium. Our charter is liberal, and allows us to issue debentures and guaranty loans, and we can give such commissions as we may decide upon. * * * Referring to the commission on sale of stock, would say that, were our company a new one, with no valuable plant, it would be consistent to give commissions, but, as we have written you, we are loath to give up our birthright, and would take the entire amount of stock if we thought it practicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-12\">\u201cYours, truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-14\">Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>.

We hardly think some of your friends appreciate altogether the advantage of securing stock in a company which secures the accretions and emoluments of a business of long standing, and of such value as Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. have upofi their books. We have been, as before intimated, rather unwilling to incorporate. In order to cover the competition that is upon the market, we have decided upon this step at your suggestion, and some of our other friends, but would not be willing to take it unless we ourselves were largely interested in the stock. We believe that under our new incorporation that securities will be more favorably cared for, and that we will find it mutually profitable in your representing us in New Haven, as we will endeavor to cover all the wants of your customers. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">\u201cTours, truly, Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">March 20th, 1888, Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. wrote Alfred Walker &amp; Co. as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">\u201cBurnham, Tulleys &amp; Co., Investment Bankers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">* \u201cCouncil Bluffs, Iowa, 3-20-1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-10\">\u201cMessrs. Alfred Walker &amp; Co., New Haven, Conn.\u2014Gentlemen: We are in receipt of your valued favor of the 17th inst., covering draft for $2,600, 50% of subscription of 50 shares in the American Mortgage &amp; Trust Co., account of your Mr. Walker. Money has been coming in quite freely, and we would hardly think it wise at this time to accept any more money on account of this subscription. It is possible we will incorporate sooner than we anticipated, and, if so, we will call in the other 50 per cent. We are pleased that you approve of the papers sent you, and believe from the present plans that the company will be one of the very best extant. Lately we took off a statement of our business, and were astonished to find how well it appeared, and think that we can affirm, without boasting, that no plant has\" been offered to the public possessing such desirable elements for an incorporation as we have. We are not incorporating in order to get rid of objectionable features of our business, but only because we think it will put the trusts we have assumed in a more permanent form and give us a larger line of customers. We repeat that we expect to be liberal takers of the stock, and would not dispose of any of it outside, if we did not think the last-named object would be attained. We are gratified to have you connected with us, and believe, with united effort and the experience which we all have had, that in regular course the stock will command a handsome premium. As yet we have not considered just the plan of guaranty it will be most judicious to adopt, but it seems to us that a certain class of loans at 6%% we might guaranty, but we did not contemplate guarantying above 6%. We have adopted, within a reasonable length of time, the most rigid rules in the making of loans, and believe in the new plant that we will have as fine .a line of investments as have ever been floated. We trust that the valued customers to whom you refer will not hesitate to take advantage of this investment while there is opportunity, as it does not occur very often. If it suits your purpose better, we would prefer that a smaller amount be paid at the time of the subscription, say 15 or 20%,. as we do not care to put the company to the payment of interest when money is so easy as it is with us at present. We shall aim most certainly to merit the high regard you have for us. Thanking you for your kind expressions, we are</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\">\u201cTours, truly, Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Go.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-12\">The subscription referred to in the foregoing letter was of Alfred Walker, a member of the firm, and is not the subscription of the plaintiff.

The proposed capital is \u00a7500,000, a large part of which has been taken by ourselves. If it were practicable we should take it all, as, from our past experience in the business, we feel sure it will prove a profitable investment. We offer a limited amount of stock to our friends at par. Under our articles of incorporation and the laws of this state the stock is full paid and nonassessable. The company will be under the management of the members of said firm, and will adhere to the same conservative methods which have characterized their past record. It needs no argument to demonstrate the value of our plant, or that the stock will pay handsome dividends. The new form will increase our facilities, both east and west, for a more extended business, and with a larger business will come increased profits. As the amount we have to dispose of is limited, we offer it to all our friends and customers, and subscriptions will be accepted in order of the priority of their receipt. Subscriptions should be accompanied by 25 per cent, of the amount subscribed. The balance will be called in between now and June first, as the directors may elect.

About April 7, 1888, the plaintiff subscribed, through Alfred Walker &amp; Co., for 50 shares of the stock, for which he paid \u00a75,000, which was remitted to the defendants. Subsequently the corporation was placed in the hands of a receiver, and, through some scheme of the reorganization not disclosed by the evidence, the stock of the consenting shareholders was reduced one-half, and the shares issued for good will were surrendered to the corporation.

Chester v. Dickerson, 54 N. Y. 1; Getty v. Devlin, Id. 408; Locke v. Stearns, 1 Metc. (Mass.) 560; Rapp. v. Latham, 2 Barn. &amp; Aid. 793; 1 Lindl. Partn. (3d Eng. Ed.) 34, 320, 389; Story, Partn. \u00a7\u00a7 108,181; Bigelow, Fraud, 240, 246. Burnham is equally liable with his partners for their misrepresentations and concealments. The individual defendants, under their firm name, organized the corporation, fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the amount of the capital stock, and determined the time when, and the terms upon which, the corporation should be formed. They appointed agents to receive subscriptions for shares, fixed their price, and the compensation to be paid the agents. All this was done before the corporation was created; and they, as a firm, received the money of the plaintiff and of others for shares in advance of the formation of the company. How the defendants applied this money does not appear. The defendants were the promoters of this corporation; and persons who undertake to form a corporation, and induce others to subscribe for stock therein by issuing statements and prospectuses, occupy a position of trust and confidence towards the persons so induced to subscribe for shares to be issued, and they are bound to exercise the utmost good faith in their transactions. If they make material misrepresentations or conceal material facts in respect to the enterprise to the injury of those who are induced' to subscribe, they become liable for damages. Brewster v. Hatch, 122 N. Y. 349, 25 N. E. Rep. 505; Getty v. Devlin, 54 N. Y. 408; Erlanger v. Phosphate Co., 3 App. Cas. 1218, 1 Mor. Priv. Corp. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 291. The liability of promoters is not limited to subscribers whom they personally induce to take shares, but it extends to \u2018all those who are induced by their agents to subscribe for shares; and if they make material misrepresentations to, or conceal material facts from, their agents, who, relying on the statements, induce persons to become subscribers, the promoters are liable for the damages. It is a familiar principle that what one does by his agent he does by himself. The scheme which was organized by the defendants, and carried out in part through the\u2019ir agents, was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s damages, and, no intervening and responsible principal standing between the plaintiff and defendants, the latter are liable to the former to the same extent as if they had personally, by false representations and concealments, induced Mm to become a subscriber. Getty v. Devlin, supra A purchaser of shares in an existing corporation from a stockholder has no interest in the application of the money which he pays for the shares, but it is quite different with one who agrees to subscribe for shares in a corporation to be created. The difference is well stated by Chief Justice Coleridge in Twycross v. Grant, 2 C. P. Div. 488. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajq\">\u201cThe value of a share In a company, however, depends not only on those circumstances which regulate the value of all saleable commodities, but also on the persons by whom, and the mode in which, the capital of the company is to be dealt with. It is utterly immaterial to an ordinary purchaser to know what the vendor will do with the purchase money when he gets it; the purchaser has no further interest in it. But an applicant for shares in a company is in a totally different position. His money becomes part of the capital of the compan)-, and to him it is 'all important to know what sort of persons are to have the control of his money when he has paid it, and how that money is to be applied, whether upon the enterprise itself, or in remunerating, perhaps with slavish extravagance, those who have brought the company into existence. Again, it is all-important for him .to know whether shares applied for by other people are applied for honestly, as by himself, or by persons whose only object is to create a fictitious demand for the shares, and to get rid of them as soon as they have succeeded in deluding others to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>take them on the faith of their apparent value. Now, these are all matters which promoters may arrange for their own benefit, and keep entirely out of sight; and it is notorious that by taking advantage of their opportunities in this respect, promoters have committed gigantic frauds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">This brings us to the question whether the defendants did make materially false statements to, and conceal material facts from, their agents, with the intent of inducing, and which actually did induce, such agents to recommend and advise the plaintiff to subscribe for shares. The court found that Burnham, Tulleys &amp;. Co. wrote the letters and issued the circular which are set out in the statements of facts. In the letter of March 20, 1888, they wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cWe repeat that we expect to be liberal takers of this stock, and would not dispose of any of it if we did not think the last-mentioned object [a larger line of customers] would be attained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The whole tenor of these letters is to the effect that Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. were to take a large proportion of the shares to be issued, and that the corporation was to be managed by the members of the firm in the same manner that their business had been previously managed. There is no hint 'in the letters or circular that any of the shares were to be issued except for cash, or that any were to be issued to members of the firm for good will.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201c(10) The statement in said circular that \u2018the proposed capital is $500,000, a large part of which has been taken by ourselves,\u2019 was untrue, and designed to mislead and deceive A. Walker &amp; Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u201c(11) The statement that \u2018the company will be under the management of the members of said firm\u2019 was untrue, and designed to mislead and deceive A. Walker &amp; Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">\u201c(12) On and after the organization of the corporation, defendant Albert C. Burnham held no office of any sort in said corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">\u201c(15) Burnham, Tulleys &amp; Co. never disclosed to A. Walker &amp; Co. the fact of the execution of the agreement of February 24, 1888, respecting good-will stock, nor the fact that $100,000 of good-will stock was to be issued to the members of the firm upon its incorporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">\u201c(16) From the correspondence and dealings of A. W'alker &amp; Co. and Bum-ham, Tulleys &amp; Co. with respect to the incorporation, A. Walker &amp; Co. believed, and had reason to believe, that subscribers for stock, whether members of the firm or outsiders, stood on equal footing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The court also found that Alfred Walker <em>Sc </em>Co. had not seen the circular of April 2d when they effected the sale of the stock to the plaintiff and obtained his subscription, and did not rely upon the statements contained therein in effecting the sale to the plaintiff and in taking his subscription. But this finding does not relieve the defendants from liability, for under the letters which they put forth they were bound to procure the corporation to be organized upon the basis of all subscribers paying par value in cash for the shares to be issued, which they did not do, but issued to themselves one-fifth of the entire capital for so-called \"good will.\u201d In addition to this, the corporation was not placed under the management of the members of the firm, nor did they become liberal takers of the stock, as they represented they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>be. Burnham took no shares except the $30,000 issued to him for good will, and never assumed the management of the affairs of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The court was asked to find that the statements and the correspondence were designed to mislead not only A. Walker &amp; Co., but persons intending to become subscribers for the shares. The court found, as above stated, that the statements and the correspondence were designed to mislead A. Walker &amp; Co., but refused to find that they were designed to mislead subscribers, to which refusal the plaintiff excepted. This, we think, was error. If the statements were put forth with the design to mislead and deceive A. Walker &amp; Co., the agents of the defendants for procuring subscriptions, it is difficult to see why it does not follow that they were put forth with the intention of deceiving those who might subscribe for shares. The inference of fraud from the facts proved is as strong in the one case as it is in the other. Upon a retrial of this case, if one shall be had, it must be disclosed upon what terms other subscriptions were made, to whom the shares were first issued, and what disposition was made by the defendants of the funds received by them. We think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
