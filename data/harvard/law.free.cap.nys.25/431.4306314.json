Cases cited in Fiero, Spec. Proc. p. 56. In the case at bar the justice determined that he had not jurisdiction, and that disposed of the -action or proceeding pending before him. Whether he had jurisdiction or not must be reviewed in the ordinary way. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
