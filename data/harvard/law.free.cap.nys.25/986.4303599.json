Robie, 25 N. Y. Supp. 982, (decided at this term.) The bond here sued upon is given under the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. [8th Ed.] p. 890,) and is the ordinary constable\u2019s bond. No point is made but that Akers was constable, appointed for the Fourth ward of the city, and by the judges of the municipal court for service as constable in that court. It has already been noticed, in the Levin Case, that the appointment by the judges to perform duties in the municipal court did not change his status as constable of the Fourth ward. Neither did the acts which h\u00e9 was called upon to do by the municipal court differ in kind from those ordinarily required of a constable. In People v. Vilas, 36 N. Y. 464, Judge Grover wrote: \u201cA legislative alteration of the duties of an officer do not discharge his sureties, so long as the duties remain appropriate to the office.\u201d Among the reasons assigned for this conclusion was that the legislature had power at any and all times to change the duties of officers. The existence of this power is presumed to be known to the officer and the sureties in the bond as though the power was incorporated therein. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Later cases support the doctrine of this case. Board of Education v. Quick, 99 N. Y. 141, 1 N. E. Rep. 533. The duty imposed upon the constable in the present instance was precisely such in character as he would have been called upon to perform had the execution issued upon the judgment proceeded from a justice\u2019s court. As the bond covers such act, it matters nothing that in other respects the constable\u2019s duties were substantially changed and enlarged, for the surety is not sought to be charged for such acts, but only for an act contemplated and within the terms and scope of the bond. Board of Sup\u2019rs v. Clark, 92 N. Y. 395. No other points are raised than such as were disposed of in the Levin Case. The judgment appealed from affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
