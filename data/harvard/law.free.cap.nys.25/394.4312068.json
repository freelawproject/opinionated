It appeared that the corporation had $750,000-invested in its business in New York, and that the moneys owing to it amounted to $1,400,000, and that the whole amount of its debts was about $1,200,000. <em>Held </em>that, whether the debts should have been deducted or not, the assessment was not excessive, since the credits would have to be considered, if the debts were to be deducted, in order to determine what debts are chargeable to capital.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b426-13\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-14\">Certiorari by the Thurber-Whyland Company to review an assessment for taxation made by Edward P.

The original assessment for the said year was $3,000,000, which was reduced, upon \u25a0due application by the relator, while the books of annual record were open for correction. The grievance of the relator is set forth in its petition as follows: \u201cPetitioner has claimed and protested to said commissioners that on the second Monday of January, 1892, the petitioner had no personal property subject to taxation, for the reason that the \"whole amount of its capital invested in, and the whole sum invested in any manner in, its business \u2022in the city of New York, was only $750,000, and the whole amount of its -debts was $1,218,904, and that by reason of its said debts, which it was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>titled to deduct from the whole sum, as aforesaid, invested in its business, it was not liable to the tax sought to be imposed upon it.\u201d It further appears from the petition that the whole amount of relator\u2019s capital stock issued was $2,500,000, of which $100,000 was for cash, and the rest for \u201cproperty consisting of merchandise, trade-marks, good will, etc.,\u201d and that the \u201cbalance of its capital was employed outside the city of New York, principally in the form of accounts receivable, amounting to about $1,400,000.\u201d It does not appear that any portion of the $1,400,000 of accounts receivable was invested outside of the state of New York.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The opinion of Mr. Justice Beach at special term is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">The principle regulating the taxation of relator is furnished by Laws 1855, c. 37. The statute provides for assessment and taxation \u201con all sums invested in any manner in said business the same as if they were residents of this state.\u201d A resident is entitled to the deduction of just debts owing by him. 1 Rev. St. p. 390, \u00a7 9. The relator is therefore entitled to a deduction of its just debts. Notwithstanding this conclusion, I think the action of the respondents is right. They are not bound to accept any one fact stated by relator as indispensable. The pertinent one referred to is that the sums invested in its business in this state amounted to seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It also appears from the return that the relator conducts its business in the city of New York, and at time of assessment was possessed, in addition, of bills receivable, or moneys owing to it, in amount to about one million four hundred thousand dollars. A resident of the state is taxable upon all \u201cdebts and obligations for the payment of money due or owing\u201d to him; the same principle granting relator a deduction for its debts under this sum as credits liable to taxation. The respondents rightfully so considered, so far as appears, and their conclusion is therefore deemed correct. The bills receivable of relator are, in law, \u201cinvested in its business\u201d carried on in this state. The writ is dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b427-7\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Adopting this rule, it follows that the assessment is correct. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
