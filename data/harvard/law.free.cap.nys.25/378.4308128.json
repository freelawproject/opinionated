The plaintiff also seeks to recover special damages,\u2014the sum paid for the attendance of her physicians and nurse and the expenses- of \u25a0repairing the coupe. November 21, 1887, the plaintiff was driving east on Forty-Fifth street in a coupe drawn by one horse, and driven by a coachman who attempted to cross defendant\u2019s track in Broadway in front of a car approaching from the south. A collision occurred, by which the plaintiff\u2019s \u2022left collar bone was broken and the coupe injured. The issues of fact upon which the case turned were: (1) Did the driver of the car negligently cause the collision? (2) Did the driver of the coupe negligently contribute to the \u25a0accident? Upon these issues the testimony was conflicting but the jury found both in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b410-13\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The coachman who was driving at the time, how long had he \u2022been in your employment? Answer. Oh, he had been with me for five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>then. He is with us st\u00fcl. Q. Do you find him careful or careless? (Objected to by the defendant as immaterial, incompetent, and irrelevant. Objection overruled. Defendant excepted.) A. Oh, very careful; a very careful driver, indeed. It was a gentle horse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">Like evidence was given by the plaintiff\u2019s husband, over the defendant\u2019s objection and exception. This evidence was undoubtedly supposed to bear on the issue of contributory negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s driver. It certainly had no relation to any other issue. The issue was not whether the plaintiff had negligently employed or continued in her service a careless or unskillful driver, nor whether he had been careful or negligent on previous occasions, but it was, \u201cDid his negligence contribute to this accident?\u201d This \u25a0evidence was not relevant to this or to any issue in the case, and was incompetent. Jacobs v. Duke, 1 E. D. Smith, 271; Warner v. Railroad Co., 44 N. Y. 465, 472; Maguire v. Railroad Co., 115 Mass. 239; Whitney v. Gross, 140 Mass. 232, 5 N. E. Rep. 619; Hays v. Millar, 77 Pa. St. 238; Whart. Neg. \u00a7 169; Whart. Ev. \u00a7 40; Abb. Tr. Ev. 584. It has been many times held that it is not competent for a plaintiff to give evidence that the person by whom the alleged negligent act was committed had previously committed similar acts, or that he was generally negligent or unskillful. The same rule is applicable to a plaintiff seeking to show that the acts of her servant did not contribute to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The plaintiff was permitted to show on the trial, over defendant\u2019s objection, that it was \u201cincompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial,\u201d the expenses of her cure and of repairing the coupe. It appears that she is a married woman living with her husband, and the presumption is that he is liable for and discharges the ordinary expenses of the household and of the care of his wife and family. Before the plaintiff could be entitled to recover for those items, it was necessary for her to show that the expenses were paid out of her own estate. This was not done. But the objection raised to this evidence was not as specific as it should have been. The objection did not call specifically to the mind of the court and of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the evidence was objected to on the ground that the plaintiff was not, but that her husband was, entitled to recover for these items, without showing that she had personally paid the charges or had become liable to pay them. Had this objection been made, it might have been obviated on the trial by showing that the plaintiff had a personal estate and had paid the charges out of it, or that she has become liable to pay them. Thomp. Trials, \u00a7 693 et seq. But we think, for the first error discussed, that a new trial should be had. The question of negligence and of contributory negligence is a close one, and we cannot say that the erroneous evidence did not influence the jury. The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
