She was a witness interested in the event of the action, since the result of the trial adversely to plaintiff would tend to convict her of an attempted fraud upon the defendant. Her testimony, therefore, was not conclusive, but was subject to discredit, though she may not have been directly contradicted, and her general character for truth \u2022and veracity may not have been impeached. That the consideration of the above was disregarded by the justice on the trial of this action, and that the judgment appealed from proceeded from facts assumed, and of which there was no evidence, is too apparent to admit of dispute. Justice requires that there should be \u2022a new trial. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs \u25a0of this appeal and of the court below to the party prevailing on the new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
