The objection was taken below that inasmuch as there was a direction in the order for including the amount in the judgment, which, as shown, was so included, a proceeding as for a contempt would not lie, but that the plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy was an execution upon the judgment. The memorandum of the judge below states: \u201cThe case of Jacquin v. Jacquin, 86 Hun, 378. constrains me to deny this motion, without costs.\u201d In that case, as shown by the opinion, \u201cthe amount directed to be paid by the order was the costs and counsel fee recovered by the final judgment entered in the action.\u201d It was therein held that where, in an action for a separation, the final judgment directs the defendant to pay to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney a fixed sum as and for her costs and counsel fees, the failure of the defendant to make such payment cannot be treated as a contempt. It will thus be seen that the question therein presented was with respect to costs and counsel fees directed to be paid by a final judgment, whereas the question here relates to a counsel fee directed to be paid by a pendente lite order; and the decision was there expressly placed upon the ground3 that the costs and counsel fees directed by the judgment were not moneys directed to be paid by orders, as provided for in section 1769 of the Code, to enforce compliance with which a proceeding as for a contempt would lie. That section (Code, \u00a7 1769) provides that the court may, during the pendency of the action, \u201cfrom time to time, make and modify an order or orders requiring the husband to pay any sum or sums of money necessary to enable the wife to carry on or defend the action.\u201d And, as said in the opinion in Jacquin v. Jacquin, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-3\">\u201cThat section has been limited to orders made during the pendency of the action, by which the husband may be required to pay any sum or sums of money necessary to enable the wife to carry on or defend the action, or to provide for the education and maintenance of the children of the marriage, or for the support of the wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The real question, therefore, to be here determined, is whether the allowance made was one within the provisions of section 1769 of the Code, or was one made in the final judgment. By reference to the terms of the order from which we have quoted, and which was entered prior to the judgment, it will be seen that it was a direction for the payment of a counsel fee pendente lite; and were it not for the recital that such allowance may be included in plaintiff\u2019s judgment herein as a part thereof, and that the plaintiff may have execution for the collection thereof, no question could arise. It remains, then, to be determined whether such a recital in the order, coupled with the fact that the judgment directed an execution to issue for the sum thus allowed, took away the plaintiff\u2019s remedy which she otherwise would have had of enforcing the payment thereof by proceedings \u2022 as for a contempt. It is doubtful whether such provision in the judgment is' warranted, because section 1769 -is seemingly the only authority for an allowance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>plaintiff for the expenses of the action, and this makes no provision for such an allowance in the judgment. In Percival v. Percival, 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 255, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-5\">\u201cBut the judgment contained a provision awarding to the plaintiff, among other moneys, the sum of three hundred dollars for past expenses which she had incurred prior to the judgment. This sum was improperly inserted in the judgment, inasmuch as the rule as now administered is that expenses pendente lite, if they are awarded at all, must be awarded upon special application, and cannot properly form a part of the judgment, [citing Beadleston v. Beadleston, 103 N. Y. 402, 8 N. E. Rep. 735.] To this extent the original judgment must be modified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In Williams v. Williams, (Sup.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 647, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">\u201cThe counsel fee was unauthorized. The statute (Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1769) only makes provisions for costs; that is, in the final judgment. All sums necessary to enable the wife to carry on the suit must be awarded on \u25a0special motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">And in Straus v. Straus, 67 Hun, 491, 22 N. Y. Supp. 567, it was said, in construing section 1769:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">\u201cThis section, which is the only authority for an order directing payment \u25a0of the expenses of the wife for counsel in the action, evidently means that such direction shall be given in an order, and not in the final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">These cases, therefore, are all authority for the position that payment of the expenses of the wife for counsel in the action is not the subject of provision by final judgment, but is the subject of a special application, and that payment during the pendency of the action is to be directed by order. It appearing, therefore, that the amount directed to be paid had been granted upon a special application made prior to the entry of judgment, to enable plaintiff to prosecute the action, such order was a mandate of the court, (notwithstanding the direction to include it in the judgment and its subsequent insertion,) entitling the plaintiff to enforce compliance therewith by contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">It was made to appear, however, that this allowance was made several days after the case had been tried and a decision awarded in plaintiff\u2019s favor, the defendant being in default and not appearing on the motion; and it is urged that, being now without funds, he should not be punished by a proceeding as for a contempt. These, however, are considerations that might be well addressed to the learned justice who made the original order, or to the judge before whom the motion to punish for contempt shall be heard; the sole question presented for our determination being whether the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was by execution, as held by the judge below, or whether a proceeding as for a contempt will lie. Having reached the latter conclusion, it follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with costs to plaintiff, and with leave to renew the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
