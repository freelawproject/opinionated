The defendant, by answer, pleaded the statute of limitation of this state, by alleging that this action was begun on November 3, 1892; that for six years prior thereto he had continuously resided in this state; and that the note sued on fell due more than six years prior to commencement of the action. This cause of action accrued when the note fell due, and hence there is no merit in respondent\u2019s suggestion that the defendant must allege specifically that \u201cthe cause of action accrued,\u201d instead of that \u201cthe note fell due,\u201d more than six years prior to commencement of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">At trial, defendant, at the very threshold of his defense, was prevented from proving his continuous residence in this state for more than six years, under a ruling that the law of the state of New York was not applicable, but that the law of the state of Colorado was applicable, and to which he duly excepted. No suggestion in justification of this ruling is made, except, in respondent\u2019s brief, that section 390 of the Code requires a defendant to plead the law of limitation of the foreign state; but this section, by express terms, applies to a nonresident defendant sued here, to enable him to avail himself of his residence in the foreign state during the period of limitation there, as a defense in the action against him here. But this defendant is not a nonresident, and alleges six years\u2019 continuous residence in this state; hence he pleaded properly by setting up the statute of limitation of New York, for the plaintiff sought his remedy here. Therefore the defendant could avail himself of our statute of limitation, and had no concern whatever with the statute of the state where the contract was made. In the Engel Case, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>N. Y. 400, 7 N. E. Rep. 300, Judge Earl writing, the court of appeals held that the defendant, who was sued in this state upon a bill of exchange accepted by him in Vienna, Austria, could plead successfully his residence here for six years and our statute of limitation, in bar of the cause of action, although he had absconded and fled from Vienna, and came and resided here under an assumed name, for the purpose of concealing himself from his creditors. This decision in 1886 probably suggested the amendment of 1888 to section 401 of the Code, which now precludes a defendant who \u201cresides within the state under a false name\u201d from availing himself of our statute of limitations; but neither this, nor any other existing provision of the Code, disturbs the rule that a person who resides continuously, under his true name, in this state for six years prior to action against him on a note, bill of exchange, or other causes of action enumerated in section 382, can, by pleading and proof, avail himself of our statute of limitation in bar of such cause of action. This defendant\u2019s pleading entitled him to make proof of the facts pleaded, and it was error to prevent him from doing so at trial. Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event. AE concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
