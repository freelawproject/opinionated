The defendant had the option to terminate the contract at any time. Plaintiff went to the mines, and worked for eleven months, was paid \u25a0\u25a0$1,100, was furnished board for nine months, and received $50 towards his board for two months, but which cost him about $70. He says that the superintendent informed him that there was no work for him to do, and that, as he was sick, he must return to New York, and that he (plaintiff) then demanded a return of his passage money, with the extras for board, etc., but was \u2019informed that a letter would be written to the New York office, and that, when he arrived there, everything would be found satisfactory, and his demands .paid. The plaintiff so returned, and made such demands, including the $72.50 and the extras for his two months\u2019 board, which was refused, whereupon he brought this suit, and the jury, after a charge and rulings, which, if anything, were too favorable to plaintiff, found for him in $116.46. No error having been made', and the verdict not being against the weight of evidence, the judgment \u2022and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
