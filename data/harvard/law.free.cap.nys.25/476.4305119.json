H. Weyer, Notary Public.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-23\">The opinion of Clifford Boese, Esq., the referee, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-24\">\u201cThis is an action brought to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. A motion was \u25a0 made at the beginning of the reference to dismiss the complaint, on the-ground that the action was improperly brought, but it was agreed that the-testimony be taken, and this point raised by the defendant be decided, when the whole case was submitted. The defendant contends that the decision of' this court in the case of Copley v. Hay, 12 N. Y. Supp. 277, is controlling-, and\" that the complaint should be dismissed. In the case cited the owner - of the property and the contractor were different individuals. In this action they are the same party, and the decision there made was for the - purpose of relieving the owner from responsibility, a bond having been filed. While it is true that this action before me is in the nature of a foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien, it also partakes of the nature of an action against the owner for the debt, and provision to that extent must be provided in the - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>judgment under the rule laid down in Lawson v. Reilly, 13 Civil Proc. R. 290, as I am of the opinion that this action has been properly brought, and 'that the motion to dismiss should be denied. The defendant also contends that the lien filed is defective in form and verification. This objection was made at the trial, and was overruled. After careful consideration of the whole case, and without further specifically commenting upon the various objections made by the defendant to the validity of the lien, I am firm in the -opinion that the plaintiff is properly entitled to an adjudication that the lien filed July 28, 1890, was one that complied with the provisions of the \u25a0statute. The filing of this lien was the result of the failure of the defendant to pay certain moneys alleged to be due Cunningham &amp; Smith for work \u25a0done upon the houses owned by the defendant mentioned in the complaint herein. This lien was subsequently, and on or about the 21st day of August, 1890, assigned to one Patrick Booden, who, in turn, on or about October 29, 1890, reassigned it to James Cunningham, the plaintiff in this case. The plaintiff is one of the original lienors, and one of the defenses of this action is that the real person in interest is Patrick Booden; but, as Booden \"testified that he had reassigned the lien to the plaintiff herein, this objection fails. I am of the opinion that the plaintiff is the owner of the lien, and, \u2022as such, has a right to bring this action. This being the case, the first thing to consider is whether Cunningham &amp; Smith abandoned the work on the houses mentioned in the complaint herein, thereby forfeiting the right of action and invalidating the lien filed.' Work was commenced on or about -January 8, 1890, under a contract made between Cunningham &amp; Smith and the defendant herein, and was continued down to about June 11, 1891, when, \u25a0 differences having arisen in regard to the payments of money, the plaintiffs \u00a1refused to work. These differences, however, were finally adjusted, and the plaintiff continued to work on the houses up to July 26, 1892, when, as the testimony discloses, the plaintiff refused to continue, owing to the failure of the defendant to make further advances, and the lien was filed. These facts are not controverted, and it clearly follows that, where the owner prevents the contractor from completing the contract, the contractor will not be debarred from enforcing iiis lien. Henderson v. Sturgis, 1 Daly, 336. This claim here is for the amount alleged to be due the plaintiff under the \u2022contract heretofore referred to, and under various other contracts. The first contract was for painting, staining, and varnishing, and the other contracts for papering, decorating, etc. Up to June 11, 1891, the payments so far made to the plaintiff seem to have amounted to the sum of 83,956.09. In this sum were included payments made on account of papering some of the rooms in the various houses. The plaintiff contends that the papering was to be done at the price agreed upon between Doyle and himself, and I am \u2022constrained to believe that that is the fact\u2014First, because it seems improbable that a contract would be made in the manner in which it is alleged to have been made by the defendant, who testifies that the papering was to be \u2022done \u2018as cheap as he could get anybody else to do it.\u2019 This statement seems to be at variance with what are the accepted rules of business men. Secondly, when viewed in the light of the events prior to June 11, 1891, and payments for this class of work made before that time. The question as to the amount of paper hanging done on these houses by the plaintiff seems to -have been one that could easily have been controverted by the defendant, as it was manifestly within his power to have produced on the reference a \u25a0clear and absolute statement of the aggregate area of the rooms papered by introducing the plans of the several houses. This he failed to do, and \u00a1the statements made by the plaintiff, with great particularity as to the \u25a0amount of paper hanging actually done, with the prices agreed upon, corroborated by the testimony of his witnesses, compels me to the conclusion that the testimony in this regard made by the plaintiff be accepted as. sufficiently conclusive. As to the painting, graining, and varnishing, as well ns decorating, the various prices for the different classes of work have, in my opinion, been fully established by the testimony of the plaintiff, and \u25a0corroborated by the facts of the prices paid for these different classes prior ,to the 11th of June, 1891, as shown by the evidence, as well as the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>testimony. As to the staining and varnishing under the contract of January 8, 1890, I am of the opinion that the amount chargeable for the work done thereunder is $2,600; that the amount chargeable for the other work done by plaintiff for defendant is the sum of $4,446.59; making a total of $7,046.59. The evidence shows that $5,381.12 have been paid to the plaintiff, which, being deducted from the foregoing total, leaves a balance due this plaintiff of $1,665.47, with interest from July 26, 1890, for which judgment is ordered.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b510-5\">Argued before BOOKSTAVER and PRYOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\">Charles J.

Kruger v. Braender, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 23 N. Y. Supp. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">It is contended that the notice of lien, as filed, was defective;, in that the name of the affiant was omitted from the body of the verification thereto. The effect of such omission has been considered by the court of appeals in the case of People v. Sutherland, 81 N. Y. 1, where it was held that a verification in such form is sufficient. The only exception contained in this ruling relates to a case where the affiant acts in some special papacity, and in such case, the court say: \u201cIt is manifest that the name of the\" deponent must be stated, to apply to him by that name the statement of his capacity.\u201d Here, however, no statement of special capacity was required. The affidavit showed to the notary that a person\u2019s conscience had been burdened with an oath to the effect that he was \u201cone of the claimants,\u201d etc., and that the \u201cstatements were true,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">As to the question of the notary\u2019s acquaintance with \u201cO. Smith,\u201d it is sufficient to point out that the statute calls for a verification, and not an acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">There is no force in the objection that the affidavit is in the alternative. That such a verification may follow the words of the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has been held by this court in Staubsandt v. Lennon, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 22 N. Y. Supp. 544. We consider that the notice of lien complied in form with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">We have examined the exceptions to the findings and rulings of the referee, and conclude that no error requiring a reversal has been committed. The referee was at liberty to consider the agreement between the parties as evidence of the value of the work. Ludlow v. Dole, 62 N. Y, 617. The evidence supports the finding that the refusal of the defendant to make payments subsequent to the first installment justified the contractors in abandoning further performance. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-14\">Laws 1885, c. 342, \u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
