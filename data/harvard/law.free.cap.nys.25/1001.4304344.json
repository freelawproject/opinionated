The plaintiff moved to strike from this alleged separate and distinct defense the words, \u201cand repeating the previous allegations,\u201d as redundant; plaintiffs\u2019 contention being that a demurrer will not lie to a part of an entire defense in an answer, and that, while the previous specific denials are allowed to stand in the fourth paragraph, which sets forth an alleged entire defense consisting of new matter, he is precluded from availing himself of the provisions of section 494 of the Code, which allows demurrer to a defense consisting of new matter contained in the answer, on the ground that it is insufficient in law upon the face thereof. And certainly demurrer will not lie to either a specific or general denial, and, if a defendant is allowed to repeat his specific or general denials in each of his entire separate alleged defenses, consisting of new matter, then he can at will nullify the express provisions of section 494; but, of course, he has no right to do so. The motion should have been granted, and not denied. The order is reversed, with $10 costs; and motion to strike from the fourth paragraph of the answer the words, \u201cand repeating the previous allegations,\u201d granted, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiffs to demur to the alleged, defense in the fourth paragraph, consisting of new matter, within six days after entry of order hereon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
