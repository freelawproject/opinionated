Rule 16, Gen. Term, Com. Pl. N. Y. The opinion handed down at the time of the decision of the appeal herein (4 Misc. Rep. 528, 24 N. Y. Supp. 821) refutes the claim ' that either of the grounds above specified exists, and the plain purport of this motion is no other than to secure a second hearing upon the same points and facts which have been exhaustively examined and discussed in the opinion of the court. Motion for reargument denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
