One of the plaintiffs testified that, at defendant\u2019s request, he went to Iowa to ascertain what extensions were required, and upon his return reported to defendant that the extension \u201cwhich led up to the city jail\u201d was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>quired to be made, and that thereupon defendant replied, \"All right. Go ahead and make it, and I will pay for it,\u201d and that plaintiff made this extension, and that the same was reasonably worth the sum sued for. Defendant\u2019s contention on appeal is that, because the water-line extension was rendered necessary to save certain franchise rights of a water-company corporation, hence that this promise of defendant is a promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of the water company, and not being in writing, and signed by him, is void under the statute of frauds. The evidence clearly shows that defendant\u2019s promise was an original promise to pay plaintiffs for work performed for defendant at his request, and not a collateral promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another. The verdict for plaintiffs is sustained by the evidence, and the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
