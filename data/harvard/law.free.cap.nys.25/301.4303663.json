Among other provisions, the policy contained the following: \u201cThis policy may by a renewal be continued under the original stipulations, in consideration of premium for the renewed term: provided, that any increase of hazard must be made known to this company at the time of renewal or this policy shall be void. This policy shall be canceled at any time at the request of the insured, or by the company, by giving five days\u2019 notice of such cancellation.

On the 20th of February, 1891, the plaintiff served the-defendant with proofs of loss, claiming that it was liable on a contract insuring the property for $5,000, which proofs of loss the defendant returned on the next day. No policy or renewal receipt was ever delivered by the defendant to Beecher &amp; Benedict or to the plaintiff. This action was brought to recover $5,000, with the interest thereon. The following allegation is contained' in the complaint: \u201c(2) On and before the 1st day of January, 1891, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for insurance against loss on the building and property situated on the northeast comer of Thirteenth avenue and West Eleventh street, in the city of New York, and the defendant on said day agreed to and did become insurers of said property for twelve months from said 1st day of January, 1891, for the sum of five thousand dollars, and the-defendant further agreed that it would execute and deliver to plaintiff a policy of insurance covering said property in the usual form of policies of insurance issued by it, the defendant, for the sum of five thousand.\u201d The defendant denied that it insured the plaintiff\u2019s property for $5,000, as alleged,, and also denied that it agreed to execute and deliver to the plaintiff a policy of insurance on the property for $5,000. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s, evidence the defendant moved that the complaint be dismissed, which was-denied, and an exception was taken. The plaintiff thereupon moved that a verdict be directed in his favor for $5,591.86, the amount of his claim, which was granted and the defendant excepted. The defendant\u2019s exceptions were-ordered to be heard at the general term in the first instance.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b335-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Union Mut. Ins. Ck&gt;. v. Commercial Mut. Marine Ins. Co., 2 Curt. 524, affirmed 19 How. 318;. Insurance Co. v. Colt, 20 Wall. 560; Putnam v. Insurance Co., 123 Mass. 324. The complaint was evidently drafted with this difference in mind, and with the view of enabling the plaintiff to. recover on whichever kind of contract he should be able to establish. Was there a contract of insurance outstanding January 13, 1891, the date of the fire? The policy provides: \u201cThis policy may, by a renewal, be continued under the original stipulations in, consideration of premium for the renewed term.\u201d The policy had: been once renewed for the year 1890 at the same rate of premium-, charged for the original policy, and the defendant understood from-the application filed that the plaintiff desired, not a new policy, but a renewal of the one outstanding for the year 1891. This-is apparent from defendant\u2019s letter of January 7, 1891, in which it said, \u201cTour letter for renewal of insurance for E. M. Van Tassel,\u201d' etc. The binding slip of January 1, 1891, continued the original policy for $10,000 in force, subject to \"the original stipulation\u201d' therein contained. It was provided in the policy that any renewal of it should be subject to its provisions, which is the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u2022effect of a \u201cbinding slip.\u201d Lipman v. Insurance Co., 121 N Y. 454, 24 N. E. Rep. 699; Karelsen v. Sun Fire Office, 122 R Y. 545, 25 N. E. Rep. 921; May, Ins. (3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 44-59. By the binding slip the defendant contracted to continue its policy in force for $10,000 \u2022during the year 1891. This slip bound the company as effectually as the usual renewal receipt issued by insurers, and there was no way in which the defendant could, without the plaintiff\u2019s assent, terminate its contract, except in the mode provided in the policy. This it failed to do. The letter of January 7th was not effectual as a notice of cancellation, and at most it simply informed the insured that, unless he consented to accept a policy for $5,000 and surrender the contract which he then held, the insurance would be. canceled. To give this letter greater effect would be permitting the defendant to put an end to its contract in a way not provided for. The letter amounted only to a proposition by the defendant to the plaintiff to consent to a reduction of the amount insured. He had the right to accept the proposal or to stand by the contract then existing. He was not bound to take further action in the matter. Until the policy was canceled in accordance with its provision, it was in force, and the plaintiff was liable for the premium earned while the risk was covered. Had the plaintiff stood on this contract it is difficult to see how a recovery for the full amount insured by it could have been \u2022defeated. But the difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s case is that his conduct shows that he elected to consider the original policy at an end. This intention was manifested (1) by claiming that the \u2022defendant was liable for $5,000 when he gave notice of loss; (2) by tendering the premium on an insurance for $5,000; (3) by filing proofs of loss for $5,000; (4) by bringing this action for the recovery of $5,000. This conduct requires us to hold that the plaintiff acquiesced in the termination of the contract of insurance for $10,000, and it follows that there was no outstanding contract of insurance at the date of the fire, unless the sentence in the defendant\u2019s letter of January 7th can be construed to be such. The sentence is: \u201cYou will therefore consider that the risk is not held binding by this company for more than $5,000.\u201d A contract cannot be made without a meeting of the minds of the parties, and an agreement on its terms. The defendant could not impose on the plaintiff a new contract of insurance for $5,000, and at a higher rate of premium, without his assent. It is clear, we think, that the company could not have collected this premium \u2022on this sum from the plaintiff without his acceptance of the new contract tendered. He did not. manifest Ms acceptance of the new contract offered by the defendant until after the fire. This was too late, provided a reasonable time had elapsed in which he should have signified his assent. An insurer is not bound by an offer to insure property unless it is accepted, and it cannot be maintained that an owner can delay Ms acceptance for six days under the circumstances disclosed by this case, and until the property is destroyed by fire, and then, by an acceptance, bind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the company. The plaintiff, his agents, and the defendant were engaged in business in' the same city, and the property to be insured was situated in that city. We think that permitting six days to elapse without accepting the defendant\u2019s proposition was an unreasonable delay. When the facts are undisputed, the question what is a reasonable time is one of law for the court. Wiggins v. Burkham, 10 Wall. 129-132; May, Ins. (3d Ed.) \u00a7 368; Thomp. Trials, \u00a7 1530 et seq. There \u25a0 was no contract of insurance outstanding when the building was burned. Was there a binding contract to insure the property for $5,000 when the fire occurred? As before stated, an insurance company is not bound by its offer to insure unless it is accepted, which, as we have held, was not done in this case within a reasonable time. No binding contract to insure existed when the loss occurred. The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial must he granted, with costs to it, to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
