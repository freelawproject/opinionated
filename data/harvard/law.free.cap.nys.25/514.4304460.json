Y. Supp. 344. The question, then, is, were the objections, made to title by the title guaranty and trust company valid, and were they justified in rejecting the same? It is not essential that, at the time of the making of the contract, the title should be in the vendor\u2019s name, if at the time of the closing of the contract he was prepared- to transfer a good and valid title and deed, in accordance With the stipulations of the contract. From an examination of the evidence in this case, we think the trial judge was correct in granting the motion to dismiss the complaint, and that the objections made by the title guaranty and trust company are without legal merit, and form no objection, in law, to the title offered by the defendant. Judgment should\u201d therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
