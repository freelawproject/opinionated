The court found that plaintiffs called their mixture after the place it was made, and did not use the word \u201cAngostura\u201d as descriptive of the article till 1875, three years after Maynard.

Siegert, then a resident of the city of Angostura, Venezuela, South America, prepared a cordial or liquor, and about 1830 he engaged at that city in the business of manufacturing and selling the preparation as an article of commerce. The evidence shows that from 1830 to 1864 he continued the manufacture and sale of the article as sole proprietor, and that from the year 1864 to 1870, when he died, he was engaged in partnership with his son, Carlos D. Siegert, in the manufacture and sale of the article. After the death of Dr. Siegert, his sons, the present plaintiffs, under the firm name of Dr. J. G-. B. Siegert &amp; Hijos, continued the manufacture and sale of the same article. In 1846 the name of the city of Angostura was changed by statute to Cuidad Bolivar, since which time the city has been known by the last-mentioned name. This article was manufactured at the city of Angostura or Cuidad Bolivar until 1876, when the Siegerts ceased to manufacture it at that place, and began to-manufacture it at Port of Spain, in the island of Trinidad, where it has ever since been manufactured by them. This article has been put up and sold in bottles of two sizes, quarts and pints, on which were pasted printed wrappers or labels. Prior to 1875, the heading of their label was: \u201cAromatic Bitters, Prepared by Dr. Siegert, at Angostura, (now Cuidad Bolivar.)\u201d From 1875 to-1884 the label was in the following form: \u201cAromatic Bitters, or Angostura Bitters, Prepared by Dr. Siegert, at Angostura, (now Port of Spain, Trinidad.)\u201d In 1881, the plaintiffs filed a bill in equity in the state of Maryland to restrain C. W. Abbott &amp; Co. from using their trade-mark or trade-name. They were defeated in this action, upon the ground that their label was false, in not disclosing the fact that Dr. Siegert was dead, and that the article was no longer manufactured at Angostura. 61 Md. 286. After the entry of this judgment, the Siegerts changed the title of their label, and adopted the label now in use, which is given below. From 1872 to 1875 the firm of G-. H. Maynard &amp; Co. manufactured at Baltimore, Md., an article which they sold in the market under the name of \u201cAngostura Aromatic Bitters.\u201d Cornelius F. Abbott was a member of this firm. In 1876, C. W. Abbott &amp; Co. succeeded to the business of G-. H. Maynard &amp; Co., and have continued the manufacture and sale at Baltimore of a preparation designated as \u201cAngostura Aromatic Bitters.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b623-9\">Argued before O\u2019BRIEN, FOLLETT, and PARKER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-10\">Leavitt, Wood &amp; Keith, (John Brooks Leavitt, of counsel,) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-11\">Arthur Furber, (Frederick R.

Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311. It is apparent on principle, and it is well settled by authority, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>no one can acquire the exclusive right to use a geographical name, hr a term which denotes the nature of the article to which it is applied. Caswell v. Davis, 58 N. Y. 223; Keasbey v. Chemical Works, (Sup.) 21 N. Y. Supp. 696. The court found that the name \u201cAngostura Bitters\u201d was given by the Siegerts to their mixture because it was manufactured at the city of Angostura. It appears from the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that the word \u201cAngostura\u201d did not appear on their labels as descriptive of the article until 1875, three years after G. H. Maynard &amp; Co., the defendants\u2019 predecessors, began to use the term \u201cAngostura Aromatic Bitters\u201d to designate an article made and sold by them. The plaintiffs\u2019 agent in this country, who verified the complaint, was sworn on the trial, and testified that since 1878 the bitters made by the Siegerts have been advertised and sold all over the world under the name of \u201cAngostura Bitters.\u201d There is some slight evidence, mostly hearsay in its character, that prior to 1875 Siegerts Bitters were sometimes known as \u201cAngostura Bitters.\u201d This evidence was given by Wuppermann, who was but 51 years of age at the time of the trial, and left Angostura when 12 years of age, and by Paez, who thinks he first saw the article in 1843. The Siegert memorial tablet, which the plaintiffs put in evidence, states that \u201cin 1824 Dr. Siegert prepared the bitters for his own use, and in 1830 a shipment was sent to Trinidad and to England, but that in 1853 their sale did not exceed twenty dozen bottles per annum.\u201d But there is no evidence that the Siegerts applied that name to their compound when put up for sale prior to 1875. It was shown that December 12, 1871, the Siegerts filed in the patent office a so-called \u201ctrademark,\u201d by which they designated their compound as \u201cSiegert\u2019s Angostura Bitters,\u201d but there is no evidence that this term was ever applied to the article as sold on the market. The filing in the patent office of a device or name as the trade-mark for an article without afterwards using the emblem or name to denote the article sold is not sufficient to establish the right of the persons filing such a certificate to such trade-mark, and, unless the claimant has actually used the mark or device, he cannot restrain others from using a similar name. Subsequent to 1875 their bitters, when placed on the market, were labeled \u201cAngostura Bitters, Prepared by Dr. Siegert, at Angostura, (now Cuidad Bolivar.)\u201d Though, in 1846, Angostura ceased to be the legal name of the city, it has been since so called, and is carried in geographical gazetteers, in encyclopaedias, and on maps by its former name. Black\u2019s Atlas; Johnson\u2019s Atlas; Lippincott\u2019s Gaz.; Globe Gaz. Whether a word which formerly designated a city or country can be used as a trademark need not now be decided, for the reason that the evidence in this case shows that the defendants, and not the plaintiffs, first used the word \u201cAngostura\u201d to designate an article sold on the markets. Besides, one of the defendants testified\u2014and in this he was not contradicted\u2014that \u201cAngostura bark is the largest ingredient in it, [defendants\u2019 mixture,] and it is from that which it takes its name.\u201d The other defendant, when speaking of the receipt from which their article was compounded, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cI remember that Angostura bark was one.of the articles mentioned in the receipt. Don\u2019t recollect what part of the receipt it appeared in. I know it is probably the biggest thing there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The word \u201cAngostura\u201d has long been used in medical .and scientific works to designate the bark of a South American tree, having well-known medical properties. The following definition of this word is given in Murray\u2019s New English Distionary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201cAngustura, or Angostura. A town on the Orinoco, now called Cuidad Bolivar. It gives its name to a bark, valuable as febrifuge and tonic, the produce of galipea or cuspar\u00eda febr\u00edfuga, 1791, A. Brande, (title,) \u2018Experiments and Observations on the Angustura Bark.\u2019 1840, Pereria Mat. Med. 1204: \u2018Angostura bark was first publicly noticed in the London Medical Journal for 1789.\u2019 1806, Masters in Treas. Bot. 517: \u2018The means, chemical and otherwise, of distinguishing the true from the false Angostura barks.\u2019 1879, Bliss Brad-don, Vixen III., 191: \u2018Propped up with sherry and Angostura bitters.\u2019 1879, Watts\u2019 Diet. Chem. 3rd Suppl. 87: \u2018Sections of true Angostura bark.\u2019 1881, Syd. Soe. Lex. \u2018Angostura.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The word is defined in the Century Dictionary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cAngostura or cuspar\u00eda bark, the product of a rutaceous shrub, galipea cuspar\u00eda, of the mountains of Venezuela; a valuable tonic in dyspepsia, dysentery, and chronic diarrhea. It was formerly prized as a febrifuge, and is now much used in making a kind of bitters. Its use in medicine was discontinued for a time, because of the introduction into the markets of a false Angostura bark, obtained from the nux vomica tree, which produced fatal effects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">A word or term which truly denotes the nature or the chief ingredient of an article to which it is applied may be used by any manufacturer or producer of such article, though the word or term has been previously used by others to designate a like article which they produced. Caswell v. Davis, 58 N. Y. 223; Keasbey v. Chemical Works, (Sup.) 21 N. Y. Supp. 696. We think the evidence in the record and the authorities make it plain that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that they have acquired a valid trade-mark by the use which they have made of the word \u201cAngostura\u201d standing alone, or as combined by them with other words. Have the defendants, by the mode in which they have put up and described their fluid, deceitfully induced purchasers to believe that they were buying the article manufactured by the plaintiffs, instead of the one manufactured by the defendants; or is the defendants\u2019 method of bottling, labeling, and describing their article likely, in the future, to induce purchasers exercising reasonable prudence to purchase and use the defendants\u2019 mixture upon the belief that it is the plaintiffs\u2019, and so injure the plaintiffs\u2019 business? When a trade-mark acquired by one person is used, though innocently, by another, the latter becomes liable for the damages caused, and may be restrained from using the device. But when one seeks to restrain another from using a trade-name, or from putting up and selling goods in .any way calculated to induce purchasers to believe that they are buying goods which were manufactured by the complainant, the right of recovery rests upon the theory that a false representation has been made. The rule is well stated in Manufacturing Co. v. Wilson, 2 \u00b0 Oh. Div. 434. When this action was begun, the litigants were selling their compounds in quart and pint bottles, made of glass, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of much the same shape, though there is a perceptible difference between them. The bottles used by the plaintiffs have the name \u201cDr. J. Gr. B. Siegert &amp; Hijos\u201d blown in their shoulders and bottoms. The bottle\u00b0s used by the defendants have the name \u201cO. W. Abbott &amp; Co., Baltimore, Md.,\u201d blown in their shoulders and bottoms. On the bottles used by the plaintiffs there is a label printed in English, French, Grerman, and Spanish, on which two medallions are represented. The bottles used by the defendants are wrapped in a label printed in English, French, and Grerman, but no medallions are represented. The following are copies of the description in English printed upon the bottles used by the litigants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cAromatic Bitters, or Angostura Bitters, Formerly Prepared at Angostura by Doctor Siegert, and now in Port of Spain, Trinidad, by his Sons and Successors, under the old Firm Name of Dr. J. Gr. B. Siegert &amp; Hijos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cThese Bitters do not only distinguish themselves by their flavor and aromatic odour above all others generally used, but are at the same time an excellent tonic, and an efficacious stimulant to incite the appetite. They are principally used thus: Pour half a tablespoonfull in a wineglass, mix it with rum, wine, or other licor, and take it before breakfast or dinner, or at any other hour of the day, if you should feel inclined. They can likewise be used in sugar and water, or syrup, and, thus composed, they have an agreeable taste, and are more suitable for ladies and children. They are, moreover, an excellent remedy for removing indigestion, flatulency, hysterical and hypochondriac attacks, colics, colds, pains of the stomach and diarrhoea which originate from weakness and relaxation of the digestive organs. In such cases the dose is from half to one tablespoonfull, according to the violence of the attack, and may be taken, mixed as above mentioned or pure, once or several times per hour or in the course of the day until the disease disappears. Besides their extreme usefulness in the cure of fever and ague, they are also an excellent preservative against the aforesaid maladies. In the former case the dose is from half to one tablespoonfull, either mixed as above, and to be taken two, three, four, or more times during the day while the patient is free from fever. In the latter case adapt their principal application according to the general use of bitters. When administered to children above two years old, the dose should be from 20 to 60 drops, in proportion to the age. In fine, they can be applied with success for the improvement of new rum by using two tablespoonfull of Bitters to each gallon of rum, and thus they remove its bad smell and acrid taste, giving it immediately an agreeable flavour similar to old rum. Besides the above-mentioned advantageous qualities of these Bitters, they are of a most important service as a remedy against the Asiatic Cholera and Cholerine, in every instance where they have been employed with a splendid success. In such cases the dose is of one or two tablespoonfull, repeating the same every day three or four times, until a favorable result is obtained, which is very often experienced. For women and children, the doses are to be smaller in proportion to their age and constitution, and to be taken mixed with good wine, brandy, or pure. Their ordinary daily use as Bitters, is generally found to be a preservative against the aforesaid Cholera and Cholerine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201cAngostura Aromatic Bitters, Prepared by C. W. Abbott &amp; Co., 18 Camden Street, Baltimore, Md.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">\u201cThe utmost care is used in compounding these bitters, both in selecting the materials and in extracting and compounding their medicinal and valuable properties. Certain barks and roots, long known and highly prized in the materia medico, have been made to yield their most valuable properties, and these have been so combined by the art of the apothecary of ancient times as to produce the best tonic and appetizer known. These bitters have been used for many years throughout this country and elsewhere, both as a medicine and for cock-tails and flavoring wines and liquors. For these purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>they stand pre-eminent, imparting a fine aromatic flavor, and removing the unpleasant odor usually found in new liquors. When used to impart flavor and color, use 6 to 8 drops to a wine glass. This wonderful Tonic is unequalled as a cure for Liver Complaint, Dyspepsia, Fever and Ague, Billious, Intermittent, and Remittent Fevers. It is also invaluable in Nervous Weakness of all kinds, and will restore the wasted strength with wonderful permanence. It will be found totally different from any other Bitters, and is so pronounced by the best physicians in this country. It contains no mineral or poisonous qualities, but is composed entirely of vegetable matter. Dose for the above, one part Bitters and two parts water. If taken pure, one-third: wine glass, three times daily. Besides being a preventive of the above-named disease's, it is a sure remedy for Asiatic Cholera and Yellow Fever, which have of late years visited some of ara southern cities. In every instance they have been employed with success. Dose, % wine glass, four or five times per day until the danger is past. Graduate dose according to age. For adults a half wine glass full will obviate the effects of Debility, and restore the functions in cases of Diarrhea, Nausea, and Sea-Sickness. We have the amplest and most gratifying testimonials to their efficacy and value from the best medical authority in this country, and from the proprietors of the first houses throughout the United States where it has been long and favorably known.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">It will be observed that 'in the title of the label used by the defendants are the words: \u201cAngostura Aromatic Bitters, Prepared by O. W. Abbott &amp; Co., 18 Camden Street, Baltimore, Md.\u201d These words are printed from clear type of good size. The title of the plaintiffs\u2019 label contains the following words: \u201cAromatic Bitters, or Angostura Bitters, Formerly Prepared at Angostura by Doctor Siegert, and now in Port of Spain, Trinidad, by his Sons and Successors, under the old Firm Name of Dr. J. G-. B. Siegert &amp; Hijos.\u201d These words are also clearly printed from type of good size. It is difficult to see how a purchaser, exercising reasonable prudence, could be led to believe that he was purchasing the article manufactured by the plaintiffs 'instead of the article manufactured by the defendants. It will be observed that the merits and uses of these mixtures are differently described in the labels. In the defendants\u2019 description it is said: \u201cThese bitters have been used for many years throughout this country and elsewhere both as a medicine and for cocktails and flavoring wines and liquors. For these purposes they stand pre-eminent, imparting a fine aromatic flavor and removing the unpleasant odor usually found in new liquors.\u201d The plaintiffs, in their description, do not recommend the articles as specially useful in the manufacture of cocktails, but assert that the article \u201ccan be -applied with success for the improvement of new rum, * * '\u201d' and thus they remove its bad smell and acrid taste, giving it immediately an agreeable flavoring similar to old rum.\u201d The plaintiffs also assert that their bitters are \u201can excellent remedy for removing indigestion, flatulency, hysterical and hypochondriac attacks, colics, colds, pains of the stomach and diarrhoea which originate from weakness and relaxation of the digestive organs,\u201d while the defendants say that \u201cthis [their] wonderful tonic is unequalled as a cure for liver complaint, dyspepsia, fever and ague, bilious, intermittent, and remittent fevers. It is invaluable in nervous weaknesses of all kinds, and will restore the wasted strength with wonderful permanence.\u201d The plaintiffs assert that their bitters \u201care of a most important service as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>remedy against Asiatic cholera and cholerine, in every instance where they have been employed with a splendid success.\u201d The defendants state that their article \u201cis a sure remedy for Asiatic cholera and yellow fever. * * * In every instance they have been employed with success.\u201d Here we find another marked difference in the descriptions of the merits of the two articles, the defendants\u2019 mixture being a cure for yellow fever and the plaintiffs\u2019 not. A person apprehending or suffering from an attack of Asiatic cholera might purchase and us\u00e9 either or both kinds of bitters, and probably with the same result; while one having or apprehending yellow fever would, we assume, surely buy and use defendants\u2019 mixture. . The diseases which these two kinds of wonderful bitters prevent and cure are not identical, as will be observed by any reader of ordinary intelligence, and we must presume that they are purchased for the uses for which they are so highly recommended by their manufacturers. The plaintiffs, in describing how their articles should be used, say: \u201cThey are principally used thus: Pour half a tablespoonful in a wine glass, mix it with rum, wine, or other liquor, and take it before breakfast or dinner, or at any other hour of the day if you should feel inclined.\u201d It is also asserted that when used with sugar, water, or syrup their bitters \u201care more suitable for ladies and children.\u201d The defendants do not state that their article is suitable for the use of women and children. The defendants also state that \u201ccertain barks and roots long known and highly prized in the materia medico have, been made to yield their most valuable properties, and these have been so combined by the art of the apothecary of ancient times as to produce the best tonic and appetizer known.\u201d No such claim is put forth in behalf of the plaintiffs\u2019 mixture. We think it is apparent that a cursory examination of the bottles and of the claims of the merits of their. contents set forth by the litigants on their wrappers show that the bitters are made by different firms, at places widely separated, and that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a finding that the defendants have simulated the plaintiffs\u2019 goods with the intent to deceive intending purchasers, and that there is no such probability of such purchasers being deceived by the way in which the defendants have prepared and placed their article on the market as to require the intervention of this court in behalf of the plaintiffs. Neither of the litigants gave any evidence tending to show that the bitters prepared by them respectively possessed any medicinal qualities, or had served any useful purpose except as an article for sale. The plaintiffs did not show that Angostura bark, or any extract of it, entered into the composition of their bitters, nor did they specify a single ingredient used in their manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The rights of these plaintiffs were considered in Siegert v. Findlater, 7 Ch. Div. 801. It is there held that Siegert\u2019s mixture was first introduced in England in 1863, since which their popular name has been \u201cAngostura Bitters;\u201d but that the Siegerts did not adopt and apply that name to their mixture until after that name had been used by Maynard, in 1874, as descriptive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>a kind of bitters made by him. It was held that the Siegerts failed to establish a valid trade-mark; but it was also held that the mode in which the defendant put up and described his mixture was calculated to and was intended by the defendant as a deception. In that case the defendant was restrained \u201cfrom using the words \u2018Angostura Bitters,\u2019 or the word \u2018Angostura,\u2019 on any bitters or other fluids contained in bottles, not made by the plaintiffs, so as to induce the belief that such bitters or fluids are made by the plaintiffs; and, further, from selling or offering for sale any bitters or other fluids in the bottles, in the wrappers, and in the general form in which the defendants were selling the bitters called by them \u2018Angostura Bitters\u2019 at the commencement of this action, or in any other wrappers or form contrived or designed to represent and induce the belief that the bitters or fluids sold by the defendants, and not made by the plaintiffs, are the goods of the plaintiffs.\u201d In the case at bar the judgment goes much further, and restrains the defendants from using the words \u201cAngostura Bitters,\u201d or the word \u201cAngostura,\u201d or any imitation of such word, on any bitters or cordials made by or for the defendants. It is clearly shown, we think, that the plaintiffs have no trademark in these words, nor any right to their exclusive use, and the only possible relief that the plaintiffs could be entitled to under the most favorable view of their own evidence would be a judgment restraining the defendants from using those words in such a way as to lead purchasers to believe that they were buying the plaintiffs\u2019 bitters when, in fact, they were buying the defendants\u2019. If these bitters have no medicinal properties, and are only useful, for flavoring wines and liquors, they should be so advertised and sold, and not advertised and sold as having medicinal merits, unless they possess such merits; otherwise courts of equity will not look with favor on the application of the manufacturers for protection against rivals engaged in the same pursuit. In Fowle v. Spear, 7 Pa. Law J. 176, Cox, Trade-Mark Cas. (2d Ed.) 90, an injunction to restrain the use of labels and bottles similar to those used by the plaintiff was refused on the ground that the plaintiff had misrepresented, by his labels, the qualities and properties of his medicine. Browne, Trade-Marks, \u00a7 351. See, also, Leather Cloth Co. v. American Leather Cloth Co., 4 De Gex, J. &amp; S. 137, affirmed 11 H. L. Cas. 522; Connell v. Reed, 128 Mass. 477; Medicine Co. v. Wood, 108 U. S. 218, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436; Fetridge v. Wells, 4 Abb. Pr. 144; Dale v. Smithson, 12 Abb. Pr. 237; Bigelow, Fraud, 560. We do not think courts of equity should be swift or vigilant to protect the manufacturer of a compound advertised and sold as a valuable medicine, which is not shown to contain a single medical ingredient, or to possess a single merit claimed for it, as against another manufacturer, producing and selling a like compound. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
