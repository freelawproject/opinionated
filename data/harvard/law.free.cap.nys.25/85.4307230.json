The evidence is identical with that in the Struthers Case, 25 N. Y. Supp. 81, and affects the next adjoining premises. The grounds urged for reversal on this appeal do not differ from those already considered and held by us to be invalid. Struthers v. Railroad Co., (opinion handed down herewith.) Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
