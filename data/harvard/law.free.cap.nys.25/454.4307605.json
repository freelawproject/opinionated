That heretofore, and on or before the 1st day of April, 1890, an action was pending in the supreme court, in the county of New York, in which James E. Taylor was plaintiff, and Andrew K. Smith, Martin Pinney, Jay K. Smith, Julius Stickney, and another were defendants, upon a promissory note made by the said above-named defendants in that action, dated May 14, 1889, payable four months after date to Esther A. Rose or bearer, who indorsed the same, and the same was then held and owned by the said James B. Taylor, as set out in the pleadings in said action, to which reference is hereby made as a part of this complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-10\">Second. That, the said defendants, having desired to appeal from an order made in the said action denying a motion made on behalf of the said defendants'above named to change the venue of said action from the county of New York to the county of Steuben, duly perfected such appeal to the general term of the supreme court in the first department.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\">Third. That said action having been placed on the short-cause calendar, in the county of New York, for trial, by order of the supreme court therein, on a contested motion, it was reached on or about the 25th day of March, 1890, and tried, and an inquest taken therein, and judgment directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the said four named defendants in that action, for the amount of the said note, with interest thereon, besides the costs and disbursements of that action, by Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien, before whom the said action was tried, and a jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-12\">Fourth. That upon said trial and inquest the said four last named defendants, by their attorneys and counsel, applied for a stay, and to have the said inquest set aside pending the hearing and determination of the said appeal at general term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-13\">Fifth. That thereupon the said Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien, upon the request and application of the said defendants in that action, made an order directing and providing, among other things, that in case said Andrew K. Smith, Martin Pinney, Jay K. Smith, and Julius Stickney should give an undertaking, on or before the 3d day of April, 1890, to the said James E.

They also admit the execution of the bond or undertaking set forth in the complaint, and the rend\u00ed tian of the judgment therein set forth. The defendants further admit that a notice of the entry of the judgment mentioned in the complaint was served on them ten days prior to the commencement of this action, but deny that they were indebted to the plaintiff, or any other person, by virtue of the said undertaking. The defendants, further answering, deny that no part of the said\" judgment has been paid, and deny that they have any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to all the other allegations in said complaint contained not hereinbefore admitted or denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-10\">(2) The defendants, further answering, allege that on the 27th day of August, 1880, a stipulation apd agreement was made in writing, and delivered, between the plaintiff in the alleged judgment, James E. Taylor, and \u25a0 the defendants therein, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-11\">\u201cN. Y.

Smith shall quitclaim all his interest in the \u00a71,900 mortgage and judgment, and fails to pay James B. Taylor the amount of said judgment above stated, then J. E. Taylor to assign the same to A. K. Smith or his order, or, if Smith pays said judgment, he is to have an assignment..</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">\u201cDated August 27,1890. Clark Bell, Biff.

Smith, Atty. for Defts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-7\">The defendants further allege that the judgment mentioned in said stipulation refers to the judgment set forth in the complaint, and that the names J. Emmett Taylor and James E. Taylor refer to and describe one and the same person. The defendants further allege, on information and belief, that after said stipulation was made, or about that-time, and before the pretended and alleged assignment of said judgment was made to the plaintiff, the said Andrew K. Smith, in pursuance of the agreement of James E. Taylor or J. Emmett Taylor to assign over to him the said judgment, did fully assign and quitclaim over to said James E. Taylor his entire interest, he being the sole owner in the \u00a71,900 mortgage and judgment mentioned in the said agreement, and he delivered the same to said James E. Taylor, who then and there accepted the same, and agreed to assign over to said Andrew K. Smith the said judgment, as provided in the writing hereinbefore set forth. The defendants further allege, on information and belief, that at the time of the pretended assignment of said judgment over to the plaintiff herein, the said James E. Taylor had been fully paid all that was due him on said judgment, and that Andrew It. Smith, one of the defendants in said judgment, was the lawful owner thereof, and entitled to an assignment of the same. Wherefore the defendants demand judgment dismissing the complaint, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b490-8\">Argued before O\u2019BRIEU, FOLLETT, and PARKER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-9\">Jay K. Smith, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-10\">Clark Bell, for respondent,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b490-11\">O\u2019BRIEH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAh\">If the rule of law that there should be an end to litigation is not an obsolete one, then should it be applied to the facts here appearing. The defendants\u2019 attorney, who was the principal debtor, has, by procuring the substitution of sureties, the giving of an undertaking, the assignment of a mortgage as collateral, and above all by dilatory motions and an equity action, succeeded in preventing the collection of a debt, originally evidenced by a promissory note given for value, and which, after a protracted litigation, carried twice to the general term on appeals from orders, it was adjudged he should pay. Upon one of such appeals the undertaking w.as given by the defendants which is the subject of this action. With a final judgment in one\u2019s favor, secured by an undertaking upon appeal, and after exhamsting the remedy by execution against the judgment debtors, it would seemingly present a case where a creditor might reasonably expect satisfaction of his claim against the sureties. Hot so in this instance, for the defendants\u2019 attorney, having but sharpened his appetite in the. first action, found ample food to sustain him in a guerilla warfare which he has successfully waged for more than two years. Having tired out Taylor, the original and judgment creditor, the latter assigned the judgment and undertaking to this plaintiff, for what is sworn to by the latter to have been a valuable consideration. In this suit against the sureties on the undertaking, the execution of the undertaking, the recovery of judgment, and no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tice to defendants are admitted; but by way of defense it is claimed that in a transaction between Andrew K. Smith, one of the sureties on the original note, and Taylor, the latter had extended the judgment, on receiving an assignment of a mortgage \u2022as additional security, to March 14, 1891, when, upon payment of the claim, the judgment and mortgage were to be reassigned to Andrew K. Smith, and, if not paid in cash, that the mortgage was to be accepted by Taylor as a satisfaction of or as a consideration for the assignment of his judgment. In passing, it may be said cash was not paid on March 14, 1891. The case was placed on the short-cause calendar for trial, and, when reached, the defendant not appearing, a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor was had. Thereupon defendants moved to open the default, and asked for 'a stay until the final determination of an action brought by Andrew K. Smith to compel an assignment of the judgment upon the same state of facts set up by way of defense in this action. So much of the motion as asked for a stay was denied, but the default was opened upon terms, the judge ordering the case again on the short-cause calendar for trial. Upon a motion to bring in this plaintiff as a defendant in the Smith suit, and for an order enjoining the trial of this action until the determination of that, a preliminary stay was granted, but upon the hearing, it was vacated, and an order was made making Dunham (this plaintiff) a defendant in that action, but without prejudice to this action. Again placed on the short-cause calendar, this action was again reached for trial, but, defendants absenting themselves, plaintiff recovered judgment in May, 1892. A motion to open this default was made, and another preliminary stay obtained. Again the stay was vacated, but the default opened upon terms. The explanation of defendants\u2019 course is to be found in the fact that by suffering these defaults and by obtaining intermediate temporary stays they obtained what they sought, and what the court had refused them, viz. a trial first of the Smith suit against this plaintiff and Taylor. Though tried, no decision was given, and, though three judges had decided that this should not prejudice this plaintiff\u2019s action against these defendants, another temporary stay was obtained until the hearing of a motion returnable December 27, 1892. Dates are now important. This cause was again reached for trial on December 16, 1892, and was postponed upon \u25a0an express stipulation by defendants that it should be tried on a judgment suffered on the 23d. On December 23d, no one appearing for defendants, a default was taken, and for the third time a judgment entered, and thereafter, on the same day, the stay upon the motion made returnable on the 27th was served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney. This prevented any further action until January, 1893, when the decision in the Smith suit was handed down, dismissing the complaint on the merits. Thereupon this plaintiff, as he had the right to do, proceeded to enforce his judgment by issuing execution, but before he obtained a return from the sheriff the de fendants obtained another stay, and made another motion to open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the default of December 23d; and it is from a denial of this last, motion that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">We have thus gone over the successive steps taken in the two. actions because they render further comment unnecessary. The same attorney who, as said, was the principal debtor, appeared throughout, and is entitled to the credit of having successfully held off this plaintiff for two years in a simple action that could be tried in an hour, even if we assume that the transactions between Andrew K. Smith and Taylor were available in this action between these parties. Having been beaten in the Smith equity suit, he can, as was therein suggested, if unsuccessful on his appeal, obtain 'an adequate remedy at law. But whether he can or not, he has exhausted his remedies in this action, and we think .that the discretion was wisely exercised by the judge at special term in denying the motion to open the last default, and that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
