We hold that a defendant must have engaged in both activities in order to be liable under section 25500.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">S3 Incorporated (S3 or company) supplies high-performance multimedia acceleration hardware and software for personal computers. Its stock is traded through the NASDAQ national market system. Defendants Carmelo J. Santoro, John C. Colligan, and Robert P. Lee were members of the company\u2019s board of directors. Defendant Harry L. Dickinson served as senior vice-president of sales after April of 1995. Defendant Dale R. Lindly served as S3\u2019s corporate controller prior to March 4, 1997, and chief financial officer after that date. Defendant Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP (Deloitte) is a firm of certified public accountants that was engaged by S3 to provide accounting and auditing services.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>According to the consolidated amended class action complaint against S3 and various defendants, during the class period, S3, certain officers and directors of the company and Deloitte issued materially false financial statements for the interim quarters and fiscal year 1996 and for the first and second quarters of 1997. These statements overstated the company\u2019s revenues by over $58 million. The named defendants also made a series of materially false and misleading statements about S3\u2019s operations, products, future business prospects and the market in which S3 sells its products. As a result, the market price of the company\u2019s shares reached an all-time high of $23 per share in October of 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">At the same time, S3 insiders sold off more than 648,000 of their personally held S3 shares, with more than half of them selling 77 percent or more of their holdings at artificially inflated prices, for proceeds exceeding $10.7 million. The company was also able to successfully complete a $103.5 million convertible subordinated note offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">S3 later restated its financial results for 1996 and the first two quarters of 1997. The company admitted that its financial reports for the affected quarters were materially false and prepared in violation of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company also admitted that it improperly and prematurely recognized millions of dollars of revenue on products shipped primarily to its international distributors. This revenue was recognized before these products were sold through to end-user customers in violation of GAAP and S3\u2019s own policy controlling the timing of revenue recognition. S3 admitted that revenue of between $40 and $70 million in sales to distributors had been improperly recognized. Shares of S3 stock fell to $7-11/32 the day following the announcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">On November 7, 1997, plaintiffs, investors who bought S3 stock during the period between April 18, 1996, and November 3, 1997, filed a class action against S3 and various directors and officers of the company. On June 16, 1998, plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action against the same defendants and Deloitte. All of the defendants filed demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The trial court sustained selected demurrers. The demurrer by John Colligan, Robert Lee and Carmelo Santoro was sustained on the ground that these defendants were not alleged to have made any fraudulent statements or prepared any misleading documents. The demurrer by Dale Lindly was sustained on the ground that Lindly was not alleged to have sold any securities. The demurrer by Harry Dickinson was sustained on the ground that it was not alleged that Dickinson sold any stock after he made the alleged misrepresentations. The demurrer by Deloitte was sustained on the ground that the firm was not alleged to have sold any securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Plaintiffs elected not to amend the complaint, and judgment was entered in favor of Colligan, Lee, Santoro, Lindly, Dickinson, and Deloitte. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Plaintiffs contend that each defendant willfully \u201cparticipated\u201d in violating section 25400, as that term is used in section 25500. They maintain that in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrers the trial court effectively read the word \u201cparticipates\u201d out of section 25500, requiring instead that each defendant be alleged to have independently violated section 25400 by personally making a false or misleading statement and by selling stock. Accordingly, they assert that the demurrers were improperly sustained. Although our Supreme Court has yet to address this issue (see <em>StorMedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 449, 461, fn. 13 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 976 P.2d 214]), we disagree with plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, the trial court is guided by long-settled rules. It treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. It also considers matters that may be judicially noticed. Further, the court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. <em>(Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) Regardless of the labels attached by the pleader to any alleged cause of action, the court examines the factual allegations of the complaint, to determine whether they state a cause of action on any available legal theory. <em>(Ellenberger </em>v. <em>Espinosa </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 943, 947 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 360].)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">On appeal, plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that the trial court erroneously sustained the demurrer as a matter of law. This court reviews the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts stating a cause of action under any legal theory. Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, plaintiffs must show the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action. If the complaint fails to plead, or if the defendants negate, any essential element of a particular cause of action, this court affirms the sustaining of the demurrers. <em>(Rakestraw v. California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\n<em>Seller or Purchaser Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u201cCorporations Code section 25400, a part of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (Corp. Code, \u00a7 25000 et seq.), provides that it is unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in this state to make false statements or engage in specified fraudulent transactions which affect the market for a security when done for the purpose of inducing purchase or sale of the security or raising or depressing the price of the security. In short, it prohibits market manipulation. Section 25500 creates a civil remedy for buyers or sellers of stock the price of which has been affected by the forms of market manipulation proscribed by section 25400.\u201d <em>(Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1040 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539] <em>(Diamond Multimedia), </em>fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The instant complaint purports to state a cause of action under section 25400, subdivision (d) which provides in relevant part: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in this state: HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 If such person is a . . . person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security, to make, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others, any statement which was, at the time and in the <em>light of the </em>circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and which he knew or had reasonable ground to believe was so false or misleading.\u201d Section 25400 defines the proscribed conduct, but does not create a private right of action that gives rise to civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Section 25500 creates the private right to action and establishes the circumstances under which a person who has engaged in the conduct proscribed by section 25400 may be held liable for damages. The statute proves that \u201c[a]ny person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of Section 25400 shall be liable to any other person who purchases or sells any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction for the damages sustained by the latter as a result of such act or transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Plaintiffs first assert that because the word \u201cparticipates\u201d is clear, we should not indulge in judicial construction. <em>(Diamond Multimedia, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1047.) They maintain that the plain meaning of \u201cparticipates\u201d is \u201cto take part\u201d or \u201cjoin or share with others.\u201d They conclude that if the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting section 25500 was to limit civil liability to persons who directly violated section 25400 by both making the false statement <em>and </em>engaging in market activity, the Legislature would not have used the word \u201cparticipates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Plaintiffs fail to take into consideration that Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500 are modeled on subsection (a) and subsection (e) of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(a) &amp; (e)). (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, Practice Under the California Securities Laws (2001) \u00a7 14.05[1], p. 14-47 (Marsh and Volk).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the language of Corporations Code section 25500 precisely parallels the language in section 9, subsection (e) of that act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is important to point out that the five subdivisions of section 25400 deal with various types of activity designed to manipulate the market price of a security, which were common during the so-called pool operations in the 1920\u2019s. (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[2][c], p. 14-48.) Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the word \u201cparticipates\u201d in section 25500 extends liability to all the participants in these pools. For instance, section 25400, subdivision (a) prohibits \u201cwash sales,\u201d i.e., the entering of purchase and sale orders of equal amounts in order to create the appearance of active trading and raise or depress the price of a security. Subdivisions (c) and (e) deal with \u201ctipster sheets\u201d where either a broker-dealer or other person engaged in the pool operations, or a third person employed by the principals, disseminates information that the price of a security will rise or fall because of the market operations of the pool. (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[2][c], pp. 14-48 to 14-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Where, as here, California law is modeled on federal laws, federal decisions interpreting substantially identical statutes are unusually strong persuasive precedent on construction of our own laws. <em>(Building Material &amp; Construction Teamsters\u2019 Union v. Farrell </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 651, 658 [224 Cal.Rptr. 688, 715 P.2d 648]; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 426, 430 [110 P.2d 428].) In the absence of California cases that address the issue at bench, we look to federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Federal courts that have considered civil liability under subsection (a)(4) of section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on which Corporations Code section 25400, subdivision (d) was based, have concluded that the federal statute imposes civil liability only on \u201csellers\u201d of securities. (See, e.g., <em>Gulf Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co. </em>(D.Del. 1984) 582 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>F.Supp. 1110, 1122 [Securities Exchange Act \u00a7 9(a)(4) \u201capplies] only to a . . . \u2018person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase\u2019 a security\u201d]; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Banner Industries, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1966) 285 F.Supp. 758, 761 [Securities Exchange Act \u00a7 9(a)(4) \u201crequires that the misleading information be made by the purchaser to the seller or vice-versa\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Hokama </em>v. <em>E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1983) 566 F.Supp. 636 to support their position that liability under section 25500 is not limited to direct violators of section 25400. In <em>Hokama, </em>the plaintiffs alleged a cause of action against a defendant for a violation of section 25500. The defendant asserted that section 25500 imposes liability only on persons who themselves violate section 25400. The district court disagreed. It reasoned as follows: \u201cIn contrast to the immediately subsequent sections of the Code, which impose civil liability only on direct violators, see Cal.Corp.Code \u00a7\u00a7 25501-25503, section 25500 imposes liability on any person who \u2018participates\u2019 in a violation. Absent California authority indicating otherwise, the Court concludes from this difference in statutory wording that liability under section 25500 is not limited to direct violators of section 25400.\u201d <em>(Hokama, </em>at p. 648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We disagree with the reasoning of <em>Hokama. </em>First, Corporations Code section 25501 et seq. is modeled upon section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 rather than on section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.03[1], [3]a, [4]a, pp. 14-20 to 14-23.) Second, <em>Hokama </em>ignores Corporations Code sections 25504<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 25504.1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which specifically impose liability not only on the buyer or seller of a security but on controlling persons, associates and agents as well as aiders and abettors. These statutes indicate that the Legislature knows how to establish secondary liability when it wants to do so, yet failed to do so with respect to Corporations Code section 25400. Third, <em>Hokama </em>is the sole federal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that reached this conclusion. Other federal courts have concluded that Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500 apply only to defendants who were engaged in market activity at the time of the misrepresentations. (See, e.g., <em>Reiger </em>v. <em>Altris Software, Inc: </em>(S.D.Cal. 1999) Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 90,491 [Corp. Code, \u00a7 25500 \u201cwas not intended to reach defendants who did not <em>directly </em>participate in the sale of securities or some other \u2018market activity\u2019 \u201d]; <em>In re Activision Securities Litigation </em>(N.D.Cal. 1985) 621 F.Supp. 415, 422 [Corp. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500 apply only to sellers]; <em>Hudson v. Capital Management Intern., Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1983) 565 F.Supp. 615, 628 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>Hokama </em>also appears to contradict the view expressed by Marsh and Volk. In their treatise, the authors indicate that with the exception of subdivision (e) of section 25400 dealing with runners who distribute \u201ctipster sheets,\u201d under each of the other subdivisions of the statute the defendant must be engaged in market activity in order to be liable. Subdivision (d) expressly requires that the defendant be either \u201c \u2018a broker-dealer or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security.\u2019 \u201d (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[4], p. 14-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Pinter v. Dahl </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 622 [108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d 658], for the proposition that unlike the narrow seller requirement in section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933, section 9 of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act contemplated broader liability to collateral \u201cparticipants\u201d in a sale. In <em>Pinter, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the \u201cseller\u201d requirement imposed by section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 could be satisfied by allegations that a defendant substantially participated in a sale of securities. The court found no support in the statutory language or legislative history for expanding liability beyond the seller of the security. <em>(Pinter v. Dahl, supra, </em>at p. 650 [108 S.Ct. at pp. 2079-2080].) In reaching this decision, the court noted that Congress was aware of the collateral participation concept and employed it in such legislation as section 9 of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, more specifically in 15 United States Code section 78i(e). <em>(Pinter </em>v. <em>Dahl, supra, </em>at p. 650, fn. 26 [108 S.Ct. at p. 2080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"><em>Pinter </em>is no longer good law to the extent that it conflicts with <em>Central Bank of Denver, N.A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A. </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 164 [114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119] <em>(Central Bank). </em>In that case, the high court looked at the question of whether private civil liability under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j) extends as well to those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice, but who aid and abet the violation. In addressing the issue, the court looked at private causes of action in both the 1933 Securities Act and 1934 Securities Exchange Act, and specifically reviewed section 9 of the 1934 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The court concluded that \u201cnone of the express causes of action in the 1934 Act further imposes liability on one who aids or abets a violation.\u201d <em>(Central Bank, </em>at p. 179 [114 S.Ct. at p. 1449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In light of the vast majority of federal cases that have construed section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500, we conclude that civil liability pursuant to Corporations Code section 25500 applies only to a defendant who is either a person selling or offering to sell or buying or offering to buy a security. Since it was never alleged that defendant Lindly or Deloitte ever sold or offered to sell S3 stock, plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">With respect to defendant Dickinson, plaintiffs concede that he did not sell any S3 stock after March 1997. Therefore, having made the allegedly false statements after he sold his shares, he could not have made the misrepresentations \u201cfor the purpose of inducing the purchase ... of such security by others,\u201d as contemplated by section 25400. (See <em>StorMedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 461, fn. 13 [\u201cThe unlawful conduct is the making of false and misleading statements for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of a security which the defendant is selling, offering to sell, purchasing, or offering to purchase.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>Misleading Statement Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Relying on Abrams, <em>The Scope of Liability Under Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933: \u201cParticipation\u201d and the Pertinent Legislative Materials </em>(1987) 15 Fordham Urb. L.J. 877, 932 (Abrams),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiffs assert defendants Santoro, Colligan and Lee \u201cparticipated\u201d in a violation of section 25400. Their participation is based on the allegations that defendants signed a public report that was alleged to be false and misleading. As members of S3\u2019s audit committee, these defendants directed the preparation of the company\u2019s financial statements and are alleged to have participated in the decision to prematurely recognize the revenue that made the financial statements false. Plaintiffs maintain that by so doing they acted jointly with each other, with other individual defendants, with Deloitte, and with S3 to violate section 25400, subdivision (d). By signing the form 10-K, at a minimum they performed a \u201cmechanical activity\u201d in an illegal act by S3, i.e., the filing of the false 10-K report with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). There is no merit to this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">We first observe that the law review article, which was cited in <em>Pinter </em>in footnote 26 <em>(Pinter v. Dahl, supra </em>486 U.S. at p. 650, fn. 26 [108 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>p. 2080]), was written prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Central Bank, supra, </em>511 U.S. 164. Thus, the article\u2019s usefulness is limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201cSection 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), provides for derivative liability of persons who \u2018control\u2019 those who are primarily liable under the Exchange Act.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] However, control persons may escape liability by proving that they acted in good faith with regard to the securities violation. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). To determine whether the good-faith affirmative defense has been satisfied under section 20(a), defendants must show that they did not act recklessly. Negligence on the part of defendants is insufficient to establish liability.\u201d <em>(Dellastatious </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(4th Cir. 2001) 242 F.3d 191, 194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Everex Systems, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 228 F.3d 1057, the court was called upon to determine whether a director of the defendant corporation was liable under section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The court found that the plaintiff merely pointed to the director\u2019s general level of control but provided no specific indication that he had supervised or had any responsibility for the preparation of the financial statements. The court noted that although the plaintiff alleged that the director had \u201creviewed and approved\u201d financial statements as a member of the board, \u201csuch activity does not rise to a level of supervision or participation sufficient for a \u00a7 20(a) violation. Although ownership of stock and a position as a Board member are relevant to ascertaining control, here, there is no showing that [the director] was active in the day-to-day affairs of [the defendant corporation] or that he exercised any specific control over the preparation and release of the financial statements.\u201d <em>(Howard v. Everex Systems, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 1067, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Similarly, in <em>Stack v. Lobo </em>(N.D.Cal. 1995) 903 F.Supp. 1361, the court found that the plaintiffs had not adequately pled a cause of action against certain directors of the corporation. As the court stated, \u201cOrdinarily, outside directors are not involved in a corporation\u2019s day-to-day affairs. Thus, the group pleading doctrine[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] may be invoked as to outside directors only if they: 1) participated in the day-to-day management of the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>company involved in the alleged fraud, . . . , or; 2) had a special relationship with the corporation. [Citations.] fl[] Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against Antle, Caufield and Harding are not adequately pled.
