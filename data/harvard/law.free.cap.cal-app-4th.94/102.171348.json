(Cal Amp) and its officers, Ira Coron and David Nichols, seeking damages under section 25500 based on allegations that appellants made false and misleading statements to inflate the price of Cal Amp stock. Appellants filed this case for breach of contract and bad faith when respondent RLI Insurance Company (RLI) denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The trial court granted RLI\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that coverage was precluded by Insurance Code section 533. Appellants contend that coverage is permitted because Corporations Code section 25500 liability may be based on negligent conduct. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Appellants obtained a primary policy of directors and officers insurance from American Alliance Insurance Company. RLI issued a policy for excess coverage. The policies insured Cal Amp\u2019s directors and officers against liability for wrongful acts performed in their capacity as directors or officers, including violation of state laws concerning the offering, registration, sale or purchase of securities. The policies did not cover losses incurred by Cal Amp for its own liability. The primary policy also included an endorsement allocating liability between covered and noncovered claims and parties when a lawsuit is filed against both the company and its directors and officers. The RLI excess policy provides that it is subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Appellants Cal Amp, Coron, and Nichols were all named as defendants in a class action for securities fraud in violation of sections 25400, subdivision (d), and 25500. The complaint alleges that appellants made false statements to the securities market exaggerating the future demand for Cal Amp\u2019s products as part of a scheme to raise the price of Cal Amp stock. The complaint alleges that plaintiff class members purchased Cal Amp stock at prices that were artificially inflated by the false statements. The class action was settled at the beginning of trial under terms which obligated Cal Amp to pay a substantial sum of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The primary insurer and another excess insurer paid a portion of the settlement, but RLI denied coverage and refused to contribute to the settlement. Appellants then filed this action against RLI alleging causes of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>for breach of its policy, bad faith in refusing to respond to Cal Amp\u2019s demand for payment, and unfair business practices arising out of the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">RLI moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the securities fraud alleged in the class action was uninsurable under Insurance Code section 533 and, alternatively, that the policy endorsement required that the entire settlement amount be allocated to Cal Amp, which was not an insured. The trial court granted the motion basing its ruling on Insurance Code section 533. It did not address the policy endorsement issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>Section 25500 Liability Requires Knowing and Intentional Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">A motion for judgment on the pleadings tests the sufficiency of the complaint. As with a demurrer, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation and accept all allegations of material fact as true. <em>(Smiley v. Citibank </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 146 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 900 P.2d 690].) The judgment must be affirmed if any basis for the motion has merit and shows that plaintiffs cannot state a cause of action. <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317]; <em>Shin v. Kong </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 498, 502 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 304].) We independently review the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Smiley, supra, </em>at p. 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Cal Amp contends that the trial court erred by finding that liability under Corporations Code sections 25400, subdivision (d) and 25500 requires an uninsurable \u201cwilful act\u201d under Insurance Code section 533. Cal Amp argues that, since Corporations Code section 25400, subdivision (d), may be violated by negligent as well as intentional conduct, application of Insurance Code section 533 cannot be determined on the basis of the pleadings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. Since a defendant must knowingly and intentionally make a false or misleading statement to be liable under Corporations Code section 25500, coverage is precluded by Insurance Code section 533 as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">1. <em>Fraudulent and Prohibited Practices Under Corporate Securities Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Sections 25400 and 25500 are part of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (\u00a7 25000 et seq.) (Act). We construe those statutes according to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>purpose and by harmonizing them with related sections of the Act to the extent possible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Simon </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 493, 514 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 886 P.2d 1271]; <em>Walnut Creek Manor </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 245, 268 [284 Cal.Rptr. 718, 814 P.2d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The Act includes three sections that create fraudulent and prohibited practices in the purchase and sale of securities. (\u00a7\u00a7 25400-25402.) Section 25400 prohibits false and misleading statements designed to manipulate the securities markets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1036, 1049 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 968 P.2d 539] <em>(Diamond Multimedia).) </em>\u201cMarket manipulation,\u201d essentially a term of art, covers fraudulent practices such as wash sales, matched orders, and rigged prices, that are intended to mislead investors by artificially creating market activity in a security. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1040, fn. 2.) Section 25401 is a broader statute that prohibits misrepresentations in connection with the purchase or sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>securities in general. Section 25402 prohibits insider trading. These three sections are penal in nature. A violation could result in imprisonment for five years and a fine of up to $10 million. (\u00a7 25540, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Each of these three fraudulent practices sections has a corresponding section which establishes a private remedy for damages. (\u00a7\u00a7 25500-25502.) The purpose of the Act in this regard is to create statutory liability that eliminates some of the elements of common law fraud, but balances this expansion of liability by placing other restrictions on recovery. <em>(Boam v. Trident Financial Corp. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 738, 743-744 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 177]; <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 711-712 [136 Cal.Rptr. 871].) Section 25500 creates the private remedy for violations of section 25400 and extends liability to all persons affected by market manipulation without requiring reliance or privity. But, section 25500 is limited to intentional misrepresentations. (See <em>Bowden, supra, </em>at pp. 714-715.) Sections 25501 and 25502 extend liability to some negligent conduct, but retain the privity requirement from common law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">2. <em>Section 25400, Subdivision (d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Section 25400, subdivision (d), makes it unlawful for any person \u201cselling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security, to make, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others, any statement which was, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading . . . and which he knew or had reasonable ground to believe was so false or misleading.\u201d Enforcement of section 25400 is limited to administrative proceedings initiated by the Department of Corporations. (\u00a7\u00a7 25530, 25532, 25535.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Appellants contend that, by prohibiting statements that a person \u201chad reasonable ground to believe\u201d were false or misleading, section 25400, subdivision (d) can be violated by negligent conduct. We agree that a \u201creasonable ground to believe\u201d a statement is false creates a negligence-based standard, but it is a standard that is not satisfied by ordinary negligence. It requires a higher level of culpability than common law negligent misrepresentation, which is satisfied if the defendant has no reason to believe a statement is true. <em>(Home Budget Loans, Inc. v. Jacoby &amp; Meyers Law Offices </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1285 [255 Cal.Rptr. 483].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The required level of culpability for a section 25400, subdivision (d) violation is the equivalent of recklessness.  Recklessness involves more than inadvertence or incompetence. It entails a \u201c \u2018conscious choice of a course of action . . . with knowledge of the serious danger to others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>involved in it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Delaney v. Baker </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 31-32 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986].) In the context of securities fraud, recklessness exists when the danger of misleading buyers or sellers is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it. <em>(Hollinger </em>v. <em>Titan Capital Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 914 F.2d 1564, 1569.)  Similarly, section 25400, subdivision (d) requires a person to make the statement despite having a belief that it may be false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Moreover, knowledge or a reasonable ground to believe a statement is false or misleading is only one necessary element of a section 25400, subdivision (d) violation. The statement also must be made \u201cfor the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of\u2019 a security by another person. (\u00a7 25400, subd. (d).) A person must have a specific intent to affect the price of a security in order to induce its purchase or sale. (See <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 173 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527].</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The requirement of a specific intent to affect the price and induce a purchase or sale raises the level of scienter required for a section 25400, subdivision (d) violation. Recklessness satisfies one element of the statute, but deliberate intent is required to satisfy another element. As a result, a violation may be based on negligent (reckless) conduct in part, but not on negligent conduct alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We have found no case law which addresses the required level of scienter for a section 25400, subdivision (d) violation when one element of the violation can be established through negligent (reckless) conduct and one element requires intent. A leading treatise, however, takes the position that intentional conduct is required for a violation. (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, Practice Under the Cal. Securities Laws (2001) \u00a7 14.05[3][b], pp. 14-52 to 14-53 (Marsh &amp; Volk).)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">According to Marsh &amp; Volk, the \u201c \u2018for the purpose\u2019 of inducing\u201d language in section 25400, subdivision (d), requires that \u201cthe defendant knew what he or she was doing and did it intentionally.\u201d (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[3][b], pp. 14-52 to 14-53.) In reaching this conclusion, Marsh &amp; Volk emphasizes that liability extends to everyone whose market trades are affected by the market manipulation. \u201cIn view of this potentially enormous and virtually unlimited liability, the intention of the defendant to affect the market by inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others was a necessary qualification of the defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[2][e], p. 14-50; see <em>Diamond Multimedia, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>p. 1056.) It is reasonable \u201cto insist that the plaintiff prove that the defendant did something wrong.\u201d (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>at p. 14-50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">3. <em>Section 25500</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Even if a negligence-based standard of recklessness were sufficient for a section 25400, subdivision (d) violation, the private cause of action for damages alleged in the underlying class action is governed by section 25500. Section 25500 imposes conditions for the recovery of damages, which are not included in section 25400, subdivision (d), and which make it clear that liability requires a knowingly false statement made with the deliberate intent to manipulate the price of a security.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Section 25500 provides that \u201c[a]ny person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of Section 25400 shall be liable to any other person who purchases or sells any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction for the damages sustained by the latter as a result of such act or transaction.\u201d The key to section 25500 is the clause limiting liability to a person who \u201cwillfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of Section 25400.\u201d There are two areas of contention that must be resolved in order to construe this clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">First, appellants and RLI dispute the meaning of the phrase \u201cany act or transaction.\u201d According to appellants, the act or transaction referred to in section 25500 may constitute lawful conduct in general, provided that it includes a violation of section 25400, subdivision (d) as one of its parts. Appellants assert that an act or transaction fits the section 25500 requirement if it \u201cgives rise\u201d to a section 25400 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We reject this interpretation, which incorrectly separates the \u201cact or transaction\u201d from the \u201cviolation of Section 25400.\u201d We conclude that the \u201cact or transaction\u201d referred to in section 25500 is the violation of section 25400 itself. To be liable under section 25500, a person must participate in market manipulation that violates section 25400. When, as here, section 25400, subdivision (d) is involved, section 25500 liability requires a person to make a false or misleading statement for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">As appellants concede, the phrase \u201cin violation of Section 25400\u201d modifies the verb \u201cparticipates,\u201d not the phrase \u201cin any act or transaction.\u201d Therefore, as a matter of grammar, the person must participate in the section 25400 violation, not just participate in an act or transaction that includes a violation. In addition, section 25500 provides that the price of the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>must be \u201caffected by <em>such </em>act or transaction\u201d in order for there to be liability. (Italics added.) Since only the false or misleading statement can affect the price of the security, \u201csuch act or transaction\u201d must be interpreted as referring to the false or misleading statement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The more difficult question in construing section 25500 concerns the meaning of its \u201cwillfully participates\u201d requirement. Only a person who \u201cwillfully participates\u201d in the act or transaction that violates section 25400, subdivision (d) can be liable for damages. Appellants argue that, since the adverb \u201cwillfully\u201d modifies the verb \u201cparticipates\u201d and not the phrase \u201cin violation of Section 25400,\u201d the statute should be read as requiring <em>willful </em>participation in a violation of section 25400, and not <em>willful </em>participation in a <em>willful </em>violation of section 25400.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We agree that the word \u201cwillfully\u201d appears only once in section 25500. But, we can discern no material difference between willfully participating in a violation of section 25400, and willfully participating in a willful violation of section 25400.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We conclude that the purpose and intent of the willful participation requirement is to clarify and underscore the high level of scienter required for a violation of section 25500. The most reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u201cwillfully participates\u201d is to limit section 25500 liability to situations where there is an intent to defraud through a knowingly false statement. Only persons who willfully, not merely recklessly, violate section 25400, subdivision (d) can be liable for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">This construction gives substantive meaning to the language of section 25500 and acknowledges that the language imposes conditions on liability. If a violation of section 25400 were all that was required for section 25500 liability, the Legislature would have said so. The Legislature would not have included language of limitation in section 25500 but, instead, would simply have provided that injured parties could recover damages caused by a violation of section 25400.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We reject appellants\u2019 contention that the \u201cwillfully participates\u201d requirement in section 25500 imposes liability on two classes of persons: people who personally violate section 25400 and people who \u201cwillfully participate\u201d in an act or transaction that gives rise to a section 25400 violation. This interpretation deprives section 25500 of substantive significance and leaves section 25400 to determine the scope of the private remedy for damages. It also fails to adequately account for the section 25500 requirement of <em>willful </em>participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>If there is section 25500 liability on the part of all persons who willfully participate in a transaction that includes a section 25400, subdivision (d) violation, liability would extend far beyond the reach of section 25400, subdivision (d). An entire class of persons would be liable under section 25500, but not under section 25400, subdivision (d). For example, under appellants\u2019 view, a person who willfully\u2014but lawfully\u2014participates in an act or transaction that includes a false or misleading statement by another person might have liability. Appellants do not acknowledge that section 25500 liability is that far-reaching, but they also fail to demonstrate how their interpretation would limit liability in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Appellants\u2019 interpretation also ignores the enforcement scheme of the Act as it applies to aiders and abettors. Some sections of the Act provide that aiders and abettors have liability. For example, section 25504 imposes liability on a person who \u201cmaterially aids\u201d an act or transaction that violates section 25501 or 25503, and section 25504.1 imposes liability on persons who \u201cmaterially assist\u201d certain other violations. But, there is no such language in section 25400 or 25500. To impose liability on persons who do not directly participate in a section 25400 violation would be contrary to the legislative decision to exclude aiders and abettors from section 25500 liability. (See <em>Reiger v. Altris Software, Inc. </em>(S.D.Cal., Apr. 30, 1999, No. 98-CV-528 TW JFS) 1999 WL 540893; <em>Hudson v. Capital Management Intern., Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal., Aug. 24, 1982, No. C-81-1737 MHP) 1982 WL 1385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In addition, section 25400 is included in the \u201cFraudulent and Prohibited Practices\u201d part of the Act, whereas section 25500, concerning damages for violation of section 25400, is in the \u201cEnforcement\u201d part. This arrangement is inconsistent with the argument that civil liability for damages may be based on conduct which does not, in itself, also violate section 25400. In fact, section 25510 provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as explicitly provided in this chapter, no civil liability in favor of any private party shall arise against any person by implication from or as a result of the violation of any provision of this law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Moreover, although limited, consideration of these issues by courts and commentators supports a restriction on section 25500 liability to persons who were aware of the falsity of their statements and engaged in willful and intentional wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">First, Marsh &amp; Volk states that section 25500 requires that \u201cthe defendant intentionally engage in conduct prohibited by the provisions of [section 25400]. A person who made a statement which he or she did not know was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>false or misleading could not be held liable under these sections.\u201d (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[3][a], p. 14-52.) While section 25400, subdivision (d) \u201crequires only that the defendant know or have reasonable ground to believe that the statement is false or misleading, this prohibition in itself is not a sufficient basis to establish civil liability without also complying with the requirements of [Corporations Code section 25500.] A negligent misstatement might be the basis for an injunctive action by the Commissioner under [Corporations Code section 25530,] but it would not be possible to establish that a person \u2018willfully\u2019 participated in a violation of [Corporations Code section 25400] merely by establishing that he had made a negligent misstatement.\u201d (1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>at p. 14-52, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Second, the California Supreme Court has also given some indication that it has adopted the <em>position taken by </em>Marsh &amp; Volk. <em>(Diamond Multimedia, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 1048, 1056, 1058.) <em>Diamond Multimedia </em>describes the private action for damages under sections 25400 and 25500 as requiring a <em>knowingly </em>false or misleading statement. The court states that section 25400, subdivision (d), \u201cmakes it unlawful in California to knowingly make false or misleading statements for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of stock\u201d either in California or elsewhere. <em>(Diamond Multimedia, supra, </em>at p. 1048.) The court also states that civil liability attaches only if a person omits a material fact for the purpose of inducing the sale or purchase of the stock with \u201cknowledge\u201d that the omission was false or misleading. (Id., at p. 1048, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In particular, the <em>Diamond Multimedia </em>court discussed a recent amendment to the federal securities law, which provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from liability for statements that predict future events. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5.) The court noted that, since the safe harbor provision did not immunize forward-looking statements when there is actual knowledge of falsity, liability under section 25500 does not conflict with federal law. <em>(Diamond Multimedia, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1058.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Since the issue decided in <em>Diamond Multimedia </em>concerned whether an out-of-state purchaser or seller could bring an action in California under section 25500, the court was not required to decide whether section 25500 liability could be based on less than knowing and intentional wrongdoing.  Nevertheless, legal pronouncements by the Supreme Court are highly probative and, generally speaking, should be followed even if dictum. <em>Hubbard v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 66 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1169 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 819].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Third, Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500 are patterned after and virtually identical to section 9, subdivisions (a) and (e), of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i (SEA)).  California courts may look to federal statutes for guidance in interpreting a closely analogous state statute. (See <em>Keating v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 584, 598 [183 Cal.Rptr. 360, 645 P.2d 1192], overruled on other grounds in <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 1 [104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Section 9, subdivision (a)(4) of the SEA makes it unlawful for \u201ca dealer or broker, or the person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security ... to make, ... for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security . . . any statement which was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact, and which he knew or had reasonable ground to believe was so false or misleading.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 781(a)(4).) Section 9, subdivision (e) of the SEA provides that \u201c[a]ny person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction . . . .\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As with Corporations Code section 25500, there has been little judicial interpretation of section 9, subdivision (e) of the SEA. However, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated, in dictum, that there is no liability for false or misleading statements which are made recklessly. Liability extends only to a statement made willfully and with knowledge or belief that it is false or misleading. (See <em>Chemetron Corp. v. Business Funds, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1982) 682 F.2d 1149, 1162, vacated on other grounds in 460 U.S. 1007 [103 S.Ct. 1245, 75 L.Ed.2d 476].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In <em>Chemetron, </em>the court was concerned with whether the broader Securities and Exchange Commission rule 10b-5 (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.1Ob-5) remedy was available for activities covered by the more restrictive remedy set forth in section 9, subdivision (e) of the SEA. Citing legislative history, the court stated that, while recklessness was sufficient scienter for a rule 10b-5 action, recklessness is insufficient for a private cause of action under section 9, subdivision (e). <em>(Chemetron Corp. </em>v. <em>Business Funds, Inc., supra, </em>682 F.2d at p. 1162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The court noted that section 9, subdivision (a)(4) of the SEA covers statements made where the person \u201c \u2018knew or had reasonable ground to believe\u2019 \u201d they were false or misleading, and that section 9, subdivision (e) of the SEA applies to any person who \u201cwillfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsection (a).\u201d <em>(Chemetron Corp. </em>v. <em>Business Funds, Inc., supra, </em>682 F.2d at pp. 1161-1162, fn. 18.) The court stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the interplay between these statutes provides at most two standards for actionable behavior. \u201cThe first, a statement or omission <em>known </em>to be false or misleading and <em>willfully </em>made, clearly constitutes scienter. The second, a statement or omission <em>believed </em>to be false or misleading at the time and under the circumstances made, yet <em>willfully </em>made, also constitutes scienter.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>In re Activision Securities Litigation </em>(N.D.Cal. 1985) 621 F.Supp. 415, 426-427 [Corp. Code, \u00a7 25500 creates civil liability for <em>willful </em>violations of \u00a7 25400].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\n<em>Insurance Code Section 533 Precludes Coverage of Corporations Code Section 25500 Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Appellants contend that, even if liability under Corporations Code section 25500 is limited to a willful violation of Corporations Code section 25400, insurance coverage is permitted by Insurance Code section 533. We do not quarrel with appellants\u2019 assertion that the concept of willfulness cannot be captured in a single formula and that, in certain situations, willful conduct may not qualify as a \u201cwilful act\u201d within the meaning of Insurance Code section 533. (See <em>Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 182-183 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 371].) However, we reject appellants\u2019 contention that this case involves such a situation. Here, the willful conduct required for Corporations Code section 25500 liability must also be knowing and deliberate and, therefore, necessarily constitute a \u201cwilful act\u201d under Insurance Code section 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Insurance Code section 533 embodies a public policy to discourage willful wrongdoing. <em>(J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M. K. </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1009, 1020 [278 Cal.Rptr. 64, 804 P.2d 689].) Liability arising from intentional and inherently or predictably harmful conduct cannot be covered by liability insurance. <em>(Downey Venture </em>v. <em>LMI Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 478, 500-502 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 142].) But, there may be coverage for negligence, gross negligence and recklessness. <em>(J.C. Penney, supra, </em>at p. 1020; <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 740-741 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] <em>(Shell).) </em>Therefore, there may be coverage for an accident caused by drunk driving because drunk driving is considered reckless behavior. <em>(Interinsurance Exchange v. Flores </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 661, 672 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 18].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Insurance Code section 533 cases recognize that the line between reckless conduct and intentional and predictably harmful conduct is difficult to draw. <em>(Shell, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 742; <em>Mez Industries, Inc. v. Pacific Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 856, 875-876 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 721].) Nevertheless, a \u201cwilful act\u201d under Insurance Code section 533 has been defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201can act deliberately done for the express purpose of causing damage or intentionally performed with knowledge that damage is highly probable or substantially certain to result.\u201d <em>(Shell, supra, </em>at p. 742; <em>Mez Industries, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 875-876.) A \u201cwilful act\u201d includes a \u201cdeliberate, liability-producing act that the individual, before acting, expected to cause harm. . . . Therefore, section 533 precludes indemnification for liability arising from deliberate conduct that the insured expected or intended to cause damage.\u201d <em>(Shell, supra, </em>at p. 743.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">As we have concluded, section 25500 liability requires more than recklessness. The false or misleading statement may be made recklessly rather than with actual knowledge of its falsity. However, the conduct involved as a whole constitutes intentional and deliberate wrongdoing because the purpose of the false statement must be specifically intended with full knowledge of the likelihood of damage. There must be a knowing and purposeful act that is intended to cause damage by artificially altering the price of a security in order to induce a sale or purchase. Damage from the manipulation of the security is expected and \u201chighly probable or substantially certain to result.\u201d <em>(Shell, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 742; <em>Mez Industries, Inc. v. Pacific Nat. Ins. Co., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at pp. 875-876.) In fact, since the act is the manipulation of the stock price, it can be said that the \u201charm is inherent in the act itself.\u201d <em>(J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>M.K., supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We have found no case law, and the parties cite none, that applies Insurance Code section 533 to Corporations Code section 25500 or 25400. However, the case of <em>Raychem Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1994) 853 F.Supp. 1170, offers some insight. In <em>Raychem, </em>the federal district court addressed the question of whether Insurance Code section 533 prohibited coverage for damages under Securities and Exchange Commission rule 10b-5. The court concluded that, because recklessness was sufficient scienter for rule 10b-5 liability, Insurance Code section 533 did not preclude coverage. <em>(Raychem Corp., </em>at p. 1180.) However, the court also stated that Insurance Code section 533 might preclude coverage if it could be established that the defendants made knowing misrepresentations. <em>(Raychem Corp., </em>at p. 1180) Thus, <em>Raychem </em>provides inferential support for the conclusion that Insurance Code section 533 would preclude coverage of Corporations Code section 25500 liability which is necessarily based on a knowingly false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\n<em>Judicial Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">RLI contends that appellants are judicially estopped from even making the argument that section 25500 liability may be based on negligence. Judicial estoppel prevents a party from taking a position inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>with a position previously asserted in the same or prior proceeding. <em>(International Engine Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Feddersen &amp; Co. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 345, 350 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 178].) In a summary judgment motion in the underlying class action, appellants argued that liability under section 25500 requires a knowingly false statement. That argument is contrary to appellants\u2019 opposition to RLI\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The trial court refused to apply judicial estoppel because appellants\u2019 inconsistent positions involved a legal rather than a factual issue, and their position in the class action was unsuccessful. The record supports the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Judicial estoppel may be applied in the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>(International Engine Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Feddersen &amp; Co., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 350.) It is intended to protect the integrity of the judicial process by preventing litigants from playing \u201cfast and loose\u201d with the courts <em>(ibid.) </em>and, as such, it should be invoked only in egregious cases. <em>(Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1018 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 544]; <em>International Engine Parts, supra, </em>at p. 354.) For these reasons, judicial estoppel is usually limited to cases where a party misrepresents or conceals material facts. <em>(Cloud, supra, </em>at p. 1019.) Appellants\u2019 changing legal arguments, which resulted from their different positions in the two lawsuits, is a reasonable litigation tactic and does not undermine the integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\n<em>Allocation Endorsement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">RLI also contends that a policy endorsement allocating settlement costs provides an alternate basis for granting judgment on the pleadings. Directors and officers liability insurance provides coverage for wrongful acts committed by directors and officers, but no coverage for liability incurred by the company for its independent wrongdoing. Therefore, when both directors and officers and the company are named in the same lawsuit, it may be necessary to allocate settlement costs between covered and noncovered parties and claims. (See, e.g., <em>Nordstrom, Inc. v. Chubb &amp; Son, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 54 F.3d 1424, 1431-1436.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Here, an endorsement to the primary policy purports to allocate the entire loss incurred in settling a securities claim to the company rather than to its directors and officers. Since the company itself is not insured, such an allocation would relieve RLI of any indemnity obligation. Appellants contend that the endorsement raises factual questions which cannot be resolved by judgment on the pleadings. RLI argues that the endorsement ends the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Since we have determined that the motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly granted for another reason, it is unnecessary to consider the allocation endorsement issue. (See <em>City of Alhambra v. P.J.B. Disposal Co. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 136, 141, fn. 6 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 364].) Also, we exercise judicial restraint and do not reach theories not relied upon by the trial court in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>(Garver v. Brace </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 995, 998, 1003 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 220].) Although briefed by the parties, the endorsement issue was not fully developed in the trial court and was not mentioned in oral argument or the trial court\u2019s written ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The judgment is affirmed. Costs to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Gilbert, P. J., and Coffee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 2, 2002, and appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 13, 2002. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\">All statutory references are to the Corporations Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Insurance Code section 533 provides that \u201c[a]n insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the wilful act of the insured; but he is not exonerated by the negligence of the insured, or of the insured\u2019s agents or others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Section 25400 makes it unlawful for any person:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201c(a) For the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any security or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for any security, (1) to effect any transaction in a security which involves no change in the beneficial ownership thereof, or (2) to enter an order or orders for the purchase of any security with the knowledge that an order or orders of substantially the same size, at substantially the same time and at substantially the same price, for the sale of any such security, has been or will be entered by or for the same or different parties, or (3) to enter an order or orders for the sale of any security with the knowledge that an order or orders of substantially the same size, at substantially the same time and at substantially the same price, for the purchase of any such security, has been or will be entered by or for the same or different parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u201c(b) To effect, alone or with one or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u201c(c) If such person is a broker-dealer or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security, to induce the purchase or sale of any security by the circulation or dissemination of information to the effect that the price of any such security will or is likely to rise or fall because of market operations of any one or more persons conducted for the purpose of raising or depressing the price of such security.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u201c(d) If such person is a broker-dealer or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security, to make, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others, any statement which was, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and which he knew or had reasonable ground to believe was so false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\u201c(e) For a consideration, received directly or indirectly from a broker-dealer or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security, to induce the purchase or sale of any security by the circulation or dissemination of information to the effect that the price of such security will or is likely to rise or fall because of the market operations of any one or more persons conducted for the purpose of raising or depressing the price of such security.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
