Consistent with the principle that child support must be measured by the standard of living attainable by the parent\u2019s income, we conclude the trial court must be presented with sufficient information on which to properly assess the child\u2019s needs. Such information includes the amount of the supporting parent\u2019s actual income where that amount is disputed. The action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>is remanded to enable the court to obtain reliable information as to the supporting parent\u2019s income, and to make a guideline child support calculation based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Both parties also contend the trial court erred in setting child support at $19,000 per month. The mother contends the amount is too low in light of the father\u2019s extraordinarily high income, while the father insists it is too high and exceeds the child\u2019s needs. In light of flaws in the trial court\u2019s methodology for calculating child support, we conclude this portion of the appeal is not yet ripe for review and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Finally, we conclude the trial court erred in suspending the father\u2019s obligation to pay child support during the period in which his 18-year-old child was participating in a high school foreign exchange program in Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">After a marriage of about four years, William F. and Ursula A. Hubner separated in October 1979. Their son, Ryan, with whom William has never had any contact, was born March 25, 1980. From Ryan\u2019s birth until early 1987, William paid $600 per month in child support. In 1990, in response to Ursula\u2019s petition for increased child support, William was ordered to pay child support of $6,000 per month, retroactive to March 1987. That order was based on the trial court\u2019s finding that, among other things, Ursula had sole legal and physical custody of Ryan, and William\u2019s stipulation that he had a net disposable income of at least $1 million per year and the ability to pay any reasonable child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In October 1997, Ursula filed an order to show cause (OSC) requesting modification of the existing order to increase Ryan\u2019s child support to the guideline level. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4055.) Ryan was approximately <em>YlVi </em>years old when the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">In a declaration in support of her petition for modification, Ursula stated that a number of events had occurred since the 1990 support order was made, any one of which constituted a changed circumstance warranting an increase in child support. Ursula first noted that the manner and presumptions regarding the calculation of child support under the statewide uniform guidelines had changed since the previous support order. She argued that in contrast to the family court procedures followed in 1990, the statutory changes placed a burden on William to prove he was an extraordinarily high earner, and that the child support presumptively awarded under a guideline calculation would exceed Ryan\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In support of her request for an increased child support order, Ursula also noted Ryan\u2019s desire to participate in an American Field Service (AFS) academic foreign exchange program in Japan during the 1998-1999 school year. Ursula anticipated the expenses for Ryan\u2019s participation in the AFS program would exceed $25,000. In addition, Ursula noted Ryan needed funds for a car, car insurance, gasoline and repairs, a personal computer and software, participation in sports and social activities, and medical and mental health care. Ursula also said that after graduation Ryan anticipated attending a private college at an expense of approximately $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Ursula conceded she should not have waited until Ryan was almost 18 years old to seek a modification of the child support order. She said, she had known for some time the award was inadequate, but, anticipating William\u2019s argument, had been unable to \u201csummon the psychological stamina necessary to face another battle with Bill.\u201d Ursula declared that she suffered from \u201cdebilitating migraine headaches and severe depression.\u201d She also declared she had only a high school education and that because of her limited education and training and the fact that she had devoted herself to raising Ryan, she was unable to earn more than a minimal, sporadic income.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The income and expense declaration which accompanied the petition listed Ursula\u2019s monthly expenses at $13,344, her gross annual earnings for 1996 at $6,000, and her net monthly disposable income at $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In November 1997, Ursula noticed William\u2019s deposition and served him with a request to produce detailed financial documentation. William moved for a protective order to quash the subpoena issued for his deposition and document production. He argued that discovery of his personal financial information was an impermissible invasion of his right of privacy, and was irrelevant to the matters at issue. In support of his motion, William submitted an \u201cadmission,\u201d signed only by his counsel, stating \u201chis annual earned income ... is at least $1,750,000.00, pre-tax ... he lives a lifestyle commensurate with a person earning $1,750,000.00 per year, pre-tax . . . [and,] he has the ability to pay any reasonable and lawful child support. . . order made by the Court.\u201d William argued his admission established his status as an \u201cextraordinarily high income earner\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4057, subd. (b)(3)), and relieved him from the obligation to comply with Ursula\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Ursula moved to compel William\u2019s deposition and document production. She also made an alternative request that, in the event the court declined to order William to appear for deposition or to produce the requested financial information, the court find William\u2019s annual net income available to pay child support was at least $5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The motion for a protective order and the motion to compel were heard together on December 10, 1997. The court granted William\u2019s request for a protective order and denied Ursula\u2019s motion to compel. However, William was ordered to bring to the OSC hearing for court review the following week, a completed income and expense declaration, his recent tax returns, and any other income-related information required by the local rules or the California Rules of Court. William was also ordered to provide copies of his tax returns to Ursula\u2019s counsel and her forensic accountants in advance of the OSC hearing, subject to a confidentiality order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">William subsequently filed a response to Ursula\u2019s petition to modify child support in which he objected to any increased child support for Ryan, and objected to any requirement to pay child support during Ryan\u2019s participation in the AFS program.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Ursula then sought reconsideration of the ruling granting William\u2019s request for a protective order. She argued that William\u2019s opposition to any increase in his child support obligation evidenced a wrongful attempt on his part to obtain the discovery protection available to an extraordinarily high earner who had agreed to pay any support award based on an assumed income. The court partially granted Ursula\u2019s motion and ordered William to submit to a limited deposition regarding the \u201cgeneral attributes of [his] lifestyle.\u201d The court also reaffirmed the earlier order requiring William to provide copies of various financial documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The hearing on Ursula\u2019s modification petition was convened on February 5, 1998. At the outset, William\u2019s counsel revealed that contrary to court order, William had not provided any financial information to Ursula or to the court. William\u2019s counsel reported William had \u201cdecline[d] to produce [his] tax returns,\u201d and informed the court it should simply \u201cproceed from there.\u201d Ursula\u2019s counsel argued a guideline child support calculation could not be made in the absence of information about William\u2019s actual gross income. Concluding it might not \u201cbe productive\u201d to enforce its earlier order, the court stated its intention to proceed without the financial information. It noted it was \u201cnot inconceivable\u201d that, based on an assessment of Ryan\u2019s needs, it would order an amount that fell below the guideline even at William\u2019s admitted income. However, the court stated it intended to assume the \u201cworst possible tax situation\u201d for William, i.e., by basing its calculation on an after-tax $1.75 million annual income, which is an annual income of roughly $3.5 million in pretax dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, William was ordered to pay child support of $19,000 per month from November 1997 through March 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>when Ryan turned 18 years, of age. However, William\u2019s child support payments were ordered suspended during Ryan\u2019s participation in the AFS program in Japan. However, the support was ordered reinstated in February and March 1999, following Ryan\u2019s return from Japan and re-enrollment in high school, until his 19th birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">At a subsequent hearing, the court set forth the findings that formed the bases of the support order. (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4056, subds. (a), (b), 4005.) It found William was an extraordinarily high earner within the meaning of Family Code section 4057, subdivision (b)(3), with an annual income of at least $1.75 million. It also stated it had \u201cindulged in all the worst findings [it] could make with respect to tax consequences\u201d to William. Indulging in \u201cslightly higher\u201d findings than William\u2019s admitted income, the court found William had a monthly after-tax income of approximately $150,000 ($288,000 per month pretax), but failed to state the precise guideline amount of child support the income figure would yield. Without identifying specific past or projected future expenditures, the court found that monthly child support of $19,000 would enable Ryan to share in William\u2019s standard of living, but \u201canything over $19,000 would be excessive and not consistent with [Ryan\u2019s] reasonable needs.\u201d The court emphasized that although its conclusion as to the appropriate amount of support was not based solely on Ryan\u2019s actual historical expenses or the mere necessities of life, it was \u201cnot, in essence, creating a college fund.\u201d Support payments were ordered suspended while Ryan was in the AFS program in Japan because during that period he would not be \u201ca full-time student working towards a [high school] diploma.\u201d Ursula requested reconsideration of the order based on evidence she received after the OSC hearing that showed Ryan would receive credit on his home high school transcript for courses taken at his host high school in Japan. Ursula\u2019s request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">An order modifying child support was entered in April 1998. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Ursula argues the trial court erred in basing the child support order on William\u2019s \u201cadmitted\u201d income, when the appropriate amount of child support remained in dispute. Ursula also contends the $19,000 monthly child support awarded was deficient and was based on an erroneous interpretation of Ryan\u2019s \u201creasonable needs.\u201d Finally, she argues the suspension of child support payments while Ryan participated in the AFS program in Japan was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In his appeal, William insists the monthly support order was excessive by a factor of $9,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>1. <em>The guideline child support calculation must be tethered to the supporting parent\u2019s actual income.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Family Code section 4055<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sets forth a statewide uniform guideline for determining the appropriate amount of child support. The term \u201cguideline,\u201d however, is a euphemism. The support amount rendered under the guideline\u2019s algebraic formula \u201cis intended to be presumptively correct in all cases, and only under special circumstances should child support orders fall below the child support mandated by the guideline formula.\u201d (\u00a7 4053, subd. (k); see also \u00a7\u00a7 4050, 4057, subd. (a).) One special circumstance involves cases where evidence shows that the application of the formula is unjust or inappropriate under the circumstances because \u201c[t]he parent being ordered to pay child support has an extraordinarily high income and the amount determined under the formula would exceed the needs of the children.\u201d (\u00a7 4057, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Even under such circumstances, however, \u201c[t]o comply with federal law, the court shall state . . . whenever [it] is ordering an amount for support that differs from the statewide uniform guideline formula . . . [f] (1) The amount of support that would have been ordered under the guideline formula[;] [ft| (2) The reasons the amount of support ordered differs from the guideline formula amountf; and] [f] (3) The reasons the amount of support ordered is consistent with the best interests of the children.\u201d (\u00a7 4056, subd. (a).) The statutory findings are mandatory. The failure to make them precludes effective appellate review and may constitute reversible error if the missing information is not otherwise discernible from the record. (See <em>In re Marriage of Hall </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 313, 320-321 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 772]; <em>Rojas v. Mitchell </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1445, 1450-1451 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The supporting parent who seeks to rebut the statutory formula and gain protection from disclosure of detailed financial information as an \u201cextraordinarily high earner\u201d must show: (1) he or she has an extraordinarily high income, and (2) the guideline support amount exceeds the child\u2019s needs. When the extraordinarily high earning supporting parent seeks a downward departure from a presumptively correct guideline amount, it is that parent\u2019s \u201cburden to establish application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate,\u201d and the lower award would be consistent with the child\u2019s best interests. <em>(County of Stanislaus </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1417, 1424 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 819]; \u00a7\u00a7 4053, subd. (k), 4057, subd. (b)(3), and 4056, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">William\u2019s status as an extraordinarily high earner is conceded.  Thus, the issue we address is whether William, as an extraordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>high earner who admits an ability to pay any amount of child support, may refuse to reveal his actual income where the appropriate amount of child support remains disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">An award of child support rests in the court\u2019s sound discretion and cannot be overturned absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. \u201cAn appellate court does not substitute its own judgment; rather it interferes only if no judge could reasonably have made the order under the circumstances.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Catalano </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 543, 553 [251 Cal.Rptr. 370].) However, before a court may exercise its discretion to determine that a deviation from the guideline is warranted under the circumstances, it must first calculate the amount of support required by strict adherence to the guideline. In other words, only after the guideline formula is computed on a legitimate evidentiary basis as to the supporting parent\u2019s income may a court conclude that the guideline amount exceeds the child\u2019s reasonable needs. <em>(In re Marriage ofWhealon </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 132, 144-145 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 559]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 68, 75-76 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 624].) The Family Code similarly supports such a conclusion. Under section 4056, if the amount of support ordered differs from the statutory formula, the court \u201cshall state, in writing or on the record,\u201d the \u201camount of support that would have been ordered under the guideline formula.\u201d (\u00a7 4056, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Accordingly, we agree with Ursula\u2019s contention that, absent a stipulation between the parties as to the appropriate amount of support, she and the court are entitled to know William\u2019s actual income, regardless of his admission he can pay any reasonable child support ordered. Concluding to the contrary, the court relied heavily on <em>Estevez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 423 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 470] <em>(Estevez), </em>decided not long after the enactment of the mandatory child support guideline formula. That reliance was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>Estevez, </em>the noncustodial supporting parent (Estevez) resisted disclosing specific information about his lifestyle and financial status. Instead, he unilaterally stipulated his gross income was \u201cnot less than\u201d $1.4 million per year. <em>(Estevez, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at pp. 427, 430.) Estevez also stipulated he could pay any reasonable child support award, and told the court he would willingly \u201caccede to any order [it might] make, even one in excess of the amount called for by the guideline formula, so long as the award addresse[d] the reasonable needs of the children commensurate with his status as an extraordinarily high earner.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 430-431.) In that case, the custodial parent (Salley) conceded Estevez had an extraordinarily high income, and she was \u201cnot dissatisfied\u201d with the amount of the total support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cpackage,\u201d which exceeded $14,000 per month for two children. Rather, Salley took issue with the manner in which the child support was disbursed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426.) Under the circumstances, the reviewing court held detailed financial discovery was irrelevant to a determination of a child support amount paid by an extraordinarily high earner who stipulated he could and would pay any reasonable amount of child support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431.) <em>Estevez </em>finessed the issue of the statutorily required findings by concluding if the extraordinarily high earning parent challenged the amount of child support as unreasonable he would be required to disclose the necessary financial data required to enable the court to apply the guideline formula. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431, fn. 8.) Alternatively, the Court of Appeal concluded the judicial findings required by section 4056 could be satisfied if the trial court simply made the \u201cleast beneficial assumptions\u201d as to the high earner\u2019s net disposable income, federal tax-filing status, and deductions from gross income. (Estevez, at p. 431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Estevez </em>did not resolve the conflict presented here between the custodial parent\u2019s right to discovery and the noncustodial supporting parent\u2019s right to privacy, where a discrepancy exists between the supporting parent\u2019s proposed stipulated income and the other parent\u2019s contention that the proposed stipulated income was too low. That issue was recently addressed in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th 68 <em>(Johnson), </em>which governs the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In <em>Johnson, </em>decided shortly after entry of the order issued here, a professional athlete (Johnson) conceded an annual income in excess of $1 million. The custodial parent (Tate) claimed Johnson\u2019s annual income was actually $12 million, and propounded discovery to elicit evidence regarding his income, assets and lifestyle. <em>(Johnson, supra, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 70.) Johnson resisted the discovery arguing that, under <em>Estevez, </em>he was not required to reveal information about his income and lifestyle. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Relying on <em>Estevez, </em>discovery into Johnson\u2019s income was precluded, but Tate was permitted to conduct detailed discovery as to the attributes of his lifestyle. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Johnson sought a writ of mandate challenging the denial of his request for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>While the Court of Appeal in <em>Johnson </em>professed agreement with <em>Estevez, </em>it took issue with the conclusion in <em>Estevez </em>that financial information was irrelevant to the needs of a child of an extraordinarily high earning supporting parent. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 74.) However, the court agreed with Johnson that detailed discovery into his lifestyle was unwarranted and found that a child\u2019s support needs must be measured by the standard of living attainable by the supporting parent\u2019s income, regardless of his lifestyle or actual expenditures. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 75-76.) Since <em>Johnson, </em>the rule in Estevez\u2014that an extraordinarily high earner\u2019s financial information need not be disclosed where he stipulated he can and will pay any reasonable amount of child support\u2014has been limited to cases in which the parties agree on the appropriate amount of child support. (See, e.g., <em>McGinley </em>v. <em>Herman </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 936, 944 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 921] [\u201c[I]t is significant that <em>Estevez </em>did not involve a dispute over the amount of child support . . . .\u201d].) And, given <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>preclusion of discovery regarding the supporting parent\u2019s \u201clifestyle,\u201d income clearly is the primary factor in a child support determination in the case of an extraordinarily high earner.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">As in <em>Johnson, </em>we address the tension between the extraordinarily high earner\u2019s desire for protection from discovery and the necessity that a trial court be presented with sufficient information to properly assess the child\u2019s needs. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 74.) We agree with the rule expressed in <em>Johnson </em>that, where the parties dispute the amount of the high earner\u2019s income and cannot agree on the appropriate amount of child support, the court must make the least beneficial income assumptions against the supporting parent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 74-75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The court did make such assumptions here. However, it erred when it based assumptions on a fictional annual pretax income of $3.5 million for William for the purposes of the guideline calculation, a figure neither suggested nor substantiated by either party. \u201cThe key financial factor in the guideline formula is net disposable income.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 75; \u00a7\u00a7 4055, subd. (b), 4059.) The application of the least beneficial assumptions as to net disposable income \u201ccannot be made in a vacuum but must be based on reason.\u201d <em>(Johnson, </em>at p. 75.) In other words, in a case such as this, such assumptions can be made only after the court obtains a legitimate factual basis as to the amount of the high earner\u2019s actual annual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Ursula claims William\u2019s net annual income exceeds $5 million. William, on the other hand, \u201cadmits\u201d an annual income of $1.75 million. The one point of agreement is that William has prevented Ursula from acquiring any information about his actual financial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>We agree with <em>Johnson </em>that the determination of the appropriate amount of child support could be affected by the significant discrepancy between two equally unsubstantiated figures. Given the flawed premise on which the modification order was based, a reversal is required. Both parties insist the court abused its discretion in awarding monthly child support of $19,000. Because the amount of child support ordered was based on fictional gross income assumptions, we are unable to assess whether either party is correct. Thus, remand is necessary to permit the court to conduct further proceedings and permit appropriate discovery directed at obtaining reliable information to enable the court to \u201cmake assumptions with respect to [William\u2019s] income and lifestyle [at the time of the OSC] that are least favorable to him,\u201d and to protect William\u2019s legitimate privacy concerns regarding his finances. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at pp. 75-76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">2. <em>The issue as to whether the appropriate amount of child support was awarded is not yet ripe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">As stated above, both parties argue the award of monthly child support of $19,000 was an abuse of discretion. Ursula contends the amount of the award is deficient, while William insists it is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">California law regarding child support is clear: \u201c \u2018[A] child ... is entitled to be supported in a style and condition consonant with the position in society of its parents.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The father\u2019s duty of support for his children does not end with the furnishing of mere necessities if he is able to afford more.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McGinley v. Herman, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 941.) \u201c \u2018Clearly where the child has a wealthy parent, that child is entitled to, and therefore \u2018needs\u2019 something more than the bare necessities of life.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 72.) After <em>Johnson, </em>a parent\u2019s \u201cability\u201d to support a child may depend upon whether the supporting parent is merely rich or is very rich, and \u201cthis discrepancy can affect the [trial court\u2019s determination as to the] child\u2019s needs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 74.) Because the court failed to make a guideline calculation based on William\u2019s actual income, we are unable to assess the merits of any argument as to whether the child support determination was an abuse of discretion. This portion of the appeal is dismissed because it is not yet ripe for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">However, even if a factual basis existed for William\u2019s assumed $3.5 million annual income, we would be unable to adequately assess, based on the record, whether the monthly $19,000 child support award is appropriate. The court failed to make findings mandated by section 4056. On remand, in the event the court determines a guideline departure is warranted, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>directed to comply with the requirements of section 4056 by specifying (1) the child support amount calculated under the guideline formula, (2) the reasons for awarding an amount of support that deviates from the formula, and (3) the reasons the award is consistent with Ryan\u2019s best interests. (\u00a7 4056, subd. (a).) Such findings not only will enable the parties to appreciate the basis for the child support order, they will facilitate judicial review in any future appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">3. <em>The suspension of child support while Ryan attended school in Japan was erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Ursula\u2019s final contention is that the court erroneously suspended William\u2019s child support obligation following Ryan\u2019s 18th birthday during his participation in the APS program in Japan. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Section 3901 provides that a parent\u2019s \u201cduty [to support a child] continues as to an unmarried child who has attained the age of 18 years, is a full-time high school student, and who is not self-supporting, until the time the child completes the 12th grade or attains the age of 19 years, whichever occurs first.\u201d (\u00a7 3901, subd. (a).) Child support payments were ordered suspended during Ryan\u2019s participation in the APS program, and then reinstated payments upon his re-enrollment in his local high school until his 19th birthday. The order was based on a determination that the APS program was \u201cnot within the purview of Family Code section 3901\u201d because, during Ryan\u2019s participation in the program, he would not be \u201cworking towards a [high school] diploma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">In reaching its conclusion, the court apparently superimposed one of two improper requirements on the statute. Either Ryan was required to demonstrate he was making a good faith effort to complete high school as soon as possible in order to be eligible for continued child support, or to take courses necessary to graduate while in the APS program in order to qualify as a full-time student. Neither requirement, however, is a prerequisite to Ryan\u2019s continued eligibility for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The uncontradicted evidence demonstrates Ryan was expected to attend classes six days a week at his host high school in Japan. Upon application, Ryan was eligible to receive credit at his local high school, Mater Dei, for many of the courses completed in Japan. The language of the statute clearly states that the parent\u2019s duty of support continues so long as a child over age 18 remains a \u201cfull-time high school student.\u201d (\u00a7 3901, subd. (a).) Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>section 3901, only full-time school attendance is necessary to trigger a parent\u2019s obligation to continue to support a child who has reached the age of majority. William asserts that Ryan\u2019s desire to participate in the APS program was intended to \u201chinder[] his timely graduation,\u201d forcing him to continue to provide for his son\u2019s support beyond the date on which William reasonably could have expected that obligation to cease. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The statute does not require a supported child to demonstrate a good faith effort to graduate from high school as soon as possible, nor does it condition a parent\u2019s duty of support on the child\u2019s participation only in those classes that propel her or him toward graduation at the earliest possible date. Indeed, the legislative history illustrates that, to the extent the Legislature was concerned a child might abuse the child support scheme by extending his or her high school education in order to continue receiving support, the risk of such abuse was eliminated by imposing an absolute support cutoff at age 19, regardless of the child\u2019s educational status.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Ryan\u2019s exemplary academic progress and excellent standing at his local high school afforded him an opportunity to participate in the prestigious and demanding APS high school Japan exchange program, a privilege Ursula claims was afforded only 18 students in the entire United States. The evidence proffered by Ursula included a declaration from the Mater Dei assistant principal, stating the courses Ryan took at his host high school in Japan would benefit him in the college application process, would become part of his school transcript, and would count toward his graduation from high school. On this record, we cannot agree with William\u2019s implicit assertion Ryan created or pursued this unique academic enrichment opportunity solely for the purpose of receiving additional months of child support. Based on the evidence and clear language of section 3901, we conclude the court erred in suspending William\u2019s support obligations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The order is reversed with regard to modification of the amount of child support, and the cause remanded to permit the trial court to conduct further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>proceedings, as necessary, in order to make the requisite findings. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 4056.) The order is also reversed with regard to the duration of the child support award. The portion of Ursula\u2019s appeal directed to the propriety of the amount of child support ordered is dismissed, as the issue is not yet ripe for adjudication. William\u2019s appeal, which also takes issue with the amount of child support awarded, is likewise not ripe for decision and is dismissed. Appellant Ursula is to recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Johnson, Acting P.
