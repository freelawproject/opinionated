Boilman\u2019s suit included claims for sexual harassment and defamation, among other causes of action. The insurance policy covered Rocky Cola\u2019s liability for personal injury caused by an offense, including defamation, arising out of Rocky Cola\u2019s business, but specifically excluded coverage for personal injury arising out of any employment-related defamation. We conclude that the defamation alleged in Boilman\u2019s complaint was not \u201cemployment-related\u201d within the meaning of the exclusion, and that Golden Eagle therefore had a duty to defend its insureds in the B oilman lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\n<em>The underlying lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Krista Bollman sued Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9, Wally Curry, a partner in the business, and shift managers Christopher Vitolo and Angela Henderson. Her complaint asserted causes of action for sexual harassment, retaliation for reporting sexual harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, wrongful termination, and negligent hiring and supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The complaint alleged that a sexual relationship developed between Boll-man and her supervisor, defendant Christopher Vitolo. A month or so later, Bollman told Vitolo she no longer wished to have sexual relations with him. Vitolo then began to make insulting comments and engage in unwelcome touching of Bollman\u2019s body. The complaint alleges that, by abuse of his supervisorial position and by \u201con-the-jobsite verbal and physical abuse,\u201d Vitolo coerced Bollman into engaging in sporadic sexual activity with him, including sex on the jobsite. Bollman eventually resigned. The complaint included allegations that, after Bollman informed Vitolo she would no longer have sex with him, he followed her to a gym and in the presence of others humiliated her with coarse and abusive remarks about her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Bollman\u2019s cause of action for defamation included allegations that Vitolo communicated to numerous other persons \u201cwords to the effect that [Boll-man] was a \u2018sexually promiscuous and calculating bitch\u2019 who had, by use of sexually aggressive tactics, maneuvered him into an unwanted sexual relationship in order to obtain on-the-job favors from him.\u201d The complaint also alleged that Vitolo\u2019s false statements \u201cwere adopted and republished by all of the remaining Defendants, for the intent of unlawfully exculpating themselves from liability for [Bollman]\u2019s injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">On November 20, 1998, Rocky Cola and its officers and employees tendered the defense of the Bollman lawsuit to Golden Eagle Insurance Corporation, which provided Rocky Cola\u2019s commercial general liability insurance coverage. Golden Eagle initially rejected the tender by letter dated December 17, 1998. Golden Eagle asserted that its coverages for bodily injury and personal injury were subject to exclusions for employment-related practices, policies, acts and omissions, so that there was no coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Rocky Cola\u2019s counsel wrote to Golden Eagle on March 3, 1999, challenging its refusal to defend. Counsel pointed out that Bollman\u2019s claim for defamation fell within the scope of the policy\u2019s \u201cpersonal injury\u201d coverage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>and that Vitolo\u2019s alleged defamatory statement that Bollman was a \u201csexually promiscuous and calculating bitch\u201d was not an \u201cemployment-related\u201d practice within the meaning of the exclusion. Counsel cited case precedent supporting a narrow interpretation of the employment-related practices exclusion, and pointed out that since applicability of the exclusion was doubtful at best, the potential for coverage required Golden Eagle to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Golden Eagle reconsidered its position and on April 27, 1999 agreed to defend Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9, Curry and Henderson under a reservation of rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Golden Eagle declined to defend or indemnify Vitolo on several grounds, including that he was not an insured because his conduct fell outside the scope of his employment for Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9. In December 1999, the Bollman suit was concluded with a judgment against Bollman and in favor of Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9 and all the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>This lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Meanwhile, on June 25, 1999, while the Bollman suit was still pending, Golden Eagle filed a complaint for declaratory relief. Golden Eagle sought a declaration that it had no duty to defend Rocky Cola, Curry or Henderson in the Bollman action, and sought reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs paid in defense of that lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Both Rocky Cola and Golden Eagle filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that Bollman\u2019s complaint alleged facts within the coverage of Golden Eagle\u2019s policy, and that the employment practices exclusion did not apply as a matter of law to eliminate Golden Eagle\u2019s duty to defend. The court accordingly granted Rocky Cola\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Golden Eagle\u2019s motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication of issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The controlling legal principles applicable to an insurer\u2019s duties under standard commercial general liability insurance policies are well-established. The policies, including the policy at issue, provide that the insurer has a duty to indemnify the insured for sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages for any covered claim. <em>(Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 45 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766].) The policies likewise provide that the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in any action brought against the insured seeking damages for any covered claim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 45-46.) The duty to indemnify \u201cruns to claims that are actually covered, in light of the facts proved.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 46.) The duty to defend, however, is broader than the duty to indemnify. The duty to defend \u201cruns to claims that are merely potentially covered, in light of facts alleged or otherwise disclosed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In a \u201cmixed\u201d action, where some claims are potentially covered and others are not, the insurer has a duty imposed by law to defend the action in its entirety, because \u201c[t]o defend meaningfully, the insurer must defend immediately,\u201d and \u201c[t]o defend immediately, it must defend entirely.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 48-49.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Golden Eagle admits \u201ccertain aspects of [Bollman\u2019s] defamation claim fall within the coverage of the policy . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, Golden Eagle points out that the policy covers damages caused by a defamatory statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u201carising out of\u2019 Rocky Cola\u2019s business, and that Bollman\u2019s claim was based on a supervisor\u2019s defamatory statements regarding an employee. Golden Eagle argues, however, that the same facts which place the claim within the insuring agreement\u2014namely, that Bollman\u2019s injury was caused by an offense \u201carising out of [Rocky Cola\u2019s] business\u201d\u2014also trigger the operation of the employment-related acts exclusion. On this point Golden Eagle is mistaken.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The exclusion in question provides that the insurance does <em>not </em>apply to personal injury to a person \u201carising out of any . . . [e]mployment-related practices, policies, acts or omissions, such as coercion, demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation or discrimination directed at that person . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the fact that the defamatory statement in question \u201caris[es] out of [Rocky Cola\u2019s] business\u201d does not necessarily mean it is an employment-related act within the meaning of the exclusion. <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Partridge </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 94, 101-102 [109 Cal.Rptr. 811, 514 P.2d 123] [\u201c[w]hereas coverage clauses are interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured [citations], exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer\u201d].) Indeed, it is difficult to see how Vitolo\u2019s alleged statement that Bollman was a \u201csexually promiscuous and calculating bitch\u201d is employment related. Legal precedents, including the cases cited by Golden Eagle, confirm that the employment-related practices exclusion is not interpreted so broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The applicable principle was enunciated in <em>Frank and Freedus v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 461 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 678]. In that case, which involved an employment-related practices exclusion similar to this one, a former employee of Frank and Freedus sued the law firm, alleging it improperly terminated him because he was gay and had tested positive for HIV. The suit also included a cause of action for defamation based on statements made by a partner after the employee had been fired. The partner, in response to concerns expressed by the office administrator about staff morale after the termination, said the ex-employee was \u201clikely gay and probably has AIDS.\u201d The partner then instructed the office administrator to inform the staff that the \u201creal reason\u201d the employee was fired was \u201c 1 <em>\u201cfailure to perform and develop as an associate.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 465.) The employee alleged the italicized language defamed him. Allstate refused to defend, asserting that coverage for personal injuries due to termination of employment or employment-related practices was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The court in <em>Frank and Freedus </em>affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Allstate had no duty to defend, rejecting the contention that the exclusionary language\u2014and specifically the term \u201cemployment-related\u201d\u2014was ambiguous. The court said the term \u201cemployment-related\u201d is \u201cused in its ordinary sense, i.e., related to employment,\u201d and that \u201cit modifies the specified acts (including defamation) as well as the terms \u2018practices, policies, acts or omissions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Frank and Freedus v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 471.) The court continued: \u201cThe defamation here was clearly employment-related. The statement was made in the context of [the employee]\u2019s employment and its content is directed to [the employee]\u2019s performance during employment. Thus, the defamation falls within subdivision (2) [termination of employment] of the exclusion. The defamation is also encompassed within subdivision (3) of the exclusion, i.e., a personal injury (defamation) arising out of termination of employment; the statement was made in the context of and related to [the employee]\u2019s termination of employment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 471-472.) Accordingly, to fall within the scope of the employment-related practices exclusion, a defamatory statement must, at a minimum, be made \u201cin the context of\u2019 the person\u2019s employment. (See also <em>Loyola Marymount University v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1222-1223 [271 Cal.Rptr. 528] [defamation claims occurring \u201cas part and parcel of allegedly wrongful termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment\u201d plainly were directly related to their employment and clearly within the language of an exclusion for personal injury sustained \u201cas a result of an offense directly or indirectly related to the employment\u201d of the person by the insured].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The point was confirmed in <em>HS Services, Inc. v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 109 F.3d 642. The court, applying California law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>concluded the employment-related practices exclusion in the policy did <em>not </em>apply because the defamatory statements were not made in the context of the underlying plaintiff\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In <em>HS Services, </em>the plaintiff in the underlying suit, Steven Cade, was fired as president of Cade-Grayson Company, and sued Cade-Grayson for wrongful termination. The company learned that Cade had told Cade-Grayson\u2019s vendors that the company was a candidate for bankruptcy. To counteract Cade\u2019s statements in the marketplace, Cade-Grayson circulated a memo informing its sales representatives to respond to inquiries with a statement saying that the company was financially sound and Cade was terminated for acts involving dishonesty. Cade then amended his wrongful termination complaint to include a defamation claim based on those statements. Cade-Grayson\u2019s insurer refused to defend and denied coverage. The insurer argued the policy\u2019s employment-related practices exclusion excluded Cade\u2019s post-termination defamation claim from coverage because it arose out of the employment relationship. The trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The court held that the defamation was <em>not </em>\u201cclearly employment-related\u201d because \u201calthough its content is directed to Cade\u2019s employment, the statements were not made in the context of Cade\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>(HS Services, Inc. v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>109 F.3d at p. 646.) \u201cWhile it may be literally true that the remarks \u2018related\u2019 to Cade\u2019s employment, that relationship was too indirect and attenuated to qualify under the exclusion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court held that \u201cfor an act or omission to be \u2018employment-related,\u2019 the relationship must be direct and proximate. . . . This limitation of the exclusion is consistent with the \u2018context\u2019 required by <em>Frank and Freedus, </em>and the \u2018part and parcel\u2019 requirement of <em>Loyola Marymount. </em>Any broader interpretation of the exclusion would defeat the reasonable expectation of the insured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 647.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We conclude that, as in <em>HS Services </em>and unlike the statement in <em>Frank and Freedus, </em>the defamatory statement that B oilman was a \u201csexually promiscuous and calculating bitch\u201d was not made in the context of Boilman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>employment. Nor was the content of the remark directed to her performance during employment or to anything else relating to her employment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The alleged defamation was therefore outside the scope of the exclusion, and was potentially covered by the policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court therefore correctly concluded Golden Eagle had a duty to defend against Bollman\u2019s suit, and properly granted summary judgment in favor of Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9, Curry and Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The judgment is affirmed. Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9 is to recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 13, 2002. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Golden Eagle\u2019s letter to Rocky Cola\u2019s counsel stated that damages for sexual harassment, unlawful employment practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful termination of employment, and negligent hiring and supervision were not covered by the policy. Golden Eagle also reserved its rights \u201cwith regard to cause of action number 4, defamation of character.\u201d The letter further stated that \u201cGolden Eagle Insurance Corporation reserves its full rights to be reimbursed and/or an allocation of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in this action for causes- of action that are not potentially covered under the policy. These causes of action are as follows: 1) sexual harassment; 2) unlawful employment practices; 3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; 4) defamation of character; 5) wrongful termination of employment; and 6) negligent hiring and supervision. Counsel is required to keep detailed records allocating time between potentially covered and non-covered claims.\u201d Golden Eagle also reserved \u201cthe right to later seek reimbursement of defense costs (in circumstances when no duty to defend exists) or indemnity payments it makes on behalf of Rocky Cola Caf\u00e9, Inc., Wally Curry, or Angela Henderson should it later be determined that the above claims in this litigation are excluded from coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The duty to defend arises when a tender is made and is discharged when the action is concluded. The duty may be extinguished earlier, \u201cif it is shown that no claim can in fact be covered,\u201d but it is extinguished only prospectively and not retroactively. <em>(Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 46.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In a mixed action, the insurer may not seek reimbursement from the insured for defense costs of those claims \u201cthat are at least potentially covered,\u201d unless the policy itself, or a separate contract supported by separate consideration, provides for reimbursement. The insurer may, however, seek reimbursement from the insured for defense costs of claims \u201cthat are not even potentially covered\u201d by the policy. <em>(Buss </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 49-50.) Reimbursement may be obtained only for defense costs \u201cthat can be allocated solely to the claims that are not even potentially covered.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 53.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The insuring agreement, as to personal injury liability, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u201cWe will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018personal injury\u2019 ... to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for \u2018personal injury\u2019 ... to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any \u2018occurrence\u2019 or offense and settle any claim or \u2018suit\u2019 that may result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">The insurance \u201capplies to: 1) \u2018Personal injury\u2019 caused by an offense arising out of your business, excluding advertising, publishing, broadcasting or telecasting done by or for you fi[] but only if the offense was committed in the \u2018coverage territory\u2019 during the policy period.\u201d \u201cPersonal injury\u201d is defined to mean \u201cinjury, other than \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 arising out of one or more of the following offenses: flQ . . . ffl] d.

The insurer\u2019s coverage for bodily injury liability was also subject to an exclusion for bodily injury arising out of employment-related practices and acts, including harassment. In light of our conclusion that Golden Eagle had a duty to defend the lawsuit because of the potential for coverage of the defamation claim, we need not consider whether there was any duty to defend under the bodily injury coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The full text of the exclusion is as follows;</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to: [K] \u2018Personal injury\u2019 to: [1[] 1) A person arising out of any: [1D a) Refusal to employ that person; [ID b) Termination of that person\u2019s employment; or [H] c) Employment-related practices, policies, acts or omissions, such as coercion, demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline, defamation, harassment, humiliation or discrimination directed at that person; or [H] 2) The spouse, child, parent, brother or sister of that person as a consequence of \u2018personal injury\u2019 to that person at whom any of the employment-related practices described in paragraphs a), b) or c) above is directed.

It was \u2018clearly\u2019 an attempt by the employer, as employer, to bolster employee morale and, thus, was employment-related.\u201d <em>(HS Services, Inc. v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>109 F.3d at p. 646.) In <em>HS Services, </em>by contrast, the purpose of the defamatory remarks was \u201cto protect Cade-Grayson in the marketplace. The remarks related directly to competition between Cade and Cade-Grayson in the marketplace and the latter\u2019s attempt to protect itself against a remark made by Cade, not as an ex-employee, but as a present competitor; that was their context.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Golden Eagle points out Bollman alleged that the \u201csexually promiscuous and calculating bitch\u201d remark by Vitolo included his assertion that Bollman had, \u201cby use of sexually aggressive tactics, maneuvered him into an unwanted sexual relationship in order to obtain on-the-job favors from him.\u201d The complaint also alleged that Vitolo\u2019s false statements \u201cwere adopted and republished by all of the remaining Defendants, for the intent of unlawfully exculpating themselves from liability for [Boilman]\u2019s injuries.\u201d Golden Eagle argues in effect that these additional allegations render the defamatory statements employment related. We decline to parse the alleged defamatory statements so closely, or to conclude that the additional allegations render Vitolo\u2019s remarks clearly employment related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Golden Eagle argues that Bollman\u2019s claim against Rocky Cola was dependent on its status as her employer, and \u201ccould not have arisen without the occurrence of an employment related act.\u201d The argument reaches too far; it would mean that no defamation claim by an employee against an employer would ever be covered where there is an employment-related practices exclusion. It is plain from the cases discussed in the text that the exclusion is not so broad. As the court pointed out in <em>HS Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins.
