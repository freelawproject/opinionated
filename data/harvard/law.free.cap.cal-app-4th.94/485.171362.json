Code, former \u00a7 290, subd. (f)) by failing to notify law enforcement that he had changed his residence address. The jury also found true allegations that defendant had suffered four prior convictions within the meaning of Penal Code sections 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) and 1170.12. Defendant admitted an on-bail enhancement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.1) allegation. He was committed to state prison for a term of 25 years to life for the substantive offense and given a two-year term for the on-bail enhancement. On appeal, defendant argues that (1) his conviction is not supported by substantial evidence, (2) the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to give sua sponte instructions to the jury that the \u201caddition of a second address\u201d did not trigger the duty to notify law enforcement, (3) the trial court\u2019s mens rea instructions were prejudicially erroneous, (4) the trial court prejudicially erred in refusing to instruct on mistake of fact, (5) the statutory provision requiring a sex offender to notify law enforcement when he changes his residence address is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, (6) defendant\u2019s conviction cannot be upheld because he was not given the statutorily required notification, (7) the jury was presented with a legally incorrect theory of guilt and (8) the on-bail enhancement sentence must be stayed because defendant was not convicted of the offense for which he was out on bail. Only defendant\u2019s final contention has any merit. We modify the judgment to stay the two-year term imposed for the on-bail enhancement and affirm the modified judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Pretrial Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Defendant was charged by information with failing to inform law enforcement that he had changed his residence address (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 290, subd. (f)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was further alleged that defendant had suffered five prior convictions within the meaning of Penal Code sections 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) and 1170.12 and that he had been out of custody on bail when he committed the substantive offense (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.1). The prosecution subsequently dismissed one of the five prior conviction allegations, and only four prior conviction allegations were placed before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Defendant filed a very brief pretrial motion to dismiss under Penal Code section 995 that asserted that he should not have been held to answer because he had not been given proper notice of his registration obligations and he had not acted willfully. Defendant later made a more substantive motion to dismiss based on (1) the government\u2019s lack of compliance with Penal Code former section 290\u2019s mandatory notice provisions when defendant was released from custody in 1995, (2) the government\u2019s failure to properly index defendant\u2019s registration forms, (3) the insufficiency of the evidence of willfulness in light of the lack of notice and (4) the unconstitutionality of Penal Code former section 290. The constitutional challenge was an assertion that the statute was \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d or \u201coverbroad\u201d both on its face and as applied. The basis for this challenge was his assertion that a person released from jail or prison would not know that he had to notify law enforcement of a change of address if he was returning to the address at which he was registered before his incarceration. Defendant also filed a demurrer to the information on similar grounds. The motion to dismiss was denied, and the demurrer was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The prior conviction allegations were bifurcated. The court ruled that defendant\u2019s prior convictions would be admissible to impeach him if he testified at trial. Defendant admitted the on-bail enhancement allegation. Defendant also admitted the element of the substantive offense that he had suffered a prior rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>The Prosecution\u2019s Case at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor identified the charged offense as defendant\u2019s failure \u201cto inform the San Jose Police Department that he had changed his address\u201d from his last registered address of 54 Floyd Street in San Jose. The prosecutor asserted that the evidence would establish that defendant was no longer residing at the Floyd Street address but instead was living both at his mother\u2019s address on Fifth Street in San Jose and at his father\u2019s address on Buena Vista in an unincorporated area of Santa Clara County.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence showed that defendant was released from prison in July 1987. When he was released, he was informed of his obligation to register, that the obligation would continue for his \u201clifetime,\u201d and that he \u201cmust upon changing my residence inform in writing within ten days the law enforcement agency with which I last registered.\u201d After his release, defendant initially registered with the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The address he registered at that time was his father\u2019s address on South Buena Vista Street in an unincorporated area adjacent to San Jose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Defendant was provided with a registration receipt for his initial registration. Defendant registered again in March 1990. The 1990 registration forms sought the registrant\u2019s \u201ccurrent residence\u201d and \u201chome address.\u201d Defendant provided the address of 54 Floyd Street in San Jose where he, his girlfriend and their children were residing as his \u201ccurrent residence\u201d and his \u201chome address.\u201d When he registered in 1990, defendant was again informed that his registration obligation was a lifetime obligation and that he was required to notify law enforcement of any change of address.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Sometime after May 1991, defendant signed a rental agreement for 54B Floyd Street. In January 1992, defendant was still living at the Floyd Street address and identifying that address as his home. In April 1992, defendant identified the Floyd Street address as his \u201ccurrent address\u201d on a court document. This information was verified by defendant\u2019s then girlfriend. On this same document, he identified his \u201c[previous address\u201d as the Buena Vista address and stated that his residence at the Buena Vista address had lasted for about four months. He never reregistered, updated his registration or notified any law enforcement agency that he had changed his address at any time between March 1990 and his arrest in February 1996. At no time did defendant ever inform law enforcement that he was residing at an address on Fifth Street in San Jose or that he was no longer residing at 54 Floyd Street in San Jose. In October 1995, defendant listed a Fifth Street address as his address on a W-4 form for an employer. In December 1995, defendant provided the Fifth Street address to the Department of Motor Vehicles as his address for his driver\u2019s license. He was also receiving mail and telephone calls at that address. It was undisputed that defendant was not residing at 54B Floyd Street at any time between July 1995 and February 1996 and that he had in fact not lived at that address since prior to 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On January 31, 1996, a weekday, plainclothes police officers went to defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s Fifth Street address looking for defendant. They had obtained this address for defendant from the Department of Motor Vehicles after failing to find him at the Floyd Street address that he had most recently registered. The police officers had not contacted the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s office in their search for defendant. They spoke with defendant\u2019s mother without first identifying themselves as police officers. She told them that defendant had been alternating between living there with her and living with his father. Defendant\u2019s mother informed the police officers that defendant had stayed with her \u201clast night and every night this week.\u201d She told them that he had clothes at her residence. She did not provide them with the address or telephone number for defendant\u2019s father\u2019s residence although she did tell them that it was on Buena Vista. Defendant was not present at the Fifth Street address at the time. One of the police officers left a business card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>with defendant\u2019s mother and asked her to have defendant call him. Later that day, defendant telephoned the officer. Defendant admitted to the officer that he was living at both his mother\u2019s residence and his father\u2019s residence. When the officer mentioned defendant\u2019s registration obligation, defendant said he did not need to register because his offenses had occurred \u201cmore than ten years ago.\u201d Police officers returned to the Fifth Street address the next day, also a weekday, about 7:00 p.m. and found defendant taking a shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Defendant\u2019s mother testified at trial that defendant was not residing with her but solely with his father. She admitted that she was aware that, because she ran a licensed daycare center out of her home, she was not permitted to have a registered sex offender in her home and could lose her license if she admitted that defendant was living with her. She admitted that defendant would \u201csometimes\u201d sleep at her residence \u201cmostly weekends\u201d and also on some weeknights. She also conceded that there was never a month between July 1995 and February 1996 when defendant did not spend at least one night at her residence. Defendant\u2019s mother also testified that defendant kept some clothes in her residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief was denied. He also renewed his motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds. This motion too was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>The Defense Case at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The defense case was laid out in its opening statement. The defense conceded that defendant was required to register as a sex offender due to his prior conviction and that he had been properly notified of this obligation when he was released from prison in 1987. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel also pointed out that defendant had updated his registration to reflect the Floyd Street address after he \u201cstarted living there for days or weeks at a time.\u201d He asserted that defendant had done so because he had been advised that \u201cit would be a good idea if you\u2019re going to be spending time at this second address, 54 Floyd Street, B, to also register there.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel interpreted defendant\u2019s 1990 registration as the addition of a \u201csecond address\u201d so that defendant \u201cwas registered at two addresses.\u201d Thus, the defense case was that defendant had remained registered at the Buena Vista address through the time of his arrest. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel stated that the evidence would show that defendant \u201cnever used 370 North Fifth Street as a residence\u201d but always resided at the Buena Vista address.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Although defendant\u2019s trial counsel had indicated to the court at the commencement of trial that defendant would testify, during the defense case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>he indicated and defendant confirmed that defendant would not testify. There was no evidence that defendant had been renotified of his registration obligations when he was released in July 1995. Nor was there any evidence that defendant had been explicitly informed that updating his registration with a new address would \u201ccancel\u201d or \u201csupersede\u201d a prior registered address. There was also no evidence that defendant had received a registration receipt in March 1990 when he registered the Floyd Street address. The police department did not keep records of receipts since receipts were given to registrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Defendant\u2019s mother testified that defendant was living with his father at the Buena Vista Street address from the summer of 1995 until his arrest in February 1996. She insisted that defendant had not resided with her and had never been in the residence when children were present. Defendant\u2019s mother testified that defendant had merely spent the two nights prior to his arrest at her residence because he was cleaning out her garage. She claimed that she had merely told the police that he had stayed with her the last two days and that she had told them that he lived with his father. She testified that defendant did not have a bedroom in her residence but slept on the couch in a children\u2019s play area when he did spend the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Defendant\u2019s father testified that defendant had lived with him at the Buena Vista address \u201c[m]ost of the time\u201d from 1987 to 1990 and in 1995 and 1996. At some point, defendant began spending some of his time at the residence of his girlfriend. However, he still stayed with his father \u201ca lot of times.\u201d In 1995, defendant returned to the Buena Vista address and \u201clived with me there for a while.\u201d Defendant\u2019s father had little memory for specifics. \u201cI can\u2019t recall because he was coming back and forth, so I can\u2019t recall.\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, he\u2019s been with me most of the time. He comes and goes . . . .\u201d He could not say how often defendant stayed at his residence between July 1995 and February 1996. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you, but I know he stayed quite a bit with me. I can\u2019t tell you exactly how long.\u201d When pressed for specifics, he testified: \u201cHe\u2019s a grown man. He was in and out. What can I say? But most of the time he did spend with me.\u201d He claimed to be unaware that defendant had ever spent the night at defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s residence, and he insisted that defendant had spent every night at his residence during the week preceding January 31, 1996. Defendant\u2019s father also insisted that defendant lived with him from July 1995 to the time of his arrest. Defendant\u2019s father testified that defendant kept some clothes at his father\u2019s residence but kept most of his work tools at his mother\u2019s residence and received his mail at his mother\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Defendant\u2019s son, who lived with defendant\u2019s father, testified that defendant had divided his time between the Floyd Street address and the Buena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Vista address between 1990 and 1992. There were only two beds at the Buena Vista address. When defendant spent the night there between the summer of 1995 and February 1996, defendant\u2019s son would give up his bed to defendant and sleep on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">A number of other witnesses testified that they had seen defendant at defendant\u2019s father\u2019s residence on a few occasions when they were visiting there. One of defendant\u2019s son\u2019s friends testified that he had seen defendant at the Buena Vista address on alternate weekends between July 1995 and February 1996. A neighbor and friend of defendant\u2019s father testified that she had seen defendant\u2019s truck parked near his father\u2019s residence \u201c[e]very day\u201d from July 1995 to January 1996. This neighbor had worked at night and had seen the truck parked during the day. Another neighbor of defendant\u2019s father testified that she had seen defendant at his father\u2019s residence \u201c[l]ike two, three days a week, like weekends\u201d between July 1995 and January 1996. Defendant\u2019s former girlfriend testified that defendant had never lived with her at the Floyd Street address between 1990 and 1992 although he had sometimes spent the night there. Instead, he had always spent most of his time living at the Buena Vista address.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\n<em>Closing Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The prosecutor characterized the \u201ccrux\u201d of the defense case as being \u201c54 Floyd Street was never his address\u201d and \u201che\u2019s always been living at Buena Vista since 1967.\u201d The prosecutor challenged this defense by pointing out that in 1992 defendant had claimed Floyd Street as his current address and Buena Vista as his previous address. Similarly, the prosecutor noted that in 1995 defendant gave an employer and the Department of Motor Vehicles the Fifth Street address as his address. The prosecutor also noted that defendant had told a police officer just before his arrest that he lived at both the Fifth Street address and the Buena Vista address.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The prosecutor argued that defendant had committed the charged offense of \u201cfailure to register\u201d in one of two ways. He had failed to inform law enforcement that he had changed his address when, in July 1995, he was released from custody and did not return to the Floyd Street address at which he had most recently registered. Alternatively, the prosecutor argued that, even if defendant had still been registered at the Buena Vista address and had returned there, he had committed the charged offense by failing to inform law enforcement when he began residing, at least part of the time, at the Fifth Street address in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">As evidence of defendant\u2019s intent, the prosecutor identified defendant\u2019s statement to the police officer he telephoned on January 31. Defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>told this officer that he did not need to register because \u201cthat happened ten years ago.\u201d Since defendant had been fully informed that the registration obligation continued for his lifetime, the prosecutor contended that this statement evidenced a conscious decision by defendant not to comply with his obligation. The prosecutor also argued that \u201c[t]he fact that he registered at 54 Floyd Street demonstrates the fact that he knew of the requirement if he changed his address he had to notify law enforcement officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel acknowledged the prosecutor\u2019s alternative theories. As to the first theory, he argued that the 1990 \u201cregistration\u201d at Floyd Street \u201cdid not cancel the registration he then had at 483 South Buena Vista.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel maintained that defendant had always lived at the Buena Vista address with his father. He contended that the Floyd Street registration was simply the registration of \u201ca second address.\u201d With regard to the second theory, he asserted that it was not a crime \u201cto have an address which is an additional address to the one you\u2019re registered at as your residence address under Penal Code 290.\u201d He claimed that defendant did not have a \u201cresidence\u201d at the Fifth Street address because his \u201chome\u201d from July 1995 to February 1996 where he \u201cwas living\u201d was the Buena Vista address.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\n<em>Further Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">After the jury had been instructed and had retired for its deliberations, defendant\u2019s trial counsel again moved for dismissal. He claimed that there was insufficient evidence of willfulness and insufficient evidence that the Fifth Street address was \u201ca residence.\u201d He also renewed his earlier motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds. Both motions were denied. The jury deliberated for less than two and a half hours before returning a guilty verdict on the substantive count. The four prior conviction allegations were then tried to the jury, and the jury returned true findings on these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Defendant sought to bring a motion in propria persona for new trial. His trial counsel stated on the record that he had not filed a motion for a new trial \u201c[bjecause in my view, the jury verdict is a finding of fact which passed and satisfies the substantial evidence rule or test.\u201d He noted that \u201c[tjhere clearly is [substantial evidence] in this case\u201d to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel asked the trial court to strike three of the four prior conviction findings under Penal Code section 1385 or as cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court declined to strike any of the findings. The court committed defendant to state prison for a term of 25 years to life for the substantive offense and a two-year term for the on-bail enhancement. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Defendant asserts that his conviction for failing to notify law enforcement that he had changed his residence address is not supported by substantial evidence. His appellate argument is that he \u201cmerely added a second address and did not change an address.\u201d He concedes that a sex offender who lives at two different residences must <em>register </em>both addresses <em>(People </em>v. <em>Horn </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 408, 415-419 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 310]), but he argues that a sex offender\u2019s failure to register both of his residences is a violation of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (a)(l)\u2019s registration requirement rather than the offense charged here, a violation of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f)\u2019s notification requirement. We reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In a nutshell, the case presented at trial showed the following facts. Defendant registered at an address on Buena Vista in 1987. In 1990, he registered at an address on Floyd Street. In 1992, he was incarcerated. In 1995, he was released and began living at the Buena Vista address. He did not register any additional addresses after 1990 nor did he notify law enforcement that he was no longer living at the Floyd Street address or that he was now living at the Buena Vista address. The prosecution presented evidence that defendant subsequently began living, at least some of the time, at an address on Fifth Street. He did not notify law enforcement that he was now dividing his time between the Buena Vista address and the Fifth Street address. Defendant challenged only the prosecution\u2019s evidence that he was residing at the Fifth Street address. He presented evidence aimed at establishing that he was residing solely at the Buena Vista address.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The twists and turns of defendant\u2019s appellate argument weave their way through Penal Code former section 290 in a corkscrew fashion. He urges, as he did in the trial court, that his 1990 registration of the Floyd Street address was merely the addition of a second address, which did not cancel or supercede his registration of the Buena Vista address. He then asserts that his \u201creturn\u201d to the Buena Vista address in 1995 did not require him to register or to inform law enforcement that he had changed his address since he had previously registered this address in 1987. When defendant began living at the Fifth Street address some of the time, so his argument goes, \u201cdefendant did not \u2018change\u2019 his address to a \u2018new\u2019 address\u201d because a \u201cchange of address\u201d does not occur when a person \u201cmerely establishes or uses a second residence in addition to one he or she already has in use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">We cannot accept defendant\u2019s argument that a person who establishes a \u201csecond residence\u201d does not \u201cchange\u201d his or her \u201cresidence address\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the meaning of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f)\u2019s notification requirement. The only support defendant cites for this proposition is <em>People v. Ramirez </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 910 [61 Cal.Rptr. 309]. The statute involved in <em>Ramirez </em>required certain narcotics offenders to notify law enforcement of a change of address. The language of the provision was very similar to the language of subdivision (f)\u2019s requirement that certain sex offenders notify law enforcement of a change of address. Ramirez registered a motel as his address. He then spent three weeks staying with a woman in a second motel but did not notify law enforcement. He was contacted in the second motel and searched by a police officer. Heroin was found on his person, and he was convicted of possession. The issue on appeal was whether the search was valid. The search could only have been valid if the officer had reasonable cause to believe that Ramirez was in violation of the notification provision for failing to inform law enforcement that he was staying at the second motel. The Court of Appeal reversed. It deemed Ramirez\u2019s three-week stay with the woman \u201con a day-to-day basis\u201d at the second motel a \u201csojourn\u201d that was nothing more than \u201ctransitory\u201d and concluded that it did not constitute a \u201cchange of residence address\u201d within the meaning of the narcotics offender registration law\u2019s notification requirement. <em>(Ramirez, </em>at pp. 910-912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><em>Ramirez </em>provides no support for defendant\u2019s argument. The underlying basis for <em>Ramirez\u2019s </em>holding was that Ramirez\u2019s transitory visitation with a woman at a location other than his registered residence address did not establish that location as a \u201cresidence\u201d within the meaning of the narcotics offender registration law. The narcotics offender registration law at that time required a narcotics offender to register \u201cwithin 30 days of his coming into any county or city, or city and county in which he <em>resides or is temporarily domiciled </em>for such length of time . . . .\u201d (Former Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11850, italics added.) The narcotics offender registration law did not mention \u201ctemporary\u201d residences. At the time of <em>Ramirez, </em>a \u201cresidence\u201d was defined as \u201cany factual place of abode of some permanency, more than a mere temporary sojourn.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 235, 239 [288 P.2d 497].) Further, a person could have only one \u201cdomicile,\u201d but could have multiple residences. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 239.) Because the court in <em>Ramirez </em>concluded that Ramirez\u2019s stay with the woman in the second motel was merely a temporary sojourn, the second motel did not qualify as Ramirez\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d and therefore he had not changed his residence address within the meaning of the narcotics offender registration law then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In contrast, the sex offender registration law at issue here (the 1996 version of Pen. Code, former \u00a7 290) required a sex offender to register \u201cwithin 14 days of coming into any city, county or city and county in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>he or she <em>temporarily resides </em>or is domiciled for that length of time . . . (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, subd. (a), italics added.) Subdivision (f) required a registrant to inform law enforcement when he or she changed a residence address. \u201cIf any person required to register pursuant to this section changes his or her residence address, the person shall inform, in writing within 10 days, the law enforcement agency or agencies with whom he or she last registered of the new address.\u201d Since the sex offender registration law explicitly required registration of <em>temporary </em>residences, it follows that this law\u2019s requirement of notification when a person \u201cchanges\u201d a \u201cresidence address\u201d also applies to <em>temporary </em>residences. Because the statute construed in <em>Ramirez </em>did not apply to temporary residences, <em>Ramirez </em>did not address the question of \u201cchanges\u201d with regard to temporary residences. Moreover, the issue in <em>Ramirez </em>was not what constituted \u201cchanges\u201d of address but instead what constituted a nontemporary \u201cresidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding by the jury that he was at least temporarily residing at both the Buena Vista address and the Fifth Street address. Nor does he challenge the undisputed evidence that he was <em>not </em>residing at the Floyd Street address. Instead, he argues that neither his \u201creturn\u201d to the Buena Vista address nor his \u201caddition\u201d of the Fifth Street address as a second residence address \u201cchange[d]\u201d his residence address within the meaning of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f)\u2019s notification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">His interpretation of the word \u201cchanges\u201d in Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) is absurd. Although he concedes that a registrant who adds a second address must <em>register </em>that address in compliance with subdivision <em>(a), </em>he argues that a person who adds (or, it must be assumed, as to the Floyd Street address, eliminates) a second address has not <em>changed </em>his residence address within the meaning of subdivision <em>(f) </em>and therefore need not notify law enforcement. He assumes that \u201cchanges\u201d refers <em>only </em>to the <em>substitution </em>of one address for another rather than to the <em>elimination </em>of one of two registered addresses or the <em>addition </em>of a second address to an existing registered address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Defendant supports his argument by an interpretation of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f), which posits that requiring notification when a person changes a residence address would necessarily cancel or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>supercede the previously registered address thereby presenting an unresolvable dilemma for someone who is merely adding a second residence address rather than substituting a new residence for an old residence. We can find nothing in Penal Code former section 290 which supports this contention. By explicitly referring to \u201ctemporary\u201d residences, Penal Code former section 290 clearly contemplated that a registrant might need to register multiple addresses. Hence, it would be unreasonable to assume, as defendant does, that subdivision (f)\u2019s broadly worded notification requirement was not intended to apply to the elimination of one of multiple registered addresses or the addition of an unregistered second address to an existing registered address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The language of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) itself is also not amenable to defendant\u2019s tortured interpretation. \u201cIf any person required to register pursuant to this section changes his or her residence address, the person shall inform, in writing within 10 days, the law enforcement agency or agencies with whom he or she last registered of the new address.\u201d Although the singular \u201caddress\u201d is used, no one could reasonably conclude from this language that someone with multiple registered addresses is not subject to this provision. Instead, the only rational interpretation of the subdivision is that notification is required when a person \u201cchanges\u201d <em>any </em>\u201cresidence address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Defendant\u2019s theory at trial was that he had not changed residence addresses because (1) he had properly registered multiple residence addresses, Floyd Street and Buena Vista, (2) he was living solely at the registered Buena Vista address and (3) he was not living at the Fifth Street address. However, any rational interpretation of \u201cchanges\u201d would include the conduct upon which defendant sought to premise his claim of innocence. The primary definition of the verb \u201cchange\u201d is \u201cto make different in some particular.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet. (10th ed. 1993) p. 190.) Under defendant\u2019s theory, he eliminated one of two registered addresses but failed to inform law enforcement of this fact. The deletion of one of two registered residence addresses undoubtedly makes a person\u2019s residence address \u201cdifferent.\u201d Similarly, under the prosecution\u2019s theories, defendant either substituted the Buena Vista address for the Floyd Street address without notifying law enforcement, or added the Fifth Street address to the Buena Vista address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>without notifying law enforcement, or both. The substitution of one address for another certainly makes a person\u2019s address \u201cdifferent,\u201d as does going from having a single residence address to having two residence addresses. There is no theory under which defendant\u2019s conduct did not violate his notification requirement. We reject defendant\u2019s assertion that no violation of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) occurs if one of a registrant\u2019s residence addresses remains unchanged while another residence address is added, eliminated or otherwise altered without notification of law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">B. <em>Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Defendant claims that the trial court prejudicially erred in (1) failing to give sua sponte instructions to the jury that the \u201caddition of a second address\u201d did not trigger the duty to notify law enforcement, (2) giving inadequate mens rea instructions and (3) refusing to instruct on mistake of fact. As we have already concluded in the previous section of this opinion, Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) <em>does </em>impose a duty to notify law enforcement of the \u201caddition of a second [residence] address.\u201d Therefore the court did not err in failing to give instructions to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor did the court err in its mens rea instructions or in refusing to give mistake of fact instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">1. <em>Mens Rea Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The court instructed the jury that the charged offense could only be committed if defendant \u201cwillfully failed to inform in writing within ten days\u201d the law enforcement agency \u201cwith whom he last registered of the new address.\u201d The court defined the term \u201cwillfully\u201d for the jury. \u201cThe word \u2018willfully\u2019 when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted means with a purpose or willingness to commit the act or to make the omission in question. The word \u2018willfully\u2019 does not require any intent to violate the law or to injure or to acquire any advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Defendant asserts that these instructions were inadequate because they failed to inform the jury that he could not be convicted unless he knew that Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) \u201capplied to his or her situation\u201d and willfully failed to comply with its requirements. He asserts that the trial court was required to instruct the jury that he could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>convicted only if he \u201cactually knew of the duty to report the change of address . . . He claims that the trial court\u2019s error in failing to so instruct was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because there was no evidence that he knew that he was required to report a change of address \u201cwhen one merely was adding a second or additional residence to an already existing residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In his original respondent\u2019s brief, the Attorney General contested defendant\u2019s assertion that knowledge was an element of the offense. After the completion of the original appellate briefing in this case, the California Supreme Court ruled in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 744 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 23 P.3d 590] that a willful violation of Penal Code former section 290 occurs only where the defendant \u201cactually know[s] of the duty to act\u201d and \u201cwhat act is required to be performed.\u201d (Garcia, at p. 752.) The jury instructions in <em>Garcia </em>had included the same willfulness instructions given here but had also included an \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse\u201d instruction, which was not given to the jury in this case. (Garcia, at p. 754.) Garcia\u2019s trial counsel had been precluded by the court from arguing that Garcia should be found not guilty because he had not been aware of the registration requirement, and the prosecutor was permitted to argue that lack of knowledge was not a defense. <em>(Garcia, </em>at pp. 754-755.) The California Supreme Court found that the trial court had erred in failing to instruct on the knowledge element, giving the \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse\u201d instruction and allowing the jury to be led to believe that knowledge was not necessary to a finding' of guilt. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nevertheless, the California Supreme Court found the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury had necessarily concluded that defendant had been properly informed of his registration obligation and the only evidence that defendant had been unaware of his obligation was his own testimony that he had not been informed of his registration obligation which was discredited by the jury\u2019s finding of notice. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Both the Attorney General and defendant submitted supplemental letter briefs addressing <em>Garcia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Based on <em>Garcia, </em>we find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the circumstances of this case. The evidence presented at trial established without dispute that defendant was properly notified both in 1987 and 1990 that he was required both to register and to inform law enforcement if he changed his address. He properly registered the Buena Vista address, and, in 1990, he notified law enforcement that he had changed his address to the Floyd Street address. His notification to law enforcement of the Floyd Street address verified that he was aware of his obligation to notify law enforcement of any change in his residence address. Defendant never thereafter reregistered, updated his registration or notified any law enforcement agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that he had changed his address prior to his February 1996 arrest. However, he indisputably stopped residing at the Floyd Street address no later than 1993. At the time of his 1996 arrest, defendant admitted that he was living at the Fifth Street address, but he claimed he did not need to apprise law enforcement of his current address because his sex offenses had occurred \u201cmore than ten years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As the evidence indisputably established that defendant had been repeatedly and properly notified of his lifetime registration and notification obligations and that he had previously complied with those obligations, and defendant did not testify at trial regarding his actual state of mind, the trial court\u2019s omission of explicit instruction on the knowledge element of the offense was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no reasonable possibility that the omitted instruction would have caused any juror to doubt whether defendant was aware of his registration and notification obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">2. <em>Mistake of Fact Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Defendant claims that the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to instruct sua sponte on mistake of fact because there was evidence that \u201cdefendant reasonably and in good faith believed that he had not changed an address within the meaning of subdivision (f) of former section 290 of the Penal Code when, in the latter part of 1995, he started spending part of his time living at [the Fifth Street address] while during the other part of his time he was living at [the Buena Vista address].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because this theory was not supported by substantial evidence, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">This alleged mistake of fact applies only to the prosecution\u2019s theory that defendant had violated Penal Code former section 290 by failing to inform law enforcement when he began residing part of the time at the Fifth Street address. Defendant disputed at trial that he was living at the Fifth Street address at all, but the jury could only have convicted him on this theory if it found that he was living at the Fifth Street address. Certainly there was no evidence that defendant honestly did not know where he lived. He provided the Fifth Street address to his employer and the Department of Motor Vehicles and used it for other purposes. When he was arrested for the current offense, defendant admitted that he was living at the Fifth Street address, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>he claimed he did not need to register because his sex offenses had occurred \u201cmore than ten years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel speculates that defendant may have believed that his change from living solely at the Buena Vista address to living partly at that address and partly at the Fifth Street address was not a change of address which he was obligated to report to law enforcement. He bases this speculation on the fact that one of defendant\u2019s 1987 registration cards stated that the card should be surrendered in exchange for a new registration receipt showing \u201ccurrent address\u201d when a change of address was reported to law enforcement. Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel claims that the information on this card would lead a reasonable person to believe that the addition of a second address did not require notification of law enforcement because surrender of the old registration card in exchange for a new receipt showing <em>only the second address </em>would not accurately reflect both addresses. This speculation is neither supported by the language on the card nor reasonable. Any reasonable person would have understood this language to require one to surrender the old card and obtain a new receipt which listed <em>all current addresses. </em>Absolutely nothing in its language indicated that a person could not obtain a new registration receipt listing multiple current addresses. Moreover, it would be unreasonable to conclude from the language on the registration card that a registrant\u2019s lifetime obligation to notify law enforcement whenever he or she changed addresses was not intended to apply to persons with multiple addresses. Finally, defendant\u2019s statements at the time of his arrest rebutted any inference that he was operating under such a mistake of fact since he attributed his failure to notify law enforcement to his alleged belief that his lifetime registration obligation had miraculously expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The trial court did not err in failing to give mistake of fact instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">C. <em>Vagueness Challenge to Statute as Applied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Defendant made a pretrial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute on the ground that Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) was vague as applied to a defendant who returns after a period of time in custody to the address at which he had registered prior to going into custody. He repeats this challenge on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u201c[A]n as applied challenge assumes that the statute or ordinance violated is valid and asserts that the manner of enforcement against a particular individual or individuals or the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance is applied is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Cal.4th 1069, 1089 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].) \u201c \u2018The rule is well established . . . that one will not be heard to attack a statute on grounds that are not shown to be applicable to himself and that a court will not consider every conceivable situation which might arise under the language of the statute and will not consider the question of constitutionality with reference to hypothetical situations.\u2019 . . <em>(Tobe, </em>at p. 1095, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge to the statute is misdirected because the prosecution did not seek to enforce the statute in the manner in which defendant claims it is vague. The prosecution unambiguously asserted that defendant\u2019s only current registered address was the Floyd Street address but he was living at the Buena Vista address and the Fifth Street address. It did not seek to apply the statute to a person who had returned after a period of custody to the address at which he had been registered when the custodial period began. It was the defense that asserted that defendant\u2019s \u201creturn\u201d to the Buena Vista address was <em>not </em>a violation of the statute because his registration of the Floyd Street address had only been the addition of a second address to his previous registration of the Buena Vista address. The jury\u2019s verdict implies factual findings which eliminate any basis for defendant\u2019s challenge. Either the jury found that defendant\u2019s registration of the Floyd Street address was a substitution of this address for the Buena Vista address rather than an addition of this address to the Buena Vista address or the jury based the conviction on defendant\u2019s residence at the Fifth Street address, an address which he had never provided to any law enforcement agency. Under neither scenario was defendant\u2019s conviction based on his return after a period of custody to an address at which he had been registered when the custody commenced. We reject defendant\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">D. <em>Notice to Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Defendant asserts that his conviction cannot be upheld because Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (b) was not complied with when he was released from custody in 1995. This issue was also raised by means of a pretrial motion to dismiss and personally argued by defendant after the jury\u2019s verdict. The trial court rejected this assertion. We do also.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201cAny person who . . . is released, discharged, or paroled from a jail, state or federal prison, school, road camp, or other institution where he or she was confined because of the commission or attempted commission of one of the offenses specified in subdivision (a) . . . shall, prior to discharge, parole, or release, be informed of his or her duty to register under this section by the official in charge of the place of confinement . . . .\u201d (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>It is undisputed that defendant was properly informed of his lifetime duty to register when he was released from prison in 1987. He registered in 1987 and 1990. In 1992, defendant was arrested for new offenses, convictions for which also would have triggered a duty to register under Penal Code former section 290. Defendant remained in custody until 1995 when his convictions for these new offenses were reversed on appeal. He was returned to the county jail and released on bail pending retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Defendant claims that jail officials were required to inform him of his duty to register when he was released from jail in 1995 pending retrial of offenses to which the duty to register would have applied upon conviction. His parsing of the notification requirement is illogical in the extreme. On its face, this notification requirement cannot require notification to a person whose custody at the time of release is based on <em>mere allegations </em>that he or she committed an offense to which Penal Code former section 290\u2019s registration requirement would be applicable. Penal Code former section 290\u2019s registration requirement only applies to those who are <em>convicted </em>of one of the specified offenses. Yet, if defendant\u2019s interpretation of the notification requirement was correct, every person released from jail with charges pending for a specified offense would have to be notified of a registration requirement that was <em>wholly inapplicable </em>to that person because he or she had not yet suffered a <em>conviction </em>for an offense triggering the registration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Even if, on a highly technical analysis, the precise statutory language might be potentially susceptible to defendant\u2019s interpretation, his interpretation is so absurd that it must be rejected.  \u201c \u2018 \u201c[Wjhere the language of a statutory provision is susceptible of two constructions, one of which, in application, will render it reasonable, fair and harmonious with its manifest purpose, and another which would be productive of absurd consequences, the former construction will be adopted.\u201d . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 305 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042], citations omitted.) \u201cCourts will not favor a defendant\u2019s interpretation if it would lead to results \u2018that are contrary to legislative intent or that fail to prevent the harm that is identified in the statute or that override common sense and create palpable absurdities.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Townsend </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1396-1397 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 438], citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The purpose of the notification requirement was unambiguously to inform a person of his or her registration obligation at the time of his or her release from custody for a <em>conviction </em>which had triggered Penal Code former section 290\u2019s registration requirement. Application of the notice requirement to a person released from a period of custody that was not attributable to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>conviction </em>which triggered Penal Code former section 290\u2019s registration requirement would not serve the obvious purpose of the notification requirement, defies common sense and is patently absurd. How can a person be informed of a registration requirement if he or she does not have one because he or she has not yet suffered a conviction? Why would the Legislature require notification of a nonexistent duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">It is no answer for defendant to assert that the notification requirement, as he interprets it, was only intended to apply to those who already had a registration requirement arising from a prior conviction. If the Legislature had intended to require notification of every person subject to a registration requirement upon their release after any custodial period even if it was not attributable to a conviction triggering the registration requirement, it would be unreasonable to limit such a notification to only those instances where the release occurred with charges pending to which a registration requirement might be triggered upon conviction. While it might be conceivable that the Legislature might want those obligated to register to be reminded of their preexisting registration obligations after time in custody, defendant\u2019s interpretation would not have that result because no notification would be required where the person obligated to register was in custody for something other than a specified sex offense. Defendant\u2019s interpretation of the notification requirement is not rendered any more reasonable by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Because defendant\u2019s interpretation of the notification requirement would require us to conclude that the Legislature acted in an irrational manner, it must be rejected. Any failure of jail officials to notify defendant of his preexisting registration obligation in 1995 did not violate Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">E. <em>Alleged Presentation of Legally Incorrect Theory to the Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Defendant asserts that \u201cserious prejudicial error occurred\u201d when the court in its instructions to the jury and the prosecutor in his argument to the jury referred to the charged offense as a \u201cfailure to register\u201d or a \u201cfailure to update registration\u201d rather than as a \u201cfailure to notify.\u201d He claims that these erroneous references invited the jury to return a conviction based on a crime with which he was not charged thereby depriving him of due process. Defendant does not present this assertion as a claim of instructional error or prosecutorial misconduct. Instead, his claim is based solely on his argument that these references to an uncharged offense amounted to the presentation of the case to the jury on a \u201clegally incorrect\u201d theory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">It is true that the trial court twice misstated the title of the offense. First, in its instructions on the need for unanimity, it said: \u201cThe defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>accused of having committed <em>the crime of failure to update registration </em>in a single count of the information. The prosecution has introduced evidence tending to prove that there is more than one act or omission upon which a conviction on that count may be based. [5\u00a1] The defendant may be found guilty if the proof shows beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any one or more of the acts or omission[s]. However, in order to return a verdict of guilty to Count 1, all jurors must agree that he committed the same act or omission. It is not necessary that the particular act or omission agreed upon be stated in your verdict.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Second, although the trial court accurately instructed the jury in the language of Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (f) on the elements of the charged offense, it did misstate the title of the offense once during these instructions while otherwise correctly stating both the title and the nature of the charged offense. The trial court instructed the jury that the charged offense was <em>\u201cthe crime of failure to inform a law enforcement agency of new address </em>with a sexual assault prior\u201d that had been committed when defendant \u201cchange[d] his residence address and did fail to inform in writing within ten days the San Jose Police law enforcement agency which whom he last registered . . . with his new address.\u201d (Italics added.) The court instructed the jury in the language of the subdivision (f) notification requirement that defendant was charged with violating. \u201cEvery person who having previously been convicted of a felony sex offense who is required to register as a sex offender with the chief of police of the city in which he resided or domiciled or temporarily resided or was temporarily domiciled, or with the sheriff of the county if he resided or domiciled or temporarily resided or temporarily was domiciled in an unincorporated area of the county, and who changes his residence address and who failed to inform in writing within ten days the chief of police or the sheriff of the county where he was last registered of the new address is guilty of <em>the crime of failure to register, </em>a violation of Penal Code section 290(g)(2) [szc].\u201d (Italics added.) The court also informed the jury that it was stipulated that defendant was required to register. The remaining elements of the offense upon which the jury was correctly instructed were: (1) that defendant registered, (2) that defendant \u201cchanged his residence address\u201d and (3) that defendant \u201cwillfully failed to inform in writing within ten days\u201d the law enforcement agency \u201cwith whom he last registered of the new address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In light of these instructions, there is no possibility that the jury would have interpreted the trial court\u2019s two technically incorrect references to the title of the offense to refer to anything other than the charged offense of failing to inform law enforcement of a change of address. To a layperson, there is no perceptible difference between failing to inform someone of a change in one\u2019s registered address and failing to \u201cupdate\u201d one\u2019s registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>with that information. Since the trial court\u2019s singular reference to a \u201cfailure to register\u201d came on the heels of an accurate and complete description of the elements of the charged failure to notify offense, it is inconceivable that the jury could have been misled by the court\u2019s inaccurate reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Although there were references by both the court and the prosecutor to the charged offense as a \u201cfailure to register,\u201d the court did not instruct on and the prosecutor did not present any theory to the jury that was based on defendant\u2019s failure to \u201cregister\u201d rather than his failure to \u201cnotify\u201d law enforcement that he had changed his address. The prosecutor argued that defendant had committed the charged offense by either (1) failing to notify law enforcement of his change of address when he did not return to the Floyd Street address after his release from prison or (2) failing to notify law enforcement of his change of address when he began residing, at least at times, at the Fifth Street address. Neither of these theories was based on an uncharged failure to \u201cregister\u201d as opposed to the charged failure to notify, and both theories were \u201clegally correct.\u201d Defendant\u2019s assertion of prejudicial error fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">F. <em>Sentence for Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Defendant asserts, and the Attorney General concedes, that the sentence imposed for the on-bail enhancement must be stayed because, at the time of sentencing in this case, defendant had not been convicted of the primary offenses for which he was out on bail. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.1, subd. (d).) We agree and will so order.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The two-year term imposed for the Penal Code section 12022.1 on-bail enhancement is hereby ordered stayed. The trial court is ordered to prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting this modification and to transmit the amended abstract to the Department of Corrections. The modified judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Premo, Acting P.

Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The information actually alleged a violation of subdivision (g)(2), but the parties agree that the substantive allegation of which defendant had notice was an allegation of a violation of subdivision (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Of course, under the prosecution\u2019s evidence, which defendant does not challenge on appeal, he substituted the Fifth Street address for the Floyd Street address as his \u201csecond address\u201d without notifying law enforcement. Thus, even if his unwieldy statutory interpretation could possibly succeed, the facts established at trial would still show that he violated subdivision (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\">When the second address is within the same jurisdiction as the first address, one might argue that Penal Code former section 290, subdivision (a)\u2019s registration requirement, as it read in 1996, did not require <em>registration </em>of the second address since the person was already present within the jurisdiction and had registered. Here, the Buena Vista address and the Fifth Street address were not in the same jurisdiction since the Buena Vista address was in the unincorporated area while the Fifth Street address was within the San Jose city limits. The Floyd Street address was, like the Fifth Street address, within the San Jose city limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The jury was instructed that a person could have more than one \u201cresidence,\u2019\u2019and defendant does not claim that this instruction was improper. \u201cA person may have more than one residence or domicile or temporary residence or a temporary domicile at the same time. Residence is the equivalent of home, something more than passing through or a presence for a limited visit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel asked the trial court to instruct the jury on mistake of fact with CALJIC No. 4.35. He claimed that there was evidence of two mistakes of fact: (1) that defendant mistakenly believed that he was concurrently registered at both the Floyd Street address and the Buena Vista address between 1987 and 1992 and (2) that defendant mistakenly believed that he was not using the Fifth Street address \u201cas a residence.\u201d The court concluded that the instruction was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Notably, defendant\u2019s trial counsel also referred to the charged offense in his closing argument as a failure to \u201creregister\u201d or to \u201cupdate\u201d the registration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
