J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">Plaintiff California Medical Association, Inc. (CMA) appeals a judgment dismissing this lawsuit after the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of defendants Aetna U.S. Healthcare of California, Inc., et al.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to CMA\u2019s second amended complaint. CMA contends the court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrers to CMA\u2019s second amended complaint\u2019s claim for the reasonable value of services rendered (quasi-contract) and to CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s claims for violation of Health and Safety Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 1371<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and unlawful practices under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (the unfair competition law\u2014UCL).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In July 1999, as the assignee of claims assertedly owned by various physicians and medical groups (together Physicians), CM A brought this lawsuit seeking recovery from defendants of payments allegedly owed to Physicians for services provided by Physicians to enrollees in health care service plans<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> operated by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">For purposes of determining the propriety of the orders sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrers to CMA\u2019s claims for violation of section 1371, unlawful practices under the UCL and quasi-contract, we state the facts properly alleged by CMA in its first and second amended complaints. <em>(Orange Unified School Dist. v. Rancho Santiago Community College Dist. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 750, 757 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 778]; <em>Ellenberger v. Espinosa </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 943, 947 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 360].)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Defendants were licensed by the DOC to arrange for the provision of health services and to enter into agreements to provide such services. In operating their health care service plans, defendants entered into \u201cDefendant-Enrollee Agreements\u201d with their enrollees that imposed obligations upon defendants to pay for services rendered by Physicians to those enrollees. Defendants also entered into \u201cDefendant-Intermediary Agreements\u201d with various contracting entities including large medical groups, independent practice associations and limited Knox-Keene license plans (together Intermediaries). Under those Defendant-Intermediary Agreements, defendants paid their agent Intermediaries to perform specific tasks on defendants\u2019 behalf, including managing and arranging for medical services for defendants\u2019 enrollees by signing up panels of primary care and specialty physicians, processing claims and making payments to the physicians providing such services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In turn, Intermediaries entered into \u201cIntermediary-Physician Agreements\u201d with Physicians to provide health services to defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>enrollees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Physicians\u2019 access to the majority of insured patients in the state depended upon Physicians\u2019 participation in managed care plans. To participate in the managed care plans offered by defendants, Physicians were required to enter into the Intermediary-Physician Agreements or otherwise be accepted onto panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Upon providing covered medical services to defendants\u2019 enrollees, Physicians submitted to defendants via Intermediaries uncontested claims for such services. However, due to their actual or imminent insolvency, many Intermediaries failed to pay Physicians for those services. Not having any control over Intermediaries\u2019 business practices or financial stability, Physicians depended upon defendants to ensure that Intermediaries were financially stable and capable of paying Physicians for services rendered to defendants\u2019 enrollees. Nonetheless, despite knowing that Intermediaries were financially unstable and unable to pay Physicians, defendants maintained their contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and continued to make payments to Intermediaries. Further, although continuing to receive premiums from their enrollees, defendants declined Physicians\u2019 numerous demands for payments for services rendered to such enrollees.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">CMA\u2019s first amended complaint, filed in September 1999, sought to state various claims based upon defendants\u2019 alleged statutory violations and contractual breaches. In particular, CMA alleged defendants did not comply with their obligations under section 1371 to reimburse Physicians in a timely manner for uncontested claims for health services provided by Physicians to defendants\u2019 enrollees. CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s prayer sought compensatory damages, restitution, injunctive relief and declaratory relief. In January 2000, in sustaining without leave to amend defendants\u2019 demurrer to CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s claim for violation of section 1371 and its derivative claim for unlawful practices under the UCL, the superior court concluded section 1371 did not create the duties alleged by CMA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer to CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s claims for breach of express contract, breach of implied contract, and breach of third party beneficiary contracts (to wit, the Defendant-Enrollee Agreements and the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements), the superior court granted CMA leave to amend to attempt to allege a claim for quasi-contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Later in January 2000, CMA filed a second amended complaint seeking to state a quasi-contract claim against defendants for recovery of the amount of the reasonable value of services rendered to defendants\u2019 enrollees by Physicians. In May 2000, in sustaining without leave to amend defendants\u2019 demurrer to CMA\u2019s second amended complaint for quasi-contract, the superior court rejected CMA\u2019s argument that it had pleaded facts bearing on \u201cthe relative relationship\u201d of Intermediaries with defendants \u201con the one hand\u201d and the \u201crelationship\u201d of Intermediaries with Physicians \u201con the other\u201d sufficient to show that defendants were unjustly enriched. Later that month, the court dismissed CMA\u2019s action in its entirety. CMA appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Seeking reversal of the judgment of dismissal, CMA contends the superior court should have concluded that CMA adequately pleaded that defendants abdicated their alleged obligations under Knox-Keene and principles of equity to \u201carrange for the provision of health care services\u201d by not reimbursing Physicians for providing medically necessary services to defendants\u2019 enrollees when Intermediaries became insolvent. Further, asserting Knox-Keene \u201cunequivocally mandates\u201d appropriate reimbursement to Physicians as the providers under contract of covered medical services to defendants\u2019 enrollees, CMA contends the ultimate responsibility for payment for such services rested with defendants, despite any agreements to the contrary that defendants had demanded from Intermediaries and Physicians. CMA also faults the superior court for relying upon an interpretation of law issued by the DOC, an administrative agency no longer having regulatory authority over defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude the superior court properly sustained defendants\u2019 demurrers and dismissed CMA\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\n<em>CMA\u2019s Claim for Defendants\u2019 Alleged Violation of Section 1371</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\n<em>The Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">At relevant times, section 1371 provided in pertinant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201cA health care service plan, including a specialized health care service plan, shall reimburse claims or any portion of any claim, whether in state or out of state, as soon as practical, but no later than 30 working days after receipt of the claim by the health care service plan, or if the health care service plan is a health maintenance organization, 45 working days after receipt of the claim by the health care service plan, unless the claim or portion thereof is contested by the plan in which case the claimant shall be notified, in writing, that the claim is contested or denied, within 30 working days after receipt of the claim by the health care service plan, or if the health care service plan is a health maintenance organization, 45 working days after receipt of the claim by the health care service plan.

Specifically, CMA asserts that despite defendants\u2019 risk-shifting agreements with Intermediaries, defendants remained obligated to Physicians under the plain language of section 1371\u2019s last paragraph (the statutory nonwaiver clause) to pay claims for those services and could not delegate those obligations to the Intermediaries. In that vein, CMA asserts section 1371 voided any language in the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements purporting to shift from defendants to Intermediaries the ultimate responsibility to pay Physicians\u2019 claims. Similarly, CMA asserts section 1371 voided the \u201cunfair\u201d language in the \u201cadhesive\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cunconscionable\u201d Intermediary-Physician Agreements requiring Physicians to \u201clook solely\u201d to Intermediaries for payment. CMA characterizes those various contractual provisions as \u201coverreaching\u201d attempts to render Physicians remediless and guarantee that Physicians would never receive any payment from defendants. CMA also asserts the legislative and enforcement history of Knox-Keene indicates defendants were ultimately responsible for paying Physicians. CMA further asserts that Knox-Keene \u201cunequivocally\u201d imposed upon defendants the duty to be a \u201cguarantor\u201d for payment for all covered services.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Preliminarily, we note that any standing CMA has to seek enforcement of section 1371 appears to be limited. CMA does not have a \u201cgeneral power to enforce\u201d Knox-Keene. <em>(Samura </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1299 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 20].) Instead, such \u201cpower has been entrusted exclusively\u201d to the DOC and now to the DMHC, \u201cpreempting even the common law powers of the Attorney General.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nevertheless, \u201cdespite the existence of a statutory enforcement scheme, [CMA] may still sue to enjoin acts which are made unlawful by the Knox-Keene Act.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In any event, as we shall explain, CMA\u2019s first amended complaint did not allege facts sufficient to establish a violation of section 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The issue whether section 1371\u2019s statutory nonwaiver clause imposed an ultimate payment obligation upon defendants is a question of law. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].) We conclude such statutory nonwaiver clause did not preclude defendants from contractually delegating through the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements any alleged payment obligation to Physicians.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, we find nothing in the statutory nonwaiver clause negating the provisions in the Intermediary-Physician Agreements requiring Physicians to \u201clook solely\u201d to Intermediaries for payments for covered medical services rendered by Physicians to defendants\u2019 enrollees. On the contrary, when construed in the statutory framework of the remainder of section 1371 and other portions of Knox-Keene <em>(People v. Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129]; <em>Curle v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1057, 1063 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 16 P.3d 166]), the statutory nonwaiver clause simply means that section 1371\u2019s time limits and other procedural requirements must be satisfied even when health plans have delegated their payment obligations to contracting entities under risk-shifting agreements consistent with other Knox-Keene provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>In that vein, the Legislature has specifically approved of various risk-shifting arrangements including capitation payments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In particular, section 1348.6, enacted by the Legislature in the same year that the statutory nonwaiver clause was added to section 1371, expressly permits \u201cgeneral payments, such as capitation payments, or shared-risk arrangements\u201d under specified circumstances. (\u00a7 1348.6, subd. (b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> added by Stats. 1996, ch. 1014, \u00a7 2.) Similarly, administrative regulations contemplate the contractual shifting of financial risk from health plans to other risk-bearing entities. (E.g., 28 Cal. Code Regs., \u00a7 1300.76, subd. (b)(3)(A) &amp; (B) [services paid for on a capitated basis are excluded when calculating a health plan\u2019s required tangible net equity].) Indeed, CMA expressly acknowledges that \u201c \u2018risk-bearing organizations\u2019 may accept some risk for the provision of professional services as they may accept capitated payments.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s acknowledgement of such risk-shifting arrangements is also reflected by recent amendments to Knox-Keene imposing stricter regulations on such arrangements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Further, our construction of section 1371 is consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history. As originally enacted in 1986, section 1371 simply imposed certain procedural requirements, including time frames, on the processing of claims. In that vein, a legislative committee analysis of the bill adding section 1371 to Knox-Keene described the bill\u2019s purpose as to specify a time period for payment of claims since existing law simply required that health plans enact procedures for prompt payment or denial. (Stats. 1986, ch. 957, \u00a7 1; see Dept, of Corp., denial of petn. by Cal. Medical Assn, to adopt Cal. Code Regs., former tit. 10, \u00a7 1300.75 (Dec. 29, 1998), citing Sen. Ins., Claims and Corp. Com., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4206 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 30, 1986.) CMA has not identified anything in the legislative history indicating that section 1371 was intended to impose an obligation on health plans to pay treating physicians where the plans had no contractual obligation to do so. Further, the legislative history of the 1996 amendment adding the statutory nonwaiver clause to section 1371 indicates such clause was intended simply to require contracting entities such as Intermediaries to make timely compliance with the statute\u2019s procedures for handling claims. (Stats. 1996, ch. 711, \u00a7 1. Specifically, the Legislature intended to motivate health care service plans to require their contracting entities to comply with section 1371 by subjecting the plans to disciplinary action and penalties for those contracting entities\u2019 failures. (Assem. Com. on Health, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1478 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) June 19, 1996, p. 2.) CMA has not identified anything in the legislative history indicating that section 1371\u2019s statutory nonwaiver clause was intended to establish a requirement that health plans must pay treating physicians where the plans are not contractually obligated to do so or that health plans were to be guarantors of any intermediary\u2019s contractual obligations to pay those treating physicians. Moreover, recent amendments to section 1371 involving payment of interest on claims are consistent with our interpretation of the statute as merely imposing procedural requirements on claim processing. (Stats. 2000, ch. 825, \u00a7 3; Stats. 2000, ch. 827, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, our construction of section 1371 is also consistent with the DOC\u2019s decision, cited by the superior court, that denied CMA\u2019s request for a regulation to make health plans the primary obligors for payment of claims notwithstanding contractual provisions to the contrary. (Dept, of Corp., denial of petn. by Cal. Medical Assn, to adopt Cal. Code Regs., former tit. 10, \u00a7 1300.75 (Dec. 29, 1998); see \u00a7 1341.14, subd. (a).) The DOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>concluded \u201cthe plain meaning of Section 1371 does not require a plan to assume liability for the payment of a claim where no such liability otherwise exists.\u201d The DOC also concluded the statute \u201cdoes not create liability for the payment of claims that a plan is otherwise not responsible for paying\u201d or \u201coverride all contractual agreements as to liability for payment that providers have entered into with other entities.\u201d The DOC further concluded that section 1371\u2019s effect with respect to health plans was only to impose a time frame for payment of claims when those plans were contractually obligated to pay such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>CMA\u2019s Contentions Lack Merit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">A conclusion contrary to our construction of section 1371 is not supported by anything in other provisions of Knox-Keene or various administrative regulations cited by CMA. First, CMA contends that section 1349 prohibits Intermediaries from assuming defendants\u2019 financial responsibilities for payment of Physicians\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, section 1349 simply requires that health plans such as defendants\u2019 be licensed. Further, as discussed, various Knox-Keene provisions permit defendants by contract to shift financial risks to risk-bearing organizations such as Intermediaries. Moreover, CMA acknowledges the DOC has exempted contracting entities such as Intermediaries from the prohibitions of section 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Section 1375.1, subdivision (a)(2), relied upon by CMA, provides that each health care service plan must demonstrate to the state that it has \u201c[a]ssumed full financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of covered health care services . . . .\u201d Section 1375.1, subdivision (b)(1), also relied upon by CMA, provides that in determining whether the conditions of such statute have been met, the state may consider the \u201cfinancial soundness of the plan\u2019s arrangements for health care services . . . .\u201d However, although noncompliance with those statutory requirements bearing on the relationship between a health plan and the state may subject defendants to discipline by the state, nothing in the statutes imposes upon defendants the financial liability to Physicians alleged by CMA in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">CMA characterizes the second sentence of section 1375.4, subdivision (g)(1)(C) as clarifying that any delegation of payment obligations to Intermediaries did not abrogate defendants\u2019 alleged \u201cpre-existing duty to pay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Physicians.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, as expressly indicated by section 1375.4, subdivision (a), the contractual provisions required by such statute apply only to agreements between health plans and risk-bearing organizations \u201cissued, amended, renewed, or delivered in this state on or after July 1, 2000\u201d and became effective only \u201cas of January 1, 2001.\u201d Since the judgment in this lawsuit was entered in May 2000, section 1375.4 is not relevant to CMA\u2019s current claims. Moreover, in any event, CMA misconstrues the second sentence of subparagraph (C) of the statute\u2019s subdivision (g)(1) as purportedly affirming that at all relevant times and under all circumstances defendants had a nondelegable obligation to pay Physicians. Reasonably read, such sentence simply states that subparagraph (C) has no effect whatsoever on defendants\u2019 responsibility, if any, under existing law. In that vein, although asserting that defendants had a nondelegable \u201cpre-existing duty to pay\u201d Physicians, CMA has not alleged facts sufficient to establish the existence of any such underlying legal responsibility. Specifically, under the contractual framework alleged by CMA, nothing in section 1371 imposed upon defendants a duty to pay Physicians directly if Intermediaries failed to do so. Further, CMA has not pleaded that defendants and Physicians entered into any contract imposing upon defendants any obligation to pay Physicians\u2019 claims under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">CMA contends section 1371.37, subdivision (c)(3) will prohibit health plans from engaging in the \u201cprecise\u201d unfair payment pattern assertedly alleged here, to wit, the failure on a repeated basis to pay uncontested claims.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> CMA also contends subdivision (g) of section 1371.37 will prohibit health plans from shifting ultimate payment responsibilities to others.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, as CMA essentially acknowledges, section 1371.37 does not apply to this lawsuit because such statute did not become effective until January 1, 2001, well after judgment here. In any event, section 1371.37 does not purport to establish or affirm the existence of any underlying obligation on the part of health plans to pay treating physicians for services under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>contractual framework alleged here. Instead, the statute simply prohibits certain conduct by health plans in derogation of various statutory time requirements in processing and reimbursing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">CMA also relies on California Code of Regulations, title 28, section 1300.70, subdivision (b)(2)(H)!, part of the DMHC\u2019s health care service plan quality assurance program. Such regulation provides: \u201cA plan that has capitation or risk-sharing contracts must: HQ . . . Ensure that each contracting provider has the administrative and financial capacity to meet its contractual obligations . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the benefits of the DMHC\u2019s quality assurance regulations appear directed to the enrollees of defendants\u2019 health plans, not to Physicians as the providers of services to those enrollees. In any event, although noncompliance with the DMHC\u2019s quality assurance regulations might subject defendants to discipline by the state, nothing in the specific regulation cited by CMA imposes upon defendants the financial liability to Physicians alleged in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">CMA additionally contends that California Code of Regulations, title 28, section 1300.51 imposes upon defendants an obligation to ensure that their capitated payments to Intermediaries are actuarially sound and thus adequate to cover the costs of medical services provided by Physicians. In that vein, CMA contends defendants did not ensure that Intermediaries were financially stable and capable of paying Physicians for services rendered to defendants\u2019 enrollees but instead virtually assured Intermediaries\u2019 financial insolvency by not providing Intermediaries with sufficient funds to pay for the costs of services assertedly incurred on defendants\u2019 behalf. However, CMA has not identified anything in such regulation imposing upon defendants the financial liability to Physicians alleged by CMA in this lawsuit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Finally, we reject CMA\u2019s various claims based upon the theory that section 1371 assertedly voided the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements and the Intermediary-Physician Agreements. Preliminarily, we note that as strangers to the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements, Physicians and their assignee CMA have no standing to challenge those agreements. Similarly, with respect to the Intermediary-Physician Agreements, any actionable claim potentially available to CMA as Physicians\u2019 assignee would lie not against defendants but instead against Intermediaries, nonparties to this lawsuit. In any event, as discussed, nothing in section 1371 precluded the risk-shifting arrangement effected by the contractual framework alleged by CMA in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Contrary to CMA\u2019s contentions, nothing in section 1371 or elsewhere in Knox-Keene expressly provides that defendants were the only entities legally authorized to assume the financial risk for payments to Physicians for services provided to the enrollees in defendants\u2019 health plans or that defendants were otherwise prohibited from contracting with Intermediaries to bear the ultimate risk for those payments. Mindful that section 1371 is part of a detailed and complex \u201ccomprehensive system of licensing and regulation\u201d <em>(Van de Kamp v. Gumbiner, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1284), we decline to conclude that section 1371 or its statutory nonwaiver clause in particular implicitly shifted in the manner suggested by CMA the various alleged contractual obligations and attendant financial risks among defendants, Intermediaries and Physicians. If the Legislature had intended to effect such purported major structural change in the existing highly regulated health care finance and delivery schemes, such intent would have been expressly reflected in the text of section 1371 or its legislative history. (Cf. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Capital Growth Investors XIV </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1168 [278 Cal.Rptr. 614, 805 P.2d 873].)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We thus conclude that under the contractual framework alleged by CMA where Intermediaries as risk-bearing organizations have agreed with defendants to be solely responsible for paying Physicians as the providers of medical services rendered to defendants\u2019 health plans\u2019 enrollees and, in turn, Physicians have agreed to look solely to Intermediaries for such payments, nothing in section 1371 imposed an independent obligation upon defendants to pay Physicians directly if Intermediaries failed to do so after defendants had already paid Intermediaries for Physician\u2019s services. Further, as discussed, under the contractual framework alleged here, defendants had no contractual obligation to pay Physicians directly in such circumstances. Instead, under risk-shifting arrangements contemplated by various KnoxKeene provisions, defendants shifted to Intermediaries any such payment obligation. With respect to that payment obligation, section 1371 and its statutory nonwaiver clause simply impose upon defendants nonwaivable time limits and procedural requirements that must be satisfied even when such payment obligation has been shifted by contract to risk-bearing obligations such as Intermediaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>In sum, under the allegations of CMA\u2019s pleadings, defendants as a matter of law had no liability, whether statutory or contractual, to pay Physicians directly for services rendered by Physicians to enrollees in defendants\u2019 health plans if Intermediaries failed to make such payment after defendants had already paid Intermediaries for Physicians\u2019 services. Accordingly, we conclude the superior court properly sustained without leave to amend defendants\u2019 demurrer to CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s claim for violation of section 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\n<em>CMA\u2019s Claim for Defendants\u2019 Alleged Unlawful Practices Under the UCL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s claim for unlawful practices in violation of the UCL alleged: Defendants required waivers from Physicians and insisted that Physicians \u201clook only\u201d to Intermediaries for payment for services rendered by Physicians to defendants\u2019 enrollees and subscribers; defendants\u2019 requiring such waivers from Physicians and failing to pay Physicians for those services constituted an unfair business practice; and as a result of such conduct, defendants have been unjustly enriched by their receipt of millions of dollars in health premiums from enrollees and subscribers. In sustaining without leave to amend defendants\u2019 demurrer to CMA\u2019s first amended complaint\u2019s claim for violation of section 1371 and its derivative claim for unlawful practices under the UCL, the superior court concluded section 1371 did not create the duties alleged by CMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">CMA contends the superior court erred in sustaining without leave to amend Defendants\u2019 demurrer to CMA\u2019s claim against defendants for UCL violations. Specifically, CMA asserts defendants engaged in \u201cunlawful\u201d/ \u201cunfair\u201d business practices under Knox-Keene and particularly under Health and Safety Code section 1371 by refusing to reimburse Physicians fully for millions of dollars of medically necessary services provided to defendants\u2019 enrollees while defendants forced Intermediaries into insolvency through inadequate capitation rates, continued to pay Intermediaries despite knowledge of such insolvency, and continued to accept from the enrollees/subscribers premiums that should have provided the required financing. Similarly, CMA asserts defendants engaged in \u201cunlawful\u201d/\u201cunfair\u201d business practices under Health and Safety Code section 1371 and Civil Code section 3513<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> by requiring Physicians to enter into the Intermediary-Physician Agreements where Physicians agreed to waive their purported rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>payments from defendants and to rely instead on the financial capacity of Intermediaries. However, CMA has not shown the superior court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer to its UCL claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Although Business and Professions Code section 17200 does not confer on private party CMA a general power to enforce Knox-Keene, CMA may nonetheless sue to enjoin acts made unlawful by Knox-Keene. <em>(Samura </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1299.) As noted by the appellate court in <em>Samura, </em>\u201cother decisions have upheld use of Business and Professions Code section 17200 to enjoin acts which are declared to be unlawful under a statutory enforcement scheme.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, as discussed at length, defendants\u2019 business practices alleged to be unlawful and unfair by CMA did not violate the Knox-Keene statutory enforcement scheme. Specifically, under the contractual framework alleged here, nothing in Health and Safety Code section 1371 or elsewhere in Knox-Keene imposed an obligation on defendants to pay Physicians directly if Intermediaries failed to do so after defendants had already paid Intermediaries for Physicians\u2019 services. Further, by means of risk-shifting arrangements contemplated by various Knox-Keene provisions, to wit, the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements, defendants shifted to Intermediaries any payment obligations owed to Physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Where, as here, the Legislature has permitted certain conduct, \u201ccourts may not override that determination\u201d by declaring such conduct to be actionable under Business and Professions Code section 17200. <em>(Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v.

Additionally, the \u201cunfairness term\u201d of Business and Professions Code section 17200 \u201cdoes not give the courts a general license to review the fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of contracts . . . .\u201d <em>(Samura, v.

More specifically, CMA contends defendants have unjustly retained indisputable benefits received from Physicians\u2019 providing uncompensated services to defendants\u2019 enrollees given that defendants\u2019 \u201ccore function\u201d under section 1345, subdivision (f)(1) was assertedly to arrange and pay for health care in a continuous and accessible manner. CMA further contends defendants directly benefited financially from Physicians\u2019 unpaid provision of care since defendants were thus relieved of the obligation to pay noncontracting physicians at nondiscounted rates. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 28, \u00a7 1300.75.1.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, CMA contends Physicians did not voluntarily choose to enter into the Intermediary-Physician Agreements but instead, in order to gain access to defendants\u2019 enrollees/subscribers, Physicians were forced to contract with Intermediaries under arrangements that \u201cinure\u201d not to Physicians but rather to defendants. Additionally, CMA contends defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>did nothing to eliminate the risk that Physicians would not be paid but instead forced Physicians into financial distress and created continuity of care problems for defendants\u2019 enrollees by not following the obligations assertedly imposed on defendants by Knox-Keene to assure Intermediaries\u2019 financial solvency, not making adequate payments to Intermediaries, not monitoring Intermediaries\u2019 financial affairs to ensure Intermediaries were able to pay Physicians, and permitting Physicians to remain unpaid. CMA thus concludes that under a balance of the equities, it would be fundamentally unfair for Physicians not to be paid by defendants for the reasonable value of the services provided by Physicians to defendants\u2019 enrollees.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">However, as a matter of law, a quasi-contract action for unjust enrichment does not lie where, as here, express binding agreements exist and define the parties\u2019 rights. (Cf. <em>Eisenberg v. Alameda Newspapers, Inc. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1387 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 802];<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v.

Thus, CMA may not proceed on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>quasi-contract claim because the subject matter of such claim, to wit, whether Physicians were entitled to compensation from defendants, was governed by express contracts including the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements and Defendant-Enrollee Agreements (as specifically alleged in CMA\u2019s second amended complaint) as well as the Intermediary-Physician Agreements (as argued in CMA\u2019s opening brief). <em>(Eisenberg, </em>at p. 1387; <em>Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp., </em>at p. 203; <em>Hedging Concepts, Inc., </em>at pp. 1419-1420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Further, the record indicates that CMA is improperly seeking to proceed on a quasi-contract claim only after trying unsuccessfully by its first amended complaint to enforce various express contracts against defendants directly. (Cf. <em>Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 203; <em>Hedging Concepts, Inc. v. First Alliance Mortgage Co., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1419-1420.) Specifically, after alleging that the portions of the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements intended to limit Physicians to seeking compensation only from Intermediaries were void and unenforceable as violating section 1371 and public policy, CMA\u2019s first amended complaint sought recovery from defendants for assertedly breaching other terms of those Defendant-Intermediary Agreements by not paying Physicians the value of the services rendered by Physicians to defendants\u2019 enrollee/subscribers. Further, CMA\u2019s first amended complaint also sought recovery directly from defendants on a third party beneficiary theory for breaching the terms of the express Defendant-Intermediary Agreements and the express Defendant-Enrollee Agreements by not paying Physicians the value of those services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Moreover, since Physicians were strangers to the Defendant-Intermediary Agreements and the Defendant-Enrollee Agreements, CMA as Physicians\u2019 assignee lacks standing to the extent it now attempts through its quasi-contract claim either to affirm or to void any portion of those contracts. Similarly, as discussed, any attempt by CMA to affirm or void a portion of the Intermediary-Physician Agreements through its quasi-contract claim is misdirected as targeted only toward defendants who are nonparties to such agreements. In any event, as discussed, nothing in section 1371 or elsewhere in Knox-Keene precluded the risk-shifting arrangement effected by the contractual framework alleged by CMA in this lawsuit or otherwise obligated defendants to guarantee payment to Physicians for services rendered to defendants\u2019 enrollees if Intermediaries failed to pay Physicians after defendants had made payments to Intermediaries for those services. (Cf. <em>Ghirardo v. Antonioli, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 51; <em>First Nationwide Savings v.
