J.</author>\n<p id=\"A045\">Gilberto Sandoval, Carolina Sandoval, Daniel Sandoval and Samuel Sandoval (together Sandoval), by and through their guardian ad litem Dana Sandoval, appeal a judgment after jury trial favoring defendant Bank of America NT &amp; SA (Bank) on Sandoval\u2019s wrongful death complaint for premises liability negligence. Sandoval contends that with respect to the test of the legal causation element of negligence, the court gave the jury erroneous instructions, a special verdict form containing an erroneous question, and an erroneous answer to the jurors\u2019 written inquiry about such question during deliberation. Concluding the court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry during deliberation was prejudicially erroneous as not comporting with case law bearing on causation, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">While Sandoval\u2019s decedent was walking from the parking lot of the Bank\u2019s North Park branch toward the branch\u2019s office, an unknown man ran up to him, grabbed his briefcase and tried to pull the briefcase away from him. Sandoval\u2019s decedent resisted and a struggle ensued. The assailant then shot Sandoval\u2019s decedent several times. The assailant fled with the briefcase and was never apprehended. Sandoval\u2019s decedent collapsed and later died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number> Sandoval sued the Bank, alleging the Bank\u2019s negligence caused the death of Sandoval\u2019s decedent. <em>(Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 123-124 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653] <em>(Isaacs); \u00d1ola M. </em>v. <em>University of Southern California </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 421, 426 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 97] <em>(Nola M.).)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sandoval proceeded on the theory that despite numerous prior robberies on or adjacent to its premises, the Bank failed to provide adequate security at the time Sandoval\u2019s decedent was attacked. At the time of the shooting, the Bank had one unarmed security guard inside the branch office. Sandoval\u2019s security expert opined at trial that if the Bank had stationed two armed off-duty police officers in the parking lot near the entranceway to the Bank, it would have prevented the crime against Sandoval\u2019s decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">The trial court gave the jury various instructions on the elements of negligence including legal causation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court submitted to the jury a special verdict form proposed by the Bank.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During deliberation, the jury sent the court a written inquiry about question No. 3 on the special verdict form: \u201cRegarding question 3, we have a question as to the meaning and/or intent of the use of the word would. In this question, we are assuming the use of the word would is an absolute. Meaning, if B of A had not been neglegent <em>[sic], </em>[decedent] would not have been assaulted, would not have been shot, would not have been killed. We further assume prevent means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>totally eliminate the assualt [sz'c], shooting and death. Is this the meaning of this question[?]\u201d After discussion with counsel, the court gave the jury a written reply simply saying \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">Ultimately, the jury returned a special verdict finding that (1) the property where Sandoval\u2019s decedent was assaulted, robbed and/or killed was in the Bank\u2019s ownership, possession and/or control; (2) the Bank was negligent in the management of the premises; but (3) the criminal assault on Sandoval\u2019s decedent would not have been prevented even if the Bank had acted non-negligently in managing the premises. Based upon the special verdict, the court entered judgment favoring the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">On appeal, Sandoval contends the challenged instructions, question No. 3 on the special verdict form and the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry about such question erroneously indicated that the test of the causation element of the tort of negligence was \u201cabsolute\u201d rather than the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d standard. We conclude that instead of dispelling the jurors\u2019 apparent confusion about the proper test of causation, the court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry about question No. 3 on the special verdict form served only to reinforce such confusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">In <em>Saelzler </em>v. <em>Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143] <em>(Saelzler), </em>a case decided while this appeal was pending, a plaintiff injured on the defendants\u2019 premises in a criminal assault by unknown assailants sought to recover damages from the defendants on the theory that the defendants breached their duty of care to her. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 772.) The Supreme Court stated that \u201cto prevail in such a case, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed her a legal duty of care, the defendant breached that duty, <em>and the breach was a proximate or legal cause of her </em>injury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court observed: \u201cActual causation is an entirely separate and independent element of the tort of negligence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 778.) Thus, the Supreme Court stated that even if \u201cthe defendant owed and breached a duty of care to the plaintiff,\u201d the plaintiff could not prevail without showing that \u201cthe breach bore a causal connection to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 773.) The Supreme Court also noted: \u201cNo matter how inexcusable a defendant\u2019s act or omission might appear, the plaintiff must nonetheless show the act or omission caused, or substantially contributed to, her injury. Otherwise, defendants might be held liable for conduct which actually caused no harm, contrary to the recognized policy against making landowners the <em>insurer </em>of the absolute safety of anyone entering their premises.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 780.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">In <em>Saelzler, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 763, in framing the issue of causation, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cWas defendants\u2019 possible breach of duty a substantial factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 772.) After discussing the \u201canalyses\u201d in cases it characterized as \u201cclose on point\u201d and \u201cinstructive\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 773), the Supreme Court concluded that despite the \u201cspeculative opinion\u201d of her expert, plaintiff Saelzler \u201ccannot show that defendants\u2019 failure to provide increased daytime security at each entrance gate or functioning locked gates was a substantial factor in causing her injuries. [Citations.] Put another way, she is unable to prove it was \u2018more probable than not\u2019 that additional security precautions would have prevented the attack.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 776, citing <em>Leslie G. v. Perry &amp; Associates </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 488 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 785] <em>(Leslie G.);</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 41, p. 269 [plaintiff must show it more likely than not defendant\u2019s conduct was cause in fact of the result; \u201cmere possibility of such causation is not enough\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">\u201cThe first element of legal cause is <em>cause in fact: </em>i.e., it is necessary to show that the defendant\u2019s negligence contributed in some way to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, so that \u2018but for\u2019 the defendant\u2019s negligence the injury would not have been sustained. If the accident would have happened anyway, whether the defendant was negligent or not, then his negligence was not a cause in fact, and of course cannot be the legal or responsible cause. The \u2018but for\u2019 rule has traditionally been applied to determine cause in fact. [Citations.] ffl] The Restatement formula uses the term <em>\u2018substantial </em>factor\u2019 \u2018to denote the fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause.\u2019 [Citation.] And \u2018the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.\u2019 \u201d (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 968, pp. 358-359.) The Supreme Court has observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>the \u201c \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test subsumes the \u2018but for\u2019 test. \u2018If the conduct which is claimed to have caused the injury had nothing at all to do with the injuries, it could not be said that the conduct was a factor, let alone a substantial factor, in the production of the injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mitchell v. Gonzales </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1041, 1052 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 913, 819 P.2d 872]; accord, <em>Nola M., </em>supra, 16 Cal.App.4th at p. 439; <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 495, 515 [238 Cal.Rptr. 436].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">\u201cIn California, the causation element of negligence is satisfied when the plaintiff establishes (1) that the defendant\u2019s breach of duty (his negligent act or omission) was a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff\u2019s harm and (2) that there is no rule of law relieving the defendant of liability.\u201d <em>(Leslie G., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 481; accord, <em>Rosh v. Cave Imaging Systems, Inc. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1235 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 136]; <em>Nola M., supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 427.) Here, no such rule of law relieved the Bank of liability. Instead, as observed by the appellate court in <em>Leslie G.: </em>\u201cIn the context of this case, the causation analysis is unaffected by the fact that the assailant\u2019s conduct was criminal and not merely negligent. Stated in traditional terms, the assailant\u2019s attack is not a superseding cause and it does not, in itself, relieve the defendant of liability. As our Supreme Court has explained, if the likelihood that a third person may act in a particular manner is \u2018 \u201cone of the hazards which makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Leslie G., </em>at p. 481; accord, <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>San Francisco Community College Dist. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799, 812 [205 Cal.Rptr. 842, 685 P.2d 1193] [\u201cintervening criminal conduct cannot absolve the defendant of liability where as here the plaintiff alleges that defendants maintained the property in such a way so as to increase the risk of criminal activity\u201d]; <em>\u00d1ola M., </em>at p. 427 [\u201cStated in traditional terms, the assailant\u2019s attack is not a superseding cause and it does not relieve [defendant] of liability.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">In sum, at trial Sandoval was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Bank\u2019s alleged negligence \u201cwas an actual, legal cause\u201d of Sandoval\u2019s decedent\u2019s injuries. <em>(Saelzler, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 769.) To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>\u201cdemonstrate\u201d such \u201cactual or legal causation,\u201d Sandoval was required to show that the Bank\u2019s negligence \u201cwas a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in bringing about the injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 778.) Further, to demonstrate that the Bank\u2019s negligence constituted a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, Sandoval was required to show \u201cit was \u2018more probable than not\u2019 that additional security precautions would have prevented the attack.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 776; <em>Leslie G., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Preliminarily, we note that Sandoval has contended the court\u2019s assertedly erroneous use of the concept of \u201cprevention\u201d in the challenged jury instructions and question No. 3 of the special verdict form confused the jury by directly conflicting with the substantial factor test of causation properly communicated to the jury under another instruction. However, for purposes of this appeal, we deem the challenged instructions and question No. 3 on the special verdict form not to have been improper. The concept of prevention used in the challenged instructions and question No. 3 on the special verdict form appears consistent with ample case law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, the court properly instructed the jury on the elements of negligence generally, the substantial factor test of causation, the burden of proof standard of preponderance of the evidence, and concurrent causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>Nonetheless, on this record the judgment must be reversed. As noted, the jury found the Bank was negligent in the management of its premises. Such finding suggests the jurors believed that \u201cby reason of the prior criminal assaults and incidents\u201d on such premises, the Bank \u201cowed a duty to provide a reasonable degree of security to persons entering them\u201d and breached such duty. <em>(Saelzler, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 775.) Although a properly instructed jury\u2019s ensuing finding that the Bank\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide increased security despite the foreseeability of assaults\u201d did not \u201cactually cause[]\u201d Sandoval\u2019s decedent\u2019s injuries might have been proper <em>(id. </em>at p. 777), the record indicates the jurors were confused by the applicable test of causation as manifested by their inquiry to the court during deliberation about the meaning of certain language in question No. 3 on the special verdict form. However, despite having given other proper instructions bearing on the causation element of negligence, the court prejudicially erred in not correctly explaining causation in replying to the jury\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">As discussed, at trial Sandoval was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the Bank\u2019s alleged negligence was an actual, legal cause of Sandoval\u2019s decedent\u2019s injury; to demonstrate such actual or legal causation, Sandoval was required to show that the Bank\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury; and to demonstrate that the Bank\u2019s negligence constituted a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, Sandoval was required to show it was more probable than not that additional security precautions would have prevented the attack. <em>(Saelzler, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 769, 776, 778; <em>Leslie G., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 488.) However, in answering the jury\u2019s inquiry about the special verdict form\u2019s question No. 3\u2019s use of the word \u201cwould,\u201d the court did not convey to the jurors that the law required Sandoval to show only that the security measures proposed by Sandoval\u2019s security expert would more likely than not have prevented the attack on Sandoval\u2019s decedent. Instead, by simply replying \u201cyes\u201d to the jury\u2019s inquiry, the court told the jury that the law required Sandoval to show that such security measures would absolutely have prevented an attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">In sum, the jury should have been told that if a preponderance of the evidence showed it was more likely than not that proper security by the Bank would have prevented the harm to Sandoval\u2019s decedent, the Bank\u2019s negligence in not providing such security would constitute a substantial factor in bringing about Sandoval\u2019s harm and thus form the requisite cause in fact of such harm. <em>(Saelzler, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 769, 776, 778; <em>Leslie G., supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 488.)  However, instead of telling the jury that, for purposes of imposing liability on the Bank, the test of causation required that it be more likely than not that the criminal assault on Sandoval\u2019s decedent would have been prevented absent the Bank\u2019s negligence, the court effectively contradicted its proper instruction on the substantial factor standard and left the jury in its state of confusion. <em>(LeMons v. Regents of University of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 869, 877-878 [148 Cal.Rptr. 355, 582 P.2d 946] <em>(LeMons).)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Finally, the court\u2019s erroneous answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry during deliberation was prejudicial to plaintiff Sandoval. <em>(LeMons, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 875-878; <em>Krouse, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 72-73; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 125, 152-153 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 643] <em>(Scott); McLaughlin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1158-1159.) Among the factors properly considered in assessing the prejudice of the court\u2019s error are the jury\u2019s request for \u201cclarification\u201d of question No. 3 on the special verdict form, the \u201ceffect of other instructions in remedying the error\u201d and \u201cthe closeness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 152, citing <em>LeMons, </em>at p. 876.) Here, the jury\u2019s inquiry reflected the jurors\u2019 confusion on the test of the causation element of the tort of negligence. <em>(LeMons, </em>at p. 876; <em>Scott, </em>at p. 152.) However, the \u201cjurors\u2019 confusion was not remedied either by the court\u2019s [answer] in response to their query or by other instructions.\u201d <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 152; see <em>Krouse, </em>at p. 73.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) Instead, by misstating the test of causation in its answer to such inquiry, the court raised the bar to an impossibly high level for Sandoval because very little in human affairs is absolutely certain. <em>(Campbell v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 112, 120 [184 Cal.Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224, 35 A.L.R.4th 1036].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> More particularly, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>required Sandoval to eliminate any possibility that the attack on Sandoval\u2019s decedent would have occurred even if the proper security had been provided. Thus, any remotely possible scenario imagined by the jury, no matter how unlikely, would defeat liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hence, the court\u2019s erroneous answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry imposed on Sandoval a standard impossible to meet. Further, the jury\u2019s verdict was close, with three jurors answering in Sandoval\u2019s favor question No. 3 on the special verdict form. (LeMons, at pp. 876-877; <em>Scott, </em>at pp. 152-153.) Accordingly, since on this record it is more likely than not that an outcome more favorable to Sandoval would have resulted at trial absent the court\u2019s erroneous answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry during deliberation, the judgment must be reversed. <em>(People v.
