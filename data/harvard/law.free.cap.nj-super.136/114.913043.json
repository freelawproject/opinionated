A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ate\">In July 1973, under the authority delegated to him to \u201cpromulgate such rules and regulations * <em>* </em>* as may be necessary\u201d to \u201caccomplish the objectives and to carry out the duties prescribed\u201d by the Consumers Fraud Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq., </em>the Attorney General adopted a set of rules \u201cconcerning motor vehicle advertising practices.\u201d 5 <em>N. J. R. </em>152 (2), 5 <em>N. J. R. </em>290 (b); <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:45A \u2014 2.2. Among the motor vehicle advertising practices declared to be \u201cunlawful\u201d by those rules was the following <em>(N. J. A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a) (2) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">ii. The failure in any price advertisement to disclose * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-14\"><em>% </em>sjo</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-15\">(4) The <em>Iona fide </em>odometer reading of any specifically advertised <em>* </em>* * used car. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>So far as here pertinent, a \u201cprice advertisement\u201d is defined as \u201cany advertisement [of a motor vehicle] in which a specified price is stated\u201d. <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:45A-2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Appellant Joseph Friedman owns and operates an advertising agency under the firm name Friedman Associates. Among his clientele during the period critical to this proceeding were some 30 to 35 separate retail automobile dealers, for whom he prepared and delivered to local newspapers for publication advertisements numbering an estimated \u201c100 individual ads per day\u201d. The essential factual details to be included in the advertisements were supplied to \u2022 Friedman Associates by the respective automobile dealers, from which the advertisements would be prepared by a member of the Friedman staff and then delivered by the latter to the newspaper for publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On December 14, 1973, there was published in the <em>Newark Star </em>Ledger, under the name of Kay American Jeep, an advertisement offering for sale a used motor vehicle for a stated price. The advertisement, concededly prepared by Friedman Associates on behalf of Kay, did not set forth the odometer reading of the advertised vehicle. As a result the Division of Consumer Affairs issued its complaint and notice of hearing to Kay American Jeep, charging a violation of <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2(a) (2) (ii) (4) in failing \u201cto disclose the BONA FIDE Odometer reading of any specifically advertised * * * used motor vehicle\u201d in \u201ca price advertisement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">At the hearing held March 13, 1974 Mr. Friedman appeared in company with a representative of Kay American Jeep, both without counsel. After consenting to the joinder of himself as a party respondent to the proceedings, Friedman admitted to the hearing officer that the offending advertisement had been prepared by Friedman Associates; that the odometer reading of the advertised vehicle had in fact been furnished to Friedman Associates by Kay, and that the omission of the odometer reading from the advertise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ment was due entirely to the oversight of Friedman Associates. The representative of Kay corroborated Friedman. Ho other witnesses were called by either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing the hearing officer found both Kay American Jeep and Mr. Friedman \u201cguilty of violating the rule [regulation]\u201d, and by order of March 15, 1974 assessed a fine of $150 and $50 costs against them jointly and severally, and directed that each \u201cthereafter cease and desist from failing to disclose in any price advertisement for a used motor vehicle * * * the bona fide odometer reading of said motor vehicle\u201d. The present appeal from that order has been taken by respondent Joseph Friedman.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">It is the contention of the respondent Friedman that there can be no violation of the act or the implementing regulations in the absence of intent, and inasmuch as it is uncontroverted that the omission of the odometer reading was inadvertent, the finding and order of the Division must be reversed. The Division takes the position that the language of the act, as well as the policy underlying it, make manifest a legislative purpose to prohibit the proscribed conduct and impose liability without regard to intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Manifestly, the design of the Consumer Fraud Act is to protect the consumer against imposition and loss as a result of fraud and fraudulent practices by persons engaged in the sale of goods and services. <em>Kugler v. </em>Romain, 58 <em>N. J. </em>522 (1971). The pertinent portion of the controlling section of that act is found in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56 :8-2, and provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any preson has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice <em>\u2022 * * *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In the context of this language it is plain that, however the fraud or fraudulent conduct may be designated or characterized, if it consists of or rests upon \u201cconcealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact\u201d, the nondisclosure must be \u201cknowing * * * [and] with intent that others rely\u201d thereon. <em>Ibid. </em>As a consequence, the nondisclosure of a material fact unknowingly and by reason of inadvertence does not constitute an unlawful practice under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Notwithstanding this clear expression of legislative intent the dissent suggests that, by virtue of the authority delegated to the Attorney General to promulgate regulations, he may declare the unknowing and inadvertent nondisclosure of a material fact to constitute an \u201cunconscionable commercial practice.\u201d The argument overlooks (and does not touch upon) the fact that such an interpretation would nullify absolutely and render completely meaningless the clause of the statute relating to fraud and fraudulent conduct arising out of the \u201cknowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact.\u201d The phrase \u201cunconscionable commercial practice\u201d has no special properties. In consumer goods transactions \u201cunconscionability must be equated with the concepts of deception, fraud, false pretense, misrepresentation, concealment and the like * * * stamped unlawful under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56 :8-2.\u201d <em>Kugler v. </em>Romain, <em>supra </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The legislative history of the Consumer Eraud Act supplies further evidence of the intent of the Legislature. As originally introduced, the portion of the section with which we are here concerned provided (Senate Bill No. 199, \u00a7 2) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">The act, use or employment of any deception, fraud, false pretense, misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact by any person in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice; * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Significantly, the concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact was constituted an unlawful practice without regard to knowledge or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">On passage in the Senate, however, the bill was amended in several respects, including the qualifications that the concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact had to be knowing and with intent that others rely thereon, in order to constitute an unlawful practice. As amended the pertinent portion road as follows (Senate Committee Amendments to Senate No. 199 \u2014 the added language being underlined, the deleted language being bracketed) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">The act, use or employment <em>ly any person </em>of any deception, fraud, false pretense, misrepresentation, <em>or the knowing </em>concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact [by any person] <em>with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, </em>in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The critical significance of the amendments needs no elaboration; it is manifestly self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">However broad the authority of the Attorney General to \u201cpromulgate such rules and regulations * * * as may be necessary\u201d to effectuate the purpose and policy of the act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-4, it does not extend to or authorize the promulgation of any regulation that would nullify and run counter to the express language and specific limitations of the statute from which that authority stems.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Cases such as <em>Dept. of Health v. Concrete Specialties, Inc., </em>112 N. <em>J. Super. </em>407 (App. Div. 1970), and <em>Grant Lunch Corp. v. Driscoll, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>408 (Sup. Ct. 1943), aff\u2019d o. b. 130 <em>N. J. L. </em>554 (E. &amp; A. 1943), <em>cert. </em>den. 320 <em>U. S. </em>801, 64 S. Ct. 431, 88 L. Ed. 4814 (1944), involving violations of air pollution control regulations and alcoholic beverage regulations dealing with sales to minors, respectively, are not here apposite. In neither instance did the underlying statutory authority expressly require that the proscribed conduct be \u201cknowing\u201d and intentional, as here. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>26 :2C \u2014 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>et seq.; N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1-1 <em>et seq. </em>Likewise the cases of <em>State v. Elmwood Terrace, Inc., </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>240 (App. Div. 1964), and <em>State v. Kinsley, </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>190 (Cty. Ct. 1968), aff\u2019d 105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>347 (App. Div. 1969), involving, respectively, violation of an ordinance requiring dwellings to be heated to a minimum temperature and violation of a water pollution statute \u2014 knowledge and intent were not specific prerequisites as in the statute here under review. See, generally, <em>State v. Savoie, </em>67 <em>N. J. </em>439 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">This disposition of the appeal makes it unnecessary to consider and to pass upon the other grounds urged for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Accordingly, so much of the order of the Division of Consumer Affairs as finds the respondent Joseph Friedman, individually and trading as Friedman Associates, to have violated <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:45A-2.2 (a) (2) (ii) (4), assesses a penalty of $150 and costs of $50 against him, and directs that he \"thereafter cease and desist\u201d from the same conduct, is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Division of Consumer Affairs with directions to dismiss the complaint as against respondent Joseph Friedman.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b144-6\">Kolovsky, P. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"am-dedup-0\">(dissenting). Separate complaints filed in the Division of Consumer Affairs (Division) charged two automobile dealers, Kay American Jeep, Inc. and Arrel Datsun, respectively, with having violated a regulation which makes it an unlawful motor vehicle advertising practice to fail to include in an advertisement for sale of a used automobile the bona fide odometer reading of the automobile. See <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13 :45A-2.2 (a) (ii) (4). Each complaint sought assessment of a penalty of $200, entry of a cease and desist order and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Appellant Friedman conducts the advertising agency which had prepared the copy and placed the advertisements in a newspaper on behalf of each of the dealers. In each case he appeared with the dealer at the scheduled hearing and consented to being added as a party defendant to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>That the odometer reading had been omitted from the advertisements was conceded. The defense offered was that the omission was not intentional but rather resulted from the negligence of someone in appellant\u2019s office, in one case appellant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Division rejected the proffered defense. An order was entered in each ease finding that the charged violation had been proven and ordering that the respective dealers and appellant Friedman \u201cjointly and severally and in the alternative\u201d pay a penalty of $150 and $50 costs and cease and desist from violating the regulation in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Friedman, but not the dealers, filed a notice of appeal in each ease. Since each appeal and the majority opinions therein involve identical issues, this dissenting opinion will apply to both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The majority concludes that a violation of the cited regulation cannot be established unless it be shown that the failure to include the odometer reading was deliberate rather than due to inadvertence or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u201cThe subject of consumer fraud has emerged as a major problem of our commercial scene. Being unequal to the vendor, the consumer is easily overreached.\u201d <em>Riley v. New Rapids Carpet </em>Center, 61 N. <em>J. </em>218, 224 (1972). To remedy and alleviate that problem, our Legislature adopted statutes whose purpose is to protect the consumer against deceptive and improper practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Among them was <em>L. </em>1960, <em>c. </em>39 \u2014 \u201cAn Act concerning consumer fraud, its prevention, and providing penalties therefor\u201d (hereafter the Consumer Fraud Act). The act, now N. <em>J. S. A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq., </em>has been amended over the years to expand the protection afforded the consumer. Concomitantly, the governmental machinery provided for enforcement and regulation has been upgraded and expanded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Power to promulgate rules and regulations \"to accomplish the objectives and to cany out the duties prescribed by [the Consumer Fraud Act],\u201d regulations \"which shall have the force of law,\u201d was granted to the Attorney General by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-4. There can be no question but that \"the Legislature intended to confer on the Attorney General the broadest kind of power to act in the interest of the consumer public * * *.\u201d <em>Kugler v. Romain, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>522, 537 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Acting pursuant to the power thus granted, regulations have been adopted outlawing specific practices, in various types of business, thus delineating specific standards of conduct with which persons engaged in those businesses must comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Among the practices so regulated are those involved in the advertising of motor vehicles for sale. Under <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13 :45A-2.1, the regulations apply to an \"advertiser,\u201d defined in pertinent part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">* * * any person as defined by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-1(d) who in the ordinary course of business is engaged in the sale or financing of motor vehicles or who in the course of any 12-month period offers more than three motor vehicles for sale, lease or rental, or who is engaged in the brokerage of motor vehicles whether for sale, lease or rental, and who directly or indirectly initiates, requests, or causes an advertisement to be made for motor vehicles; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>N. J. A. C. </em>13 :45A-2.2 begins with a paragraph declaring that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>(a) Without limiting any other practices which may be unlawful under the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-1 <em>et seq., </em>the following motor vehicle advertising practices shall be unlawful thereunder :</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">and then continues with a listing and description, in seven separate sections, o\u00ed various unlawful advertising practices. Included therein, as section 2 (ii), is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">The failure in any price advertisement to disclose any of the following :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">(1) The year, make and model, and the series if such advertised motor vehicles have a designated series;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">(2) Whether the motor vehicle is new or used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">(3) Whether the motor vehicle has been used as a demonstrator, executive, police or fire vehicle, or passenger vehicle for lease, rental or hire, when such prior use is known or should have been known by the advertiser;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">(4) The <em>bona fide </em>odometer reading of any specifically advertised demonstration, executive or used motor vehicle. The advertiser may rely on his seller\u2019s affidavit or certification as to milage at the time the advertiser took possession of the motor vehicle provided such reliance is in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">s- * * [The remaining subsections relate for the most part to new motor vehicles.'!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The reasonableness of the requirement that the <em>Iona fide </em>odometer reading he set forth is beyond dispute. The number of miles an automobile has been driven is of critical importance in evaluating the worth of the automobile \u2014\u2022 a fact recognized by the Motor Vehicle Act and regulations adopted by the Division of Motor Vehicles (See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17050.1 <em>et seq. </em>prohibiting the downward alteration of \u201cthe mileage registering instrument of a used motor vehicle\u201d; see also, N. <em>J. A. C. </em>13 :21-5.8 and 5.9 requiring a seller of a used motor vehicle to certify in writing at the time of sale the truth of the mileage appearing on the odometer of the vehicle.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The regulation here involved \u2014 mandating the inclusion in the advertisement of the odometer reading of the vehicle \u2014 establishes a standard of conduct with which advertisers must comply, under pain of penal sanctions, regardless of intent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>moral culpability. The regulation falls within the class of \"strict liability\u201d penal statutes and regulations which a legislature or an authorized administrative agency may adopt to eliminate the social or economic problems with which they are concerned. <em>Cf. Dept. of Health v. Concrete Specialties, Inc., </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>407 (App. Div. 1970); <em>Grant Lunch Corp. v. Driscoll, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>408, 411 ( Sup. Ct. 1943), aff\u2019d 130 <em>N. J. L. </em>554 (E. &amp; A. 1943), <em>cert. </em>den. 320 <em>U. S. </em>801, 64 S. Ct. 431, 88 L. Ed. 484 (1944); <em>State v. Elmwood Terrace, Inc., </em>85 <em>N. J. Super. </em>240, 246-247 (App. Div. 1964); <em>State v. Kinsley, </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>190 (Cty. Ct. 1968), aff'd o. b. 105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>347 (App. Div. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Apposite is what was said in <em>Grant Lunch Corp. v. Dris-coll, supra, </em>in rejecting a contention that a liquor dealer should not have been penalized because one of his clerks inadvertently had sold a bottle of liquor below the minimum price fixed by a regulation of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Although the sale was not accomplished in purposeful violation of the regulations it was such an act as would have been avoided had the prosecutor\u2019s clerks performed their duty; and in any event it was a flat violation of lawful regulations duly promulgated and fully grounded in the statute. [129 <em>N. J. L. </em>at 410-411]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The majority finds the cited cases inapposite because, in their view, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-2 mandates that before one may be found guilty of violating the regulation in question, it must be shown that he did so knowingly and intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">I find no such mandate in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56 :8-2 nor do I find therein any legislative intent to limit the broad powers granted the Division to delineate standards of conduct or permissible commercial practices to which those who advertise used automobiles for sale must adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:8-2 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>misrepresentation, <em>or </em>the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice; <em>*' </em>* [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation ignores that the word \u201cknowing\u201d appears only after the word or (which I have italicized) and applies only to the conduct thereinafter referred to. The word \u201cknowing\u201d does not appear in, nor does it have any application to, the preceding provision of the section proscribing \u201cthe act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice;, deception\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The omission of the word \u201cknowing\u201d from the provision just quoted is cogent evidence that the Legislature intended that, irrespective of the offender\u2019s intent, it is unlawful to use or employ an \u201cunconscionable commercial practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Were there no prior enunciated governing and controlling standard of conduct, the issue of whether particular conduct constitutes an unconscionable commercial practice might present a factual issue. Here, however, there is no room for debate; a preexisting regulation seeking to compel truth in advertising has declared that the failure to include the odometer reading, as well as the other required information, in the advertisement is an unlawful \u201cmotor vehicle advertising practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">I find no justification in the statute or elsewhere for the interpretation adopted by the majority which would impose on the Division, in its efforts to protect the consumer, the almost impossible task of showing an intentional failure to comply with one or more of the myriad regulations it has adopted to eliminate improper commercial practices, regulations of which all in the regulated business have been forewarned.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The majority\u2019s disposition of the appeal made it unnecessary for them to consider the remaining points ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>vanced for reversal. Those points challenged the propriety of imposing liability on an advertising agency \u2014 as distinguished from its client, the dealer \u2014 for a violation of the regulation. Appellant contends that his advertising agency is not an \u201cadvertiser\u201d as that word is defined in <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13 :45A-2.1, and that if it is deemed so to be, the regulation and the underlying statute unconstitutionally discriminate against advertising agencies because of the exemption granted by the regulation and the statute (I quote from the regulation) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">* * * to the owner or publisher of newspapers, magazines, publications or printed matter wherein such advertisement appears or to the owner or operator of a radio or television station which disseminates such advertisement when the owner, publisher or operator has no knowledge of the intent, design or purpose of the advertiser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">There is no substance to appellant's constitutional contention. Further, there is no reason for us to reach or decide, on the present record and without a full development of the scope of appellant's activities, whether he is an advertiser within the meaning of that term as defined in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">That issue was neither raised nor explored at the hearing before the Division. On the contrary, at the hearings before the Division appellant took the position that if any penalty were imposed, it should be imposed against him not against his customer, the automobile dealer, since it was his agency which was responsible for the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">I would affirm the order of the Division in each case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\"> TJnder the original act the powers o\u00ed enforcement and regulation were assigned to the Attorney General. By <em>L. </em>1967, c. 23 (N. <em>J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>S. A. </em>52:17B-5.6 <em>et seq.) </em>his functions, powers and duties under the act were directed to be exercised by him through a bureau then established in the Division of Law, the Office of Consumer Protection, headed by an executive director appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the Attorney General. The Attorney General\u2019s powers and duties were transferred in 1971 to the newly created Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:17B-120, 124. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:17B-120 provides that \u201cthe division shall be under the immediate supervision of a director who shall administer the work of the division under the direction and supervision of the Attorney General.\u201d The director is appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
