Eight of these dealt with his possession and distribution of controlled dangerous substances and his record keeping and furnishing in connection therewith. The ninth count related to his keeping of premises for proscribed purposes relating to the use of controlled dangerous substances. The State appeals, upon leave granted, from a determination by the trial judge that defendant \u201cis not competent at this time to stand trial\u201d because of his inability \u201cto consult intelligently with counsel.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">As the trial judge found, defendant practices medicine in a manner that is \u201cbizarre by all acceptable standards.\u201d It is equally true that \u201cthis bizarre practice is the root of the criminal charges\u201d against defendant. Finally, and most significantly, we agree wholly with the findings of the trial judge that \u201cdefendant is a highly educated person\u201d who \u201cwould be able to follow the evidence as presented at trial\u201d and who \u201ccan comprehend his position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We part companj', however, with that which is more a conclusion than a finding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the trial judge: \u201cSince these grandiose and bizarre theories can only be understood by Doctor Snell * * * he will be unable to confer intelligently with counsel so as to construct a just defense.\u201d If the test of <em>Aponte v. </em>State, 30 <em>N. J. </em>441 (1959), that defendant be able \u201cintelligently [to] consult with counsel and plan his defense,\u201d is made to rest upon the ability of counsel or the world to receive and understand a grandiose or bizarre scheme, then it seems that consideration has shifted from the mental state of defendant to that of his auditors. We do not think <em>Aponte </em>intended that.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Despite the fact that Dr. Snell may truly believe that universal ignorance is persuading the world against his en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>lightened theories, and that he may truly be unable to understand that, he certainly does comprehend his position as the trial judge found. We are satisfied additionally that he can communicate that position with counsel, and that accordingly he can assist in the planning of his defense. No more than that is required. <em>State v.
