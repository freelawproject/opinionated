The sole question on appeal is whether that widow should be d\u00a9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>prived of dependency benefits merely because, since her husband\u2019s death, she has held herself out as the wife of another man although she has not married him.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The issue was decided in <em>Gaudreau v. Eclipse Pioneer Division, Bendix Air Corp., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>666 (E. &amp; A. 1948). It was there held that the Legislature had clearly provided that only the actual remarriage of a widow terminates her right to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. Since common law marriages have not been recognized in this State since 1939, it is necessary that there be an actual ceremonial remarriage before a widow can be deprived of dependency benefits. Short of that, the widow\u2019s life-style, albeit an illicit relationship, is no bar to her receiving compensation. <em>Gaudreau </em>at 368, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
