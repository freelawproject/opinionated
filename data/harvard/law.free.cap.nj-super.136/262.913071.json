J. S. A. </em>2A:85-5. His codefendant, Willie Hodges, who has not appealed, was convicted of raping the same female, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:138-1. Defendant was sentenced to New Jersey State Prison for a term of seven to nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">He contends the trial judge committed reversible error in permitting a police chemist to testify that an analysis of certain paper tissues, made by his assistant under his supervision, contained human seminal material and was positive for spermatozoa. There is no need to recite the uneon-tradicted evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt \u2014 defendants did not testify \u2014 other than to indicate that the proofs were that Hodges had used the tissues to wipe himself after having sexual intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We find no error in the admission of the police chemist\u2019s testimony because it related only to a codefendant and not defendant, see <em>United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, </em>426 <em>F. </em>2d 1176 (2d Cir. 1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U. S. </em>941, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>944, 28 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 222 (1971). In addition, one expert\u2019s testimony may be based on the work done or hearsay evidence of another expert, especially if the latter\u2019s work is supervised by the former. Here defendant fully cross-examined the expert and, under the circumstances, he was not deprived of his right of confrontation. This modern rule has been accepted by many authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ties, see <em>Evid. R. </em>56(2) and the commentary thereon; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>447 <em>F. </em>2d 1285 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 405 <em>U. S. </em>954, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>1168, 31 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 231 (1972); <em>Jenkins v. United States, </em>113 U. S. App. D. C. 300, 307 <em>F. </em>2d 637 (D. C. Cir. 1962); <em>Moore v. Cataldo, </em>356 <em>Mass. </em>325, 249 <em>N. E. </em>2d 578 (Sup. Ct. 1969); <em>Grant v. State, </em>472 <em>S. W. </em>2d 531 (Tex. Civ. App. 1971); <em>McCormick, Evidence </em>(2 ed. 1972), \u00a7 15; Annotation, \u201cAdmissability on issue of sanity of expert opinion based partly on medical, psychological, or hospital reports,\u201d 55 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 551. Finally, in view of the overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt, if error existed it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 <em>U. S. </em>371, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>2174, 33 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1 (1972); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U. S. </em>18, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967), reh. den. 386 <em>U. S. </em>987, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>1283, 18 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 241 (1967); <em>State v. La Porte, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>312, 320 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Considering the nature of the present offense and defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, the sentence imposed was warranted and defendant has failed to show that the sentencing judge abused his discretion. <em>State v. Tyson, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>411 (1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 380 <em>U. S. </em>987, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1359, 14 <em>L.
