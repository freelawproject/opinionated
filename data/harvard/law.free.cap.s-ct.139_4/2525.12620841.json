We have previously addressed what officers may do in two broad categories of cases. First, an officer may conduct a BAC test if the facts of a particular case bring it within the exigent-circumstances exception to the Fourth Amendment's general requirement of a warrant. Second, if an officer has probable cause to arrest a motorist for drunk driving, the officer may conduct a breath test (but not a blood test) under the rule allowing warrantless searches of a person incident to arrest.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Today, we consider what police officers may do in a narrow but important category of cases: those in which the driver is unconscious and therefore cannot be given a breath test. In such cases, we hold, the exigent-circumstances rule almost always permits a blood test without a warrant. When a breath test is impossible, enforcement of the drunk-driving laws depends upon the administration of a blood test. And when a police officer encounters an unconscious driver, it is very likely that the driver would be taken to an emergency room and that his blood would be drawn for diagnostic purposes even if the police were not seeking BAC information. In addition, police officers most frequently come upon unconscious drivers when they report to the scene of an accident, and under those circumstances, the officers' many responsibilities-such as attending to other injured drivers or passengers and preventing further accidents-may be incompatible with the procedures that would be required to obtain a warrant. Thus, when a driver is unconscious, the general rule is that a warrant is not needed.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), we recounted the country's efforts over the years to address the terrible problem of drunk driving.

It deems drivers to have consented to breath or blood tests if an officer has reason to believe they have committed one of several drug- or alcohol-related offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20343.305\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 343.305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), (3). Officers seeking to conduct a BAC test must read aloud a statement declaring their intent to administer the test and advising drivers of their options and the implications of their choice. \u00a7 343.305(4). If a driver's BAC level proves too high, his license will be suspended; but if he refuses testing, his license will be\n   <em>\n    revoked\n   </em>\n   and his refusal may be used against him in court. See\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   . No\n   test will be administered if a driver refuses-or, as the State would put it, \"withdraws\" his statutorily presumed consent. But \"[a] person who is unconscious or otherwise not capable of withdrawing consent is presumed not to have\" withdrawn it. \u00a7 343.305(3)(b). See also \u00a7\u00a7 343.305(3)(ar) 1-2. More than half the States have provisions like this one regarding unconscious drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The sequence of events that gave rise to this case began when Officer Alexander Jaeger of the Sheboygan Police Department received a report that petitioner Gerald Mitchell, appearing to be very drunk, had climbed into a van and driven off. Jaeger soon found Mitchell wandering near a lake. Stumbling and slurring his words, Mitchell could hardly stand without the support of two officers. Jaeger judged a field sobriety test hopeless, if not dangerous, and gave Mitchell a preliminary breath test. It registered a BAC level of 0.24%, triple the legal limit for driving in Wisconsin. Jaeger arrested Mitchell for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and, as is standard practice, drove him to a police station for a more reliable breath test using better equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the way, Mitchell's condition continued to deteriorate-so much so that by the time the squad car had reached the station, he was too lethargic even for a breath test. Jaeger therefore drove Mitchell to a nearby hospital for a blood test; Mitchell lost consciousness on the ride over and had to be wheeled in. Even so, Jaeger read aloud to a slumped Mitchell the standard statement giving drivers a chance to refuse BAC testing. Hearing no response, Jaeger asked hospital staff to draw a blood sample. Mitchell remained unconscious while the sample was taken, and analysis of his blood showed that his BAC, about 90 minutes after his arrest, was 0.222%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mitchell was charged with violating two related drunk-driving provisions. See \u00a7\u00a7 346.63(1)(a), (b). He moved to suppress the results of the blood test on the ground that it violated his Fourth Amendment right against \"unreasonable searches\" because it was conducted without a warrant. Wisconsin chose to rest its response on the notion that its implied-consent law (together with Mitchell's free choice to drive on its highways) rendered the blood test a consensual one, thus curing any Fourth Amendment problem. In the end, the trial court denied Mitchell's motion to suppress, and a jury found him guilty of the charged offenses. The intermediate appellate court certified two questions to the Wisconsin Supreme Court: first, whether compliance with the State's implied-consent law was sufficient to show that Mitchell's test was consistent with the Fourth Amendment and, second, whether a warrantless blood draw from an unconscious person violates the Fourth Amendment.

But\n   our decisions have not rested on the idea that these laws do what their popular name might seem to suggest-that is, create actual consent to all the searches they authorize. Instead, we have based our decisions on the precedent regarding the specific constitutional claims in each case, while keeping in mind the wider regulatory scheme developed over the years to combat drunk driving. That scheme is centered on legally specified BAC limits for drivers-limits enforced by the BAC tests promoted by implied-consent laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over the last 50 years, we have approved many of the defining elements of this scheme.

A driver so drunk as to lose consciousness is quite likely to crash, especially if he passes out before managing to park. And then the accident might give officers a slew of urgent tasks beyond that of securing (and working around) medical care for the suspect. Police may have to ensure that others who are injured receive prompt medical attention; they may have to provide first aid themselves until medical personnel arrive at the scene. In some cases, they may have to deal with fatalities. They may have to preserve evidence at the scene and block or redirect traffic to prevent further accidents. These pressing matters, too, would require responsible officers to put off applying for a warrant, and that would only exacerbate the delay-and imprecision-of any subsequent BAC test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, all these rival priorities would put officers, who must often engage in a form of triage, to a dilemma. It would force them to choose between prioritizing a warrant application, to the detriment of critical health and safety needs, and delaying the warrant application, and thus the BAC test, to the detriment of its evidentiary value and all the compelling interests served by BAC limits. This is just the kind of scenario for which the exigency rule was born-just the kind of grim dilemma it lives to dissolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mitchell objects that a warrantless search is unnecessary in cases involving unconscious drivers because warrants these days can be obtained faster and\n   more easily.

We do not rule out the possibility that in an unusual case a defendant would be able to show that his blood would not have been drawn if police had not been seeking BAC information, and that police could not have reasonably judged that a warrant application would interfere with other pressing needs or duties.

The officer administered a preliminary breath test, which revealed a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.24%. The officer arrested Mitchell for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Once at the police station, the officer placed Mitchell in a holding cell, where Mitchell began to drift into either sleep or unconsciousness. At that point, the officer decided against administering a more definitive breath test and instead took Mitchell to the hospital for a blood test. Mitchell became fully unconscious on the way. At the hospital, the officer read Mitchell a notice, required by Wisconsin's so-called \"implied consent\" law, which gave him the opportunity to refuse BAC testing. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20343.305\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 343.305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). But Mitchell was too incapacitated to respond. The officer then asked the hospital to test Mitchell's blood. Mitchell's blood was drawn about 90 minutes after his arrest, and the test revealed a BAC of 0.22%\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At no point did the officer attempt to secure a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mitchell was charged with violating two Wisconsin drunk-driving laws. See \u00a7\u00a7 346.63(1)(a), (b). He moved to suppress the blood-test results, arguing that the warrantless blood draw was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. In response, Wisconsin conceded that exigent circumstances did not justify the warrantless blood draw. As the State's attorney told the trial court, \"There is nothing to suggest that this is a blood draw on a[n] exigent circumstances situation when there has been a concern for exigency. This is not that case.\" App. 134. Instead, Wisconsin argued that the warrantless blood draw was lawful because of Wisconsin's implied-consent statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20343.305\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20343.305\">\n    at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The trial court denied Mitchell's motion to suppress, and a jury convicted him of the charged offenses.

In the typical situation, the police cannot test a person's blood as soon as the person is arrested; police officers do not draw blood roadside. Rather, they generally must transport the drunk-driving suspect to a hospital or other medical facility and wait for a medical professional to draw the blood. That built-in delay may give police officers time to seek a warrant, especially if the suspect is brought to the hospital by an officer or emergency-response professional other than the one who applies for the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, although \"the alcohol level in a person's blood begins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n    at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does so \"over time in a gradual and relatively predictable manner,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n    at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, as the plurality observes, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2537 - 2538, that delay is guaranteed because an unconscious person will need to be transported\n   to the hospital for medical attention. Such a delay occurred in Mitchell's case, even more so than it did in McNeely's.

Furthermore, because unconsciousness is more likely to occur at higher BACs, see Martin, Measuring Acute Alcohol Impairment, in Forensic Issues in Alcohol Testing 1, 8 (S. Karch ed. 2008), the BACs of suspected drunk drivers who are unconscious will presumably be higher above the legal limit-and thus remain above the legal limit for longer-than is true for suspects who are conscious and close to sobering up. And, of course, the process for getting a warrant remains the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   All told, the mere fact that a person is unconscious does not materially change the calculation that the Court made in\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   when it rejected a categorical exigency exception for blood draws. In many cases, even when the suspect falls unconscious, police officers will have sufficient time to secure a warrant-meaning that the Fourth Amendment requires that they do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The plurality distinguishes unconscious drunk-driving suspects from others based on the fact that their unconsciousness means that they will, invariably, need urgent medical attention due to their loss of consciousness. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2537 - 2538. But the need for medical care is not unique to unconscious suspects. \"Drunk drivers often end up in an emergency room,\" whether or not they are unconscious when the police encounter them. See\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n    569 U.S., at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/#p149\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.).

That Mitchell was hospitalized is likewise insufficient here.

We do not hold that the State established that the facts of this particular case involve exigent circumstances under\n    <em>\n     McNeely\n    </em>\n    . Rather, we adopt a rule for an entire category of cases- those in which a motorist believed to have driven under the influence of alcohol is unconscious and thus cannot be given a breath test. This rule is not based on what happened in petitioner's particular case but on the circumstances generally present in cases that fall within the scope of the rule. Those are just the sorts of features of unconscious-driver cases that Wisconsin brought to our attention, see Brief for Respondent 54-55; Tr. of Oral Arg. at 32-34, 48-51, which petitioner addressed, see Reply Brief at 14-15; Tr. of Oral Arg. at 15-20, 23-24, 29-31, 63-66.

See\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , at 2550. Indeed, rather than confine itself to the facts and legal issues actually presented in this case, the plurality instead creates a new\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    categorical rule out of thin air. The plurality does so without any evidence that such a rule is necessary in all, or even most, cases. See\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , at 2550. That the plurality reaches out to determine the rights of all drivers, rather than just Mitchell, makes today's decision more misguided, not less.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    A related but distinct point: The issue on which the plurality resolves this case is not \"fairly included\" in the question on which the Court granted certiorari. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). The Court granted certiorari to answer \"[w]hether a statute authorizing a blood draw from an unconscious motorist provides an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.\" Pet. for Cert. ii; accord,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2532 - 2533. The answer to that question is no. Whether exigent circumstances nevertheless require that the warrantless blood draw be upheld is an independent issue. True, that issue might affect the same \"category of cases,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2534, n. 2, but that would be true of all sorts of matters not fairly included in the question on which this Court granted certiorari. \"Both [issues] might be subsidiary to a question embracing both-[Was suppression appropriate?]-but they exist side by side, neither encompassing the other.\"\n    <em>\n     Yee v.

One wonders why the Court asked for briefing and oral argument at all.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The plurality's new rule, in addition to requiring a defendant to prove that the officer had no time to get a warrant, also appears to require the defendant to show that his blood would not have been drawn absent law enforcement's need for a blood sample. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2539. That is, a suspect can never prevail under the new rule if the hospital staff draws his blood for its own noninvestigatory medical reasons. But, again, the relevant question is whether the evidence is likely to dissipate before the police can obtain a warrant. This particular aspect of the plurality's approach offers no help in answering that question. The plurality separately suggests that, because an unconscious person may well undergo a blood test for medical purposes regardless, its\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    categorical exception \"could\n    <em>\n     lessen\n    </em>\n    the intrusion\" of a blood draw. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2538, n. 8.

That law says that anyone driving in Wisconsin agrees-by the very act of driving-to testing under certain circumstances. But the Court today declines to answer the question presented. Instead, it upholds Wisconsin's law on an entirely different ground-citing the exigent circumstances doctrine. While I do not doubt that the Court may affirm for any reason supported by the record, the application of the exigent circumstances doctrine in this area poses complex and difficult questions that neither the parties nor the courts below discussed. Rather than proceeding solely by self-direction, I would have dismissed this case as improvidently granted and waited for a case presenting the exigent circumstances question.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
