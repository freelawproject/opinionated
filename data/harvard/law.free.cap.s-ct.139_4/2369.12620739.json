That promise stands as one of the Constitution's most vital protections against arbitrary government. Yet in this case a congressional statute compelled a federal judge to send a man to prison for a minimum of five years without empaneling a jury of his peers or requiring the government to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As applied here, we do not hesitate to hold that the statute violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a jury found Andre Haymond guilty of possessing child pornography in violation of federal law, the question turned to sentencing. The law authorized the district judge to impose a prison term of between zero and 10 years,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and a period of supervised release of between 5 years and life, \u00a7 3583(k). Because Mr. Haymond had no criminal history and was working to help support his mother who had suffered a stroke, the judge concluded that Mr. Haymond was \"not going to get much out of being in prison\" and sentenced him to a prison term of 38 months, followed by 10 years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After completing his prison sentence, however, Mr. Haymond encountered trouble on supervised release. He sat for multiple polygraph tests in which he denied possessing or viewing child pornography, and each time the test indicated no deception. But when the government conducted an unannounced search of his computers and cellphone, it turned up 59 images that appeared to be child pornography. Based on that discovery, the government sought to revoke Mr. Haymond's supervised release and secure a new and additional prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A hearing followed before a district judge acting without a jury, and under a preponderance of the evidence rather than a reasonable doubt standard. In light of expert testimony regarding the manner in which cellphones can \"cache\" images without the user's knowledge, the judge found insufficient evidence to show that Mr. Haymond knowingly possessed 46 of the images. At the same time, the judge found it more likely than not that Mr. Haymond knowingly downloaded and possessed the remaining 13 images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With that, the question turned once more to sentencing. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3), enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a district judge who finds that a defendant has violated the conditions of his supervised release normally may (but is not required to) impose a new prison term up to the maximum period of supervised release authorized by statute for the defendant's original crime of conviction, subject to certain limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that provision, the judge in this case would have been free to sentence Mr. Haymond to between zero and two additional years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   But there was a complication. Under \u00a7 3583(k), added to the Act in 2003 and amended in 2006, if a judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant on supervised release committed one of several enumerated offenses, including the possession of child pornography, the judge\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   impose an additional prison term of at least five years and up to life without regard to the length of the prison term authorized for the defendant's initial crime of conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Mr. Haymond had committed an offense covered by \u00a7 3583(k), the judge felt bound to impose an additional prison term of at least five years. He did so, though, with reservations. It's one thing, Judge Terence Kern said, for a judge proceeding under a preponderance of the evidence standard to revoke a defendant's supervised release and order him to serve additional time in prison within the range already authorized by the defendant's original conviction; after all, the jury's verdict, reached under the reasonable doubt standard, permitted that much punishment. But the judge found it \" 'repugnant' \" that a statute might impose a new and additional \"mandatory five-year\" punishment without those traditional protections. Were it not for \u00a7 3583(k) 's mandatory minimum, the judge added, he \"probably would have sentenced in the range of two years or less.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal to the Tenth Circuit, Mr. Haymond challenged both the factual support for his new punishment and its constitutionality. On the facts, the court of appeals held that the district court's findings against Mr. Haymond were clearly erroneous in certain respects. Even so, the court concluded, just enough evidence remained to sustain a finding that Mr. Haymond had knowingly possessed the 13 images at issue, in violation of \u00a7 3583(k). That left the question of the statute's constitutionality, and there the Tenth Circuit concluded that \u00a7 3583(k) violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The court explained that a jury had convicted Mr. Haymond beyond a reasonable doubt of a crime carrying a prison term of zero to 10 years. Yet now Mr. Haymond faced a new potential prison term of five years to life. Because this new prison term included a new and higher mandatory minimum resting only on facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence, the court held, the statute violated Mr. Haymond's right to trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By way of remedy, the court held the last two sentences of \u00a7 3583(k), which mandate a 5-year minimum prison term, \"unconstitutional and unenforceable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267066\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1153/#p1168\">\n    869 F.3d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1168 (C.A.10 2017). The court then vacated Mr. Haymond's revocation sentence and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing without regard to those provisions. In effect, the court of appeals left the district court free to issue a new sentence under the preexisting statute governing most every other supervised release violation, \u00a7 3583(e). Following the Tenth Circuit's directions, the district court proceeded to resentence Mr. Haymond to time served, as he had already been detained by that point for approximately 28 months. We granted review to consider the Tenth Circuit's constitutional holding. 586 U.

Pym (Jan. 27, 1766), in 1 Papers of John Adams 169 (R. Taylor ed. 1977). Just as the right to vote sought to preserve the people's authority over their government's executive and legislative functions, the right to a jury trial sought to preserve the people's authority over its judicial functions.

At the founding, a \"prosecution\" of an individual simply referred to \"the manner of [his] formal accusation.\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 298 (1769) (Blackstone); see also N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1828) (defining \"prosecution\" as \"the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal\"). And the concept of a \"crime\" was a broad one linked to punishment, amounting to those \"acts to which the law affixes ... punishment,\" or, stated differently, those \"element[s] in the wrong upon which the punishment is based.\" 1 J.

A judge's authority to issue a sentence derives from, and is limited by, the jury's factual findings of criminal conduct. In the early Republic, if an indictment or \"accusation ... lack[ed] any particular fact which the laws ma[d]e essential to the punishment,\" it was treated as \"no accusation\" at all. 1 Bishop \u00a7 87, at 55; see also 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170 (1736); Archbold *106. And the \"truth of every accusation\" that was brought against a person had to \"be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours.\" 4 Blackstone 343. Because the Constitution's guarantees cannot mean less today than they did the day they were adopted, it remains the case today that a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt every fact \" 'which the law makes essential to [a] punishment' \" that a judge might later seek to impose.\n    <em>\n     Blakely\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/#p309\">\n     542 U.S. at 304\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/#p309\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting 1 Bishop \u00a7 87, at 55).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    For much of our history, the application of this rule of jury supervision proved pretty straightforward.

Based on the facts reflected in the jury's verdict, Mr. Haymond faced a lawful prison term of between zero and 10 years under \u00a7 2252(b)(2). But then a judge-acting without a jury and based only on a preponderance of the evidence-found that Mr. Haymond had engaged in additional conduct in violation of the terms of his supervised release. Under \u00a7 3583(k), that judicial factfinding triggered a new punishment in the form of a prison term of at least five years and up to life. So just like the facts the judge found at the defendant's sentencing hearing in\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n    , the facts the judge found here increased \"the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences\" in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 115,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n     133 S.Ct. 2151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this case, that meant Mr. Haymond faced a minimum of five years in prison instead of as little as none. Nor did the absence of a jury's finding beyond a reasonable doubt only infringe the rights of the accused; it also divested the \" 'people at large' \"-the men and women who make up a jury of a defendant's peers-of their constitutional authority to set the metes\n    and bounds of judicially administered criminal punishments.\n    <em>\n     Blakely\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/#p309\">\n     542 U.S. at 306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/#p309\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting Letter XV by the Federal Farmer (Jan. 18, 1788), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 315, 320 (H.

There, the trial judge applied a \"sentencing enhancement\" based on his own factual findings at the defendant's initial sentencing hearing; meanwhile, Mr. Haymond received his new punishment from a judge at a hearing to consider the revocation of his term of supervised release. This procedural distinction makes all the difference, we are told, because the Sixth Amendment's jury trial promise applies only to \"criminal prosecutions,\" which end with the issuance of a sentence and do not extend to \"postjudgment sentence-administration proceedings.\" Brief for United States 24; see also\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at 2393 - 2395 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (echoing this argument).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    But we have been down this road before.

As this Court has repeatedly explained, any \"increase in a defendant's authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact\" requires a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt \"no matter\" what the government chooses to call the exercise.\n    <em>\n     Ring\n    </em>\n    , 536 U.S. at 602,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254507\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/584/\">\n     122 S.Ct. 2428\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    To be sure, and as the government and dissent emphasize, founding-era prosecutions traditionally ended at final judgment.

The defendant receives a term of supervised release thanks to his initial offense, and whether that release is later revoked or sustained, it constitutes a part of the final sentence for his crime. As at the initial sentencing hearing, that does not mean a jury must find every fact in a revocation hearing that may affect the judge's exercise of discretion within the range of punishments authorized by the jury's verdict. But it does mean that a jury must find any facts that trigger a\n    <em>\n     new\n    </em>\n    mandatory minimum prison term.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    This logic respects not only our precedents, but the original meaning of the jury trial right they seek to protect.

If the government and dissent were correct, Congress could require anyone convicted of even a modest crime to serve a sentence of supervised release for the rest of his life. At that point, a judge could try and convict him of any violation of the terms of his release under a preponderance of the evidence standard, and then sentence him to pretty much anything. At oral argument, the government even conceded that, under its theory, a defendant on supervised release would have no Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial when charged with an infraction carrying the death penalty.

Before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a federal criminal defendant could serve as little as a third of his assigned prison term before becoming eligible for release on parole. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204205\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (1982 ed.). Or he might avoid prison altogether in favor of probation. See \u00a7 3561 (1982 ed.). If the defendant violated the terms of his parole or probation, a judge could send him to\n    prison. But either way and as we've seen, a judge generally could sentence the defendant to serve\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    the remaining prison term authorized by statute for his original crime of conviction. See\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 2376 - 2377;\n    <em>\n     Morrissey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n     408 U.S. at 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n     92 S.Ct. 2593\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The essence of parole is release from prison,\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    the completion of sentence\" (emphasis added)). Thus, a judge could not imprison a defendant for any longer than the jury's factual findings allowed-a result entirely harmonious with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p477\">\n     530 U.S. at 498\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p477\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2348\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Scalia, J., concurring);\n    <em>\n     Blakely\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/#p309\">\n     542 U.S. at 309\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/#p309\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    All that changed beginning in 1984. That year, Congress overhauled federal sentencing procedures to make prison terms more determinate and abolish the practice of parole. Now, when a defendant is sentenced to prison he generally must serve the great bulk of his assigned term. In parole's place, Congress established the system of supervised release. But \"[u]nlike parole,\" supervised release wasn't introduced to replace a portion of the defendant's prison term, only to encourage rehabilitation\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    the completion of his prison term. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 7, pt. A(2)(b) (Nov. 2012); see Doherty, Indeterminate Sentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised Release,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%20958\">\n     88 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 958\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1024 (2013).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In this case, that structural difference bears constitutional consequences. Where parole and probation violations generally exposed a defendant only to the\n    <em>\n     remaining\n    </em>\n    prison term authorized for his crime of conviction, as found by a unanimous jury under the reasonable doubt standard, supervised release violations subject to \u00a7 3583(k) can, at least as applied in cases like ours, expose a defendant to an additional mandatory minimum prison term well\n    <em>\n     beyond\n    </em>\n    that authorized by the jury's verdict-all based on facts found by a judge by a mere preponderance of the evidence. In fact, \u00a7 3583(k) differs in this critical respect not only from parole and probation; it also represents a break from the supervised release practices that Congress authorized in \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and that govern most federal criminal proceedings today. Unlike all those procedures, \u00a7 3583(k) alone requires a substantial increase in the minimum sentence to which a defendant may be exposed based only on judge-found facts under a preponderance standard. And, as we explained in\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n    and reaffirm today, that offends the Fifth and Sixth Amendments' ancient protections.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    D\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The dissent suggests an analogy between revocation under \u00a7 3583(k) and prison disciplinary procedures that do not normally require the involvement of a jury.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , at 2396 - 2397. But the analogy is a strained one: While the Sixth Amendment surely does not require a jury to find every fact that the government relies on to adjust the terms of a prisoner's confinement (say, by reducing some of his privileges as a sanction for violating the prison rules), that does not mean the government can send a free man back to prison for years based on judge-found facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Again, practice in the early Republic confirms this. At that time, a term of imprisonment may have been understood as encompassing a degree of summary discipline for alleged infractions of prison regulations without the involvement of a jury. See F. Gray, Prison Discipline in America 22-23, 48-49 (1848). But that does not mean any sanction, no matter how serious, would have been considered part and parcel of the original punishment. On the contrary, the few courts that grappled with this issue seem to have recognized that \"infamous\" punishments, such as a substantial additional term in prison, might implicate the right to trial by jury.

Yet like much else in our Constitution, the jury system isn't designed to promote efficiency but to protect liberty. In what now seems a prescient passage, Blackstone warned that the true threat to trial by jury would come less from \"open attacks,\" which \"none will be so hardy as to make,\" as from subtle \"machinations, which may sap and undermine i[t] by introducing new and arbitrary methods.\" 4 Blackstone 343. This Court has repeatedly sought to guard the historic role of the jury against such incursions. For \"however\n    <em>\n     convenient\n    </em>\n    these may appear at first, (as doubtless all arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most\n    <em>\n     convenient\n    </em>\n    ) yet let it be again remembered, that delays, and little inconveniences in the forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665221,4065359\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/215/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 344.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Having concluded that the application of \u00a7 3583(k) 's mandatory minimum in this\n    case violated Mr. Haymond's right to trial by jury, we face the question of remedy. Recall that the Tenth Circuit declared the last two sentences of \u00a7 3583(k) \"unconstitutional and unenforceable.\" Those two sentences provide in relevant part that \"[i]f a defendant required to register under [SORNA]\" commits certain specified offenses, \"the court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment [of] not ... less than 5 years.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Before us, the government suggests that the Tenth Circuit erred in declaring those two sentences \"unenforceable.\" That remedy, the government says, sweeps too broadly. In the government's view, any constitutional infirmity can be cured simply by requiring juries acting under the reasonable doubt standard, rather than judges proceeding under the preponderance of the evidence standard, to find the facts necessary to trigger \u00a7 3583(k) 's mandatory minimum. This remedy would be consistent with the statute's terms, the government assures us, because \"the court\" authorized to revoke a term of supervised release in \u00a7 3583(k) can and should be construed as embracing not only judges but also juries. And, the government insists, that means we should direct the court of appeals to send this case back to the district court so a jury may be empaneled to decide whether Mr. Haymond violated \u00a7 3583(k). Unsurprisingly, Mr. Haymond contests all of this vigorously.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    We decline to tangle with the parties' competing remedial arguments today. The Tenth Circuit did not address these arguments; it appears the government did not even discuss the possibility of empaneling a jury in its brief to that court; and this Court normally proceeds as a \"court of review, not of first view,\"\n    <em>\n     Cutter v.

The consequences that flow from violation of the conditions of supervised release are first and foremost considered sanctions for the defendant's \"breach of trust\"-his \"failure to follow the court-imposed conditions\" that followed his initial conviction-not \"for the particular conduct triggering the revocation as if that conduct were being sentenced as new federal criminal conduct.\" United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 7, pt. A, intro. 3(b) (Nov. 2018); see\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2392 - 2393. Consistent with that view, the consequences for violation of conditions of supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e), which governs most revocations, are limited by the severity of the original crime of conviction, not the conduct that results in revocation. See \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (specifying that a defendant may as a consequence of revocation serve no \"more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony, [no] more than 3 years in prison if ... a class B felony,\" and so on).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Section 3583(k) is difficult to reconcile with this understanding of supervised release. In particular, three aspects of this provision, considered in combination, lead me to think it is less like ordinary revocation and more like punishment for a new offense, to which the jury right would typically attach.\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 3583(k) applies only when a defendant commits a discrete set of federal criminal offenses specified in the statute.\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 3583(k) takes away the judge's discretion to decide whether violation of a condition of supervised release should result in imprisonment and for how long.\n    <em>\n     Third\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 3583(k) limits the judge's discretion in a particular manner: by imposing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of \"not less than 5 years\" upon a judge's finding that a defendant has \"commit[ted] any\" listed \"criminal offense.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Taken together, these features of \u00a7 3583(k) more closely resemble the punishment of new criminal offenses, but without granting a defendant the rights, including the jury right, that attend a new criminal prosecution. And in an ordinary criminal prosecution, a jury must find facts that trigger a mandatory minimum prison term.\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n     570 U.S. at 103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n     133 S.Ct. 2151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Accordingly, I would hold that \u00a7 3583(k) is unconstitutional and remand for the Court of Appeals to address the question of remedy.

Many passages in the opinion suggest that the entire system\n    of supervised release, which has been an integral part of the federal criminal justice system for the past 35 years, is fundamentally flawed in ways that cannot be fixed. Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), whenever a federal court sentences a criminal defendant to a term of imprisonment, the court may include in the sentence a term of supervised release, and under some circumstances supervised release is mandatory.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . When a court imposes a term of supervised release, the order must specify the conditions with which the defendant is required to comply, \u00a7 3583(d), and a judge may revoke supervised release and send a defendant back to prison if the judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated one of those conditions, \u00a7 3583(e)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Many statements and passages in the plurality opinion strongly suggest that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial applies to\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    supervised-release revocation proceeding. Take the opinion's opening line: \"Only a jury, acting on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, may take a person's liberty.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2373. In a supervised-release revocation proceeding, a judge, based on the preponderance of the evidence, may make a finding that \"take[s] a person's liberty,\"\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    in the sense that the defendant is sent back to prison. Later, after noting that the Sixth Amendment applies to a \"criminal prosecution,\" the plurality gives that term a broad definition that appears to encompass any supervised-release revocation proceeding. The plurality defines a \"crime\" as any \" 'ac[t] to which the law affixes ... punishment,' \" and says that a \"prosecution\" is \" 'the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2376. These definitions explain what the terms in question mean in general use, but they were not formulated for the purpose of specifying what \"criminal prosecution\" means in the specific context of the Sixth Amendment. The plurality, however, uses them for precisely that purpose, and in so doing boldly suggests that every supervised-release revocation proceeding is a criminal prosecution. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2379 (\"[A] 'criminal prosecution' continues and the defendant remains an 'accused' with all the rights provided by the Sixth Amendment, until a final sentence is imposed.... [A]n accused's final sentence includes any supervised release sentence he may receive\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Later statements are even more explicit. Quoting\n    <em>\n     Blakely v.

Rejecting this argument, the plurality huffs that \"the demands of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments\" cannot be \"dodge[d]\" \"by the simple expedient of relabeling a criminal prosecution a ... 'sentence modification' imposed at a 'postjudgment\n    sentence administration proceeding.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2379. The meaning of this statement is unmistakable and cannot have been inadvertent: A supervised-release revocation proceeding is a criminal prosecution and is therefore governed by the Sixth Amendment (and the Fifth Amendment to boot). And there is more. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2390 (\"any accusation triggering a new and additional punishment [must be] proven to the satisfaction of a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\");\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2380 (\"a jury must find\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of the facts necessary to authorize a judicial punishment\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Finally, while the plurality appears to say that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to parole revocation proceedings, see\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2381 - 2382,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    the plurality characterizes supervised release as \"critical[ly] differen[t],\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2381 - 2382. This is so, the plurality explains, because parole relieved a prisoner from serving part of the prison sentence originally imposed, whereas a term of supervised release is added to the term of imprisonment specified by the sentencing judge. As I will explain, this difference is purely formal and should have no constitutional consequences. But for now the important point is the plain implication of what the plurality says: Parole was constitutional, but supervised release ... well, that is an entirely different animal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The intimation in all these statements is clear enough: All supervised-release revocation proceedings must be conducted in compliance with the Sixth Amendment-which means that the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, which means that as a practical matter supervised-release revocation proceedings cannot be held. In 2018, federal district courts completed 1809 criminal jury trials. Admin. Office of U. S. Courts, Judicial Business of the United States Courts (2018) (Table T-1). During that same year, they adjudicated 16,946 revocations of supervised release,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (Table E-7A), and there is simply no way that the federal courts could empanel enough juries to adjudicate all those proceedings, let alone try all those proceedings in accordance with the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. So, if every supervised-release revocation proceeding is a criminal prosecution, as the plurality suggests, the whole concept of supervised release will come crashing down.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Where the plurality is headed is demonstrated-ironically-by its insistence that it is not going all the way-for now. The plurality writes: \"[O]ur opinion,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2383, 2383 - 2384, does \"not pass judgment one way or the other on \u00a7 3583(e) 's consistency with\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n    ,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2382, n. 7. Section 3583(e) sets out the procedure to be followed in\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    supervised-release revocation proceedings, so if that provision is not consistent with\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n    , the whole idea of supervised release must fall. The strategy of the plurality opinion is only thinly veiled. It provides the framework to be used in ending supervised release. It provides no clear ground for limiting the rationale of the opinion so that it does not lead to that result. And then it says: We are not doing that\n    <em>\n     today\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Is it possible to read the plurality opinion more narrowly? Can it be understood to condemn only one narrow statutory provision, namely, \u00a7 3583(k), which\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    the judge to send respondent Haymond back to prison for at least five years once the judge found that he had violated a condition of his supervised release by again possessing child pornography? On this reading, the only Sixth Amendment defect would be the mandatory minimum period of additional confinement that the statute imposes. There would be no problem if the judge had been free to choose the term, if any, of additional confinement. Does the plurality mean to go no further than this?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    There are passages in the opinion that hint at this narrower interpretation. The plurality analogizes the mandatory minimum term of additional confinement required by \u00a7 3583(k) to the mandatory minimum term of initial imprisonment found to violate the Sixth Amendment in\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n    , see\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2377 - 2379. But the previously quoted statements pointing to a broader understanding remain, and the plurality does nothing to disavow that reading. To the contrary, the plurality doubles down, assuring us that this broader understanding would not be\n    <em>\n     too\n    </em>\n    disruptive. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2383 - 2384.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    A narrower interpretation of the plurality opinion is also contradicted by another important statement in the opinion. The plurality says that the maximum \"lawful prison term\" \"reflected in the jury's verdict\" in respondent's case was \"10 years.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2378. This statement is full of meaning because if 10 years is the maximum amount of time that respondent could lawfully be required to spend in prison on the basis of the jury's verdict, there is a serious constitutional defect in the very design of the supervised-release system. That is so because the concept of supervised release is based on a fundamentally different conception of the maximum term of confinement authorized by a guilty verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    To understand this, it is important to understand the relationship between the system of supervised release and the old federal parole system it replaced. By abolishing parole and substituting supervised release, the SRA sought to retain the chief benefit of parole,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , providing a transition period of monitoring to ensure that a prisoner who leaves prison has been sufficiently reformed so that he is able to lead a law-abiding life. At the same time, the SRA aimed to promote truth in sentencing and thus to eliminate a much-derided feature of the old parole system. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 1, pt. A (Nov. 2018) (USSG). Under the parole system, a defendant who was convicted of a serious crime and given what seemed to be a stiff sentence could be and not infrequently was set free after serving only a fraction of the sentence originally pronounced. A prisoner was generally eligible for parole after serving only one-third of his sentence, and a sentence of life was treated as a sentence of 30 years.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, a defendant sentenced to imprisonment for life could be out on the streets after only 10 years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The SRA changed this, and now a defendant must serve the full term of imprisonment imposed at sentencing minus only a small deduction for good behavior in prison. USSG ch. 1, pt. A.1(3);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) ;\n    <em>\n     Barber v. Thomas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641522,12454860\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/474/\">\n     560 U.S. 474\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 481-482,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641522,12454860\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/474/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 2499\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641522,12454860\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/474/\">\n     177 L.Ed.2d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010). But to provide the same sort of transition period as was furnished under parole, a sentencing court may, and in\n    some cases must, add a period of supervised release. See \u00a7 3583. The replacement of parole with supervised release changed the form of federal sentences but not their substance. Here is an example: A pre-SRA sentence of nine years' imprisonment meant three years of certain confinement and six years of possible confinement depending on the defendant's conduct in the outside world after release from prison. At least for present purposes, such a sentence is the substantive equivalent of a post-SRA sentence of three years' imprisonment followed by six years of supervised release. In both situations, the period of certain confinement (three years) and the maximum term of possible confinement (nine years) are the same. If anything, the defendant in the post-SRA case is treated more favorably because he is guaranteed release from prison after three years; his release at that point is not dependent on a decision by a parole board.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    As this example shows, the concept of supervised release rests on the idea that a defendant sentenced to x years of imprisonment followed by y years of supervised release is really sentenced to a maximum punishment of x + y years of confinement, with the proviso that any time beyond x years will be excused if the defendant abides by the terms of supervised release. And on this understanding, the maximum term reflected in the jury's verdict in respondent's case was not 10 years, as the plurality claims, but 10 years plus the maximum period of supervised release that the statute authorized.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    None of this matters in respondent's case because the sum of his original sentence (38 months) and the additional time imposed for violating supervised release (60 months) is less than 120 months, but adoption of the rule toward which the plurality opinion seems to point would make a big difference in many cases. Under that rule, a term of supervised release could never be ordered for a defendant who is sentenced to the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, and only a short period of supervised release could be ordered for a defendant sentenced to a term of imprisonment that is close to the statutory maximum. Moreover, in many cases, a judge, before beginning a supervised-release revocation proceeding, would have to anticipate the period of additional confinement that the judge would find appropriate if a particular violation or set of violations was shown. For example, suppose that the statutory maximum term of certain confinement authorized by the offense of conviction is 10 years and that a prisoner is sentenced to and serves eight years. Suppose that the term of supervised release imposed at the time of sentencing is five years. Before starting a supervised-release revocation proceeding in this hypothetical case, the judge would have to decide whether to rule out the possibility of sending the defendant back to prison for more than two years. Unless the judge was willing\n    to do this-without knowing all the facts-the judge would have to convene a jury. It would be strange to put judges in that predicament.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The plurality appreciates the implication of its understanding of the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by a jury verdict in the post-SRA era. In footnote 4, the plurality says that it need not decide whether its interpretation of the Sixth Amendment leads to the results I have just outlined. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2378 - 2379, n. 4. But here again, while formally reserving decision on this question, the opinion provides no theory that might permit what the SRA contemplates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In short, under the plurality opinion, the whole system of supervised release would be like a 40-ton truck speeding down a steep mountain road with no brakes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    This should not have been a difficult or complicated case. I start with the proposition that the old federal parole system did not implicate the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right. A parole revocation proceeding was not a \"criminal prosecution\" within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and revocation did not result in a new sentence. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v. Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946680\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/558/224/#p226\">\n     558 F.2d 224\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 226 (C.A.5 1977) ;\n    <em>\n     Hyser v.

When a prisoner was paroled, the Executive was simply exercising the authority conferred by law to grant the defendant a conditional release from serving part of the sentence imposed after a guilty verdict.\n    <em>\n     Mistretta v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p364\">\n     488 U.S. 361\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 364-365,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p364\">\n     109 S.Ct. 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p364\">\n     102 L.Ed.2d 714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Supervised release, for reasons already explained, is not fundamentally different and therefore should not be treated any differently for Sixth Amendment purposes. When a jury finds a federal defendant guilty of violating a particular criminal statute, the maximum period of confinement authorized is the maximum term of imprisonment plus the maximum term of supervised release. If a prisoner does not end up spending this full period in confinement, that is because service of part of the period is excused due to satisfactory conduct during the period of supervised release. Any other reading exalts form over substance in a way that has enormous consequences that cannot be justified on constitutional grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Once this is understood, it follows that the procedures that must be followed at a supervised-release revocation proceeding are the same that had to be followed at a parole revocation proceeding, and these were settled long ago. At a parole revocation hearing, the fundamental requisites of due process had to be observed, but a parolee did not have a right to a jury trial. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

There\n    is no good reason to depart from that understanding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The plurality tries to suggest a reason by sprinkling its opinion with quotations from venerable sources, but all are far afield. (John Adams was not writing about the Sixth Amendment when he made a diary entry in 1771 or when he wrote to William Pym in 1766. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2375 - 2376.) And the plurality makes no real effort to show that the Sixth Amendment was originally understood to require a jury trial in a proceeding like a supervised-release revocation proceeding. Of course, nothing like supervised release-or for that matter, parole-existed when the Sixth Amendment was ratified, so I will not attempt to make the affirmative case that the Sixth Amendment was specifically understood\n    <em>\n     not to apply\n    </em>\n    to such proceedings. But there is a strong case for the proposition that the terms of the Sixth Amendment and the original understanding of the scope of the jury trial right do not require the plurality's interpretation. And our prior precedents emphatically refute that interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Sixth Amendment limits the scope of the jury trial right in three significant ways: It provides \"\n    <em>\n     who\n    </em>\n    may assert the right ('the accused');\n    <em>\n     when\n    </em>\n    the right may be asserted ('[i]n all criminal prosecutions'); and\n    <em>\n     what\n    </em>\n    the right guarantees\" (\"the right to a ... trial, by an impartial jury\").\n    <em>\n     Rothgery v.

To be sure, he was\n    <em>\n     formerly\n    </em>\n    the accused-at the time when he was duly indicted and tried for possession of child pornography. But after a jury convicted him and authorized the judge to sentence him to terms of imprisonment and supervised release, respondent was transformed into the convicted. And his status as such remained the same while he served his sentences, including during the proceeding to determine whether he had adhered to the conditions\n    attached to the term of supervised release that was permitted by law and thus implicitly authorized by the jury's verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    This is especially so given that respondent's reimprisonment was not primarily a punishment for new criminal conduct. The principal reason for assigning a penalty to a supervised-release violation is not that the violative act is a crime (indeed, under other provisions in \u00a7 3583, the act need not even be criminal); rather, it is that the violative act is a breach of trust. USSG ch. 7, pt. A, intro. 3(b) (recommended reimprisonment terms are designed to \"sanction primarily the defendant's breach of trust,\" not \"new criminal conduct\"). In other words, it makes little sense to treat respondent as the accused-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , one charged with a crime-when he has been charged not with a crime, but with violating the terms of a jury-authorized sentence that flowed from his original conviction. The plurality's extension of the jury trial right to respondent's supervised-release revocation proceeding thus flounders from the start for the simple reason that respondent cannot easily be viewed as an \"accused\" in the conventional sense of the term.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    It is similarly awkward to characterize a supervised-release revocation proceeding as part of the defendant's \"criminal prosecution.\" A supervised-release revocation proceeding is not part of the criminal prosecution that landed a defendant in prison in the first place because \"[a] 'criminal prosecution' ... ends when sentence has been pronounced on the convicted or a verdict of 'Not guilty' has cleared the defendant of the charge.\" F. Heller, Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 54 (1951). This follows from the early understanding that a \"prosecution\" concludes when a court enters final judgment. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (defining a prosecution as the \"process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them\n    <em>\n     to final judgment\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis added)); The Universal English Dictionary 465 (J.

There is no evidence that there was a right to a jury trial at such proceedings, and the plurality does not even attempt to prove otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Corporal punishment of prisoners is also inconsistent with the plurality's suggestion that a convicted criminal has the right to a jury trial before a punishment is imposed for legally proscribed conduct. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2376. Well into the 19th century, prisoners were whipped for misbehavior. See Friedman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 37, 77, n. *; M. Kann, Punishment, Prisons, and Patriarchy 120, 182 (2005). Virginia law, for example, provided\n    that a prisoner could be punished \"by stripes\" if he were guilty of \"profanity, indecent behavior, idleness, neglect or willful mismanagement of work, insubordination, an assault not amounting to felony, or a violation of any of the rules prescribed by the governor.\" Va. Code, Tit. 56, ch. 213, \u00a7 22 (1849). Massachusetts law gave the warden \"all necessary means\" \"to suppress insurrection, enforce obedience, and maintain order in the prison,\" provided however \"that no convict shall be punished ... by more than ten stripes\" without meeting certain conditions. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. CXVIII, \u00a7 21 (1828). And even at the turn of the century, courts entertained imposition of reasonable corporal punishment provided that it was authorized by lawfully adopted rule or regulation.

See 4 Atty. Gen.'s Survey of Release Proc. 1 (1939) (Parole Survey); 2\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11265385\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/74/624/#p624\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 2 (Probation Survey).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The well-settled revocation power wielded by courts and other officials brings this point home. A violation of the conditions permitted not only the defendant's reimprisonment, see Parole Survey 4; Probation Survey 2, but several other penalties as well. In the parole context, these penalties most often included the forfeiture of good time credits-a reduction in prison time based on good behavior-that the parolees had accrued prior to their release on parole, as well as the forfeiture of any time served for the duration of their parole. Parole Survey 249-253; see also Friedman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 159 (stating in the context of 19th century good time laws that \"[t]o forfeit 'good time' was a terrible penalty\"). Many States also conditioned the future availability of parole on mandatory minimum terms of reimprisonment, and others even rendered certain parole violators ineligible for future parole. Parole Survey 255-258. And in the probation context, several courts refused to give credit for time spent on probation. Probation Survey 334-335, and n. 52. Thus, courts and parole boards could not only revoke conditional liberty but they could also subject violators to longer periods of\n    imprisonment and erase the fact that the violators had served a substantial portion of their lives on the streets under strict conditions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    From each of the foregoing examples, a clear historical fact emerges: American juries have simply played \"no role\" in the administration of previously imposed sentences.\n    <em>\n     Ice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679494\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/160/#p170\">\n     555 U.S. at 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679494\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/160/#p170\">\n     129 S.Ct. 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Two of the reasons seem to amount to the same thing-a worry that \u00a7 3583(k) imposes a new mandatory minimum sentence without a jury. And for the reasons we've already given, we can agree that this is indeed a problem under\n     <em>\n      Alleyne\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      .\n     </em>\n     But Justice BREYER's remaining reason is another story.

But why should\n     <em>\n      that\n     </em>\n     matter? Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated in \"discrete\" instances or vast numbers, our duty to enforce the Constitution remains the same. Besides, any attempt to draw lines based on when an erosion of the jury trial right goes \"too far\" would prove inherently subjective and depend on judges' intuitions about the proper role of the juries that are supposed to supervise them. As we have previously explained, \"[w]hether the Sixth Amendment incorporates [such a] manipulable standard rather than\n     <em>\n      Apprendi\n     </em>\n     's bright-line rule depends on the plausibility of the claim that the Framers would have left definition of the scope of jury power up to judges' intuitive sense of how far is too far.\"\n     <em>\n      Blakely v.

First, the plurality appears to concede that a jury trial is unnecessary where penalties for postjudgment conduct are not\n     <em>\n      too\n     </em>\n     harsh.\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2382 - 2383. I suspect that the prisoners who endured corporal punishment would have challenged the plurality's suggestion that their punishment was not that harsh. But in any event, a too-harsh standard-something that would appear to be more at home in an Eighth Amendment analysis-is hardly a principled way of determining whether a jury trial is constitutionally required. Second, the plurality suggests that my reasoning amounts to an extension of\n     <em>\n      Turner v. Safley\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/#p89\">\n      482 U.S. 78\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/#p89\">\n      107 S.Ct. 2254\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210045\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/78/#p89\">\n      96 L.Ed.2d 64\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (1987), because\n     <em>\n      Turner\n     </em>\n     addresses only the relaxation of a prisoner's constitutional rights and the Court has \"never extended it to the jury rights of persons out in the world who retain the core attributes of liberty.\"\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2383. But a convicted criminal on supervised release does not \"retain the core attributes of liberty,\"\n     <em>\n      ibid.,\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Turner\n     </em>\n     is not implicated here because, as I have shown, the Sixth Amendment does not apply and thus the criminal has no jury trial right that\n     <em>\n      Turner\n     </em>\n     might relax. And once again, more notable than the plurality's lack of real answers is its inability to point to any affirmative evidence that the jury ever played a historical role in the administration of previously imposed sentences.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
