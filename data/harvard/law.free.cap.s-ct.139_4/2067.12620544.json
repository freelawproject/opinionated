Eighty-nine years after the dedication of the Cross, respondents filed this lawsuit, claiming that they are offended by the sight of the memorial on public land and that its presence there and the expenditure of public funds to maintain it violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. To remedy this violation, they asked a federal court to order the relocation or demolition of the Cross or at least the removal of its arms. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the memorial is unconstitutional and remanded for a determination of the proper remedy. We now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the cross has long been a preeminent Christian symbol, its use in the Bladensburg memorial has a special significance. After the First World War, the picture of row after row of plain white crosses marking the overseas graves of soldiers who had lost their lives in that horrible conflict was emblazoned on the minds of Americans at home, and the adoption of the cross as the Bladensburg memorial must be viewed in that historical context. For nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the community's grief at the loss of the young men who perished, its thanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for which they fought. It has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of \"a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Van Orden v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n    545 U.S. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). And contrary to respondents' intimations, there is no evidence of discriminatory intent in the selection of the design of the memorial or the decision of a Maryland commission to maintain it. The Religion Clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously, and the presence of the Bladensburg Cross on the land where it has stood for so many years is fully consistent with that aim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The cross came into widespread use as a symbol of Christianity by the fourth century,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it retains that meaning today. But there are many contexts in which the symbol has also taken on a secular meaning. Indeed, there are instances in which its message is now almost entirely secular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A cross appears as part of many registered trademarks held by businesses and secular organizations, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Bayer Group, and some Johnson &amp; Johnson products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many of\n   these marks relate to health care, and it is likely that the association of the cross with healing had a religious origin. But the current use of these marks is indisputably secular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The familiar symbol of the Red Cross-a red cross on a white background-shows how the meaning of a symbol that was originally religious can be transformed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) selected that symbol in 1863 because it was thought to call to mind the flag of Switzerland, a country widely known for its neutrality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Swiss flag consists of a white cross on a red background. In an effort to invoke the message associated with that flag, the ICRC copied its design with the colors inverted. Thus, the ICRC selected this symbol for an essentially secular reason, and the current secular message of the symbol is shown by its use today in nations with only tiny Christian populations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the cross was originally chosen for the Swiss flag for religious reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   So an image that began as an expression of faith was transformed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The image used in the Bladensburg memorial-a plain Latin cross\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -also took on new meaning after World War I. \"During and immediately after the war, the army marked soldiers' graves with temporary wooden crosses or Stars of David\"-a departure from the prior practice of marking graves in American military cemeteries with uniform rectangular slabs. G. Piehler, Remembering War the American Way 101 (1995); App. 1146. The vast majority of these grave markers consisted of crosses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus when Americans saw photographs of these cemeteries, what struck them were rows and rows of plain white crosses. As a result, the image of a simple white cross \"developed into a 'central symbol' \" of the conflict.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . Contemporary literature, poetry, and art reflected this powerful imagery. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   10-16. Perhaps most famously, John McCrae's poem, In Flanders Fields, began with these memorable lines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on row.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Flanders Fields and Other Poems 3 (G. P. Putnam's Sons ed. 1919). The poem was enormously popular. See P. Fussell, The Great War and Modern Memory 248-249 (1975). A 1921 New York Times article quoted a description of McCrae's composition as \" 'the poem of the army' \" and \" 'of all those who understand the meaning of the great conflict.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The image of \"the crosses, row on row,\" stuck in people's minds, and even today for those who view World War I cemeteries in Europe, the image is arresting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the 1918 armistice, the War Department announced plans to replace the wooden crosses and Stars of David with uniform marble slabs like those previously used in American military cemeteries. App. 1146. But the public outcry against that proposal was swift and fierce. Many organizations, including the American War Mothers, a nonsectarian group founded in 1917, urged the Department to retain the design of the temporary markers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1146-1147. When the American Battle Monuments Commission took over the project of designing the headstones, it responded to this public sentiment by opting to replace the wooden crosses and Stars of David with marble versions of those symbols.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1144. A Member of Congress likewise introduced a resolution noting that \"these wooden symbols have, during and since the World War, been regarded as emblematic of the great sacrifices which that war entailed, have been so treated by poets and artists and have become peculiarly and inseparably associated in the thought of surviving relatives and comrades and of the Nation with these World War graves.\" H. Res. 15, 68th Cong., 1 (1924), App. 1163-1164. This national debate and its outcome confirmed the cross's widespread resonance as a symbol of sacrifice in the war.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Recognition of the cross's symbolism extended to local communities across the country. In late 1918, residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, formed a committee for the purpose of erecting a memorial for the county's fallen soldiers. App. 988-989, 1014. Among the committee's members were the mothers of 10 deceased soldiers.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 989. The committee decided that the memorial should be a cross and hired sculptor and architect John Joseph Earley to design it. Although we do not know precisely why the committee chose the cross, it is unsurprising that the committee-and many others commemorating World War I\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   -adopted a symbol so widely associated with that wrenching event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After selecting the design, the committee turned to the task of financing the project. The committee held fundraising events in the community and invited donations, no matter the size, with a form that read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-27\">\n   \"We, the citizens of Maryland, trusting in God, the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, Pledge Faith in our Brothers who gave their all in the World War to make [the] World Safe for Democracy. Their\n   Mortal Bodies have turned to dust, but their spirit Lives to guide us through Life in the way of Godliness, Justice and Liberty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"With our Motto, 'One God, One Country, and One Flag' We contribute to this Memorial Cross Commemorating the Memory of those who have not Died in Vain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at. 1251.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Many of those who responded were local residents who gave small amounts: Donations of 25 cents to 1 dollar were the most common.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1014. Local businesses and political leaders assisted in this effort.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1014, 1243. In writing to thank United States Senator John Walter Smith for his donation, committee treasurer Mrs. Martin Redman explained that \"[t]he chief reason I feel as deeply in this matter [is that], my son, [Wm.] F. Redman, lost his life in France and because of that I feel that our memorial cross is, in a way, his grave stone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1244.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Cross was to stand at the terminus of another World War I memorial-the National Defense Highway, which connects Washington to Annapolis. The community gathered for a joint groundbreaking ceremony for both memorials on September 28, 1919; the mother of the first Prince George's County resident killed in France broke ground for the Cross.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 910. By 1922, however, the committee had run out of funds, and progress on the Cross had stalled. The local post of the American Legion took over the project, and the monument was finished in 1925.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The completed monument is a 32-foot tall Latin cross that sits on a large pedestal. The American Legion's emblem is displayed at its center, and the words \"Valor,\" \"Endurance,\" \"Courage,\" and \"Devotion\" are inscribed at its base, one on each of the four faces. The pedestal also features a 9- by 2.5-foot bronze plaque explaining that the monument is \"Dedicated to the heroes of Prince George's County, Maryland who lost their lives in the Great War for the liberty of the world.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 915 (capitalization omitted). The plaque lists the names of 49 local men, both Black and White, who died in the war. It identifies the dates of American involvement, and quotes President Woodrow Wilson's request for a declaration of war: \"The right is more precious than peace. We shall fight for the things we have always carried nearest our hearts. To such a task we dedicate our lives.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the dedication ceremony, a local Catholic priest offered an invocation.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 217-218. United States Representative Stephen W. Gambrill delivered the keynote address, honoring the \" 'men of Prince George's County' \" who \" 'fought for the sacred right of all to live in peace and security.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 1372. He encouraged the community to look to the \" 'token of this cross, symbolic of Calvary,' \" to \" 'keep fresh the memory of our boys who died for a righteous cause.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The ceremony closed with a benediction offered by a Baptist pastor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since its dedication, the Cross has served as the site of patriotic events honoring veterans, including gatherings on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day. Like the dedication itself, these events have typically included an invocation, a keynote speaker, and a benediction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 182, 319-323. Over the years, memorials honoring the veterans of other conflicts have been added to the surrounding area, which is now known as Veterans Memorial Park. These include a World War II Honor Scroll; a Pearl Harbor memorial; a Korea-Vietnam veterans memorial; a September 11 garden; a War of 1812 memorial; and two recently added 38-foot-tall markers depicting British and American soldiers in the Battle of Bladensburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 891-903, 1530. Because the Cross is located on a traffic island with limited space, the closest of these other monuments is about 200 feet away in a park across the road.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 36, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the area around the Cross developed, the monument came to be at the center of a busy intersection. In 1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the Cross and the land on which it sits in order to preserve the monument and address traffic-safety concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 420-421, 1384-1387. The American Legion reserved the right to continue using the memorial to host a variety of ceremonies, including events in memory of departed veterans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1387. Over the next five decades, the Commission spent approximately $ 117,000 to maintain and preserve the monument. In 2008, it budgeted an additional $ 100,000 for renovations and repairs to the Cross.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In 2012, nearly 90 years after the Cross was dedicated and more than 50 years after the Commission acquired it, the American Humanist Association (AHA) lodged a complaint with the Commission. The complaint alleged that the Cross's presence on public land and the Commission's maintenance of the memorial violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1443-1451. The AHA, along with three residents of Washington, D. C., and Maryland, also sued the Commission in the District Court for the District of Maryland, making the same claim. The AHA sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring \"removal or demolition of the Cross, or removal of the arms from the Cross to form a non-religious slab or obelisk.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263867\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/195/#p202\">\n    874 F.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 202, n. 7 (C.A.4 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). The American Legion intervened to defend the Cross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commission and the American Legion. The Cross, the District Court held, satisfies both the three-pronged test announced in\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kurtzman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027402\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/602/\">\n    403 U.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test, a court must ask whether a\n   challenged government action (1) has a secular purpose; (2) has a \"principal or primary effect\" that \"neither advances nor inhibits religion\"; and (3) does not foster \"an excessive government entanglement with religion,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027402\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/602/\">\n    403 U.

Applying that test, the District Court determined that the Commission had secular purposes for acquiring and maintaining the Cross-namely, to commemorate World War I and to ensure traffic safety. The court also found that a reasonable observer aware of the Cross's history, setting, and secular elements \"would not view the Monument as having the effect of impermissibly endorsing religion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270349\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/373/#p387\">\n    147 F.Supp.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (D.Md. 2015). Nor, according to the court, did the Commission's maintenance of the memorial create the kind of \"continued and repeated government involvement with religion\" that would constitute an excessive entanglement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270349\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/373/#p387\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Finally, in light of the factors that informed its analysis of\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   's \"effects\" prong, the court concluded that the Cross is constitutional under Justice BREYER's approach in\n   <em>\n    Van Orden.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270349\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/373/#p387\">\n    147 F.Supp.3d at 388-390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. The majority relied primarily on the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test but also took cognizance of Justice BREYER's\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   concurrence. While recognizing that the Commission acted for a secular purpose, the court held that the Bladensburg Cross failed\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   's \"effects\" prong because a reasonable observer would view the Commission's ownership and maintenance of the monument as an endorsement of Christianity. The court emphasized the cross's \"inherent religious meaning\" as the \" 'preeminent symbol of Christianity.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263867\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/195/#p202\">\n    874 F.3d at 206-207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although conceding that the monument had several \"secular elements,\" the court asserted that they were \"overshadow[ed]\" by the Cross's size and Christian connection-especially because the Cross's location and condition would make it difficult for \"passers-by\" to \"read\" or otherwise \"examine\" the plaque and American Legion emblem.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263867\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/195/#p202\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263867\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/195/#p202\">\n    at 209-210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The community may come to value them without necessarily embracing their religious roots. The recent tragic fire at Notre Dame in Paris provides a striking example. Although the French Republic rigorously enforces a secular public square,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   the cathedral remains a symbol of national importance to the religious and nonreligious alike. Notre Dame is fundamentally a place of worship and retains great religious importance, but its meaning has broadened. For many, it is inextricably linked with the very idea of Paris and France.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Speaking to the nation shortly after the fire, President Macron said that Notre Dame \" 'is our history, our literature, our imagination.

Religion undoubtedly motivated those who named Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Las Cruces, New Mexico; Providence, Rhode Island; Corpus Christi, Texas; Nephi, Utah, and the countless other places in our country with names that are rooted in religion. Yet few would argue that this history requires that these names be erased from the map. Or take a motto like Arizona's, \"\n   <em>\n    Ditat Deus\n   </em>\n   \" (\"God enriches\"), which was adopted in 1864,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   or a flag like Maryland's, which has included two crosses since 1904.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Familiarity itself can become a reason for preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , when time's passage imbues a religiously expressive monument, symbol, or practice with this kind of familiarity and historical significance, removing it may no longer appear neutral, especially to the local community for which it has taken on particular meaning. A government that roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing\n   away any reference to the divine will strike many as aggressively hostile to religion. Militantly secular regimes have carried out such projects in the past,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for those with a knowledge of history, the image of monuments being taken down will be evocative, disturbing, and divisive.

(\"[D]isputes concerning the removal of longstanding depictions of the Ten Commandments from public buildings across the Nation ... could thereby create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   These four considerations show that retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices is quite different from erecting or adopting new ones. The passage of time gives rise to a strong presumption of constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The role of the cross in World War I memorials is illustrative of each of the four preceding considerations. Immediately following the war, \"[c]ommunities across America built memorials to commemorate those who had served the nation in the struggle to make the world safe for democracy.\" G. Piehler, The American Memory of War, App. 1124. Although not all of these communities included a cross in their memorials, the cross had become a symbol closely linked to the war. \"[T]he First World War witnessed a dramatic change in ... the symbols used to commemorate th[e] service\" of the fallen soldiers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1123. In the wake of the war, the United States adopted the cross as part of its military honors, establishing the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross in 1918 and 1919, respectively. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 147-148. And as already noted, the fallen soldiers' final resting places abroad were marked by white crosses or Stars of David. The solemn image of endless rows of white crosses became inextricably linked with and symbolic of the ultimate price paid by 116,000 soldiers. And this relationship between the cross and the war undoubtedly influenced the design of the many war memorials that sprang up across the Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This is not to say that the cross's association with the war was the sole or dominant motivation for the inclusion of the symbol in every World War I memorial that features it. But today, it is all but impossible to tell whether that was so. The passage of time means that testimony from those actually involved in the decisionmaking process is generally unavailable, and attempting to uncover their motivations invites rampant speculation. And no matter what the original purposes for the erection of a monument, a community may wish to preserve it for very different reasons, such as the historic preservation and traffic-safety concerns the Commission has pressed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition, the passage of time may have altered the area surrounding a monument in ways that change its meaning and provide new reasons for its preservation. Such changes are relevant here, since the Bladensburg Cross now sits at a busy traffic\n   intersection, and numerous additional monuments are located nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even the AHA recognizes that there are instances in which a war memorial in the form of a cross is unobjectionable. The AHA is not offended by the sight of the Argonne Cross or the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both Latin crosses commemorating World War I that rest on public grounds in Arlington National Cemetery. The difference, according to the AHA, is that their location in a cemetery gives them a closer association with individual gravestones and interred soldiers. See Brief for Respondents 96; Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   But a memorial's placement in a cemetery is not necessary to create such a connection. The parents and other relatives of many of the war dead lacked the means to travel to Europe to visit their graves, and the bodies of approximately 4,400 American soldiers were either never found or never identified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for many grieving relatives and friends, memorials took the place of gravestones. Recall that the mother of one of the young men memorialized by the Bladensburg Cross thought of the memorial as, \"in a way, his grave stone.\" App. 1244. Whether in a cemetery or a city park, a World War I cross remains a memorial to the fallen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Similar reasoning applies to other memorials and monuments honoring important figures in our Nation's history. When faith was important to the person whose life is commemorated, it is natural to include a symbolic reference to faith in the design of the memorial. For example, many memorials for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., make reference to his faith. Take the Martin Luther King, Jr. Civil Rights Memorial Park in Seattle, which contains a sculpture in three segments representing \"both the Christian Trinity and the union of the family.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Atlanta, the Ebenezer Baptist Church sits on the grounds of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park. National Statuary Hall in the Capitol honors a variety of religious figures: for example, Mother Joseph Pariseau kneeling in prayer; Po'Pay, a Pueblo religious leader with symbols of the Pueblo religion; Brigham Young, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and Father Eusebio Kino with a crucifix around his neck and his hand raised in blessing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   These monuments honor men and women who have played an important role in the history of our country, and where religious symbols are included in the monuments, their presence acknowledges the centrality of faith to those whose lives are commemorated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, as World War I monuments have endured through the years and become a familiar part of the physical and cultural landscape, requiring their removal would not be viewed by many as a neutral act. And an alteration like the one entertained by the Fourth Circuit-amputating the arms of the Cross, see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263867\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/195/#p202\">\n    874 F.3d at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n. 7 -would be seen by many as profoundly disrespectful. One member of the majority below viewed this objection as inconsistent with the claim that the Bladensburg Cross serves secular purposes, see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517039\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/117/\">\n    891 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wynn, J., concurring in denial of en banc), but this argument misunderstands\n   the complexity of monuments. A monument may express many purposes and convey many different messages, both secular and religious. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Van Orden\n   </em>\n   , 545 U.S. at 690,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion) (describing simultaneous religious and secular meaning of the Ten Commandments display). Thus, a campaign to obliterate items with religious associations may evidence hostility to religion even if those religious associations are no longer in the forefront.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For example, few would say that the State of California is attempting to convey a religious message by retaining the names given to many of the State's cities by their original Spanish settlers-San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Jose, San Francisco, etc. But it would be something else entirely if the State undertook to change all those names. Much the same is true about monuments to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country more than a century ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   Court ambitiously attempted to find a grand unified theory of the Establishment Clause, in later cases, we have taken a more modest approach that focuses on the particular issue at hand and looks to history for guidance.

It requested-and President Washington proclaimed-a national day of prayer, see 1 J. Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897, p. 64 (1897) (President Washington's Thanksgiving Proclamation), and it reenacted the Northwest Territory Ordinance, which provided that \"[r]eligion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2052\">\n    1 Stat. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n. (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). President Washington echoed this sentiment in his Farewell Address, calling religion and morality \"indispensable supports\" to \"political prosperity.\" Farewell Address (1796), in 35 The Writings of George\n   Washington 229 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940). See also P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 66 (2002). The First Congress looked to these \"supports\" when it chose to begin its sessions with a prayer. This practice was designed to solemnize congressional meetings, unifying those in attendance as they pursued a common goal of good governance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To achieve that purpose, legislative prayer needed to be inclusive rather than divisive, and that required a determined effort even in a society that was much more religiously homogeneous than ours today. Although the United States at the time was overwhelmingly Christian and Protestant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   there was considerable friction between Protestant denominations. See M. Noll, America's God: From Jonathan Edwards to Abraham Lincoln 228 (2002). Thus, when an Episcopal clergyman was nominated as chaplain, some Congregationalist Members of Congress objected due to the \" 'diversity of religious sentiments represented in Congress.' \" D. Davis, Religion and the Continental Congress 74 (2000). Nevertheless, Samuel Adams, a staunch Congregationalist, spoke in favor of the motion: \" 'I am no bigot. I can hear a prayer from a man of piety and virtue, who is at the same time a friend of his country.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2052\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Others agreed and the chaplain was appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Over time, the members of the clergy invited to offer prayers at the opening of a session grew more and more diverse. For example, an 1856 study of Senate and House Chaplains since 1789 tallied 22 Methodists, 20 Presbyterians, 19 Episcopalians, 13 Baptists, 4 Congregationalists, 2 Roman Catholics, and 3 that were characterized as \"miscellaneous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Four years later, Rabbi Morris Raphall became the first rabbi to open Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since then, Congress has welcomed guest chaplains from a variety of faiths, including Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American religions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece,\n   </em>\n   which concerned prayer before a town council meeting, there was disagreement about the inclusiveness of the town's practice.

But there was no disagreement that the Establishment Clause permits a nondiscriminatory practice of prayer at the beginning of a town council session. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"I believe that pluralism and inclusion [in legislative prayer] in a town hall can satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutrality\"). Of course, the specific practice challenged in\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   lacked the very direct connection, via the First Congress, to the thinking of those who were responsible for framing the First Amendment. But what mattered was that the town's practice \"fi[t] within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state\n   legislatures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 577,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of the Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The practice begun by the First Congress stands out as an example of respect and tolerance for differing views, an honest endeavor to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and a recognition of the important role that religion plays in the lives of many Americans. Where categories of monuments, symbols, and practices with a longstanding history follow in that tradition, they are likewise constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Applying these principles, we conclude that the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As we have explained, the Bladensburg Cross carries special significance in commemorating World War I. Due in large part to the image of the simple wooden crosses that originally marked the graves of American soldiers killed in the war, the cross became a symbol of their sacrifice, and the design of the Bladensburg Cross must be understood in light of that background. That the cross originated as a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in many contexts does not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular meaning when used in World War I memorials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Not only did the Bladensburg Cross begin with this meaning, but with the passage of time, it has acquired historical importance. It reminds the people of Bladensburg and surrounding areas of the deeds of their predecessors and of the sacrifices they made in a war fought in the name of democracy. As long as it is retained in its original place and form, it speaks as well of the community that erected the monument nearly a century ago and has maintained it ever since. The memorial represents what the relatives, friends, and neighbors of the fallen soldiers felt at the time and how they chose to express their sentiments. And the monument has acquired additional layers of historical meaning in subsequent years. The Cross now stands among memorials to veterans of later wars. It has become part of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The monument would not serve that role if its design had deliberately disrespected area soldiers who perished in World War I. More than 3,500 Jewish soldiers gave their lives for the United States in that conflict,\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   and some have wondered whether the names of any Jewish soldiers from the area were deliberately left off the list on the memorial or whether the names of any Jewish soldiers were included on the Cross against the wishes of their families. There is no evidence that either thing was done, and we do know that one of the local American Legion leaders responsible for the Cross's construction was a Jewish veteran. See App. 65, 205, 990.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The AHA's brief strains to connect the Bladensburg Cross and even the American Legion with anti-Semitism and the Ku Klux Klan, see Brief for Respondents 5-7, but the AHA's disparaging intimations have no evidentiary support. And when the events surrounding the erection of the Cross are viewed in historical context, a very different picture may perhaps be discerned. The monument was dedicated on July 12, 1925, during a period when the country was experiencing heightened racial and religious animosity. Membership in the Ku Klux Klan, which preached hatred of Blacks, Catholics, and Jews, was at its height.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 8, 1925, just two\n   weeks after the dedication of the Bladensburg Cross and less than 10 miles away, some 30,000 robed Klansmen marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in the Nation's Capital. But the Bladensburg Cross memorial included the names of both Black and White soldiers who had given their lives in the war; and despite the fact that Catholics and Baptists at that time were not exactly in the habit of participating together in ecumenical services, the ceremony dedicating the Cross began with an invocation by a Catholic priest and ended with a benediction by a Baptist pastor. App. 1559-1569, 1373. We can never know for certain what was in the minds of those responsible for the memorial, but in light of what we know about this ceremony, we can perhaps make out a picture of a community that, at least for the moment, was united by grief and patriotism and rose above the divisions of the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, it is surely relevant that the monument commemorates the death of particular individuals. It is natural and appropriate for those seeking to honor the deceased to invoke the symbols that signify what death meant for those who are memorialized. In some circumstances, the exclusion of any such recognition would make a memorial incomplete. This well explains why Holocaust memorials invariably include Stars of David or other symbols of Judaism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   It explains why a new memorial to Native American veterans in Washington, D. C., will portray a steel circle to represent \" 'the hole in the sky where the creator lives.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this is why the memorial for soldiers from the Bladensburg community features the cross-the same symbol that marks the graves of so many of their comrades near the battlefields where they fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol, but that fact should not blind us to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent. For some, that monument is a symbolic resting place for ancestors who never returned home. For others, it is a place for the community to gather and honor all veterans and their sacrifices for our Nation. For others still, it is a historical landmark. For many of these people, destroying or defacing the Cross that has stood undisturbed for nearly a century would not be neutral and would not further the ideals of respect and tolerance embodied in the First Amendment. For all these reasons, the Cross does not offend the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and remand the cases for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    B.

The Court's opinion eloquently explains why that is so: The Latin cross is uniquely associated with the fallen soldiers of World War I; the organizers of the Peace Cross acted with the undeniably secular motive of commemorating local soldiers; no evidence suggests that they sought to disparage or exclude any religious group; the secular values inscribed on the Cross and its place among other memorials strengthen its message of patriotism and commemoration; and, finally, the Cross has stood on the same land for 94 years, generating no controversy in the community until this lawsuit was filed. Nothing in the record suggests that the lack of public outcry \"was due to a climate of intimidation.\"\n    <em>\n     Van Orden\n    </em>\n    , 545 U.S. at 702,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2854\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). In light of all these circumstances, the Peace Cross cannot reasonably be understood as \"a government effort to favor a particular religious sect\" or to \"promote religion over nonreligion.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And, as the Court explains, ordering its removal or alteration at this late date would signal \"a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     at 704\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209788\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/677/#p704\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2854\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The case would be different, in my view, if there were evidence that the organizers had \"deliberately disrespected\" members of minority faiths or if the Cross had been erected only recently, rather than in the aftermath of World War I.

That practice does not violate the Establishment Clause, the Court has ruled.\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    does not explain those cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Today, the Court declines to apply\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    in a case in the religious symbols and religious speech category, just as the Court declined to apply\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    in\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Galloway\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Van Orden\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Marsh\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Chambers\n    </em>\n    . The Court's decision in this case again makes clear that the\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    test does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in that category. And the Court's decisions over the span of several decades demonstrate that the\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    test is not good law and does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in any of the five categories.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    On the contrary, each category of Establishment Clause cases has its own principles based on history, tradition, and precedent. And the cases together lead to an overarching set of principles: If the challenged government practice is not coercive\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    if it (i) is rooted in history and tradition; or (ii) treats religious people, organizations, speech, or activity equally to comparable secular people, organizations, speech, or activity; or (iii) represents a permissible legislative accommodation or exemption from a generally applicable law, then there ordinarily is no Establishment Clause violation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     *\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The practice of displaying religious memorials, particularly religious war memorials, on public land is not coercive and is rooted in history and tradition. The Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.

I agree with the Court that the Bladensburg Cross is constitutional. At the same time, I have deep respect for the plaintiffs' sincere objections to seeing the cross on public land. I have great respect for the Jewish war veterans who in an\n    <em>\n     amicus\n    </em>\n    brief say that the cross on public land sends a message of exclusion. I recognize their sense of distress and alienation. Moreover, I fully understand the deeply religious nature of the cross. It\n    would demean both believers and nonbelievers to say that the cross is not religious, or not all that religious. A case like this is difficult because it represents a clash of genuine and important interests. Applying our precedents, we uphold the constitutionality of the cross. In doing so, it is appropriate to also restate this bedrock constitutional principle: All citizens are equally American, no matter what religion they are, or if they have no religion at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The conclusion that the cross does not violate the Establishment Clause does not necessarily mean that those who object to it have no other recourse. The Court's ruling\n    <em>\n     allows\n    </em>\n    the State to maintain the cross on public land. The Court's ruling does not\n    <em>\n     require\n    </em>\n    the State to maintain the cross on public land. The Maryland Legislature could enact new laws requiring removal of the cross or transfer of the land. The Maryland Governor or other state or local executive officers may have authority to do so under current Maryland law. And if not, the legislature could enact new laws to authorize such executive action. The Maryland Constitution, as interpreted by the Maryland Court of Appeals, may speak to this question. And if not, the people of Maryland can amend the State Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Those alternative avenues of relief illustrate a fundamental feature of our constitutional structure: This Court is not the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    guardian of individual rights in America. This Court fiercely protects the individual rights secured by the U. S. Constitution. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <em>\n     West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.

But the Constitution sets a floor for the protection of individual rights. The constitutional floor is sturdy and often high, but it is a floor. Other federal, state, and local government entities generally possess authority to safeguard individual rights above and beyond the rights secured by the U. S. Constitution. See generally J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions (2018); Brennan, State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20489\">\n     90 Harv.

Although I agree that rigid application of the\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    test does not solve every Establishment Clause problem, I think that test's focus on purposes and effects is crucial in evaluating government action in this sphere-as this very suit shows. I therefore do not join Part II-A. I do not join Part II-D out of perhaps an excess of caution. Although I too \"look[ ] to history for guidance,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2087 (plurality opinion), I prefer at least for now to do so case-by-case, rather than to sign on to any broader statements about history's role in Establishment Clause analysis. But I find much to admire in this section of the opinion-particularly, its emphasis on whether longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices reflect \"respect and tolerance for differing views, an honest endeavor to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and a recognition of the important role that religion plays in the lives of many Americans.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2089. Here, as elsewhere, the opinion shows sensitivity to and respect for this Nation's pluralism, and the values of neutrality and inclusion that the First Amendment demands.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The Establishment Clause states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting\n    an establishment of religion.\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. The text and history of this Clause suggest that it should not be incorporated against the States. Even if the Clause expresses an individual right enforceable against the States, it is limited by its text to \"law[s]\" enacted by a legislature, so it is unclear whether the Bladensburg Cross would implicate any incorporated right. And even if it did, this religious display does not involve the type of actual legal coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion. Therefore, the Cross is clearly constitutional.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    As I have explained elsewhere, the Establishment Clause resists incorporation against the States.\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece v.

Today, the Court explains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to demand the destruction of longstanding monuments, and I find much of its opinion compelling. In my judgment, however, it follows from the Court's analysis that suits like this one should be dismissed for lack of standing. Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment to reverse and remand the court of appeals' decision, I would do so with additional instructions to dismiss the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The Association claims that its members \"regularly\" come into \"unwelcome direct contact\" with a World War I memorial cross in Bladensburg, Maryland \"while driving in the area.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263867\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/195/#p202\">\n     874 F.3d 195\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 203 (C.A.4 2017). And this, the Association suggests, is enough to allow it to insist on a federal judicial decree ordering the memorial's removal. Maybe, the Association concedes, others who are less offended lack standing to sue. Maybe others still who are equally affected but who come into contact with the memorial too infrequently lack standing as well. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48-49. But, the Association assures us, its members are offended enough-and with sufficient frequency-that they may sue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    This \"offended observer\" theory of standing has no basis in law. Federal courts may decide only those cases and controversies that the Constitution and Congress have authorized them to hear. And to establish standing to sue consistent with the Constitution, a plaintiff must show: (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.

The constitutionality of a practice doesn't depend on some artificial and indeterminate three-part test; what matters, the plurality reminds us, is whether the challenged practice fits \" 'within the tradition' \" of this country.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2088 (citing\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706999\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/565/\">\n     572 U.S. at 577\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 1811\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    I agree with all this and don't doubt that the monument before us is constitutional in light of the nation's traditions. But then the plurality continues on to suggest that \"longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices\" are \"presumpt[ively]\" constitutional.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2082. And about that, it's hard not to wonder: How old must a monument, symbol, or practice be to qualify for this new presumption? It seems 94 years is enough, but what about the Star of David monument erected in South Carolina in 2001 to commemorate victims of the Holocaust, or the cross that marines in California placed in 2004 to honor their comrades who fell during the War on Terror? And where exactly in the Constitution does this presumption come from? The plurality does not say, nor does it even explain what work its presumption does. To the contrary, the plurality proceeds to analyze the \"presumptively\" constitutional memorial in this case for its consistency with \" 'historical practices and understandings' \" under\n    <em>\n     Marsh\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece\n    </em>\n    -exactly the same approach that the plurality, quoting\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece\n    </em>\n    , recognizes \" 'must be' \" used\n    <em>\n     whenever\n    </em>\n    we interpret the Establishment Clause.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2087; see also\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2092 - 2094 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring). Though the plurality does not say so in as many words, the message for our lower court colleagues seems unmistakable: Whether a monument, symbol, or practice is old or new, apply\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece\n    </em>\n    , not\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    . Indeed, some of our colleagues recognize this implication and blanch at its prospect. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2091 (BREYER, J., concurring);\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 2094 (KAGAN, J., concurring in part) (declining to join Parts II-A &amp; II-D);\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , at 2104, n. 2 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But if that's the real message of the plurality's opinion, it seems to me exactly right-because what matters when it comes to assessing a monument, symbol, or practice isn't its age but its compliance with ageless principles. The Constitution's meaning is fixed, not some good-for-this-day-only coupon, and a practice consistent with our nation's traditions is just as permissible whether undertaken today or 94 years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    With\n    <em>\n     Lemon\n    </em>\n    now shelved, little excuse will remain for the anomaly of offended observer standing, and the gaping hole it tore in standing doctrine in the courts of appeals should now begin to close.

On November 11, 1918, the Great War ended. Bereaved families of American soldiers killed in the war sought to locate the bodies of their loved ones, and then to decide what to do with their remains. Once a soldier's body was identified, families could choose to have the remains repatriated to the United States or buried overseas in one of several American military cemeteries, yet to be established. Eventually, the remains of 46,000 soldiers were repatriated, and those of 30,000 soldiers were laid to rest in Europe. American Battle Monuments Commission, Annual Report to the President of the United States Fiscal Year 1925, p. 5 (1926) (ABMC Report).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    While overseas cemeteries were under development, the graves of American soldiers in Europe were identified by one of two temporary wooden markers painted white. Christian soldiers were buried beneath the cross; the graves of Jewish soldiers were marked by the Star of David. See L. Budreau, Bodies of War: World War I and the Politics of Commemoration in America, 1919-1933, p. 120 (2010). The remains of soldiers who were neither Christian nor Jewish could be repatriated to the United States for burial under an appropriate headstone.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    When the War Department began preparing designs for permanent headstones in 1919, \"no topic managed to stir more controversy than the use of religious symbolism.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 121-122. Everyone involved in the dispute, however, saw the Latin cross as a Christian symbol, not as a universal or secular one. To achieve uniformity, the War Department initially recommended replacing the temporary sectarian markers with plain marble slabs resembling \"those designed for the national cemeteries in the United States.\" Van Duyne, Erection of Permanent Headstones in the American Military Cemeteries in Europe, The Quartermaster Review (1930) (Quartermaster Report).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    The War Department's recommendation angered prominent civil organizations, including the American Legion and the Gold Star associations: the United States, they urged, ought to retain both the cross and Star of David. See\n    <em>\n     ibid.\n    </em>\n    ; Budreau,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 123. In supporting sectarian markers, these groups were joined by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), a newly created independent agency charged with supervising the establishment of overseas cemeteries. ABMC Report 57. Congress weighed in by directing the War Department to erect headstones \"of such design and material as may be agreed upon by the Secretary of War and the American Battle Monuments Commission.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).

A committee convened by the War Department composed of representatives from \"seven prominent war-time organizations\" as well as \"religious bodies, Protestant, Jewish, [and] Catholic\" agreed \"unanimous[ly] ... that marble crosses be placed on the graves of all\n    <em>\n     Christian\n    </em>\n    American dead buried abroad, and that the graves of the Jewish American dead be marked by the six-pointed star.\" Durable Markers in the Form of Crosses for Graves of American Soldiers in Europe, Hearings before the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 24 (1924) (emphasis added).
