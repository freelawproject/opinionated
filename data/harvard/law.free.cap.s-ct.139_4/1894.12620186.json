True, the AEA gives the Nuclear Regulatory Commission significant authority over the milling, transfer, use, and disposal of uranium, as well as the construction and operation of nuclear power plants. But Congress conspicuously chose to leave untouched the States' historic authority over the regulation of mining activities on private lands within their borders. Nor do we see anything to suggest that the enforcement of Virginia's law would frustrate the AEA's purposes and objectives. And we are hardly free to extend a federal statute to a sphere Congress was well aware of but chose to leave alone. In this, as in any field of statutory interpretation, it is our duty to respect not only what Congress wrote but, as importantly, what it didn't write.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Virginia Uranium thought its plan was pretty straightforward. First, the company wanted to use conventional mining techniques to extract raw uranium ore from a site near Coles Hill, Virginia. Next, it intended to mill that ore into a usable form. Typically performed at the mine site, milling involves grinding the ore into sand-sized grains and then exposing it to a chemical solution that leaches out pure uranium. Once dried, the resulting mixture forms a solid \"yellowcake,\" which the company planned to sell to enrichment facilities that produce fuel for nuclear reactors. Finally, because the leaching process does not remove all of the uranium from the ore, the company expected to store the leftover \"tailings\" near the mine to reduce the chances of contaminating the air or water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   But putting the plan into action didn't prove so simple. Pursuant to the AEA, ch. 724,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20755\">\n    60 Stat. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the NRC regulates milling\n   and tailing storage activities nationwide, and it has issued an array of rules on these subjects.

None of those, though, proved the real problem for Virginia Uranium. The company hit a roadblock even before it could get to the point where the NRC's rules kick in: State law flatly prohibits uranium mining in Virginia. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2045.1-161.292\">\n    Va.

The company alleged that, under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, the AEA preempts state uranium mining laws like Virginia's and ensconces the NRC as the lone regulator in the field. And because the NRC's regulations say nothing about uranium mining, the company continued, it remains free to mine as it will in Virginia or elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both the district court and a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit rejected the company's argument. The courts acknowledged that the AEA affords the NRC considerable authority over the nuclear fuel life cycle. But both courts found missing from the AEA any hint that Congress sought to strip States of their traditional power to regulate mining on private lands within their borders.

We examine these arguments about the AEA's preemptive effect much as we would any other about statutory meaning, looking to the text and context of the law in question and guided by the traditional tools of statutory interpretation. Here, no more than in any statutory interpretation dispute, is it enough for any party or court to rest on a supposition (or wish) that \"it must be in there somewhere.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin with the company's claim that the text and structure of the AEA reserve the regulation of uranium mining for the purpose of addressing nuclear safety concerns to the NRC alone-and almost immediately problems emerge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Unlike many federal statutes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the AEA contains no provision preempting state law in so many words. Even more pointedly, the statute grants the NRC extensive and sometimes exclusive authority to regulate nearly every aspect of the nuclear fuel life cycle\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   mining. Companies like Virginia Uranium must abide the NRC's rules and regulations if they wish to handle enriched uranium, to mill uranium ore or store tailings, or to build or run a nuclear power plant. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202111\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 2113(a), 2073. But when it comes to mining, the statute speaks very differently, expressly stating that the NRC's regulatory powers arise only \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   [uranium's] removal from its place of deposit in nature.\" \u00a7 2092 (emphasis added). As the government itself has conceded, this means that \"uranium mining\" lies \"outside the NRC's jurisdiction,\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   14, and the agency's grip takes hold only \"at the mill, rather than at the mine,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hydro Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.R.C.%20510\">\n    63 N. R. C. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   What the text states, context confirms. After announcing a general rule that mining regulation lies outside the NRC's jurisdiction, the AEA carves out a notably narrow exception. On\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   lands, the statute says, the NRC may regulate uranium mining. \u00a7 2097. And if the federal government wants to control mining of uranium on\n   <em>\n    private\n   </em>\n   land, the AEA tells the NRC exactly what to do: It may purchase or seize the land by eminent domain and\n   <em>\n    make\n   </em>\n   it federal land. \u00a7 2096. Congress thus has spoken directly to the question of uranium mining on private land, and every bit of what it's said indicates that state authority remains untouched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later amendments to the AEA point to the same conclusion. Some years after the statute's passage, Congress added a provision, currently codified in \u00a7 2021, allowing the NRC to devolve certain of its regulatory powers to the States. Unsurprisingly, Congress indicated that the NRC must maintain regulatory control over especially sensitive activities like the construction of nuclear power plants. \u00a7 2021(c). But under \u00a7 2021(b) the NRC may now, by agreement, pass to the States some of its preexisting authorities to regulate various nuclear materials \"for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.\" Out of apparent concern that courts might (mis)read these new provisions as prohibiting States from regulating any activity even tangentially related to nuclear power without first reaching an agreement with the NRC, Congress added subsection (k):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Nothing in this section [that is, \u00a7 2021] shall be construed to affect the authority of any State or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 2021, thus, did nothing to extend the NRC's power to activities, like mining, historically beyond its reach. Instead, it served only to allow the NRC to share with the States some of the powers previously reserved to the federal government. Even then, the statute explained in subsection (k) that States remain free to regulate the activities discussed in \u00a7 2021 for purposes\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   nuclear safety without the NRC's consent. Indeed, if anything, subsection (k) might be described as a\n   <em>\n    non-preemption\n   </em>\n   clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Virginia Uranium's case hinges on a very different construction of subsection (k). The company suggests that, properly\n   read, the provision greatly expands the preemptive effect of the AEA and demands the displacement of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   state law (touching on mining or any other subject) if that law was enacted for the purpose of protecting the public against \"radiation hazards.\" And, the company adds, Virginia's law bears just such an impermissible purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In our view, this reading nearly turns the provision on its head. Subsection (k) does not displace traditional state regulation over mining or otherwise extend the NRC's grasp to matters previously beyond its control. It does not expose every state law on every subject to a searching judicial inquiry into its latent purposes. Instead and much more modestly, it clarifies that \"nothing in this [new] section [2021]\"-a section allowing for the devolution-by-agreement of federal regulatory authority-should be construed to curtail the States' ability to regulate the activities discussed in that\n   <em>\n    same section\n   </em>\n   for purposes other than protecting against radiation hazards. So only state laws that seek to regulate the activities discussed in \u00a7 2021 without an NRC agreement-activities like the construction of nuclear power plants-may be scrutinized to ensure their purposes aim at something other than regulating nuclear safety. Really, to accomplish all it wants, Virginia Uranium would have to persuade us to read 13 words out of the statute and add 2 more:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">\n   <s>\n    Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of\n   </s>\n   any State or local agency\n   <s>\n    to\n   </s>\n   <strong>\n    may\n   </strong>\n   regulate activities\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That may be a statute some would prefer, but it is not the statute we have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Just consider what would follow from Virginia Uranium's interpretation. Not only would States be prohibited from regulating uranium mining to protect against radiation hazards; the federal government likely would be barred from doing so as well. After all, the NRC has long believed, and still maintains, that the AEA affords it no authority to regulate uranium mining on private land. Nor does Virginia Uranium dispute the federal government's understanding. Admittedly, if Virginia Uranium were to prevail here, the NRC might respond by changing course and seeking to regulate uranium mining for the first time. But given the statute's terms, the prospects that it might do so successfully in the face of a legal challenge appear gloomy. Admittedly, as well, federal air and water and other regulations might apply at a uranium mine much as at any other workplace. But the possibility that both state and federal authorities would be left unable to regulate the unique risks posed by an activity as potentially hazardous as uranium mining seems more than a little unlikely, and quite a lot to find buried deep in subsection (k). Talk about squeezing elephants into mouseholes. See\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

Along the way, the Court expressly dismissed the notion that \u00a7 2021 establishes the federal government as \"the sole regulator of all matters nuclear.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 205,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court observed that subsection (k) addresses itself only to \"the preemptive effect of 'this section,' that is [\u00a7 2021].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 210,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court acknowledged that subsection (k) does not \"cut back on pre-existing state authority outside the NRC's jurisdiction,\" a field that surely includes uranium mining.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 209,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . None of this remotely helps Virginia Uranium's cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Still, Virginia Uranium seeks to make the best of a bad situation. The company points out that\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas\n   </em>\n   upheld the state law at issue there only after observing that it was enacted out of concern with economic development, not for the purpose of addressing radiation safety hazards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 205,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From this, the company reasons, we should infer that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   state law enacted with the purpose of addressing nuclear hazards must fall thanks to our precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But even that much does not follow. Since the passage of the AEA, the NRC has always played a significant role in regulating the construction of nuclear power plants. Indeed, under \u00a7 2021(c) this remains one area where the NRC generally cannot devolve its responsibilities to the States. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 197-198, 206-207,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And because \u00a7 2021 classifies the construction of nuclear power plants as one of the core remaining areas of special federal concern, any state law regulating that activity risks being subjected to an inquiry into its purposes under subsection (k). But the activity Virginia's law regulates-mining on private land-isn't one the AEA has ever addressed, and it isn't one \u00a7 2021 discusses, so subsection (k) does not authorize any judicial inquiry into state legislative purpose in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Admittedly, there is a wrinkle here.\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas\n   </em>\n   seemed to accept California's argument that its law addressed\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   new power plants may be built, while the NRC's regulatory power under \u00a7 2021(c) extends only to the question\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   such plants are constructed and operated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 212,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And accepting (without granting) these premises, it would appear that California's law did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   implicate an activity addressed by \u00a7 2021, so an inquiry into state legislative purpose under subsection (k) was not statutorily authorized. Yet\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas\n   </em>\n   inquired anyway, perhaps on the unstated belief that the state law just came \"too close\" to a core power \u00a7 2021(c) reserves to the federal government. Does that mean we must do the same? Certainly Virginia Uranium sees it that way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We do not. Just because\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas\n   </em>\n   may have made more of state legislative purposes than the terms of the AEA allow does not mean we must make more of them yet. It is one thing to do as\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas\n   </em>\n   did and inquire exactingly into state legislative purposes when state law prohibits a regulated activity like the construction of a nuclear plant, and thus comes close to trenching on core federal powers reserved to the federal government by the AEA. It is another thing to do as Virginia Uranium wishes and impose the same exacting scrutiny on state laws prohibiting an activity like mining far removed from the NRC's historic powers. And without some clearer congressional mandate suggesting an inquiry like that would be appropriate, we decline to undertake it on our own authority.

In doing so, the Court did not inquire into state legislative purposes, apparently because it thought state tort law (unlike a law prohibiting the construction of a nuclear power plant) fell beyond any fair understanding of the NRC's reach under the AEA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197835\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/238/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 251,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197835\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/238/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consider just some of the costs to cooperative federalism and individual liberty we would invite by inquiring into state legislative purpose too precipitately. The natural tendency of regular federal judicial inquiries into state legislative intentions would be to stifle deliberation in state legislatures and encourage resort to secrecy and subterfuge. That would inhibit the sort of open and vigorous legislative debate that our Constitution recognizes as vital to testing ideas and improving laws. In Virginia Uranium's vision as well, federal courts would have to allow depositions of state legislators and governors, and perhaps hale them into court for cross-examination at trial about their subjective motivations in passing a mining statute. And at the end of it all, federal courts would risk subjecting similarly situated persons to radically different legal rules as judges uphold and strike down materially identical state regulations based only on the happenstance of judicial assessments of the \"true\" intentions lurking behind them. In light of all this, it can surprise no one that our precedents have long warned against undertaking potential misadventures into hidden state legislative intentions without a clear statutory mandate for the project.

We don't, the company says, because Virginia has admitted that it enacted its law with the (impermissible) purpose of protecting the public from nuclear safety hazards. But the Commonwealth denies making any such admission. Instead, it says it has merely accepted as true the allegations in the company's complaint about the intentions animating state law for purposes of the Commonwealth's own motion to dismiss this suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). If the case were to proceed beyond the pleadings stage, Virginia insists, a more searching judicial inquiry into the law's motivation would be inevitable. Whoever may be right about the status of Virginia's admissions in this case, though, the point remains that following Virginia Uranium's lead would require serious intrusions into state legislative processes in future cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Beyond these concerns, as well, lie well-known conceptual and practical ones this Court has also advised against inviting unnecessarily. State legislatures are composed of individuals who often pursue legislation for multiple and unexpressed\n   purposes, so what legal rules should determine when and how to ascribe a particular intention to a particular legislator? What if an impermissible intention existed but wasn't necessary to her vote? And what percentage of the legislature must harbor the impermissible intention before we can impute it to the collective institution? Putting all that aside, how are courts supposed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into these questions when recorded state legislative history materials are often not as readily available or complete as their federal counterparts? And if trying to peer inside legislators' skulls is too fraught an enterprise, shouldn't we limit ourselves to trying to glean legislative purposes from the statutory text where we began? Even\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas\n   </em>\n   warned future courts against too hastily accepting a litigant's invitation to \"become embroiled in attempting to ascertain\" state legislative \"motive[s],\" acknowledging that such inquiries \"often\" prove \"unsatisfactory venture[s]. What motivates one legislator to vote for a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298336\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/190/\">\n    461 U.

On Virginia Uranium's account, Congress sought to capture the benefits of developing nuclear power while mitigating its safety and environmental costs. And, the company contends, Virginia's moratorium disrupts the delicate \"balance\" Congress sought to achieve between these benefits and costs. Maybe the text of the AEA doesn't touch on mining in so many words, but its authority to regulate later stages of the nuclear fuel life cycle would be effectively undermined if mining laws like Virginia's were allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    A sound preemption analysis cannot be as simplistic as that. No more than in field preemption can the Supremacy Clause be deployed here to elevate abstract and unenacted legislative desires above state law; only federal laws \"made in pursuance of\" the Constitution, through its prescribed processes of bicameralism and presentment, are entitled to preemptive effect.

Efforts to ascribe unenacted purposes and objectives to a federal statute face many of the same challenges as inquiries into state legislative intent. Trying to discern what motivates legislators individually and collectively invites speculation and risks overlooking the reality that individual Members of Congress often pursue multiple and competing purposes, many of which are compromised to\n    secure a law's passage and few of which are fully realized in the final product. Hefty inferences may be required, as well, when trying to estimate whether Congress would have wanted to prohibit States from pursuing regulations that may happen to touch, in various degrees and different ways, on unenacted federal purposes and objectives. Worse yet, in piling inference upon inference about hidden legislative wishes we risk displacing the legislative compromises actually reflected in the statutory text-compromises that sometimes may seem irrational to an outsider coming to the statute cold, but whose genius lies in having won the broad support our Constitution demands of any new law. In disregarding these legislative compromises, we may only wind up displacing perfectly legitimate state laws on the strength of \"purposes\" that only we can see, that may seem perfectly logical to us, but that lack the democratic provenance the Constitution demands before a federal law may be declared supreme.

It may be that Congress meant the AEA to balance that goal against various safety concerns. But it also may be that Members of Congress held many other disparate or conflicting goals in mind when they voted to enact and amend the AEA, and many different views on exactly how to manage the competing costs and benefits. If polled, they might have reached very different assessments, as well, about the consistency of Virginia's law with their own purposes and objectives. The only thing a court can be sure of is what can be found in the law itself. And every indication in the law before us suggests that Congress elected to leave mining regulation on private land to the States and grant the NRC regulatory authority only\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    uranium is removed from the earth. That compromise may not be the only permissible or even the most rationally attractive one, but it is surely both permissible and rational to think that Congress might have chosen to regulate the more novel aspects of nuclear power while leaving to States their traditional function of regulating mining activities on private lands within their boundaries.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    As an alternative to proceeding down the purposes-and-objectives branch of conflict preemption, Virginia Uranium might have pursued another.

But Virginia Uranium hasn't pursued an argument along any of these lines, and understandably so.

Defining the preempted field by reference to the purpose for which state laws were enacted finds \"some support in the text of the [AEA],\"\n    <em>\n     English\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121785\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/72/\">\n     496 U.

Again, this provision states that \"[n]othing in [ \u00a7 2021 ] shall be construed to affect the authority of any State ... to regulate activities\n    <em>\n     for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) Section 2021(k) presupposes federal preemption of at least some state laws enacted to guard \"against radiation hazards.\" Virginia Uranium and the dissent read this subsection to include within the preempted sphere\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    state laws motivated by concerns about the radiation hazards of NRC-regulated activities.

The Commonwealth Defendants would exclude from federal foreclosure state laws directed to activities not regulated by the NRC.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34. The Commonwealth Defendants have the better reading of the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    1\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Commonwealth has forbidden only conventional uranium mining on private land, an activity all agree is not federally regulated.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 9-10, 17-18, 30. The controlling AEA provision, \u00a7 2092, triggers federal regulation only when source material is \"remov[ed] from its place of deposit in nature.\" Federal authorities have long read that provision to preclude federal regulation of conventional uranium mining.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1901 - 1902;\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1910 - 1911. In contrast to the AEA's express provisions for uranium mining on public lands, \u00a7\u00a7 2097-2098, the Act is nearly silent about conventional uranium mining on private lands. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1901 - 1903. Indeed, insofar as the Act addresses private conventional mining, it does so to bar federal regulators from obtaining reports about ore \"prior to removal from its place of deposit in nature.\" \u00a7 2095. Every indication, then, is that Congress left private conventional mining unregulated. And if Congress did not provide for regulation of private conventional mining, it is hard to see how or why state law on the subject would be preempted, whatever the reason for the law's enactment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    2\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Virginia Uranium's argument to the contrary rests on \u00a7 2021(k), but that provision, correctly read, lends no support for Virginia Uranium's cause. By its terms,\n    \u00a7 2021(k) addresses only state authority to regulate \"activities\" for nonradiological purposes. Read in context of \u00a7 2021 as a whole, \"activities\" means activities\n    <em>\n     regulated by the NRC\n    </em>\n    . See \u00a7 2021(c), (\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    ), (m), (\n    <em>\n     o\n    </em>\n    ) ;\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1902 ( \u00a7 2021(k)\"might be described as a\n    <em>\n     non-preemption\n    </em>\n    clause\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The AEA's context and history are corroborative. Prior to enactment of \u00a7 2021(k), the Federal Government and States shared responsibility for most steps of the nuclear fuel cycle, with the former regulating primarily for public health and safety, and the latter regulating for economic and other nonradiological purposes. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1910 -1911.

Given this aim, \u00a7 2021(k) is most sensibly read to clarify that the door newly opened for state regulation left in place pre-existing state authority \"to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\" See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1902. The House and Senate Reports are explicit on this point: Section \u00a7 2021(k) was \"intended to make it clear that the bill does not impair the State[s'] authority to regulate activities of [federal] licensees for the manifold health, safety, and economic purposes other than radiation protection\"; the bill simply provides a means for States to obtain heretofore exclusively federal authority to regulate these activities for \"protection against radiation hazards.\" S.

That's because the lead opinion sets out to defeat an argument that no one made, reaching a conclusion with which no one disagrees. Specifically, the opinion devotes its analysis to whether the field of uranium mining safety is preempted under the Atomic Energy Act, ultimately concluding that it is not. But no party disputes that. Rather, the question we agreed to address is whether a State can purport to regulate a field that is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    preempted (uranium mining safety) as an indirect means of regulating other fields that\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    preempted (safety concerns about uranium milling and tailings). And on that question, our precedent is clear: The AEA prohibits state laws that have the purpose and effect of regulating preempted fields.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    As relevant here, processing uranium ore involves three steps: mining, milling, and storing \"tailings.\"\n    <em>\n     Mining\n    </em>\n    is the extracting of uranium ore from the ground;\n    <em>\n     milling\n    </em>\n    is the process of turning the substance into a usable form; and\n    <em>\n     tailings\n    </em>\n    are the leftover radioactive waste that must be safely stored.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    There is no dispute over which of these fields the AEA reserves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The parties agree that the field of uranium\n    <em>\n     mining\n    </em>\n    safety is not preempted. See Brief for Petitioners 3, 22, n. 4, 27; Reply Brief 8; Brief for Respondents 1; Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    4, 14. And it is undisputed that radiological safety concerns about\n    <em>\n     milling\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     tailings\n    </em>\n    are preempted fields. See Brief for Petitioners 32; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37 (counsel for respondents); Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    23. Indeed, that shared understanding was the basis of the question presented.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Despite all this, the lead opinion insists that petitioners (hereafter the company) press an entirely different argument. \"Before us, Virginia Uranium contends that the AEA (and only the AEA) unseats state\n    uranium mining regulations,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1901, but \"almost immediately problems emerge,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1901. Problems do immediately emerge in the opinion, but they are of its own making. The company does not argue that the AEA reserves the field of uranium\n    <em>\n     mining\n    </em>\n    safety. After attributing this failing argument to the company, the lead opinion then proceeds to explain why the argument must, in fact, fail. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at 1901 - 1905.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Turning to the question presented, however, the company's theory of the case is fairly straightforward. The property at issue here contains the largest known uranium deposit in the country and one of the largest in the world.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Shortly after its discovery, Virginia enacted a complete ban on uranium mining. According to the company, the ban was not motivated by concerns about mining safety. Instead, it was motivated by Virginia's desire to ban the more hazardous steps that come after mining-uranium milling and the storage of radioactive tailings-due to the Commonwealth's disagreement with the NRC over how to safely regulate those activities. And, crucially, Virginia has yet to put forward any other rationale to support the ban.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, the question before us is whether, consistent with the AEA and our precedents, the Commonwealth may purport to regulate a non-preempted field (mining safety) with the purpose and effect of indirectly regulating a preempted field (milling and tailings). That should have made for an easy case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Under our AEA precedents, a state law is preempted not only when it \"conflicts with federal law,\" but also when its\n    <em>\n     purpose\n    </em>\n    is to regulate within a preempted field.\n    <em>\n     Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

See\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1905 - 1906. Virginia contends that if the case were to proceed past the pleadings stage, it could establish a nonsafety rationale for the ban. See Brief for Respondents 47. That may well be true. See\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202012\">\n       id.,\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202012\">\n      at 1905\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (discussing environmental concerns).

See\n     <em>\n      ante\n     </em>\n     , at 1915, n. 4. Instead, the concurrence contends, the difference is that here the Commonwealth \"regulated an activity, conventional uranium mining, that Congress left to state regulation.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202012\">\n       Ibid.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     But that is equally true in\n     <em>\n      National Meat\n     </em>\n     , where the State had likewise regulated an activity, the sale of meat, that Congress left to state regulation. See 565 U. S. at 463,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186528,12446027\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/452/\">\n      132 S.Ct. 965\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The concurrence and lead opinion also note that\n     <em>\n      National Meat\n     </em>\n     involved an \"express\" preemption provision whereas this case does not.\n     <em>\n      Ante\n     </em>\n     , at 1906, n. 3 (lead opinion);\n     <em>\n      ante\n     </em>\n     , at 1914 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). But they do not explain why that matters, and there's no reason it should. In both cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the State regulated an undisputedly non-preempted activity as an indirect means to regulate an undisputedly preempted activity.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
