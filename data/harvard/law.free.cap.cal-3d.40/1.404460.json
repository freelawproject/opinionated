After considering the motions and accompanying affidavits, the trial court ruled in favor of the city, concluding that all three of the challenged fees were imposed \u201cto pay for the cost of financing new capital improvements to serve the new facilities and population anticipated through development\u201d and constituted \u201ca reasonable exercise of the police power.\u201d Plaintiff appealed, but challenged only that portion of the judgment upholding the validity of the Growth Requirements Capital Fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">While the appeal was pending, the city amended the challenged Growth Requirements Capital Fee ordinance (Ord. No. 1876), clarifying the uses to which the proceeds from the fee may be put and significantly modifying the formula under which each individual fee is to be calculated.  Although plaintiff contends that the modification of the ordinance has no bearing on this appeal, past California decisions establish that in proceedings of this nature\u2014where injunctive relief against a legislative enactment is sought\u2014the relevant provision for purposes of the appeal is the measure which is in effect at the time the appeal is decided. <em>(Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 294, 306, fn. 6 [138 Cal.Rptr. 53, 562 P.2d 1302]; see also <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>City of San Juan Capistrano </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 72, 77-78 [191 Cal.Rptr. 47].)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Plaintiff nevertheless urges us to determine the validity of the old ordinance for the benefit of developers who paid the fee pursuant to its terms and who might be entitled to a refund if it is invalid. We see no need for passing on the validity of the old ordinance in this proceeding. Plaintiff is an association which merely sought to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. No specific fee is at issue, and thus there is no aggrieved party with regard to the old ordinance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Since the trial court has never passed on the validity of the new ordinance, we reverse the judgment for reconsideration in light of the new ordinance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Indeed, no specific fee may ever be at issue. Until legislation enacted in 1984 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65913.5), case law had indicated that the procedure for challenging an allegedly unreasonable fee or condition was to refuse to comply with the condition and to bring a mandate action to have the condition declared invalid. <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 128 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111] <em>County of Imperial </em>v. <em>McDougal </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 505, 510-511 [138 Cal.Rptr. 472, 564 P.2d 14]; <em>Pfeiffer </em>v. <em>City of La Mesa </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 74, 77-78 [137 Cal.Rptr. 804].) A landowner who complied with the conditions of a permit was said to have waived the right to bring a later legal challenge against the conditions. <em>(Pfeiffer </em>v. <em>City of La Mesa, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d at p. 78.) The only exception recognized was where a new ordinance imposed fee conditions on a permit necessary for a later phase of a development that was already underway. <em>(McLain Western #1 </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 772, <em>777 </em>[194 Cal.Rptr. 594].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-4\">We do not encourage a city engaged in litigation to adopt a new ordinance as a means of avoiding judicial review. The record in the present case shows, however, that the amendment of the ordinance was a good faith effort on the part of the city to make its impact more equitable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
