J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApT\">Who should bear the loss when a bona fide purchaser relies on a vehicle certificate of ownership which fails to disclose that the vehicle is subject to a perfected security interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">On July 27, 1979, Shirl and Edward E. Morgan obtained from defendant, United California Bank (UCB),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a personal loan for $17,146 to finance the purchase of a mobilehome. The Morgans granted UCB a security interest in the mobilehome to secure repayment of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">On August 6, 1979, UCB mailed to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) a request for issuance of a new certificate of ownership showing UCB as the legal owner. The necessary fees and the existing certificate, properly endorsed by the Morgans, were enclosed. That day or soon thereafter, bank personnel made an entry in a UCB computer to remind them in 90 days to confirm that the DMV had issued an accurate certificate of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">On October 15, 1979, the DMV issued a certificate of ownership showing the Morgans as the registered owners of the mobilehome. Although UCB had properly requested issuance of a certificate showing it as the legal owner, the space reserved for the \u201clienholder\u201d and \u201clegal owner\u201d was mistakenly left blank. Thus, the certificate did not disclose UCB\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">On November 20, 1979, Shirl Morgan offered to sell the mobilehome to plaintiff, T &amp; O Mobile Homes, Inc. (T&amp;O), a dealer in used mobilehomes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>She did not inform T&amp;O that UCB was the legal owner. Relying on the \u201cclean\u201d certificate of ownership, T&amp;O purchased the mobilehome for $7,000 cash. Shirl Morgan endorsed the certificate and delivered it to T&amp;O.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">T&amp;O\u2019s status as a bona fide purchaser was undisputed. The parties stipulated that T&amp;O had no actual notice of the existence of UCB\u2019s security interest when it purchased the mobilehome. It was also stipulated that T&amp;O would not have made the purchase had it known of UCB\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On December 6, 1979, the DMV sent a letter to the Morgans, with copies to T&amp;O and UCB, which stated that the October 15th certificate of ownership had been incorrectly issued and was invalid. The letter indicated that a new certificate would be issued listing UCB as the legal owner. The new certificate was issued to UCB on December 21, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">After UCB demanded possession of the mobilehome, T&amp;O brought an action against UCB.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> T&amp;O sought a judgment declaring it the legal owner and enjoining UCB from repossessing the mobilehome. A court trial was held. The court found that UCB\u2019s security interest had been perfected and was prior to the interest of T&amp;O. Judgment was entered declaring UCB the legal owner. T&amp;O appeals that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Division 9 (\u00a7\u00a7 9101-9508) of the California Uniform Commercial Code \u201csets out a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of security interests in personal property.\u201d (Official com. to Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 9101.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 9201 provides that, except as provided otherwise by the Code, \u201ca security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, <em>against purchasers of the collateral </em>and against creditors.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A security interest attaches and becomes enforceable when (1) either the debtor has signed a security agreement or the secured party is in possession of the collateral, (2) value has been given, and (3) the debtor has rights in the collateral. (\u00a7 9203.) These conditions were satisfied on July 27, 1979, when the Morgans signed the security agreement and received the loan proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To be effective against a purchaser of the collateral, a security interest in goods must also have been \u201cperfected\u201d prior to the purchase.  An unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of \u201ca person who is not a secured party and who is a . . . buyer not in ordinary course of business to the extent that he gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected.\u201d (\u00a7 9301, subd. (l)(c).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">For most kinds of goods, a security interest is perfected when it has attached and a financing statement has been filed in the office of the Secretary of State. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9303, 9401.) However, the filing provisions of the UCC are not applicable to noninventory mobilehomes. (See \u00a7 9302, subd. (3)(b).)5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of the transactions at issue here, perfection of a security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>interest in a noninventory mobilehome was governed exclusively by the provisions of section 6301 of the Vehicle Code. That section provides that \u201c[w]hen the secured party, his or her successor, or his or her assignee, has deposited with the department a properly endorsed certificate of ownership showing the secured party as legal owner or an application in usual form for an original registration, together with an application for registration of the secured party as legal owner, the deposit constitutes perfection of the security interest and the rights of all persons in the vehicle shall be subject to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See also Veh. Code, \u00a7 6303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">As previously noted, the UCC provides that a perfected security interest is generally effective against a purchaser of the collateral. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9201, 9301, subd. (l)(c), but see \u00a7 9307, subd. (1).) This rule is premised upon the assumption that the filing of a financing statement with the Secretary of State will permit prospective purchasers and encumbrancers to ascertain the existence of security interests in the property by checking a centralized record system. In other words, the UCC\u2019s perfection system, like the title recordation systems employed for real property, is based on constructive notice given through recordation. (See Note, <em>Security Interests in Motor Vehicles Under the UCC: A New Chassis for Certificate of Title Legislation </em>(1961) 70 Yale L.J. 995, 1005 [hereafter <em>Security Interests in Motor Vehicles].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">By contrast, the special scheme employed for the registration of security interests in motor vehicles relies primarily on <em>actual </em>notice to subsequent purchasers through a certificate of ownership held by the seller. (See <em>Security Interests in Motor Vehicles, ibid.; </em>Comment, <em>The California Used Car Dealer and the Foreign Lien\u2014A Study in the Conflict of Laws </em>(1959) 47 Cal.L.Rev. 543, 546-547.) Because this \u201cfull title\u201d system requires all security interests to be listed on the statutory certificate of ownership (see Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 370, 4451, 4453), a purchaser may rely on the certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and is not expected to check a centralized set of records to determine whether a security interest has been recorded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">California adopted the full title system decades before the advent of the UCC, and the system remains essentially unchanged. The buyer\u2019s right to rely on the information on the certificate of ownership has been emphasized by our courts both before and after the enactment of the UCC. In <em>First National Bank of Hays City </em>v. <em>Sprigg </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 258 [25 Cal.Rptr. 838], decided one year before the enactment of the UCC, the court observed that \u201cCalifornia is known as a \u2018full title\u2019 state insofar as registration of motor vehicles is concerned. This means that anyone transacting business with the owner of a motor vehicle can rely upon the title as reflected by the registration certificate, without further inquiry.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 259-260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>Ferraro </em>v. <em>Pacific Finance Corp. </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 339 [87 Cal.Rptr. 226], decided seven years after adoption of the UCC, reached the same conclusion. \u201cIn California, as is well known to anyone engaged in the business of selling or lending money on the security of automobiles, a prospective purchaser of a motor vehicle without knowledge of any defect of title may rely exclusively on the information disclosed by the statutory certificate of ownership.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 346, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Like full title statutes in other states, Vehicle Code section 6301 holds a purchaser to constructive notice of a security interest from the time the secured party\u2019s application for registration as legal owner is deposited with the DMV. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6301, 6302; <em>Security Interests in Motor Vehicles, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 1005.) However, the purpose of this provision is primarily to establish priority among two or more competing <em>lienholders </em>according to time of receipt of the applications. (See <em>ibid.) </em>The deposit of the application is deemed to impart constructive notice only because it is assumed that the security interest will actually be recorded in the DMV\u2019s files. (See <em>Eckhardt </em>v. <em>Morley </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 229, 230-231 [30 P.2d 423].) In <em>Eckhardt, </em>this court construed the predecessor to Vehicle Code section 6301 to require actual registration before constructive notice would be deemed to <em>date </em>from the time of deposit. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The same reasoning applies to the requirement for notation of the security interest on the certificate of ownership. Upon registration, the DMV is required to issue a new certificate of ownership to the legal owner listing the legal owner\u2019s name and address. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1800, subd. (a), 4450, 4451, 4453, 6302.) Thus, it is assumed that the deposit of an application for registration will result in simultaneous registration of the security interest and issuance of a new certificate of ownership listing the secured party as the legal owner. The deposit should not be deemed to impart constructive notice to a buyer unless the security interest has been accurately listed on the certificate of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">When the system functions properly, there will be no unfairness to purchasers and no opportunity for conflicting results in title disputes. The result should be the same regardless of whether reliance is placed on the constructive notice provided by the central DMV records or the actual notice provided by the certificate of ownership. A security interest cannot be recorded while a certificate of ownership for the vehicle is at large. The DMV will register a security interest only when the existing certificate, properly endorsed, is submitted with the application. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 6301.) Conversely, a new certificate of ownership listing the security interest will be issued only in conjunction with registration of the security interest. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4450, 6301, 6302.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Thus, it should normally be impossible for a seller to present a buyer with a certificate of ownership which shows no security interest at a time when the DMV records show one. By the same token, a prospective buyer has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>reason to check the DMV\u2019s records if the seller produces a clean certificate of ownership. (See <em>Ferraro </em>v. <em>Pacific Fin. Corp., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d at p. 346, fn. 1; <em>First Nat. Bank of Hays City </em>v. <em>Sprigg, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d at pp. 259-260.) The DMV records and the provision for constructive notice based on registration should come into play only when the seller is unable to produce a certificate of ownership. A buyer who proceeds in that situation without checking the DMV records does so at his or her own risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In this case, of course, the system did not function properly. Although UCB deposited an application in proper form which requested registration of its security interest and issuance of a certificate of ownership listing it as legal owner of the mobilehome, the DMV mistakenly issued a certificate which listed no legal owner.In this case, of course, the system did not function properly. Although UCB deposited an application in proper form which requested registration of its security interest and issuance of a certificate of ownership listing it as legal owner of the mobilehome, the DMV mistakenly issued a certificate which listed no legal owner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Relying on the \u201cclean\u201d certificate, T&amp;O paid $7,000 to purchase the mobilehome from the Morgans, who have since disappeared from the scene.  The question then becomes who should bear the loss, the bona fide purchaser or the bank with the perfected security interest?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The specific provisions of the UCC governing the effect of a perfected security interest on subsequent purchasers do not provide an answer. As an early UCC commentator noted, dating perfection from the time of deposit prevents the second of two applications received by the recording agency from being listed on the certificate and recorded as the first. (See <em>Security Interests in Motor Vehicles, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 1005.) Thus, finding constructive notice from the time of deposit provides a fair means of resolving questions of priority between competing secured parties. However, it does not address or solve the problem created for a subsequent buyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>or secured party when no interest is noted on the certificate at all. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 1005-1006.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Where the Legislature has failed to anticipate a problem, the UCC provides for the application of common law and equitable principles. \u201cUnless displaced by the particular provisions of this code, the principles of law and equity . . . shall supplement its provisions.\u201d (\u00a7 1103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">To identify the relevant principles, it is useful to consider cases which have construed provisions for constructive notice in statutes governing the recordation of interests in real property. <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Purser </em>(1901) 131 Cal. 552 [63 P. 844] concerned the question of which party should prevail when a county recorder fails to record a mortgagee\u2019s interest and the land is subsequently sold to a bona fide purchaser. In holding for the subsequent purchaser, this court treated the recorder as the agent of the mortgagee, attributing any errors or omissions by the recorder to the mortgagee. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 556; see <em>Dougery </em>v. <em>Bettencourt </em>(1931) 214 Cal. 455, 461-465 [6 P.2d 499]; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Wilhoit </em>(1894) 104 Cal. 395, 399 [38 P. 53].)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In <em>Eckhardt </em>v. <em>Morley, supra, 220 </em>Cal. 229, this court held that the requirements for effective constructive notice of interests in real property were equally applicable to security interests in motor vehicles under the predecessor to Vehicle Code section 6301. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 231.) After reviewing statutes \u00e1nd cases concerning real property recordation, the court concluded that, while recordation may be deemed effective for some purposes on deposit, \u201cwherever the purpose of the recordation is to give constructive notice of the contents of the instrument, the mere deposit of it with the recorder is not the equivalent of recordation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Responsibility for insuring that the security interest is actually recorded and listed on the certificate of ownership is properly placed on the lender as the party seeking the protection offered by recordation. The lender, who knows that it has applied for registration of the security interest, is also in a better position than a subsequent purchaser to detect and correct an error. For example, in this case UCB\u2019s computer was programmed to remind bank personnel to determine whether the DMV had issued a certificate of ownership listing UCB\u2019s security interest. A witness for the bank testified that the computer could have been programmed to call for the confirmation earlier. This step could well have led to discovery of the error before the sale to T&amp;O.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>UCB argues that T&amp;O was not entitled to rely on the certificate of ownership and could have protected itself by checking the records of the DMV to determine whether a security interest in the mobilehome had been registered. However, the record does not establish that the bank\u2019s interest had been registered. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 10.) For all the record discloses, a check of the DMV\u2019s indexed records would have produced nothing but the same inaccurate information which appeared on the certificate of ownership. Only by retrieving the original application could a buyer confirm the accuracy of the information appearing on the certificate. More importantly, the argument ignores the established principle that permits a buyer to rely exclusively on the information appearing on the certificate. <em>(Ferraro </em>v. <em>Pacific Fin. Corp., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d at p. 346, fn. 1; <em>First Nat. Bank of Hays City </em>v. <em>Sprigg, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d at pp. 259-260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">UCB also argues that its security interest must prevail because \u201cT&amp;O at no time moved to perfect its title in the subject property.\u201d UCB invokes a \u201cgeneral rule of property law . . . that, to prevail over other claims to the same property, one must first record or file his interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In support of this dubious proposition, UCB relies on section 5600 of the Vehicle Code, which requires a transferee of title in a registered vehicle to apply for transfer of the registration before the transfer will be effective. This reliance is misplaced. UCB fails to note that subdivision (a) of Vehicle Code section 5600, by reference to Vehicle Code section 5906, expressly exempts a dealer holding a vehicle for resale from the registration requirement. T&amp;O, as a dealer in used mobilehomes, clearly came within the exemption.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Finally, UCB asserts that T&amp;O claims the status of a holder in due course and regards the certificate of ownership as a negotiable instrument. T&amp;O makes no such claims, which would in any event be unsupportable under the definition of the term \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d in the UCC. (See \u00a7 3104, subd. (1); see also \u00a7 1201, subd. (15), \u00a7 7104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In conclusion, an examination of the general perfection provisions of the UCC and the special \u201cfull title\u201d registration scheme for security interests in motor vehicles supports the position advanced by T&amp;O. The interest of a bona fide purchaser must prevail over a technically perfected security interest which is not disclosed on the vehicle certificate of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Because the transactions involving the mobilehome occurred in 1979, this case is subject to the rules applicable to a motor vehicle. The parties incorrectly assume that the same result would obtain if the transactions had occurred, for example, within the past year. However, in 1981 the Legislature enacted the Mobilehomes\u2014Manufactured Housing Act of 1980, which created a completely separate system for the registration of mobile-homes. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18000 et seq., <em>id., </em>\u00a7 18075, subd. (a); see <em>ante, </em>fn. 6.) Registration of mobilehomes is now conducted by the Department of Housing and Community Development rather than the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Many of the new provisions are quite similar to the comparable sections of the Vehicle Code which remain applicable to motor vehicles. Following recent amendments, the Health and Safety Code provides for the establishment of a \u201cpermanent title record\u201d and the issuance of a \u201ccertificate of title,\u201d both of which are to contain up-to-date listings of all security interests in the mobilehome. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 18090.5, 18091, 18100.5, subd. (a)(1).) These requirements are similar to those found in the Vehicle Code provisions discussed above. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1800, subd. (a), 4450, 4451, 4453, 6302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Other provisions represent a significant shift in philosophy. Particularly relevant here is Health and Safety Code section 18091, which sets forth the information that must appear on the mobilehome \u201ccertificate of title.\u201d Most of the information is similar to that required on a motor vehicle certificate of ownership under Vehicle Code section 4451. However, the mobilehome certificate of title must also contain \u201c[a] statement to the effect that the certificate of title may not reflect all liens filed with the department against the title and that current title status may be confirmed through the department.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18091, subd. (d).) No comparable statement is required on a motor vehicle certificate of ownership. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4450, 4451, 4453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>It thus appears that a different result would be compelled if the transactions in this case had occurred after July 1, 1981, when the new statutory scheme for mobilehome registration took effect. The disclaimer required on the new certificate of title warns the prospective purchaser of a mobilehome against relying, as T&amp;O did here, on the certificate. The Legislature appears to have concluded, at least with respect to mobilehomes, that a buyer\u2019s examination of a certificate cannot substitute for a complete search of the centralized recording system.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">This comparison of the two statutory schemes reinforces the foregoing interpretation of the UCC and Vehicle Code provisions applicable to this case. It is apparent that, when the Legislature wants to discourage reliance by buyers on a certification system, it knows how to say so. The fact that the Legislature left the parallel Vehicle Code sections unchanged provides a strong indication that it concurred in the established rule that buyers of motor vehicles may rely exclusively on the information contained in the certificate of ownership. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 755 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622]; <em>City of Port Hueneme </em>v. <em>City of Oxnard </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 385, 395 [341 P.2d 318]; <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Fountain Valley School Dist. </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 180, 187-188 [153 Cal.Rptr. 56].)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The interest of a bona fide purchaser of a vehicle subject to registration under the Vehicle Code prevails over a technically perfected security interest which is not disclosed on the certificate of ownership.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This holding will not affect mobilehome transactions that occurred on or after July 1, 1981, the date on which mobilehome registration became subject to the Health and Safety Code. It will apply to transactions involving all other vehicles which remain subject to registration under the Vehicle Code unless and until the Legislature changes the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The judgment is reversed and the trial court is instructed to enter its judgment declaring T&amp;O the legal owner of the mobilehome and enjoining UCB from repossessing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Mosk, J., Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., and Lucas, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-13\">After this lawsuit was filed, defendant changed its name to First Interstate Bank of California.

(See Stats. 1963, ch. 819, \u00a7 9306, p. 1981.) T&amp;O does not contend that UCB authorized the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">A \u201cbuyer in ordinary course\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who in good faith and without knowledge that the sale to him or her is in violation of the ownership rights or security interest of a third party in the goods buys in ordinary course from a person in the business of selling goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1201, subd. (9).) A fortiori, a buyer <em>not </em>in ordinary course includes one who buys from a person who is not in the business of selling the type of goods purchased. The Morgans are not in the business of selling mobilehomes. Therefore, T&amp;O, although it purchased the mobilehome from them in good faith and without knowledge that the sale violated UCB\u2019s security interest, was not \u201ca buyer in ordinary course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A44\">The distinction can be important. A buyer in ordinary course of business \u201ctakes free of a security interest created by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.\u201d (\u00a7 9307, subd. (1).) This provision was intended to \u201cprotect the ordinary customer of a retail or wholesale merchant who has created a lien upon his inventory.\u201d <em>(The Uniform Commercial Code: A Special Report by the California State Bar Committee on the Commercial Code </em>(1962) 37 State Bar J. 117, 213.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\">In 1979, this provision read as follows: \u201c(3) The filing of a financing statement otherwise required by this division is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property subject to . . . [\u00b6] (b) The provisions of the Vehicle Code which require registration of a vehicle or boat; but during any period in which collateral is inventory, the filing provisions of this division (Chapter 4) apply to a security interest in that collateral . . . .\u201d (Former \u00a7 9302, subd. (3)(b), Stats. 1975, ch. 650, \u00a7 1, p. 1408.) The registration provisions of the Vehicle Code were made applicable to mobilehomes by Vehicle Code section 5350. (See also Veh. Code, \u00a7 635; but see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5351.)</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">Mobilehome registration is no longer governed by the Vehicle Code or administered by the DMV. In 1981, the sentence making mobilehomes subject to the registration provisions of the Vehicle Code was deleted from Vehicle Code section 5350. (Stats. 1981, ch. 975, \u00a7 35, p. 3796.) Subdivision (3)(b) of section 9302 of the UCC was amended to exclude from the coverage of the Code\u2019s filing provisions noninventory property subject to the \u201cprovisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of the Health and Safety Code which require registration of a mobilehome or commercial coach . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1981, ch. 134, \u00a7 7, p. 912.) On July 1, 1981, the Mobilehomes\u2014 Manufactured Housing Act of 1980 went into effect. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 18000 et seq.) Responsibility for registration of mobilehomes was shifted to the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Community Development. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 18075, subd. (a).) The impact of these statutory changes on the present case is discussed <em>post, </em>at pages 454-455.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\">The former version of Vehicle Code section 6301 in effect in 1979 differed in minor respects not significant here. (See Stats. 1963, ch. 819, \u00a7 49, p. 2014; Stats. 1982, ch. 454, \u00a7 182, p. 1893.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The dissent maintains that this case is like any other involving a mistake in the filing or indexing of a security interest subject to the UCC. (See dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 457.) However, none of the authorities cited by the dissent addresses the problem presented when an actual notice system based on a certificate of ownership is superimposed on the general purpose, constructive notice model of the UCC. The dissent would afford the certificate of ownership no legal significance whatsoever. That view ignores the pivotal role assigned to the certificate by the Vehicle Code, by the courts, and by millions of lay persons who rely on it when they buy used motor vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The dissent contends that today\u2019s holding ignores the effect of the \u201cinevitable delay in indexing.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 457.) In fact, delays in indexing are not a concern for the buyer under the full title system since the system relies primarily on the notice provided by the certificate of ownership and not on indexes. As noted above, the current certificate of ownership must be submitted with any application for registration of a security interest. A new certificate will be issued only when the security interest has been registered and indexed. Absent DMV error, it will normally be impossible in the period of \u201cinevitable delay\u201d between filing and indexing for the seller to present\u2014or the buyer to rely on\u2014a certificate of ownership that does not reveal the security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"AYo\">For the buyer of an item that is subject to a pure constructive notice system, the delay between filing and indexing of a security interest poses a danger even in the absence of mistakes by the filing officer. The UCC alerts such a buyer that he or she takes subject to recently filed security interests that may not appear in a search of the appropriate index. (See \u00a7\u00a7 9303, 9401.) The delay in indexing is not a problem for the buyer of a motor vehicle governed by the Vehicle Code\u2019s full title system precisely because the system directs the buyer to rely primarily on the certificate of ownership and not on the DMV\u2019s central records.</p>\n<p id=\"AUQf\">It is apparently necessary to reiterate that this case arose not from an error or delay in filing or indexing but from an error in the preparation of a certificate of ownership. By its repeated attempts to portray the issue as one of improper filing or indexing (dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 457), the dissent demonstrates either an inability or a stubborn refusal to recognize the function of the certificate of ownership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The record does not disclose whether UCB\u2019s security interest was properly entered into the DMV\u2019s indexed records. (See Veh. Code, \u00a7 1800, subd. (a).) Under the Vehicle Code, an application for registration is filed separately from the corresponding record of registration, which is indexed under several categories. (See <em>ibid.) </em>As a result, it is possible that the record of registration for the subject mobilehome, like the erroneous certificate of ownership, omitted UCB\u2019s security interest. UCB failed to obtain or introduce into evidence any of the DMV\u2019s records. It chose to rely on the department\u2019s letters informing the parties of the mistake as proof that its application for registration had been received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The speculations of the dissent regarding \u201cguilty knowledge\u201d notwithstanding, the parties did stipulate that T&amp;O had no actual knowledge of UCB\u2019s security interest. (See dis. opn., <em>post, </em>fn. 2.) This court may not go behind that stipulation to question T&amp;O\u2019s bona fides. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Attorneys, \u00a7 208, pp. 239-240 and cases cited [stipulation, unless contrary to law, court rule or policy, is binding on court]; see also <em>Schlemmer </em>v. <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1965) 349 F.2d 682, 684 [\u201cWhen parties have entered into stipulations as to material facts, our duty is to treat such facts as having been established by the clearest proof\u201d].) Certainly it would be unwise to indulge such speculations in formulating a rule of general application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">T&amp;G cites cases holding that \u201cwhere one of two innocent persons must suffer because of the conduct of a third person, the loss must be borne by the person whose negligence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>misplaced confidence enabled the injury to occur.\u201d <em>(Tampico </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 211, 214-215 [34 Cal.Rptr. 885]; accord <em>People\u2019s Finance etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Bowman </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 729, 736 [137 P.2d 729]; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 3543.) According to T&amp;O, the bank misplaced its confidence in the Morgans when it extended credit to them, making it possible for the Morgans to defraud T&amp;O.</p>\n<p id=\"Al5f\">This argument is unpersuasive. One could as easily conclude that T&amp;O \u201cmisplaced its confidence\u201d in the Morgans when it bought the mobilehome from them. (See Void, <em>Worthless Check Cash Sales, \u201cSubstantially Simultaneous\u201d and Conflicting Analogies </em>(1950) 1 Hastings L.J. 111, 121-123.) The argument also misses the point. The problem in this case arose as a result of the conduct of the DMV. The Morgans could never have presented T&amp;O with a clean certificate of ownership if the DMV had not mistakenly issued it. The real question is who should bear the cost of that mistake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The dissent finds a dilemma where none exists, suggesting that the rule applied here shields dealers but leaves consumers unprotected. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>fn. 7.) T&amp;O did not apply for transfer of the registration precisely because it knew that, under the dealer exemption, the transfer of title would be effective without registration. As for consumers, the registration card which must be' kept in every licensed motor vehicle clearly states the requirement to notify the DMV immediately when the vehicle is sold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b485-12\">It is unnecessary to decide here whether a different result would be compelled in a case where the registration transfer requirements of Vehicle Code section 5600 applied and the transferee had failed to comply. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 453-454.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b485-11\">KAUS, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AFr\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>As both the trial court and the Court of Appeal clearly saw, the issues in this case are quite simple and unerringly point to priority of United California Bank\u2019s (UCB) security interest which was perfected in compliance with all applicable provisions of law. Unfortunately the majority obscures this simplicity by (1) an erroneous suggestion that the California Uniform Commercial Code\u2019s (hereafter Commercial Code) protections for perfected security interests are primarily designed to establish priorities among lien-holders,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) an outdated analysis of California\u2019s \u201cfull title system,\u201d (3) an inapplicable analogy to real property recording, (4) a meticulous but, I believe, irrelevant description of post-1979 law, and, finally, (5) a misplaced appeal to principles of equity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The applicable statutes are found in the Vehicle Code and the Commercial Code. Vehicle Code sections 6300 and 6301\u2014amended as part of the same chapter which enacted the Commercial Code (Stats. 1963, ch. 819)\u2014pre-scribe the mechanics for the recording of a security interest in a vehicle. Briefly, section 6300 calls for the deposit of certain documents with the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 6301 then provides that the deposit \u201cconstitutes perfection of the security interest and the rights of all persons in the vehicle <em>shall be subject to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>...\u201d (Italics added.) To be specific: if the party to be secured has done all that is required of him, we look to the Commercial Code for the consequences of slipups by the filing officer\u2014here, of course, the Department of Motor Vehicles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">It is at this point in its analysis of applicable statutory law that the majority leaves the straight and narrow. <em>(Ante, </em>p. 448.) It states that the rule that perfected security interests are good against bona fide purchasers is premised on the assumption that filing of a security interest will result in a record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>which a prospective purchaser can discover. From this premise it concludes that if a record is not discoverable, we can ignore the Commercial Code. The premise is, however, only half-true and the conclusion is quite mistaken. It is, of course, to be hoped that filing will result in a discoverable record, but\u2014even if we ignore the inevitable delay in indexing (\u00a7 9403, subd. (4)(a))\u2014mistakes happen and it begs the question presented by this case simply to abandon the Commercial Code because a perfected security interest is not discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">It is not as if the problem of a slipup by the filing officer had not been considered. To the contrary, the wording of the relevant provisions of the Commercial Code, the official comment thereto and Mr. Anderson\u2019s authoritative treatise on the code, are in perfect harmony to the effect that a perfected security interest is not lost because of a mistake by the filing officer. Section 9303 provides that a security interest is perfected when it has attached<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the applicable steps toward perfection, such as filing, have been taken. Section 9403 states that filing consists of \u201c[presentation for filing . . : tender of the filing fee and acceptance ... by the filing officer.\u201d Nothing further is required. The Uniform Commercial Code comment to section 9-407 (\u00a7 9407) states unequivocally: \u201cNote . . . that under section 9-403(1) <em>the secured party does not bear the risk that the filing officer will not properly perform his duties: </em>under that Section the secured party has complied with the filing requirements when he presents his financing statement for filing and the filing fee has been tendered or the statement accepted by the filing officer.\u201d (Italics added.) In 4 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code, section 9-403:5, the author states: \u201cThe secured party does not bear the risk of an improper filing or indexing by the filing officer, as long as the secured party has not by his own conduct caused the error by misleading the filing officer, [\u00b6] The Code adopts the concept that filing is constructive notice from the time of presentation to the filing officer, rather than from the later time of indexing. . . . [\u00b6] The rationale of the Code provision defining \u2018filing\u2019 is to make certain the time of filing and to free the secured party from errors or mistakes on the part of the filing officer.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 519-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Although no California case in point has been found, the authorities from other jurisdictions uniformly agree that the Commercial Code means what it says. <em>(Matter of Glasco, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1981) 642 F.2d 793, 796 [\u201cA creditor who has complied with the filing requirements does not bear the risk of improper indexing by the Secretary of State.\u201d]; <em>In re Royal Electro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>type Corporation </em>(3d Cir. 1973) 485 F.2d 394, 396; <em>In re Hammons </em>(D.Miss. 1977) 438 F.Supp. 1143, 1151 [\u201cNor is the secured party an insurer of proper indexing.\u201d]; <em>Matter of Fowler </em>(D.Okla. 1975) 407 F.Supp. 799, 803; <em>In re May Lee Industries, Inc. </em>(D.N.Y. 1974) 380 F.Supp. 1, 3.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">This phalanx of authority to the effect that the secured party does not have to bear the risk of a slipup in the recording system, is simply ignored by the majority, which offers us nothing better than (a) an imperfect analogy to the real property recording system<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (b) a reference to California\u2019s \u201cfull title\u201d system which, as far as I c\u00e1n tell, never did encounter\u2014let alone solve\u2014the problem posed by this case. Certainly the two decisions relied on by the majority are not in point. <em>First Nat. Bank of Hays City </em>v. <em>Sprigg </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 258 [25 Cal.Rptr. 838] involved as the creditor a Kansas bank which failed to note its lien on the certificate of title before handing it over to the debtor, who drove the car to California where he sold it. The court held, most plausibly, that the bank was estopped to claim its lien. Even less pertinent is <em>Ferraro </em>v. <em>Pacific Fin. Corp. </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 339 [87 Cal.Rptr. 226], where an employee of the creditor neglected to indicate its security interest when submitting the relevant documents to the Department of Motor Vehicles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>In conclusion I would simply ask what the Legislature could have intended by providing in section 6301 of the Vehicle Code that \u201cthe rights of all persons in the vehicle shall be subject to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code\u201d if, the first time an occasion for applying this command arises, we simply ignore it?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Grodin, L, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Section 9201 of the Commercial Code begins as follows: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this code a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, <em>against purchasers of the collateral and against creditors.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Equity!

It is, of course, true that section 1103 of the Commercial Code provides that, inter alia, principles of equity supplement its provisions, wherever the code is silent. The trouble is, however, that it is not silent on the point in issue here, but explicitly commands a result contrary to the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Henceforth, unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Commercial Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Section 9204 sets forth the conditions which must be satisfied for a security interest to \u201cattach.\u201d Since it is clear that UCB\u2019s interest had attached, the point need not be pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>General Motors Acceptance Corporation </em>v. <em>Hodge </em>(Ky. 1972) 485 S.W.2d 894 is not to the contrary.
