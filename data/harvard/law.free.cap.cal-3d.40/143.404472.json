The primary purpose of the proposed operation is habilitation. Any therapeutic benefit would be incidental. The probate court, while agreeing with appellants that the procedure was medically safe and would enhance the quality of Valerie\u2019s life, concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We are asked to determine whether section 2356, subdivision (d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon which the trial court relied, precludes the sterilization of a severely retarded conservatee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in all circumstances and, if so, whether application of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>prohibition to Valerie denies her the benefits of state and/or federal constitutional guarantees of privacy, equal protection, and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We shall conclude that the Legislature, in enacting subdivision (d) of section 2356, while contemporaneously repealing Welfare and Institutions Code section 7254, intended to discontinue the longstanding, but discredited, practice of eugenic sterilization,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to deny guardians and conservators authorization to have the procedure performed on their wards and conservatees. The judgment must be affirmed because the record does not support a conclusion that sterilization is necessary to Valerie\u2019s habilitation and does not support the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion that less intrusive means by which to avoid conception are unavailable to Valerie. We shall also conclude, however, that the present statutory scheme denies incompetent developmentally disabled persons rights which are accorded all other persons in violation of state and federal constitutional guarantees of privacy. Our affirmance of the judgment therefore is without prejudice to a renewed petition and hearing at which the requisite showing may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Valerie was born on July 13, 1955, apparently a victim of Downs Syndrome as a result of which she is severely retarded. Her IQ is estimated to be 30. She is now 29 years old. She lives with her mother and stepfather. Although she has no comprehension of the nature of these proceedings, she has expressed her wish to continue to have her parents care for her. Her parents\u2019 long range plan for Valerie is that she will move to a residential home should they become mentally or physically unable to care for her. She has received therapy and training for behavior modification which was not successful in eliminating her aggressive sexual advances toward men. Her parents are attempting to prepare her for the time when they can no longer care for her, and to broaden her social activities as an aspect of this preparation. They have concluded that other methods of birth control are inadequate in Valerie\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On September 5, 1980, appellants filed their petition to be named conservators of Valerie\u2019s person in the Santa Clara County Superior Court pursuant to section 1820. In the same petition they sought the additional power to authorize \u201ca Salpingectomy or any other operation that will permanently sterilize\u201d Valerie. The petition was supported by the declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of Valerie\u2019s personal physician who stated that the tubal ligation procedure is \u201cadvisable and medically appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On September 25, 1980, after review of a court investigator\u2019s report which stated that Valerie had no comprehension of the proceedings, could not complete an affidavit of voter registration, and gave no pertinent response when asked if she objected to being disqualified from voting, the probate court granted the petition insofar as it sought appointment of appellants as coconservators. The court continued the hearing on the request for additional powers, however, and appointed counsel to represent Valerie.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On December 10, 1980, when the hearing resumed, appellants submitted a declaration by a physician who had treated Valerie from the time she was 10 years old. He stated that in his opinion a tubal litigation procedure was \u201cadvisable and medically appropriate in that a potential pregnancy would cause psychiatric harm to Valerie.\u201d A second declaration, this by a licensed marriage, family and child counselor having a masters degree in developmental psychology, was also submitted. This declarant had worked with Valerie on a weekly basis for a year during 1977-1978. She believed that a tubal ligation was \u201can appropriate means of guarding against pregnancy,\u201d and had observed that Valerie acted \u201caffectionately\u201d toward adult men and made \u201cinappropriate\u201d sexual advances toward them. This declarant was of the opinion that because Valerie\u2019s parents had found it necessary to be overly restrictive in order to avoid a possible pregnancy which would have \u201csevere psychologically damaging consequences\u201d to Valerie, close monitoring had severely hampered Valerie\u2019s ability to form social relationships. She also believed that the level of Valerie\u2019s retardation meant that no alternative birth control methods were available that would ensure against pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Valerie\u2019s mother testified that Valerie had not been sexually active, apart from masturbation, because she had been closely supervised. She was aggressive and affectionate toward boys. On the street she approached men, hugged and kissed them, climbed on them, and wanted to sit on their laps. Valerie had been given birth control pills in her early teens, but she rejected them and became ill. Her doctor then recommended the tubal ligation. Valerie was unable to apply other methods of birth control such as a diaphragm, and would not cooperate in a pelvic examination for an intrauterine device which the witness believed was unsafe in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>No evidence was offered by counsel representing Valerie, although he did argue that less drastic alternatives to sterilization should be used, and also questioned the jurisdiction of the probate court to authorize the surgery. It was conceded that the court had the power to authorize an abortion should Valerie become pregnant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">No evidence was offered to establish that Valerie is capable of conceiving, and other than the opinions of her mother and the family counselor no evidence was offered to establish that alternative less intrusive methods of birth control are unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The trial judge then denied the request for additional powers, explaining he believed both that sterilization was in order and that subdivision (d) of section 2356 was unconstitutional, but was obliged to follow <em>Guardianship of Tulley </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 698 [146 Cal.Rptr. 266], which had held that the probate court lacks jurisdiction to authorize the sterilization of a conservatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The parties agree that section 2356 bars nontherapeutic sterilization of conservatees. Because that section provides that the procedure may not be authorized \u201cunder the provisions of this division,\u201d however, we invited additional briefing addressed to whether the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4500 et seq.) afforded an alternative source of authority. The parties argue that it does not. We conclude that the history of section 2356 supports the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\n<em>Statutory Development</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">A. <em>Involuntary Sterilization in California.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">In 1909, California enacted this state\u2019s first statute permitting sterilization of developmentally disabled individuals. That authority extended only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>persons committed to state institutions or prisons, and provided: \u201cWhenever in the opinion of the medical superintendent of any state hospital, or the superintendent of the California Home for the Care and Training of Feeble-Minded Children, or of the resident physician in any state prison, it would be beneficial and conducive to the benefit of the physical, mental or moral condition of any inmate of said state hospital, home, or state prison, to be asexualized, then such superintendent or resident physician shall call in consultation the general superintendent of state hospitals and the secretary of the state board of health, and they shall jointly examine into all of the particulars of the case with the said superintendent or resident physician, and if in their opinion, or in the opinion of any two of them, asexualization will be beneficial to such inmate, patient, or convict, they may perform the same; . . .\u201d (Stats. 1909, ch. 720, \u00a7 1, pp. 1093-1094.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">That law was repealed in 1913, and replaced with authority to \u201casexualize\u201d committed mental patients and developmentally disabled persons prior to their release from state institutions, and developmentally disabled minor and adult patients in state hospitals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1917 section 1 of the statute was amended to make it applicable to developmentally disabled adults. It then provided that prior to discharge a person \u201cwho is afflicted with mental disease which may have been inherited and is likely to be transmitted to descendants, the various grades of feeble-mindedness, those suffering from perversion or marked departures from normal mentality or from disease of a syphilitic nature,\u201d might be asexualized. (Stats. 1917, ch. 489, \u00a7 1, p. 571.) No hearing procedure was provided and no judicial approval was required under any of these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Twenty-two states enacted similar legislation and, as a \u201cpioneer\u201d in the field, California performed the greatest number of sterilization operations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>One of the first legal commentaries on the practice noted that \u201c[b]etween 1907 and 1921 California sterilized 2,558 of the 3,233 total for all United States in that period.\u201d (Comment, <em>Constitutional Law\u2014. </em>. . <em>Sterilization of Defectives </em>(1927) 1 So.Cal.L.Rev. 73, 74, fn. 5.) The same author quoting from an article by Popenoe, <em>Eugenic Sterilization in California, </em>published in the Journal of Social Hygiene in May 1927, reported that \u201c\u2018[t]he total number of operations performed to date is more than 5,000, which is four times as many as have been performed for eugenic reasons, in governmental institutions, in all the rest of the world together, so far as known.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 74, fn. 5.) Although challenged on a variety of constitutional grounds, principally denial of due process and equal protection, most of these statutes were upheld, if adequate procedural safeguards, including a hearing for the patient, were afforded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Codified as section 6624 of the Welfare and Institutions Code in 1937 (Stats. 1937, ch. 369, \u00a7 6624, p. 1155), the substantive aspects of the California law remained essentially unchanged over the next 40 years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1951 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>significant procedural protections were added, the nomenclature of eligible patients was changed to substitute \u201cmental deficiency\u201d for \u201cfeeble-mindedness,\u201d and subdivisions (c) and (d) were combined into a single category of persons exhibiting \u201cmarked departures from normal mentality.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After being renumbered as Welfare and Institutions Code section 7254 in 1967, this authority for nonconsensual sterilization was finally repealed in 1979,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> operative January 1, 1980.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>B. <em>Revision of the Guardianship-Conservatorship Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">During the 40-year period during which involuntary sterilization was permissible significant advances occurred both in understanding of the causes of mental retardation, and in public awareness that many developmentally disabled persons lead self-sufficient, fulfilling lives, and become loving, competent, and caring marriage partners and parents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In 1978 the California Law Revision Commission submitted to the Legislature a draft of a new guardianship-conservatorship law which expressly denied the probate court jurisdiction to grant conservators the power to cause their wards and cons\u00e9rvateos to be sterilized.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Affording safeguards, rather than barring sterilization, was the basis for the proposal, however, and sterilization would have been available under this proposal if the conservatee were admitted to a state hospital. As proposed, section 2356, subdivision (d), read: \u201cA ward or conservatee may be sterilized only as provided in Section 7254 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d The comment accompanying the section explained: \u201cSubdivisions (b)-(d) are new and make clear that the provisions of other codes relating to highly intrusive forms of medical treatment are the only provisions under which such treatment may be authorized for a ward or conservatee, <em>thus assuring that the procedural safeguards contained in those provisions will be applied. </em>Subdivision (d) is consistent with Guardianship of Tulley, 83 Cal.App.3d 698, 146 Cal.Rptr. 266 (1978) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and Guardianship of Kemp, 43 Cal.App.3d 758, 118 Cal.Rptr. 64 (1974).\u201d (14 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1978) p. 725, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Before enacting the new Guardianship-Conservatorship Law recommended by the Law Revision Commission, however, the Legislature repealed Welfare and Institutions Code section 7254. That section, therefore, no longer afforded authorization for the sterilization of mentally retarded wards or cons\u00e9rvateos, even if they were admitted to state institutions and were afforded the procedural protections contemplated by the commission. The intent of the Legislature is clear. Neither the probate court, nor state hospital personnel were to retain authority to permit a nontherapeutic sterilization of a conservatee who is unable to personally consent to the procedure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">C. <em>The Lantermcui Developmental Disabilities Services Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In 1977, the Legislature, possibly concerned about the rising tide of criticism of compulsory sterilization,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and by then fully aware of the importance of providing services to developmentally disabled persons to assist them in remaining in noninstitutional settings, enacted the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (LDDSA). (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4500 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The LDDSA reflected a change in legislative attitude toward the mentally retarded, a change which found impetus in the recommendation of the Study <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Commission on Mental Retardation which reported to the Governor and Legislature in January 1965. The commission proposed a variety of state supported services for the retarded, including rehabilitation and educational services aimed at vocational training, and the creation of regional centers as a means by which services would be brought to the families of mentally retarded children to assist them in making \u201can appropriate lifetime plan.\u201d (See Study Com. on Mental Retardation, The Undeveloped Resource, A Plan for the Mentally Retarded in California (1965) p. 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The centers were to make community services accessible, provide special services where necessary, and provide home services for the \u201cmildly retarded [who] may be enabled to live at home if they receive occasional visits from a public health nurse or homemaker . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 53.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The report also recommended that residential facilities bp provided for mentally retarded persons who could not live independently, but were not in need of the services of a state hospital which then was the only public institution for the mentally retarded in California. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 70-71.) These facilities \u201cwould reflect a concern with these people as individuals and would make it possible for them to enter into community life insofar as they are able. It would also facilitate normal family and neighborly relationships, which are harder to achieve in a large institution.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 74.) The study commission recommended further study of a proposal that sterilization be made available when necessary to achieve this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The Legislature undertook to implement the proposed reforms in a series of steps which culminated in the LDDSA. The California Mental Retardation Services Act of 1969 was enacted to restructure the provision of services to the mentally retarded which had been, the responsibility of eight state agencies and numerous local programs. That act, former division 25 of the Health and Safety Code (commencing at former \u00a7 38000; Stats. 1969, ch. 1594, \u00a7 1, p. 3234) provided for. regional centers to be operated by private, nonprofit community and local agencies to provide services to the mentally retarded and their families. It prohibited judicial commitment of persons who were not a danger to themselves or others to state hospitals on referral by a regional center, and authorized the regional centers to purchase out-of-hospital care for the mentally retarded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The final impetus for the LDDSA occurred in 1975 when federal legislation expanded the type of services to be afforded the developmentally disabled by states receiving federal funding for their programs. In that year Congress enacted the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DDA) (Pub.L. No. 94-103), included in which was recognition of a right to \u201ctreatment, services, and habilitation for a person with developmental disabilities should be designed to maximize the developmental potential of the person and should be provided in the setting that is least restrictive of the person\u2019s personal liberty.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6010(1) &amp; (2).)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">When the LDDSA was enacted in 1977 sterilization continued to be available under Welfare and Institutions Code section 7254, the repeal of which did not become effective until January 1, 1980. (Stats. 1979, ch. 552, \u00a7 1, p. 1762; Stats. 1979, ch. 730, \u00a7 156.5, p. 2540.) Accordingly, the LDDSA contained no provision by which sterilization of a conservatee could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>included among the services provided by the regional centers to nonconsenting clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Under the LDDSA, regional centers contract with the Department of Developmental Services to seek out and assist developmentally disabled persons within the service area for which they are responsible.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Among the services available to persons within a regional center\u2019s service area are \u201cpreventive services\u201d needed by persons identified as being at risk of parenting a developmentally disabled infant. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4644.) The \u201cpreventive services\u201d to be provided for such clients may include sterilization of consenting adults.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> If so, however, the section would authorize sterilization only on request of a client, and only for the purpose of avoiding a high risk of parenting a developmentally disabled infant. Although Valerie might qualify,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> she is incapable of requesting or consenting to that procedure, and the LDDSA includes no provision for request or consent by a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The regional center must also undertake activities necessary to the achievement of the goals of the individual program plan (IPP) it devises for a client. Among these activities is \u201c[p]rogram coordination which may include securing, through purchase or referral, services specified in the person\u2019s plan, coordination of service programs, information collection and dissemination, and measurement of progress toward objectives contained in the person\u2019s plan.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4648, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The Legislature has given high priority to the provisions of services necessary to enable children to remain in the home of their parents when this is a preferred objective in an IPP. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The regional center is also authorized to purchase out-of-home care for developmentally disabled clients in licensed community care facilities, or assist in placement and follow-along services for those individuals who cannot remain in the home of a parent or relative. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4648, subd. (b).) It is the intent of the LDDSA that services for such clients continue to provide \u201can unbroken chain of experience, maximum personal growth and liberty,\u201d under \u201cconditions of everyday life which are as close as possible to the norms and patterns of the mainstream of society.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4830; see also \u00a7 4501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The legislative intent that developmentally disabled persons be assisted in achieving their maximum developmental potential is express in the findings set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section 4501 which explain that coordinated services are required to \u201cinsure that no gaps occur in communication or provision of services\u201d and that \u201c[sjervices should be planned and provided as part of a continuum . . . sufficiently complete to meet the needs of each person with developmental disabilities, regardless of age or degree of handicap, and at each stage of life.\u201d It is also express in the legislative statement of the rights of the developmentally disabled to \u201c [treatment and habilitation services [to] foster the developmental potential of the person . . . provided with the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of treatment\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4502, subd. (a)) and in the right to \u201csocial interaction and participation in community activities ... to physical exercise and recreational opportunities,\u201d and to be \u201cfree from . . . isolation.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4502, subds. (f)(h).) Finally, it appears in the breadth of services which the LDDSA authorizes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Nonetheless, neither the provision for preventive services nor any other provision of the LDDSA authorizes sterilization of nonconsenting persons even when necessary to achieve these goals, and the Legislature took no action to amend the LDDSA either in conjunction with the enactment of section 2356, subdivision (d) or once the repeal of Welfare and Institutions Code section 7254 became effective. We conclude therefore that this legislation does not presently afford a mechanism by which sterilization of Valerie may be authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\n<em>Constitutional Rights of the Developmentally Disabled</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Our conclusion regarding the present legislative scheme requires that we confront appellants\u2019 contention that the scheme is unconstitutional. Both appellants and counsel for Valerie pose the constitutional question in terms of the right of procreative choice. Appellants argue that subdivision (d) of section 2356 deprives Valerie of that right by precluding the only means of contraception realistically available to her, while counsel for Valerie contends that the legislation furthers that right by protecting her against sterilization forced upon her by the will of others. The sad but irrefragable truth, however, is that Valerie is not now nor will she ever be competent to choose between bearing or not bearing children, or among methods of contraception. The question is whether she has a constitutional right to have these decisions made for her, in this case by her parents as conservators, in order to protect her interests in living the fullest and most rewarding life of which she is capable. At present her conservators may, on Valerie\u2019s behalf, elect that she not bear or rear children. As means of avoiding the severe psychological harm which assertedly would result from pregnancy, they may choose abortion should she become pregnant; they may arrange for any child Valerie might bear to be removed from her custody; and they may impose on her other methods of contraception, including isolation from members of the opposite sex. They are precluded from making, and Valerie from obtaining the advantage of, the one choice that may be best for her, and which is available to all women competent to choose\u2014contraception through sterilization. We conclude that the present legislative scheme, which absolutely precludes the sterilization option, impermissibly deprives developmentally disabled persons of privacy and liberty interests protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and article I, section 1 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The right to marriage and procreation are now recognized as fundamental, constitutionally protected interests. <em>(Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 1, 12 [18 L.Ed.2d 1010, 1018, 87 S.Ct. 1817]; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1942) 316 U.S. 535, 541 [86 L.Ed. 1655, 1660, 62 S.Ct. 1110]; <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 711, 714 [198 P.2d 17]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pointer </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1139 [199 Cal.Rptr. 357].) So too, is the right of a woman to choose not to bear children, and to implement that choice by use of contraceptive devices or medication, and, subject to reasonable restrictions, to terminate a pregnancy. These rights are aspects of the right of privacy which exists within the penumbra of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution <em>(Roe </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 113, 154 [35 L.Ed.2d 147, 177, 93 S.Ct. 705]; <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 438, 453 [31 L.Ed.2d 349, 362, 92 S.Ct. 1029]; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1965) 381 U.S. 479, 485 [14 L.Ed.2d 510, 515, 85 S.Ct. 1678]), and is express in section 1 of article I of the California Constitution which includes among the inalienable rights possessed by all persons in this state, that of \u201cprivacy.\u201d <em>(Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 252, 262 [172 Cal.Rptr. 866, 625 P.2d 779, 20 A.L.R.4th 1118]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Belous </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 954, 963 [80 Cal.Rptr. 354, 458 P.2d 194]; <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Population Services International </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 678 [52 L.Ed.2d 675, 97 S.Ct. 2010]; <em>Planned Parenthood of Missouri </em>v. <em>Danforth </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 52 [49 L.Ed.2d 788, 96 S.Ct. 2831].) They are also within the concept of liberty protected against arbitrary restrictions by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Although the Supreme Court has not considered the precise question of the right to contraception in the context of an assertion that the right includes sterilization, that sterilization is encompassed within the right to privacy has been acknowledged in this state. <em>(Jessin </em>v. <em>County of Shasta </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 737, 748 [79 Cal.Rptr. 359, 35 A.L.R.3d 1433].) Since <em>Jessin </em>was decided this court has affirmed the constitutional stature of the right of women to exercise procreative choice \u201cas they see fit.\u201d <em>(Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 252, 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In its enactment of section 2356, subdivision (d), and the omission of any provision in other legislation authorizing sterilization of incompetent developmentally disabled persons, the Legislature has denied incompetent women the procreative choice that is recognized as a fundamental, constitutionally protected right of all other adult women. We realize that election of the method of contraception to be utilized, or indeed whether to choose contraception at all, cannot realistically be deemed a \u201cchoice\u201d available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>an incompetent since any election must of necessity be made on behalf of the incompetent by others. The interests of the incompetent which mandate recognition of procreative choice as an aspect of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty do not differ from the interests of women able to give voluntary consent to this procedure, however. That these interests include the individual\u2019s right to personal growth and development is implicit in decisions of both the United States Supreme Court and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>410 U.S. 113, the court concluded that an unmarried woman\u2019s fundamental right not to bear children could be found within the right to privacy, whether the privacy right arises out of the penumbra of the First Amendment or the liberty right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In so doing the court recognized that this interest is not limited to the intimacy of the marital relationship, but encompasses also the individual\u2019s right to determine the course of his or her future life. The court made reference to the impact denial of the right of procreative choice might have in causing a woman a \u201cdistressful life and future.\u201d (410 U.S. at p. 153 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The liberty interest which the court recognized as a substantive right protected against arbitrary deprivation by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right of the individual \u201cto be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties; to be free to use them in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling [and] to pursue any livelihood or avocation . . . .\u201d <em>(Allgeyer </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1897) 165 U.S. 578, 589 [41 L.Ed. 832, 835, 17 S.Ct. 427]; see also <em>Grosjean </em>v. <em>American Press Co. </em>(1936) 297 U.S. 233, 244 [80 L.Ed. 660, 665, 56 S.Ct. 444].) \u201cLiberty means more than freedom from servitude, and the constitutional guarantee is an assurance that the citizen shall be protected in the right to use his powers of mind and body in any lawful calling.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1914) 233 U.S. 630, 636 [58 L.Ed. 1129, 1132, 34 S.Ct. 681].) \u201cAlthough the Court has not assumed to define \u2018liberty\u2019 with any great precision, that term is not confined to mere freedom from bodily restraint. Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, and it cannot be restricted except for a proper governmental objective.\u201d <em>(Bolling </em>v. <em>Sharpe </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 497, 499-500 [98 L.Ed. 884, 887, 74 S.Ct. 693].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Although denominated \u201chabilitation\u201d in the context of the developmentally disabled, the right in issue, one which we have no doubt is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>entitled to constitutional protection, is the right of every citizen to have, the personal liberty to develop, whether by education, training, labor, or simply fortuity, to his or her maximum economic, intellectual, and social level. That all persons may not seek to exercise this right in no way diminishes its importance. It lies at the core of the liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and article I, section 1 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">An incompetent developmentally disabled woman has no less interest in a satisfying or fulfilling life free from the burdens of an unwanted pregnancy than does her competent sister. Her interest in maximizing her opportunities for such a life through habilitation is recognized and given statutory protection by both the LDDSA and the DDA. If the state withholds from her the only safe and reliable method of contraception suitable to her condition, it necessarily limits her opportunity for habilitation and thereby her freedom to pursue a fulfilling life.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, whether approached as an infringement of the right of privacy under the First Amendment or the privacy right that is found within the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and whether analyzed under due process or equal protection principles, the issue is whether withholding the option of sterilization as a method of contraception to this class of women is constitutionally permissible. Because the rights involved are fundamental the permissibility of the restriction must be justified by a \u201ccompelling state interest,\u201d and may be no broader than necessary to protect that interest. <em>(Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>410 U.S. at p. 155 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 178].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The California Constitution accords similar protection. Article I, section 1, confirms the right not only to privacy, but to pursue happiness and enjoy liberty.  The right of a woman to choose whether or not to bear a child and thus to control her social role and personal destiny, is a fundamental right protected by that provision. <em>(Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 252, 275.) Since the right to elect ster<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ilization as a method of contraception is generally available to adult women in this state, the restriction must be justified by a compelling state interest under either article I, section 1, or under the equal protection guarantee of article I, section 7, of the California Constitution. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 276-277.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Under equal protection analysis we must determine whether the state has a compelling interest in restricting access to sterilization for incompetent developmentally disabled adults, and, if so, whether banning all such sterilization is necessary to accomplish the state purpose. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 461, 466 [125 Cal.Rptr. 129, 541 P.2d 881].) Similarly, in assessing any restriction on the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right, we must determine whether the state has a compelling interest that is within the police power of the state in regulating the subject, whether the regulation is necessary to accomplish that purpose, and if the restriction is narrowly drawn. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Belous </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 954, 964 [80 Cal.Rptr. 354, 458 P.2d 194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Respondent suggests that the interest of the state in safeguarding the right of an incompetent <em>not </em>to be sterilized justifies barring all nontherapeutic sterilization of conservatees who are unable personally to consent. We do not doubt that it is within the police power of the state to enact legislation designed to protect the liberties of its residents. The inquiry does not end there, however, since the means selected are not simply protective of a liberty interest, but restrict the exercise of other fundamental rights by or on behalf of the incompetent. The state has not asserted an interest in protecting the right of the incompetent to bear children. Neither the \u201cinvoluntary imposition\u201d of other forms of contraception, nor abortion, has been banned. A conservator is permitted to exercise his or her own judgment as to the best interests of the conservatee in these matters, excepting only the election of sterilization as a means of preventing conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The state interest therefore must be in precluding the option of sterilization because it is in most cases an irreversible procedure. Necessarily implicit in the interest asserted by the state is an assumption that the conservatee may at some future time elect to bear children. While the prohibition of sterilization may be a reasonable means by which to protect some conservatees \u2019 right to procreative choice, here it sweeps too broadly for it extends to individuals who cannot make that choice and will not be able to do so in the future. The restriction prohibits sterilization when this means of contraception is necessary to the conservatee\u2019s ability to exercise other fundamental rights, without fulfilling the stated purpose of protecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>right of the conservatee to choose to bear children. That right has been taken from her both by nature which has rendered her incapable of making a voluntary choice, and by the state through the powers already conferred upon the conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Respondent argues that the ban is, nonetheless, necessary because past experience demonstrates that when the power to authorize sterilization of incompetents has been conferred on the judiciary it has been subject to abuse. Again, however, the rationale fails since less restrictive alternatives to total prohibition are available in statutory and procedural safeguards as yet untried in this state. Respondent offers no evidence of abuse in other jurisdictions in which the option has been made available.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The courts of several of our sister states share our view that sterilization may not be denied to incompetent women when necessary to their habilitation if that determination is made in proceedings which accord safeguards adequate to prevent the abuses feared by respondent. Among the first to do so was the Supreme Court of Washington which, faced with the same conflicting interests, reviewed the factors to be considered in a decision to permit sterilization and suggested procedural safeguards appropriate to avoid abuse. Those procedures have since been accepted by courts in other states in which the judiciary had jurisdiction to authorize sterilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In <em>Matter of Guardianship of Hayes </em>(1980) 93 Wn.2d 228 [608 P.2d 635, 640-641], the Washington court concluded: \u201c[I]n the rare case sterilization may indeed be in the best interests of the retarded person. . . . However, the court must exercise care to protect the individual\u2019s right of privacy, and thereby not unnecessarily invade that right. Substantial medical evidence must be adduced, and the burden on the proponent of sterilization will be to show by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that such a procedure is in the best interest of the retarded person.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u201cAmong the factors to be considered are the age and educability of the individual. For example, a child in her early teens may be incapable at present of understanding the consequences of sexual activity, or exercising judgment in relations with the opposite sex, but may also have the potential to develop the required understanding and judgment through continued education and developmental programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u201cA related consideration is the potential of the individual as a parent. . . . [M]any retarded persons are capable of becoming good parents, and in only a fraction of cases is it likely that offspring would inherit a genetic form of mental retardation that would make parenting more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cAnother group of relevant factors involve the degree to which sterilization is medically indicated as the last and best resort for the individual. Can it be shown by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, for example, that other methods of birth control are inapplicable or unworkable?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u201cThe decision can only be made in a superior court proceeding in which (1) the incompetent individual is represented by a disinterested guardian ad litem, (2) the court has received independent advice based upon a comprehensive medical, psychological, and social evaluation of the individual, and (3) to the greatest extent possible, the court has elicited and taken into account the view of the incompetent individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u201cWithin this framework, the judge must first find by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the individual is (1) incapable of making his or her own decision about sterilization, and (2) unlikely to develop sufficiently to make an informed judgment about sterilization in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201cNext, it must be proved by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that there is a need for contraception. The judge must find that the individual is (1) physically capable of procreation, and (2) likely to engage in sexual activity at the present or in the near future under circumstances likely to result in pregnancy, and must find in addition that (3) the nature and extent of the individual\u2019s disability, as determined by empirical evidence and not solely on the basis of standardized tests, renders him or her permanently incapable of caring for a child, even with reasonable assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cFinally, there must be no alternative to sterilization. The judge must find by clear, cogent and convincing evidence (1) all less drastic contraceptive methods, including supervision, education and training, have been proved unworkable or inapplicable, and (2) the proposed method of sterilization entails the least invasion of the body of the individual. In addition, it must be shown by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that (3) the current state of scientific and medical knowledge does not suggest either (a) that a reversible sterilization procedure or other less drastic contraceptive method will shortly be available, or (b) that science is on the threshold of an advance in the treatment of the individual\u2019s disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The Massachusetts Supreme Court, noting that denying the same right to procreative choice to persons whose disability makes them reliant on others as it extends to competent persons degrades the disabled, and therefore has construed that state\u2019s statute which prohibits sterilization except with the knowledgeable consent of the patient as permitting the consent to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>through the court-approved substituted judgment of the parent or guardian. <em>(Matter of Moe </em>(1982) 385 Mass. 555 [432 N.E.2d 712, 720].) Although decided as a matter of statutory construction, the court concluded in that opinion that an incompetent\u2019s inability to choose \u201cshould not result in a loss of the person\u2019s constitutional interests. ... To speak solely in terms of the \u2018best interests\u2019 of the ward, or of the State\u2019s interest, is to obscure the fundamental issue: Is the State to impose a solution on an incompetent based on external criteria, or is it to seek to protect and implement the individual\u2019s personal rights and integrity? We reject the former possibility. Each approach has its own difficulties, but the use of the doctrine of substituted judgment promotes best the interests of the individual, no matter how difficult the task involved may be.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The New Jersey Supreme Court, rejecting an argument that absent statutory authority the court may not approve sterilization of an incompetent, has expressly recognized that an incompetent has the same constitutional right of privacy to choose whether or not to be sterilized as does a competent person, and has concluded that the court has inherent power to permit the procedure to be performed. \u201cWe do not pretend that the choice of [the incompetent\u2019s] parents, her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>or a court is her own choice. But it is a genuine choice nevertheless\u2014one designed to further the same interests she might pursue had she the ability to decide herself. We believe that having the choice made in her behalf produces a more just and compassionate result than leaving [her] with no way of exercising a constitutional right. Our Court should accept the responsibility of providing her with a choice to compensate for her inability to exercise personally an important constitutional right.\u201d <em>(In re Grady, supra, </em>426 A.2d at p. 481.) The Alaska Supreme Court reached a similar result, holding that as a court of general jurisdiction the Alaska Superior Court had the power as part of its <em>parens patriae </em>authority to entertain a petition by the guardian of an incompetent and to approve sterilization. <em>(Matter of C.D.M., supra, </em>627 P.2d 607.)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We do not suggest that the procedures adopted by these courts are the only or the best criteria and procedures adequate to simultaneously preserve the right of an incompetent person to bear children and to be free of intrusive medical and surgical procedures, while permitting the exercise by others of an incompetent\u2019s countervailing right not to bear children when the individual is incapable of personally exercising these rights. We note them by way of example as less drastic alternatives to section 2356, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>(d), under which sterilization is denied to all developmentally disabled persons who are unable to consent regardless of the effect of that denial on the quality of their lives and their ability to develop their maximum human potential. In the absence of evidence that these and similar criteria and procedures adopted in other states have proven inadequate to prevent recurrence of past abuses, respondent has failed to support the argument that section 2356, subdivision (d), is necessary to or does in fact protect the rights of incompetent developmentally disabled persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">True protection of procreative choice can be accomplished only if the state permits the court-supervised substituted judgment of the conservator to be exercised on behalf of a conservatee who is unable to personally exercise this right. Limiting the exercise of that judgment by denying the right to effective contraception through sterilization to this class of cons\u00e9rvateos denies them a right held not only by conservatees who are competent to consent, but by all other women. Respondent has demonstrated neither a compelling state interest in restricting this right nor a basis on which to conclude that the prohibition contained in section 2356, subdivision (d), is necessary to achieve the identified purpose of furthering the incompetent\u2019s right not to be sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Our conclusion that section 2356, subdivision (d), is constitutionally over-broad, and may not be invoked to deny the probate court authority to grant a conservator the power to consent to sterilization in those cases in which no less intrusive method of contraception is available to a severely retarded conservatee, does not open the way to unrestricted approval of applications for additional powers. Pending action by the Legislature to establish criteria and procedural protections governing these applications the procedures governing approval of intrusive medical procedures set forth in section 2357 should be adapted and applied. Those procedures are adequate to insure that the conservatee will receive independent representation, and that clear and convincing evidence of the necessity for the procedure will be introduced by the applicant as a prerequisite to judicial approval. In ruling on such applications the court should consider the criteria developed by the Washington Supreme Court in <em>In Matter of Guardianship of Hayes, supra, </em>608 P.2d 635, 640-641, as well as any other relevant factors brought to the attention of the court by the parties and give approval only if the findings enumerated by that court have been made on the basis of clear and convincing evidence. In order to ensure that careful consideration is given to the determinative factors, and that meaningful appellate review may be accorded an order granting or denying an application for approval of the power to consent to sterilization of a conservatee the court should identify evidence on which it relies in support of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The record in this case is inadequate to establish that the trial court erred in denying the application by appellants. Inasmuch as the trial court believed that it lacked power to grant the application the record is devoid of any specification of the factors which the court found relevant, or any findings as to their existence. Nor would the evidence support an order granting the application. Although there is an implicit assumption by the parties and the trial court that Valerie may become pregnant, there is no evidence in this record that she is capable of conceiving. Even were we to accept this assumption arguendo there is no evidence that less intrusive methods of preventing conception are unavailable to Valerie. There is medical evidence that an intrauterine device is contraindicated in Valerie\u2019s case, but the only other evidence regarding alternative methods of birth control is the testimony of Valerie\u2019s mother that several years ago Valerie became ill and refused to ingest birth control pills. The record does not reveal whether more than one formulation of birth control pill was tried,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or whether alternative methods of administering these contraceptive drugs are available and were considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Even as to those intrusive medical procedures permitted after court authorization the Legislature has required a judicial determination that the condition of the conservatee \u201crequires the recommended course of medical treatment.\u201d '(\u00a7 2357, subd. (h)(1).) Here there was neither a finding that sterilization is \u201crequired\u201d nor evidence that would support such a finding. Under these circumstances the order of the trial court denying appellants\u2019 petition was proper.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Inasmuch as there was neither evidence of necessity for contraception, nor sufficient evidence that less intrusive means of contraception are not presently available to Valerie, the judgment is affirmed. The affirmance is, however, without prejudice to a renewed application for additional powers at such time as appellants have available adequate supporting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Mosk, J., Broussard, J., and Kaus, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 4512 defines \u201c[developmental disability\u201d as \u201ca disability which originates before an individual attains 18, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial handicap for such individual.

There, we considered a scheme under which nonobjecting mentally retarded persons incompetent to request hospital placement could \u201cvoluntarily\u201d be so placed at the request of a person other than a duly authorized conservator or guardian. No judicial determination of disability or need for such placement was required. In the course of disapproving that procedure, we noted a contradiction inherent in the scheme: \u201cHop is presumed sufficiently <em>competent </em>to understand the need for her to object to her placement when it has been initiated by a third party, her mother. At the same time she is presumed <em>incompetent </em>to a degree which would prevent her from requesting admission or, once confined, obtaining unilaterally and without review her own release.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The analytical fallacy we explored in <em>Hop </em>is echoed and expanded upon in the present case. The majority acknowledges that the incompetent is, by definition, unable to make a choice. Nonetheless, it concludes that \u201cshe has a constitutional right to have these decisions made for her, in this case by her parents as conservators, in order to protect her interests in living the fullest and most rewarding life of which she is capable.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 160.) However, while she has a constitutional right to have a \u201csubstituted choice\u201d made on her behalf to effectuate her constitutional rights to be free of her procreative capabilities in order to advance her right to habilitation, the former \u201cright\u201d is severely circumscribed by the assertion that there is no intention to \u201copen the way to unrestricted approval of applications for additional powers\u201d to enable sterilizations to take place. <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 168.) The sweeping terminology utilized to discern constitutional imperatives permitting sterilization suddenly narrows when the significant past abuses in this area are recalled. To that end the majority proposes adoption of an \u201cadapted\u201d version of Probate Code section 2357\u2019s requirements to be applied in conjunction with the standards enunciated by the Washington Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>preme Court in <em>Matter of Guardianship of Hayes </em>(1980) 93 Wn.2d 228 [608 P.2d 635, 640-641].</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">As the majority mentions, and the Chief Justice\u2019s dissent emphasizes, the history of sterilization of mentally incompetent persons is not one of which we should be proud. My colleagues refer to the \u201cprevalent attitude, reflective of the limited knowledge of the nature of developmental disabilities then available.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 152, fn. 8.) Many of those responsible for eugenic sterilizations acted in accord with those \u201cprevalent\u201d views and out of high personal and societal motives. Nonetheless, the extremes to which eugenics could be misapplied were more than amply demonstrated during World War II.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">I find fundamentally problematic my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that there is a constitutional right to \u201csubstituted consent\u201d in this context. The statutory scheme providing for habilitation <em>concededly </em>does not itself permit sterilization of persons such as Valerie. The majority nonetheless has transmuted the <em>process </em>of habilitation set forth in the applicable laws into a constitutional \u201cright\u201d which encompasses the \u201cright\u201d to be sterilized if one\u2019s conservator so elects. I worry whether the \u201crights\u201d which we are \u201cprotecting\u201d are in fact more likely to become those of the incompetent\u2019s caretaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In <em>In re Hop, supra, </em>we expressly considered the argument that we should afford deference to those like Ms. Hop\u2019s mother who acted in the best interests of their charges. We responded: \u201cIn justifying disparate treatment of the developmentally disabled, we are unable to substitute for constitutional safeguards the admitted good intent both of the state and of those treating the developmentally disabled . . . .\u201d (29 Cal.3d at p. 93.) Here, that \u201cgood intent\u201d is used as a basis for concluding that an incompetent has a constitutional right to sterilization which outweighs her rights to be free of intrusive medical procedures and to retain her procreative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">It is especially interesting to take a closer look at the record which has produced the majority\u2019s exegesis on constitutional rights. Petitioner presented in support of the application for sterilization the briefest of written declarations by Valerie\u2019s pediatrician and a counselor specializing in working with developmentally disabled clients. Valerie\u2019s pediatrician, after observing that Valerie was mentally retarded apparently as a result of Down\u2019s syndrome, stated in relevant part: \u201c4. I am aware of the family\u2019s desire to have a tubal ligation performed on Valerie. This operation will permanently sterilize but not unisex [szc] the conservatee. [f] 5. In my opinion this procedure is advisable and medically appropriate in that a potential pregnancy would cause psychiatric harm to Valerie.\u201d That is the sum and substance of the doctor\u2019s evidence. Significant in this offering are his men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tion of \u201cthe family\u2019s desire\u201d to have the operation performed and the complete lack of information showing that as a pediatrician he had the training and the relevant information necessary to determine what might or might not affect Valerie\u2019s psychiatric well-being. I wonder what effect we would give a similar conclusory declaration by an obstetrician that a patient\u2019s broken leg would cause \u201cpsychiatric harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The next declaration was by a licensed counselor holding a master\u2019s degree in developmental psychology. The counselor specializes in \u201cbehavior management with developmentally disabled clients\u201d and has acted as a vendor providing services to clients connected with regional centers set up to serve the developmentally disabled. She had worked with Valerie weekly for approximately one year ending about two years before the court hearing. The counselor declared that \u201cFrom my numerous contacts with Valerie as well as her family, I am of the opinion that a tubal ligation is an appropriate means of guarding against pregnancy.\u201d Specifically she had observed \u201cValerie act affectionately\u201d towards men and had worked with Valerie\u2019s family \u201con Valerie\u2019s problem concerning her inappropriate sexual attention to adult males.\u201d No specifics regarding the conduct involved are provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">After reciting these factors, the counselor states \u201cBecause of the parents\u2019 fear of a pregnancy whith might result from Valerie\u2019s inappropriate sexual advances, they have felt compelled to overly restrict her social activities. This close monitoring has severely hampered her from being able to form social relationships appropriate to her developmental level.\u201d The focus is on the <em>parents\u2019 </em>fears and the conclusion they have \u201coverly restricted\u201d Valerie\u2019s activities. No actual description of the supervision afforded Valerie or any alternatives available is given. Nor is there mention of whether there might be ways to modify the parents\u2019 conduct if indeed they are <em>\u201coverly </em>restrictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The declaration then concludes \u201cIt is my professional opinion that if Valerie were to become pregnant, the pregnancy itself would have severe psychologically damaging consequences to Valerie.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause of Valerie\u2019s severe mental retardation there appears to be in my judgement [j/c] no alternative birth control measures available to her which would guarantee that she would not become pregnant.\u201d As in the pediatrician\u2019s report, there is no specific basis given for the conclusion that Valerie would be psychologically harmed by pregnancy. If the harm is the same as that which would occur to any similarly disabled person, then the specter of wholesale sterilization of such persons looms more concrete. Indeed, there is absolutely nothing in the medical evidence presented that significantly differentiates Valerie\u2019s medical and psychological condition from that of any other severely developmentally disabled woman in similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>In addition to this information, Valerie\u2019s mother and conservator testified at the hearing. She stated Valerie\u2019s social behavior was \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d Valerie was not, to her knowledge, sexually active, \u201c[b]ut she is very aggressive, very affectionate\u2014likes boys.\u201d Her conduct included hugging, kissing, climbing on men and wanting to sit on their laps.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As to training, behavior modification had been tried: \u201cShaking hands, you know, not being so aggressive.\u201d Valerie remained \u201caggressive.\u201d When Valerie was in her early teens, two kinds of birth control pills were tried, but she \u201crejected [them] and became ill.\u201d Therefore, according to Valerie\u2019s mother, the pediatrician recommended tubal ligation to avoid potential psychological and medical problems. Valerie had not cooperated in attempts to have a pelvic examination. Finally, when asked why sterilization of Valerie was sought, her mother stated \u201cBecause I do not wish her to become pregnant, but I would still like her to be able to broaden her social activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The above constitutes the relevant medical and psychological information presented to the court. After hearing argument, the trial judge stated that \u201cI think, sterilization, from what I\u2019ve heard, I think it is desirable and should be ordered.\u201d He concluded that \u201con the basis of what I\u2019ve heard so far, I would rule sterilization is in order except for the lack of jurisdiction.\u201d (See <em>Guardianship of Tulley </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 698 [146 Cal.Rptr. 266]; Prob. Code, \u00a7 2356, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The point of my recitation of the facts adduced at the hearing and the trial judge\u2019s response is not to cast aspersions on the sincere beliefs and good intentions of those concerned with Valerie\u2019s welfare. Rather, it is to demonstrate that on this skimpy and, I believe, totally inadequate record the trial court, but for clear restraints, would have ordered sterilization. Moreover, on this record the majority of this court has seen fit to posit a denial of constitutional rights. Consider the situation of other incompetents who might be deemed incapable of making decisions regarding sterilization, such as the mentally ill or juveniles. It is clear to me that any appellate court would consider the inadequacies of this record woefully apparent and find it an insufficient basis for concluding that sterilization should be authorized. The difference when we consider the case of the developmentally disabled arises in large part, I submit, because of societal attitudes, as well as the admittedly significant problems which may be involved in their care. The difficulty, however, is that those responsible for the decision may be more willing, for the sake of convenience and relying upon the benevolence of those making the request, to allow such surgery. However, generalized \u201cgood intentions\u201d simply are not enough to support the constitutional framework erected by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>My fear of the potential for abuse of the sterilization procedure is neither embroidered out of whole cloth, nor alleviated by the assertion that eugenics and convenience for the caretaker and society are now historic anomalies. The Chief Justice\u2019s citation to recent cases where, for example, parental consent was deemed adequate to permit sterilization demonstrates that the misuse of sterilization in such a way is still quite possible. (See <em>post, </em>at p. 177, fn. 5 (dis. opn. by Bird, C. J.).) Under the circumstances, I cannot conclude that the Legislature\u2019s determination that barring sterilization of those unable to consent to the procedure amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of an incompetent\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Our purpose here is to consider whether Probate Code section 2356, subdivision (d), prohibiting sterilization of incompetents such as Valerie, is unconstitutional. I conclude that whether one uses a compelling state interest or rational basis test to measure this regulation, the Legislature had sufficient cause to act as it did. It may well have decided that in light of past history the risks of abuse for those incompetent to consent to sterilization were simply too great. It may therefore justifiably have determined that to allow an exercise of discretion in this arena by courts and those responsible for the care of the incompetent posed an unacceptable hazard. The approach selected is further supported by the fact that not only is the nature of the procedure contemplated such that it is irreversible, but also the interests of those concerned may be served by utilizing other available alternatives to avoid unwanted pregnancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In conclusion, I cannot join with the majority in finding that the Legislature\u2019s action amounted to an unconstitutional intrusion into the rights of Valerie N. or any similarly situated incompetent person. The Legislature may well have found a compelling state interest in limiting the power of even the best-intentioned persons. The state of the record here, although found by the majority insufficient to support sterilization under the new standards enunciated, nonetheless serves only to heighten my concern that sterilization of persons such as Valerie will become pro forma commonplace occurrences even under the standards proposed. With that I cannot agree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Of course, sterilization necessitated by an incompetent\u2019s medical condition would be permissible under the present statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b204-6\">BIRD, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"AE5\">Today\u2019s holding will permit the state, through the legal fiction of substituted consent, to deprive many women permanently of the right to conceive and bear children. The majority run roughshod over this fundamental constitutional right in a misguided attempt to guarantee a right of procreative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>choice </em>for one they assume has never been capable of choice and never will be. Yet precisely because choice and consent are meaningless concepts when applied to such a person, the majority\u2019s invocation of the theory of procreative choice and the fiction of substituted consent cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The majority opinion opens the door to abusive sterilization practices which will serve the convenience of conservators, parents, and service providers rather than incompetent conservatees. The ugly history of sterilization abuse against developmentally disabled persons in the name of seemingly enlightened social policies counsels a different choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Fortunately, the Legislature has already made that choice. The state has a compelling interest in protecting the fundamental right of its citizens to bear children. The prohibition on sterilization of incompetent conservatees in Probate Code section 2356, subdivision (d) is necessary to effectuate that interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would hold that section 2356, subdivision (d) is constitutional and, on that basis, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The history of involuntary sterilization of incompetent, developmentally disabled individuals over the past 80 years is a history of wholesale violations of constitutional rights carried out with the approval of the highest judicial tribunals. (See, e.g., <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1927) 274 U.S. 200 [71 L.Ed. 1000, 47 S.Ct. 584].) In the first half of this century, approximately 60,000 people were subjected to compulsory sterilization in the United States. A disproportionate number of these operations was carried out in California\u2014 nearly 20,000 between 1900 and 1960. (See State Council on Developmental Disabilities, Cal. Developmental Disabilities State Plan, 1984-1986, pp. 58-59 [hereafter <em>State Plan].)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">This phenomenon was fueled by a widely held but incorrect belief that virtually all developmental disabilities were inherited and could be eliminated by preventing those affected from reproducing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Price &amp; Burt, <em>Sterilization, State Action, and the Concept of Consent </em>(1975) 1 L. &amp; Psychol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ogy Rev. 57, 61-62 [hereafter <em>The Concept of </em>Consent]; Burghdorf &amp; Burghdorf, <em>The Wicked Witch Is Almost Dead: Buck v. Bell and the Sterilization of Handicapped Persons </em>(1977) 50 Temple L.Q. 995, 1007-1008 [hereafter <em>The Wicked Witch].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">It is now recognized that many forms of mental retardation have no hereditary component, while in others heredity is but one of several contributing factors. <em>(Matter of Guardianship of Hayes </em>(1980) 93 Wn.2d 228 [608 P.2d 635, 640]; Brakel &amp; Rock, The Mentally Disabled and the Law (rev. ed. 1971) p. 211 [hereafter <em>Brakel &amp; Rock]; </em>Robitscher, Eugenic Sterilization (1973) pp. 113-116; Friedman, The Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons (1976) pp. 115-117.) Eighty to ninety percent of mentally disabled children are born to normal parents. (Murdock, <em>Sterilization of the Retarded: A Problem or a Solution? </em>(1974) 62 Cal.L.Rev. 917, 926 [hereafter <em>Problem or </em>Solution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The majority scarcely acknowledge this shameful history. Instead, they quote at length and largely without comment from the statutes and decisions which made such abuses possible. When they do comment, it is to explain sympathetically that the legal justifications advanced during that period were merely expressions of \u201c[t]he prevalent attitude, reflective of the limited knowledge of the nature of developmental disabilities then available . . . .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 152, fn. 8.) The extensive literature recording the scope of the abuses and the constitutional infirmities of the statutes and decisions which permitted them is cavalierly ignored.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Most importantly, the majority fail to note that abuses continue to occur. For example, the North Carolina Court of Appeals recently permitted the involuntary sterilization of a 23-year-old woman on the grounds that she was mildly retarded and \u201chad exhibited emotional immaturity, the absence of a sense of responsibility, a lack of patience with children, and continuous nightly adventures with boyfriends followed by daily sleep and bedrest. Such conduct and personality traits in addition to mental retardation,\u201d the court said, \u201cclearly . . . show that respondent failed to meet any acceptable standard of fitness to care for a child by providing a reasonable domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>environment.\u201d <em>(Matter of Johnson </em>(1980) 45 N.C.App. 649 [263 S.E.2d 805, 809]; see <em>Problem or Solution, op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 928-932 [arguing against parental unfitness as a basis for sterilization of developmentally disabled persons on overbreadth and underinclusiveness grounds]; <em>Brakel &amp; Rock, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 217; <em>The Concept of Consent, op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 72-73.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Of course, compulsory sterilization, initiated by the state, is not the issue in this case. As the majority note, California no longer has a compulsory sterilization statute. (See former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 7254, repealed by Stats. 1979, ch. 730, \u00a7 156.5, p. 2540; maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 150.) However, the history of compulsory sterilization under such statutes provides the frame of reference for evaluating the constitutionality of the Legislature\u2019s ban on sterilization of incompetent conservatees. It is also useful in assessing the ostensibly \u201cconsensual\u201d approaches which have been adopted in other states and which the majority adopt today.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As Professors Price and Burt have argued, the trend away from compulsory sterilization and toward sterilization on the basis of substituted consent obscures the fact that the issue remains one of state action threatening the fundamental right of procreation. \u201cForms of state control and intervention change and become so sophisticated, appealing, subtle, and delicate that modern governmental action seems to be less and less restricted by an ordinary application of constitutional protections. For example, when government intervention primarily took the form of institutionalization, particularly compulsory institutionalization, certain ideals of due process which had developed in the criminal law system could be brought to bear ... to increase the protection of the individual from arbitrary state action ....</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cWhen a modern state determines to intervene, for example by means of . . . sterilization, it offers modern justifications. \u2018Positive eugenics\u2019 are no longer in vogue, but the intense competition for tax dollars has merely replaced genetic considerations with fiscal and psychological ones. Where the Holmes[] statement, \u2018three generations of imbeciles are enough,\u2019 was sufficient to uphold the constitutionality of intervention by sterilization a half-century ago, we talk confidently in the compulsory 1970\u2019s about \u2018parenting,\u2019 of \u2018breaking the vicious cycle\u2019 of three generations of welfare clients. Beyond these justifications, there is an additional factor . . .: through adroit statutory change and through nonstatutory efforts to confer power to consent on persons other than the individual directly affected, the always thin line between involuntary and voluntary action has been further attenuated to the point of disappearance.\u201d <em>(The Concept of Consent, op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 59-60, fns. omitted.) Writing in 1975, Price and Burt predicted \u201ca trend toward third-party consent to cover many transactions that would have been justified by pure state intervention at a time when such action was more palatable and available.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">That prediction has been borne out in the intervening years. Courts in a number of jurisdictions without compulsory sterilization statutes or where such statutes had been repealed or were inapplicable under the circumstances of a particular case have permitted third persons to consent to sterilization of incompetent, developmentally disabled women. (See <em>Matter of Guardianship of Hayes, supra, </em>608 P.2d at pp. 638-641; <em>Matter of C. D. M. </em>(Alaska 1981) 627 P.2d 607, 610; <em>Matter of A. W., supra, </em>637 P.2d at pp. 370-375; <em>Matter of Moe </em>(1982) 385 Mass. 555 [432 N.E.2d 712, 719-720]; <em>In re Grady </em>(1981) 85 N.J. 235 [426 A.2d 467, 480-481]; <em>Ruby </em>v. <em>Massey </em>(D. Conn. 1978) 452 F.Supp. 361, 368-369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Like the majority here, these courts have turned to the substituted consent device after concluding that the right to be sterilized is an aspect of a constitutional right of procreative choice enjoyed equally by all persons, whether or not they are developmentally disabled. The justifications that have been advanced for applying both the underlying constitutional theory of procreative choice and the doctrine of substituted consent to individuals who never were and never will be capable of choice cannot withstand critical scrutiny. Because the majority\u2019s use of the procreative choice theory presents the more fundamental problem, it will be addressed first. A detailed critique of the majority\u2019s use of the substituted consent doctrine will follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">That the \u201cright to have offspring\u201d is a fundamental right was first recognized in <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1942) 316 U.S. 535, 536 [86 L.Ed. 1655, 1657, 62 S.Ct. 1110], That case involved Oklahoma\u2019s Habitual Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Sterilization Act, which, with exceptions for certain white collar crimes, permitted sterilization for multiple convictions of felonies involving moral turpitude. The high court held the statute violated the equal protection clause as applied to a man who had been convicted once of stealing chickens and twice of robbery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">None of the opinions in <em>Skinner </em>characterized the right to procreate as a right of choice or privacy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, the majority referred to the right to bear and beget children as \u201ca basic liberty\u201d and as \u201cone of the basic civil rights of man.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 541 [86 L.Ed. at p. 1660].) In a concurring opinion, Justice Jackson observed that involuntary sterilization implicated \u201cthe dignity and personality and natural powers of a minority . . . .\u201d (Id., at p. 546 [86 L.Ed. at p. 1663].) In another concurring opinion, Chief Justice Stone spoke of involuntary sterilization as an invasion of the personal liberty of the individual. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 544 [86 L.Ed. at p. 1662].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The terms employed by the <em>Skinner </em>opinions suggest that the interests implicated by sterilization are more primal than the retention of control over decisions in important areas of personal life. As one commentator has observed, \u201cthe great conceptual background for due process privacy law [is] bodily autonomy .... At present only the most powerless members of society appear to need to rely on the Constitution for such a basic right. The courts have . . . recognized individual liberty in things of the body as a touchstone.\u201d (Note, <em>Due Process Privacy and the Path of Progress </em>(1979) U. Ill. L. F. 469, 515 [hereafter <em>Due Process </em>Privacy]; id., at pp. 504-505; see <em>Union Pacific R.

Hence, restrictions or prohibitions on such choices implicate not only the fundamental right to procreate recognized in <em>Skinner </em>but also the right to <em>choose </em>not to procreate. The courts have invoked the constitutional right of privacy to strike down statutes which prohibit or unduly restrict access to contraceptive devices and information, abortion, and voluntary sterilization. The individual\u2019s right to make her own decision in this highly personal area was stressed. In <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, supra, </em>405 U.S. 438, a contraception case, the United States Supreme Court recast the right of privacy first recognized in <em>Skinner </em>as \u201cthe right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the <em>decision </em>whether to bear or beget a child.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 453 [31 L.Ed.2d at p. 362], italics added and omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Other decisions have sounded the same theme. (See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>410 U.S. at p. 153 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 177] [the right of privacy is \u201cbroad enough to encompass a woman\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy\u201d]; <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 252, 263 [172 Cal.Rptr. 866, 625 P.2d 779, 20 A.L.R.4th 1118]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Belous </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 954, 963 [80 Cal.Rptr. 354, 458 P.2d 194]; <em>Jessin </em>v. <em>County of Shasta </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 737, 748 [79 Cal.Rptr. 359, 35 A.L.R.3d 1433] [privacy right to seek sterilization].) Even Justice Douglas, the author of the majority opinion in <em>Skinner, </em>later referred to the existence of a body of fundamental privacy rights safeguarding \u201cfreedom of <em>choice </em>in the basic <em>decisions </em>of one\u2019s life respecting marriage, divorce, procreation, contraception, and the education and upbringing of children.\u201d <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 179, 211 [35 L.Ed.2d 201, 187, 93 S.Ct. 1410] (cone. opn. of Douglas, J.), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">With regard to individuals competent to make such decisions, the recognition of a comprehensive right of procreative choice, linking the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>procreate with the right to prevent procreation through sterilization or other less permanent means, was a positive and logical advance. Yet if applied unaltered to incompetent, developmentally disabled individuals, the concept of procreative choice obscures more than it clarifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The choice model creates a false impression of equivalence between the \u201cdecision\u201d to procreate and the \u201cdecision\u201d to be sterilized. On closer examination, it is apparent that only the right to be sterilized is necessarily premised on a capacity for rational, informed choice and decision. Sterilization, like abortion and the use of contraceptives, requires a conscious decision by someone aware of the significance of pregnancy and childbearing. Sterilization and abortion in particular, as medical procedures, clearly take place only as the result of choices made by individuals aware of the consequences of their actions. By contrast, procreation is a natural function which can and often does occur without the exercise of a rational or knowing choice. This is true for both competent and incompetent individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Thus, a constitutional theory which treats the right to <em>prevent </em>procreation as an aspect of a larger right of procreative choice is sensible, since the actions necessary to exercise the right require conscious choice and decision. On the other hand, the right to procreate is more than a byproduct of a right of choice. Its roots go deeper; they are <em>constitutional </em>in the physical sense, implicating the individual\u2019s rights to physical integrity and to retention of the biological capabilities with which he or she was born into this world. Hence, even in the case of a mentally competent individual, it is somewhat illogical to treat the right to procreate solely as a matter of control over basic personal decisions. In the case of a permanently incompetent individual, such logic has no place whatsoever. (See <em>Matter of Storar </em>(1981) 438 N.Y.S.2d 266 [420 N.E.2d 64, 71-73] [fundamental right to life paramount to right to decline medical treatment where terminally ill patient has never been competent to understand or make a reasoned decision about medical treatment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In their discussion of appellants\u2019 equal protection challenge, the majority disregard these differences between the right to procreate and the right to prevent procreation. By adopting the procreative choice model, they assume that, regardless of whether the woman is competent or incompetent, the sterilization decision requires the same choice between equally weighted competing interests. The majority conclude in essence that the state\u2019s interest in protecting a severely disabled woman\u2019s right to procreate is not sufficiently compelling to justify the denial of her right to be sterilized. This reasoning cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Unlike the right to bear children, the right to be sterilized is a function of the capacity for rational choice, a capacity the incompetent, develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>mentally disabled woman lacks. Thus, the balance between the two rights is not the same for an incompetent, developmentally disabled woman as it is for her competent, nondisabled counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In the case of an incompetent, severely disabled woman, the conditions upon which to premise a constitutional right to be sterilized are essentially nonexistent. By contrast, her right to procreate, which is not rooted in or dependent upon a capacity for informed decision, is undiminished. Indeed, it requires even greater protection due to her legally dependent status and limited capacity to defend her own rights. In this context, the state\u2019s interest in prohibiting sterilization is a compelling one.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The majority also find a constitutional right to sterilization in Valerie\u2019s due process liberty interest in minimizing restrictions on her social interactions. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 161-163.) That conclusion is flawed by the absence of any showing that the restrictions are truly necessary and by the majority\u2019s failure to balance the deprivation of liberty resulting from such restrictions against the irreversible loss of her fundamental right to procreate if she is sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The majority concede the inadequacy of the evidence as to the nature and effects of the restrictions placed on Valerie\u2019s activities in the attempt to prevent her becoming pregnant. However, relying on descriptions in other cases, they readily assume that unacceptable restrictions are \u201cnecessarily placed upon sexually mature mentally retarded women in the effort to prevent pregnancy . . . .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 163, fn. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In this case, the restrictions on Valerie\u2019s activities have been imposed by her parents rather than by the state. Nonetheless, it is essential to require a showing that the state has a compelling interest in preventing Valerie from becoming pregnant and that the restrictions are no broader than necessary to protect that interest. (See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>410 U.S. at p. 155 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 178].) Only then may the right to \u201cpersonal growth and development\u201d be weighed against the right of procreation. This, the majority has not attempted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">If such an analysis were attempted, it would become clear that any unavoidable adverse impact of the sterilization ban on a developmentally disabled, incompetent conservatee\u2019s liberty interests is insufficient to justify the permanent deprivation of her right to procreate. This conclusion flows inexorably from a comparison of the intrusions on the two rights. Sterilization results in a complete and irreversible deprivation of the right to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>create.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By contrast, any restriction on social activities that results from a ban on sterilization constitutes at most a partial deprivation of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The majority\u2019s failure to engage in a meaningful weighing of these interests is indicative of a basic problem with their analysis. In their effort to protect Valerie\u2019s rights of liberty and procreative \u201cchoice,\u201d they fail to seriously acknowledge her right to procreate. The majority make several unsupported assumptions which suggest that they recognize Valerie\u2019s right to procreate for purposes of conceptual symmetry only. They do not regard it as a <em>real </em>right, entitled to meaningful protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">For example, the majority assert without citation to any authority that Valerie\u2019s conservators may legally compel her to undergo an abortion or to surrender custody over any child she might bear. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 160-161; but see <em>id., </em>at p. 150 &amp; fn. 6; <em>The Concept of Consent, op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 72-74.) Indeed, having incorrectly cast Valerie\u2019s fundamental right to procreate as a right of procreative <em>choice, </em>the majority summarily conclude that she will never have the right to bear children because she will never be competent. \u201cThat right has been taken from her both by nature which has rendered her incapable of making a voluntary choice, and by the state through the powers already conferred upon the conservator.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">I strongly disagree. As explained above, the roots of the fundamental right to procreate go deeper. A woman should not be stripped of that right by conditioning its recognition on her capacity to make informed choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">In sum, the majority\u2019s constitutional analysis fails to give proper weight to the fundamental right to procreate. It also fails to acknowledge that the right to procreate has independent roots which, in contrast to the right to sterilization, are not linked to a capacity for decision and choice. Finally, the majority fail to weigh the impact of the irreversible deprivation of the right to procreate against the partial impairment of liberty which they cite to strike down section 2356, subdivision (d). When proper consideration is given to these questions, it is apparent that the statute\u2019s ban on sterilization, which applies only to incompetent, developmentally disabled conservatees, is constitutionally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The majority\u2019s use of the substituted consent doctrine to permit sterilization of an incompetent individual underscores and exacerbates the problems inherent in applying the constitutional \u201cchoice\u201d model which forms the core of their analysis. Like the theory of procreative choice, substituted consent derives its legitimacy from the premise that the affected individual once possessed a capacity to make informed choices or will be able to do so at some point in the future. Even so, the doctrine requires a court to engage in a questionable legal fiction. This departure from reality reaches its zenith when the third party deciding on a matter as vital as whether to undergo sterilization purports to stand in the shoes of a severely retarded adult who has since birth been incapable of making such choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In many situations, the law prohibits actions affecting an individual\u2019s rights without his or her informed consent. Courts developed the doctrine of substituted consent so that third persons could make decisions on behalf of incompetents in these situations. (E.g., Annot., Power of Court or Guardian to Make Noncharitable Gifts or Allowances Out of Funds of Incompetent Ward (1969) 24 A.L.R.3d 863; see generally <em>Superintendent of Belchertown </em>v. <em>Saikewicz </em>(1977) 373 Mass. 728 [370 N.E.2d 417, 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The substituted consent doctrine is often invoked to permit surgery on incompetent conservatees, since a surgical operation performed without consent is a battery. (See \u00a7\u00a7 2355, 2357; 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 199, 200, pp. 2485-2486.) On similar grounds, substituted consent is also employed to permit consent by parents or guardians to surgery on minors. (See \u00a7 2353; 4 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2486.) The familiarity of the doctrine in the surgery context explains why courts have so readily turned to it when confronted with a request to authorize the surgical sterilization of an incompetent, developmentally disabled individual. (See <em>Right to Choose, op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 565-566.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Substituted consent is problematic even in cases where the affected individual once possessed the capacity to make informed decisions. In the well-known Karen Quinlan case, a 22-year-old woman who had fallen into a permanent coma was living in a \u201cnon-cognitive, vegetative\u201d state. <em>(Matter of Quinlan </em>(1976) 70 N.J. 10 [355 A.2d 647, 664, 79 A.L.R.3d 205].) The New Jersey Supreme Court invoked the substituted consent doctrine to permit a parent and guardian, with the concurrence of other family members, attending physicians, and a medical ethics committee, to consent to the removal of life-support equipment. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The court held that the constitutional privacy right of the comatose woman included the right to decline physically invasive and seemingly pointless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>treatment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Quinlan, supra, </em>355 A.2d at p. 664.) It concluded that this right could only be protected by permitting \u201cthe guardian and family of Karen to render their best judgment ... as to whether she would exercise it in these circumstances.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Several constitutional scholars, while sympathizing with the plight of the Quinlan family, have questioned the court\u2019s constitutional analysis as well as its application of the substituted consent doctrine. Professor Tribe has observed that \u201c[g]iven the supposedly vegetative state that alone justified the court\u2019s holding, attributing \u2018rights\u2019 to Karen at all was problematic; more realistically at stake were the desire of her anguished parents to be rid of their torment and the interest of society in freeing medical decision makers from blind adherence to a practice of keeping vegetating persons \u2018alive\u2019 simply out of a fear of prosecution. But to give <em>those </em>interests constitutional status even where the state interposes an objection in the interest of the child\u2019s life seems most troubling.\u201d (Tribe, American Constitutional Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 936-937, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Focusing more specifically on the use of the substituted consent doctrine, Professor Kamisar has challenged the court\u2019s willingness to guess at what Karen\" Quinlan would want if she could decide for herself. \u201cWhat the court is really saying, I believe, is that if Karen\u2019s constitutional right of privacy includes a right to elect to die and she presently lacks the capacity to choose and we cannot discern from her previous statements how she as a particular individual would have chosen, we may <em>surmise </em>that she would have chosen to die because we <em>presume </em>that the great majority of those in her situation would so chose. ... If, in the absence of hard evidence about a patient\u2019s wishes when actually put in a Quinlan-type situation, a court is to indulge in presumptions, one would think that it would presume <em>just the opposite </em>of what it did in <em>Quinlan. </em>\u201d (Kamisar, <em>A Life Not (or No Longer) Worth Living: Are We Deciding the Issue Without Facing It? </em>(Nov. 10, 1977) Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Lecture delivered at the State University of Buffalo, quoted in <em>Due Process Privacy, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 518, fn. 238.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">If the substituted consent doctrine poses difficult problems in a case where the affected individual was once competent, those problems magnify tenfold in the case of an individual whose incompetency is lifelong. Yet, the majority rely on just such cases to support their application of the doctrine. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 166-167; <em>Matter of Moe, supra, </em>432 N.E.2d 712; <em>In re Grady, supra, </em>426 A.2d 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In <em>Grady, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court relied on the substituted consent analysis of <em>Quinlan </em>to hold that the parents of a developmentally disabled, noninstitutionalized, 18-year-old woman could consent on her behalf to a sterilization operation. <em>(Grady, supra, </em>426 A.2d at pp. 480-481.) Whatever merit there may have been in authorizing the exercise of substituted consent in <em>Quinlan, </em>its use in <em>Grady </em>was logically unsupportable. Indeed, <em>Grady </em>exemplifies the way in which substituted consent fosters the ascendancy of legal fiction over reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In <em>Quinlan, </em>the court stressed the strong bonds of \u201cfamilial love\u201d that had existed between Karen and her family when she still possessed normal mental capacities. (See <em>Quinlan, supra, </em>355 A.2d at p. 657.) It was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>cisely the family\u2019s knowledge of Karen\u2019s way of thinking that the court believed would enable the family to determine the choice she would make if she were still capable of choosing. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In <em>Grady, </em>however, as in this case, there was no basis for a similar assumption. Like Valerie, the daughter in <em>Grady </em>had never been capable of articulating choices. There was not the slightest bit of evidence regarding the ability of the parents to determine that their daughters would choose to be sterilized. Hence, \u201ca decision by the parents [was] mere speculation, rather than an ascertainment of the incompetent\u2019s preferences based on prior observations and conversations, as in Quinlan. \u201d <em>(Right to Choose, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 584; see Note (1981) 12 Seton Hall L.Rev. 96, 110-111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Courts in several jurisdictions have recognized the absurdity of applying the substituted consent doctrine to individuals whose incompetence is the result of severe, lifelong developmental disability. <em>In Matter of Storar, supra, </em>420 N.E.2d 64, the New York Court of Appeals held that blood transfusions could not be withheld from a severely retarded man suffering from a terminal illness. (Id., at p. 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The court acknowledged the right of a competent patient to refuse medical treatment. It also recognized that a third person might be permitted to make the decision for an incompetent patient under certain circumstances. However, the court emphasized that unlike Karen Quinlan, \u201cJohn Storar was never competent at any time in his life. He was always totally incapable of understanding or making a reasoned decision about medical treatment. Thus it is unrealistic to attempt to determine whether he would want to continue potentially life prolonging treatment if he were competent. As one of the experts testified . . ., that would be similar to asking whether \u2018if it snowed all summer would it then be winter?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 72-73.) As a result, the court concluded that Storar\u2019s right to life took precedence over the right to refuse treatment which he would have had if he were competent. A judgment denying permission to continue the transfusions was reversed. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Courts faced with requests to authorize sterilization have recognized the same problem. In <em>Matter of Guardianship of Eberhardy </em>(1981) 102 Wis.2d 539 [307 N.W.2d 881], the Wisconsin Supreme Court criticized the <em>Grady </em>court\u2019s attempt to equate \u201ca decision made by others with the choice of the person to be sterilized. It clearly is not a personal choice, and no amount of legal legerdemain can make it so.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 893.) In <em>In the Matter of Terwilliger </em>(1982) 304 Pa.Super. 553 [450 A.2d 1376], the court reached a similar conclusion, noting that \u201cif the trial court . . . determines that [the conservatee] lacks the ability to make [the] choice for herself, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>pretend that the choice of her guardian to consent to sterilization would be her own choice.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1381, fn. 1; see also <em>Ruby </em>v. <em>Massey, supra, </em>452 F.Supp. at pp. 370-371, fn. 24; <em>Grady, supra, </em>426 A.2d at p. 487 (conc. opn. of Handler, J.); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra, </em>370 N.E.2d at p. 430; <em>In re Hop </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 82, 90-91 [171 Cal.Rptr. 721]; cf. <em>Farber </em>v. <em>Olkon </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 503 [254 P.2d 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Commentators have expressed stronger reservations. Professors Price and Burt have attacked the use of substituted consent in the sterilization context as \u201cnothing short of an extended conceit on the proposition of voluntariness. It is a fiction which authorizes the state to intervene because a party other than the subject provides the green light.. Often that third party is the parent of the subject individual, but the doctrine is equally applicable when the third party is ... a guardian ad litem[] or a conservator. By characterizing the transaction as \u2018consensual\u2019 rather than \u2018compulsory,\u2019 third-party consent allows the truly involuntary to be declared voluntary, thus bypassing constitutional, ethical, and moral questions, and avoiding the violation of taboos. Third-party consent is a miraculous creation of the law\u2014adroit, flexible, and useful in covering the unseemly reality of conflict with the patina of cooperation.\u201d <em>(The Concept of Consent, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 58, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Other writers have stressed the inability of the third person to know the wishes of the incompetent individual. \u201cWhile substituted parental consent may be legally and morally appropriate in circumstances with less potentially harmful results, parental consent in [the] non-therapeutic sterilization context is less legitimate, for it may not be easily presumed that [a developmentally disabled] child, upon reaching majority, would choose sexual sterilization for him/herself. \u201d <em>(Shedding Myth-Conceptions, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 635, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Still others have stressed the likelihood that the third party decisionmaker, the court and the incompetent person will have conflicting interests. \u201cJudicial refusal to recognize substituted consent as a proper alternative to an incompetent\u2019s consent to sterilization is indicative of its inadequacies. A part of this reluctance may be due to a belief that a parent\u2019s interests in the sterilization may not be consistent with the incompetent\u2019s best interests. For example, a parent seeking sterilization for the incompetent may be motivated by such concerns as illegitimate mentally deficient offspring, and the care and financial support of such offspring. These concerns, although considerable, do not reflect the personal welfare and interests of the incompetent in improving her condition through sterilization. In addition, substituted judgment leaves great discretion in the judiciary and could lead to inconsistent application.\u201d (Note, <em>Addressing the Consent Issue Involved in the Ster</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>ilization of Mentally Incompetent Females </em>(1979) 43 Albany L.Rev. 322, 328, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Notwithstanding all of the foregoing problems, courts in other jurisdictions have concluded that incompetent, developmentally disabled persons have a constitutional right to be sterilized, a right which can be vindicated only by giving to others the power to make this awesome decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">For the reasons stated earlier in this opinion, the procreative choice model and the substituted consent device are ill-suited to the situation confronting this court. As a result, the sister state decisions which rely on this approach fail to provide adequate protection for the incompetent, developmentally disabled person\u2019s fundamental right to procreate. (See <em>Hayes, supra, </em>608 P.2d at pp. 640-641; <em>Grady, supra, </em>426 A.2d at pp. 481-483; <em>In re Penny N. </em>(1980) 120 N.H. 269 [414 A.2d 541, 543]; <em>Matter of A. W., supra, 637 </em>P.2d at pp. 375-376; <em>Matter of C. D. M., supra, </em>627 P.2d at pp. 612-613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The majority patch together a test which combines the standards and procedural requirements set forth in one of these decisions\u2014Hayes\u2014with those of section 2357. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 165-166, 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Even the most cursory examination of section 2357 reveals that it is intended for application in entirely different circumstances and is ill-suited to the task. Section 2357 was designed for decisions regarding treatment of medical conditions posing a threat to the life or health of an incompetent conservatee. Judicial authorization of a conservator\u2019s request for medical treatment is permitted only where, \u201c[i]f untreated, there is a probability that the condition will become life-endangering or result in a serious threat to the <em>physical </em>health of the . . . conservatee.\u201d (\u00a7 2357, subd. (h)(2), italics added.) In Valerie\u2019s case, this prerequisite is nonexistent, since no one has even suggested that her capacity to procreate, assuming that she is in fact fertile, constitutes a threat to her physical health.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Section 2357 does require the conservator to show what, if any, efforts have been made to obtain an informed consent from the conservatee. (\u00a7 2357, subd. (c)(6).) However, it does not require a finding that the conservatee\u2019s inability to make a decision about treatment is permanent. (See \u00a7 2357, subd. (h)(3).) This omission is probably due to the fact that the section is designed for use in medical emergencies presenting a moderate degree of time urgency, a situation in which such a requirement would be inappropriate. Similarly, section 2357 does not require a court to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>a less drastic and irreversible alternative is unlikely to become available in the near future. In the sterilization context, that omission is shocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The <em>Hayes </em>standards remedy some of the more glaring deficiencies in section 2357. However, <em>Hayes </em>suffers from all the problems inherent in the application of the procreative choice model and the substituted consent device in this context. Moreover, it includes fitness for parenthood among its criteria. <em>(Hayes, supra, </em>608 P.2d at p. 640; accord <em>Grady, supra, </em>426 A.2d at p. 483.) There is merit in respondent\u2019s argument that this criterion is inconsistent with the notion that the choice being made is the one the conservatee would make. Considering fitness for parenthood is also inconsistent with the goal of putting an incompetent conservatee in the same position as normal individuals, who are free to bear or beget children without reference to their fitness as parents. Employing parental fitness as a criterion may also be constitutionally impermissible on overbreadth and underinclusiveness grounds. (See <em>Problem or Solution, op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 928-932; Note, <em>Developments in the Law\u2014The Constitution and the Family </em>(1980) 93 Harv. L.Rev. 1296, 1302-1313; <em>Right to Choose, op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 569, fn. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">At least one of the other <em>Hayes </em>requirements conflicts with the theory of the majority opinion. The majority rest much of their constitutional analysis on Valerie\u2019s liberty interest in minimizing restrictions on her social interactions. Yet <em>Hayes </em>permits a trial court to authorize the sterilization of an incompetent, developmentally disabled woman only if it finds \u201cby clear, cogent and convincing evidence\u201d that \u201call less drastic contraceptive methods, <em>.including supervision . . . </em>have been proved <em>unworkable </em>or <em>inapplicable. </em>\u201d <em>(Hayes, supra, </em>608 P.2d at p. 641, italics added.) The majority do not explain how this requirement, which they purport to adopt, can be squared with their theory that Valerie has a liberty interest in being sterilized in order to be free of parental supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In sum, the majority compound the errors of their constitutional analysis with the adoption of an unsatisfactory patchwork of contradictory standards. I cannot subscribe to this careless exercise in judicial legislation, particularly where such a fundamental right is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Respondent has demonstrated a compelling state interest in protecting an incompetent, developmentally disabled conservatee\u2019s fundamental right to procreate. Contrary to the majority\u2019s effort to merge this right into a general right of procreative choice, the right to procreate has an independent foundation. For a permanently incompetent individual who is incapable of mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ing choices about sterilization, the right to procreate must be regarded as paramount to any \u201cright to be sterilized.\u201d The latter right, as a component of the right of procreative choice, is meaningful only in the case of an individual capable of making such choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The adverse impact of a sterilization ban on a developmentally disabled conservatee\u2019s liberty is also insufficient to justify jeopardizing her right to procreate. Sterilization results in a complete and irrevocable deprivation of the right to procreate, while restrictions on an individual\u2019s activities resulting from a ban on sterilization constitute at most a partial deprivation of that individual\u2019s liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The ban on sterilization of incompetent conservatees in section 2356, subdivision (d) is necessary to effectuate the state\u2019s compelling purpose of protecting the fundamental right to procreate. Manifestly, the legal fiction of substituted consent is inadequate to protect this fundamental right. Accordingly, I would hold that section 2356, subdivision (d) is constitutional.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">All subsequent statutory references are to the Probate Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Many of the compulsory sterilizations performed in this state were undertaken on the same rationale advocated by the majority in this case\u2014that sterilization was necessary in order to permit developmentally disabled persons unsupervised social contact with members of the opposite sex. <em>(State Plan, supra, </em>at pp. 58-59.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-12\">This theory, known as \u201cnegative eugenics,\u201d was also applied to the mentally ill and to persons convicted of certain types of crime.

As the Colorado Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[c]onsent by parents to the sterilization of their mentally retarded offspring has a history of abuse which indicates that parents, at least in this limited context, cannot be presumed to have an identity of interest with their children.

Research has debunked the myth that retarded persons do not object to sterilization and suffer no adverse emotional effects from the loss of their procreative capacities. This myth was reflected in <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Bell, supra, </em>where Justice Holmes opined that the loss of procreative capacity through compulsory sterilization of developmentally disabled persons is \u201coften not felt to be a sacrifice by those concerned.\u201d (274 U.S. at p. 207 [71 L.Ed. at p. 1002].)</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">An exhaustive survey of scientific literature on the subject supports the opposite conclusion. One of the reports covered by the survey revealed that, \u201cof 50 sterilized retarded individuals discharged from Pacific State Hospital (California) between 1949 and 1958, . . . 68% disapproved of the operation, while only 20% clearly approved. Only 9% of the women approved, in contrast to 35% of the men.\u201d (Roos, <em>Psychological Impact of Sterilization on the Individual </em>(1975) 1 L. &amp; Psychology Rev. 45, 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ahm\">The author of the survey, then the executive director of the National Association for Retarded Citizens, summarized his conclusions as follows: \u201cAssumptions that mentally retarded persons are insensitive to the consequences of sterilization have been vitiated by recent studies. The psychological impact of sterilization on the mentally retarded is likely to be particularly damaging in those instances where the procedure is the result of coercion and when the retarded person has not previously had children. Existential anxieties commonly associated with mental retardation are likely to be seriously reinforced by coercive sterilization of those who have had no children. Common sources of these anxieties include low self-esteem, feelings of helplessness, and need to avoid failure, loneliness, concern over body integrity and the threat of death.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"AX9\">The mildly and moderately retarded individuals surveyed were admittedly more articulate than Valerie. However, counsel for respondent argue persuasively that these individuals\u2019 perceptions of the world are more likely to correspond to Valerie\u2019s than are those of a social worker, a conservator or even a parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
