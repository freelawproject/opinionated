We will decide whether a pharmacy at which the drug was purchased may be held strictly liable for alleged defects in the product (as distinguished from ordinary negligence), and whether a manufacturer which sold 10 percent of DES nationwide may be found to have had a \u201csubstantial\u201d share of the market for the purpose of applying the \u201cmarket share\u201d doctrine enunciated in <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588 [163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, 2 A.L.R.4th 1061].</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Plaintiff filed an action for personal injuries allegedly resulting from DES taken by her mother in 1951 and 1952 during pregnancy for the purpose of reducing the risk of miscarriage. The complaint sought damages on the theory of strict liability, alleging that the drug was defectively designed, with the result that plaintiff developed clear cell adenocarcinoma at the age of 23. As defendants, plaintiff joined Exclusive Prescription Pharmacy Corporation (Exclusive) where plaintiff\u2019s mother purchased the DES, and E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc. (Squibb). The first cause of action alleged that Squibb was the manufacturer of the DES used by plaintiff\u2019s mother. The second count, added after our decision in <em>Sindell, </em>alleged that plaintiff was unable to identify the manufacturer, but that Squibb supplied a \u201csubstantial percentage\u201d of DES for use by pregnant women to prevent miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Before jury selection began, the court granted Exclusive\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding that a pharmacy may not be held strictly liable for dispensing a prescription drug. The court determined that Exclusive rendered a professional service in supplying the DES, that the consumer of the drug was the doctor who prescribed it rather than plaintiff\u2019s mother, and that as a matter of policy the doctrine of strict liability should not be extended to a pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">In support of her second cause of action plaintiff offered to prove that Squibb sold 10 percent of the DES in the national market. The court ruled that as a matter of law 10 percent of the national market was not a \u201csubstantial percentage\u201d within the meaning of <em>Sindell, </em>and it dismissed the second cause of action. The matter went to trial against Squibb on the first cause of action alleging that Squibb had actually supplied the DES taken by plaintiff\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties introduced evidence on whether Squibb was the manufacturer of the offending drug, and the trial court instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>jury that plaintiff had the burden of proof on this issue. The jury returned a special verdict, finding that plaintiff\u2019s mother had purchased the DES at Exclusive, and that the DES which she purchased was not manufactured by Squibb. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<em>The Action Against Exclusive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In the seminal case of <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d 1049], Justice Tray nor, writing for the court, held a manufacturer strictly liable in tort for injuries caused by a defective product which it knew would be used without inspection for defects. In <em>Vandermark </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 256 [37 Cal.Rptr. 896, 391 P.2d 168], the strict liability doctrine was extended to retailers of defective products.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Plaintiff asserts that a pharmacy which sells prescription drugs is in the same position as a retailer of any other consumer product, and that the reasons advanced in <em>Greenman </em>and <em>Vandermark </em>for imposing strict liability necessarily apply to a pharmacy. Exclusive counters that a pharmacist who dispenses a prescription drug is primarily furnishing a service rather than selling a product, and that the rationale underlying imposition of strict liability does not justify application of the doctrine to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Before reaching the merits of these conflicting claims, we observe that pharmacists perform a broad range of tasks, from selling razor blades and dental floss to treating patients in a health care facility by ordering laboratory tests and administering drugs by injection (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4046, subd. (c)(4)) and acting as consultants regarding medication prescribed for patients at such facilities (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 72375). The discussion which follows relates only to the duties in a community pharmacy of a pharmacist who fills prescriptions for drugs on the order of a physician or other medical care provider, and who has used due care in compounding and labelling the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">There are no cases in California deciding whether a retail pharmacy is strictly liable for injuries caused by an inherent defect in a drug. In Florida <em>(McLeod </em>v. <em>W.S. Merrell Co. </em>(Fla. 1965) 174 So.2d 736, 739), North Carolina (Ba<em>tiste </em>v. <em>American Home Products Corp. </em>(1977) 32 N.C.App. 1 [231 S.E.2d 269, 275]) and New York <em>(Bidder </em>v. <em>Willing </em>(1977) 58 App.Div.2d 331 [397 N.Y.Supp.2d 57, 59-60]) a pharmacy is held not to be strictly liable for defects in a prescription drug. These cases rely on section 402A of the Restatement Second of Torts, which declares that unavoidably unsafe products such as drugs are not defective if they are accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>panied by an appropriate warning (id., com. k), and that a seller is only required to warn of defects of which he knew or should have known <em>(id., </em>com. j).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">It is critical to the issue posed to determine if the dominant role of a pharmacist in supplying a prescription drug should be characterized as the performance of a service or the sale of a product. Both parties accept as a general rule that \u201cthose who sell their services for the guidance of others . . . are not liable in the absence of negligence or intentional misconduct.\u201d <em>(Gagne </em>v. <em>Bertran </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 481, 487 [275 P.2d 15].) This principle was applied in <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 958 [95 Cal.Rptr. 381], the primary authority on which the trial court relied. A doctor who prescribed a drug purchased by the patient at a pharmacy was held not to be strictly liable for injuries resulting from its use. In response to the argument of the plaintiff that the doctor was \u201cin a sense a retailer\u201d of the drug, the court stated that the doctor prescribed the medication only as an aid to effect a cure and was not in the business of selling the drug. The court observed, \u201c[T]he distinction between a transaction where the primary objective is the acquisition of ownership or use of a product and one where the dominant purpose is to obtain services has not been obliterated. Where the services sought are professional in character, the distinction applies <em>a </em>fortiori. \u201d (Id., at p. 978.) On this theory, a hospital was held not strictly liable as the \u201csupplier\u201d for injuries arising out of the use of a surgical needle which broke during an operation. <em>(Silverhart </em>v. <em>Mount Zion Hospital </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 1022, 1027 [98 Cal.Rptr. 187, 54 A.L.R.3d 250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>Magrine </em>v. <em>Krasnica </em>(1967) 94 N.J.Super. 228 [227 A.2d 539], held that a dentist was not strictly liable for injuries caused by a needle which broke during the course of treatment due to a latent defect. The court characterized the difference between a sale and a service as follows: \u201c[T]he <em>essence </em>of the transaction between the retail seller and the consumer relates to the <em>article sold. </em>The seller is <em>in the business </em>of supplying the product to the consumer. It is that, and that alone, for which he is paid. A dentist or physician offers, and is paid for, his professional services and skill. That is the <em>essence </em>of the relationship between him and his patient.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 543.) (Accord: <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Nudelman </em>(1937) 367 Ill. 626 [12 N.E.2d 635] [holding optometrists and oculists who examined eyes and sold eyeglasses, exempt from a tax imposed on retailers of tangible goods on the ground that their main objective was to provide a service and that the sale of eyeglasses was purely incidental to the service]; see also <em>Barbee </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(Tex. 1968) 425 S.W.2d 342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">As might be anticipated, the parties differ sharply as to whether the main function of a pharmacist is to provide a service or to sell a product. Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>asserts that the duties of a pharmacist in filling a prescription do not differ from those of any other retailer: he reads the prescription, fills the container with the proper type and dosage of the medication required, types up a label, attaches it to the container, and exchanges the medication for payment by the customer. In essence, argues plaintiff, a pharmacist is the functional equivalent of \u201can experienced clerk at a hardware store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Exclusive and amici curiae<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> paint a dramatically different picture of the role of the pharmacist, characterizing him as a professional who provides an important health service. They point out that with a few exceptions specified by statute, only a physician or a licensed pharmacist may compound or dispense prescription drugs (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4050 et seq.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to obtain a license, a pharmacist must have graduated from a four-year college of pharmacy or the department of pharmacy of a university, have one year of practical experience under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, and pass a written examination given by the California State Board of Pharmacy (Board) (\u00a7\u00a7 4085, 4087). He must comply with continuing education requirements as a condition to renewal of his license (\u00a7 4098.5), and is subject to rules of professional responsibility and to disciplinary proceedings for violation of those rules (\u00a7 4350 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">A pharmacist is required not only to assure that the drug prescribed is properly selected, measured and labelled but, according to the Board, he must be alert to errors in prescriptions written by doctors, and contact the doctor in case of doubts or questions regarding the drug prescribed. In addition, the pharmacist may discuss with the patient the proper use of the drug and the potential side effects, and must be aware of the possibility of harmful interaction between various medications which the pharmacist knows the patient is using. According to the Board, about 22 percent of patients are counseled by the pharmacist, who spends one and one-half to two hours a day in such consultation. (Citing Cal. Pharm. (Jan. 1985) 1984 Lilly Digest Rep., p. 33, table 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">It seems clear to us that the pharmacist is engaged in a hybrid enterprise, combining the performance of services and the sale of prescription drugs. It is pure hyperbole to suggest, as does plaintiff, that the role of the pharmacist is similar to that of a clerk in an ordinary retail store. With a few exceptions, only a licensed pharmacist may dispense prescription drugs, and as indicated above there are stringent educational and professional require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ments for obtaining and retaining a license. A pharmacist must not only use skill and care in accurately filling and labelling a prescribed drug, but he must be aware of problems regarding the medication, and on occasion he provides doctors as well as patients with advice regarding such problems. In counseling patients, he imparts the same kind of information as would a medical doctor about the effects of the drugs prescribed. A key factor is that the pharmacist who fills a prescription is in a different position from the ordinary retailer because he cannot offer a prescription for sale except by order of the doctor. In this respect, he is providing a service to the doctor and acting as an extension of the doctor in the same sense as a technician who takes an X-ray or analyzes a blood sample on a doctor\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Nevertheless, it cannot be disputed that a sale in fact occurs. There is an obvious distinction between the doctor who provides a patient with a prescription for a defective drug <em>(Carmichael, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 958), a dentist who uses a faulty drill <em>(Magrine, supra, </em>227 A.2d 539) or a hospital that uses a defective needle during surgery <em>(Silverhart, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 1022), and a pharmacist who fills a prescription. The pharmacist is in the business of selling prescription drugs, and his role begins and ends with the sale. His services are rendered only in connection with the sale, and a patient who goes to a pharmacy to have a prescription filled generally is seeking to purchase the drug rather than to obtain the advice of the pharmacist.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">By contrast, the doctor, dentist and hospital in the cases cited above are not in the business of selling the drug or device; they use the product in the course of treatment as one element in their efforts to effect a cure, and furnishing the services does not depend on sale of a product.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Ordinarily, in deciding whether the sale or service aspect of an enterprise predominates, we would confine our consideration to the type of factors discussed above. In the case of a pharmacy, however, we must broaden our inquiry. The Legislature has provided in section 4046 that the practice of pharmacy is not only a profession (subd. (a)), but also a \u201cdynamic patient-oriented <em>health service </em>that applies a scientific body of knowledge to improve and promote patient health by means of appropriate drug use and drug related therapy\u201d (subd. (b)). (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">This declaration that a pharmacist provides a health service is similar to section 1606 of the Health and Safety Code, which declares that the distribution or use of whole blood or plasma is a service for all purposes and shall not be construed to be a sale.  The object of section 1606 is to avoid application of the doctrine of strict liability to those who make or sell blood or blood plasma, or to those who use it in blood transfusions, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>promoting the constant availability of an adequate supply of blood. <em>(McDonald </em>v. <em>Sacramento Medical Foundation Blood Bank </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 866, 872 [133 Cal.Rptr. 444].) In keeping with this purpose, it is held that a hospital using blood in a transfusion <em>(Shepard </em>v. <em>Alexian Brothers Hosp. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 606 [109 Cal.Rptr. 132]), a blood bank supplying the blood <em>(McDonald) </em>and a manufacturer of blood plasma selling it for transfusion <em>(Fogo </em>v. <em>Cutter Laboratories, Inc. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 744 [137 Cal.Rptr. 417]) are immune from strict liability because the Legislature has declared in section 1606 that they are providing a service rather than making a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">It is true that section 1606 of the Health and Safety Code provides not only that the distribution and use of blood and blood plasma is a service, but also that they should be deemed not to constitute a sale, whereas section 4046, subdivision (b), does not expressly declare that a sale is not involved in the practice of pharmacy. Nevertheless, the Legislature could not have been unaware when it enacted this provision that a pharmacist\u2019s main function is to fill prescriptions for medications that are sold to the public. Indeed, from a comparative functional aspect, a pharmacist\u2019s role is more aptly characterized as the performance of a service than that of the manufacturer and seller of blood plasma. The Legislature must have intended, therefore, that even though a pharmacist is paid for the medication he dispenses, his conduct in filling a prescription is to be deemed a service, and, like the manufacturer of blood plasma, a pharmacy is immune from strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We reject plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that because subdivision (b) of section 4046 was enacted at the same time as subdivision (c) of the section (which authorizes a pharmacist to order laboratory tests and give injections in health care facilities) the declaration that the practice of pharmacy provides a \u201chealth service\u201d was intended to apply only to a pharmacist acting in that capacity. (Stats. 1981, ch. 989, \u00a7 1, p. 3830.) To the contrary, the broad wording of subdivision (b) indicates that it applies to the practice of pharmacy in general, and we so construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">There is no definitive legislative history of subdivision (b), and we are not certain, therefore, of the Legislature\u2019s motivation in shielding pharmacies from strict liability. The Legislature may have determined that it is not in the public interest to subject them to strict liability, because (like the need to assure an adequate supply of blood plasma) the wide availability of a full range of prescription drugs at economical cost outweighs the advantage to the individual consumer of being able to recover for injuries on a strict liability basis rather than to be limited to claims arising from negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">If pharmacies were held strictly liable for the drugs they dispense, some of them, to avoid liability, might restrict availability by refusing to dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>drugs which pose even a potentially remote risk of harm, although such medications may be essential to the health or even the survival of patients. Furthermore, in order to assure th\u00e1t a pharmacy receives the maximum protection in the event of suit for defects in a drug, the pharmacist may select the more expensive product made by an established manufacturer when he has a choice of several brands of the same drug. As the Board\u2019s amicus brief warns, \u201cWhy choose a new company\u2019s inexpensive product, which has received excellent reviews in the literature for its quality, over the more expensive product of an established multinational corporation which will certainly have assets available for purpose of indemnification 10, 20, or 30 years down the line?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The Legislature might have decided also that, since the doctor who ordered the drug provided by the pharmacy cannot be held strictly liable for its defects and in some circumstances the manufacturer who created the defect can also escape liability, it would be unfair and burdensome to expose the pharmacy alone to strict liability since it may provide the drug only on a doctor\u2019s prescription, which the pharmacist must strictly follow.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff emphasizes that some pharmacies are owned by large chain store operations which are as capable as large drug manufacturers to respond in damages. But most pharmacies are not in this category. According to the Board, approximately 3,385 pharmacy permits are held in California by independent operators of 3 or fewer pharmacies, many of which are single drugstores owned by the operating pharmacist. Only 1,165 permits are held by operators of 4 or more pharmacies, and 642 permits are held by hospital pharmacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Finally, plaintiff contends that even if the pharmacist is personally exempt from strict liability because he provides a service, the \u201cmerchandising organization which employs him . . . should not be so exempted.\u201d Plaintiff cites no authority in support of this claim, and we perceive no basis in law or rationale for accepting it. The fact that a pharmacy may be owned by an enterprise which also deals in ordinary merchandise does not justify the conclusion that it should be held strictly liable when it performs a service. Moreover, the policy justifying the grant of immunity from strict liability to the practice of pharmacy would only be effectuated if the pharmacy operation itself is exempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the trial court was correct in granting judgment on the pleadings to Exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\n<em>The Action Against Squibb</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Plaintiff alleged in her second cause of action that she could not identify the specific manufacturer of the drug taken by her mother and that Squibb \u201csupplied a substantial percentage\u201d of the drug to prevent miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">By these allegations, plaintiff sought recovery under the \u201cmarket share\u201d theory advanced in <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 588. In that case, the plaintiff charged in her complaint that defendant manufacturers of DES, with knowledge that it might cause cancer in the daughters of the mothers who took the drug, failed to adequately test it for safety or to warn of its dangers. She could not identify the producer of the drug actually ingested by her mother, and for that reason the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrers to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We reversed the judgment, reasoning substantially as follows: The general rule is that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish that the injuries she suffered were caused by the conduct of the defendant. This rule is not without its exceptions, however, including the doctrine of \u201calternative liability\u201d applied in <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Tice </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 80 [199 P.2d 1, 5 A.L.R.2d 91]. In <em>Summers, </em>the plaintiff had suffered an injury to his eye after the two defendants had each shot a gun in his direction. The plaintiff was unable to demonstrate which of the defendants was responsible for his injury. It was held that he was not barred from pursuing the action, because the circumstances justified shifting the burden of proof to the two defendants to absolve themselves if they could. This would not be unfair, it was reasoned, because both had acted negligently toward the plaintiff, and they would both escape liability if the plaintiff were forced to choose between them and was unable to isolate which was responsible. We declined to apply this holding without modification to the drug manufacturer defendants in <em>Sindell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Nevertheless, we held in <em>Sindell, </em>because of policy considerations spelled out in our opinion, that plaintiff and those in her position should not be bereft of a remedy. We stated that the likelihood that any of the defendants caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries should be measured not by the number of DES manufacturers joined as defendants\u2014only five of two hundred manufacturers were defendants in the action\u2014but by the percentage which the DES sold by each of them for the purpose of preventing miscarriage bore to the entire production of the drug sold by all producers of the identical formula for that purpose. If plaintiff joined in the action the manufacturers of \u201ca substantial share of the DES which her mother might have taken, the injustice of shifting the burden of proof to defendants to demonstrate that they could not have made the substance which injured plaintiff\u201d would be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>siderably diminished. (26 Cal.3d at p. 612.) We recognized that there were practical problems involved in defining the market and determining market share, but held that these were matters of proof which could not be determined at the pleading stage. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The <em>Sindell </em>decision has generated numerous commentaries. (E.g., <em>DES Ruling Shakes Product Liability Field </em>(1980) 66 A.B.A. J. 827; Note (1982) 18 Cal. Western L.Rev. 143; Note (1981) 11 Golden Gate L.Rev. 917; Note (1981) 94 Harv.L.Rev. 668; Note (1982) U. Ill.L.Rev. 1003; Note (1981) 60 Neb.L.Rev. 432; Note (1981) Okla.L.Rev. 843; Note (1981) 8 Pepperdine L.Rev. 1011; Note (1981) 33 Stan.L.Rev. 937; Note (1981) Utah L.Rev. 655; Comment (1981) 26 Vill.L.Rev. 997.) Some of these comments relate to the appropriate composition of the market for application of the market share doctrine and the meaning of the term \u201csubstantial share\u201d as used in the opinion. (E.g., Fischer, <em>Products Liability\u2014An Analysis of Market Share Liability </em>(1981) 34 Vand.L.Rev. 1623, 1642-1645; Note (1981) 69 Cal.L.Rev. 1179, 1189-1193, 1197-1199; Comment, <em>The Market Share Theory </em>(1981) 19 Hous.L.Rev. 107, 128-129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">At the trial level here, plaintiff confined her offer of proof to a national market for DES.  Our only inquiry, therefore, is whether, as the trial court determined, a 10 percent share of this market is insufficient as a matter of law to allow plaintiff to proceed on the basis of the market share doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Plaintiff appears to contend that the doctrine was designed to accomplish a fair approximation of the damages which each defendant DES manufacturer would be required to pay under the principles of comparative fault <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 578 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899]), and that its applicability is unrelated to whether plaintiff has joined as defendants the manufacturers of a substantial share of the DES market. This claim lacks merit. The major issue decided in <em>Sindell </em>was whether and the circumstances under which a plaintiff in a DES case could avoid application of the usual rule that she had the burden of proving the defendant manufacturer produced the DES which caused her injuries. The opinion makes it clear that in order to shift the burden of proof on the issue of causation in fact, a plaintiff must join in the action the manufacturers of \u201ca substantial share of the DES which her mother might have taken.\u201d (26 Cal.3d at p. 612.) Although we stated that the defendant manufacturers could cross-complain against other DES manufacturers not joined in the action, which might have supplied the injury-causing product, we were careful to qualify the statement with the observation that such pleadings would be filed by defendants only after \u201cplaintiff has met her burden of joining the required defendants.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>We must determine, therefore, whether Squibb\u2019s 10 percent market share is a substantial percentage of the market for the application of the rule laid down in <em>Sindell. </em>Plaintiff, relying on general definitions of the word \u201csubstantial\u201d asserts that the term must be defined in the context of a particular case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and since Squibb was alleged to be the second largest seller of DES in the country, its 10 percent market share must be deemed substantial in the framework of DES litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">We reject this contention because it is contrary to the theoretical justification underlying the market share doctrine. We pointed out in <em>Sindell </em>that a major reason why shifting the burden of proof from plaintiff to defendants was warranted in <em>Summers </em>was that both parties who were or could have been responsible for the harm to the plaintiff were joined as defendants. Thus, there was a 50 percent chance that one of the defendants was responsible for the injury. (26 Cal.3d at p. 602.) We declined to apply an unmodified <em>Summers </em>rationale to the facts in <em>Sindell, </em>because only five of the two hundred manufacturers of the DES which could have harmed plaintiff were before the court, and therefore there was \u201cno rational basis upon which to infer that any defendant in this action caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries, nor even a reasonable possibility that they were responsible.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 602-603.) Instead, we concluded that the likelihood that one of the defendants supplied the DES should be determined not by the number of manufacturers joined in the action but by the percentage which the DES sold by each to prevent miscarriage bore to the entire production of the drug sold for that purpose. We held that if the plaintiff joined in the action the manufacturers of a substantial share of the DES which her mother might have taken, the injustice of shifting the burden of proof to defendants to exonerate themselves would be significantly diminished. We declined to declare a specific percentage of the market which would satisfy application of the doctrine, but stated only that it must be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Since Squibb had only a 10 percent share of the DES market, there is only a 10 percent chance that it produced the drug causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and a 90 percent chance that another manufacturer was the producer. In this circumstance, it must be concluded that she failed to meet the threshold requirement for the application of the market share doctrine. The trial court was justified in ruling, therefore, that she could not proceed to trial on the second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The trial of the first cause of action, which was confined to the question whether Squibb was in fact the manufacturer of the drug taken by plaintiff\u2019s mother, concluded with a jury verdict in Squibb\u2019s favor.

Quite apart from the extent to which pharmacists are expected to provide a service in addition to a product \u2014 a question with which not only this court, but also the pharmacy profession is presently grappling \u2014 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>I conclude Bertr\u00e1n\u2019s exemption from strict liability for \u201cthose who sell their services for the guidance of others\u201d <em>(Gagne </em>v. <em>Bertr\u00e1n </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 481, 487 [275 P.2d 15]) does not, and was never intended to, exempt from such liability one who renders a service incidental to a sale. I also conclude, however, that Vandermark\u2019s extension of strict liability to retailers of consumer products <em>(Vandermark </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 256 [37 Cal.Rptr. 896, 391 P.2d 168]) does not, and was never intended to, subject to such liability one whose authority to sell a product is strictly regulated by a comprehensive statutory scheme, and who dispenses his prescription drug product only at the direction of another who is himself exempt from such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">A person with a broken leg does not visit an orthopedist in order to purchase plaster, nor does one with crooked teeth seek out an orthodontist to acquire stainless steel wire, although both might acquire those items from such a professional during the course of treatment. \u201cSale\u201d of the plaster or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>wire will not subject the doctor or dentist to strict liability for defects in those products because that \u201csale\u201d is merely incidental to the patient\u2019s real purpose\u2014obtaining a professional service. <em>(Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 958, 977-979 [95 Cal.Rptr. 381]; <em>Magrine </em>v. <em>Krasnica </em>(1967) 94 N.J.Super. 228 [227 A.2d 539, 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">On the other hand, one normally does not patronize a pharmacist merely to ask for prescription advice. Although the pharmacist might well discuss with a customer such matters as whether a particular prescription drug may adversely react with other prescription drugs he is taking, or whether continuing to take a particular prescription drug will cause accumulation of excessive quantities of dangerous substances in his body, such a service would be rendered incidental to the real reason for the customer\u2019s visit-acquisition of a prescribed drug. Because the pharmacist\u2019s service (to the extent it exists in a given case) is merely incidental to a sale, the rendering of such a service cannot exempt a pharmacy from strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Nevertheless, I conclude that nothing in our previous decisions, nor the decisions of any other state, either directly or by analogy supports extension of strict liability to retail pharmacists who sell prescription drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">A pharmacist is not free to sell a prescription drug to anyone who merely requests the product and offers payment; unlike a car dealer or a tire vendor, a pharmacist may dispense his prescription drugs only after being authorized to do so by a prescribing physician or similar person. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4036, subd. (a).) In preparing the drug and selling it to his customer on the prescriber\u2019s authorization, the pharmacist simply carries out what the prescriber orders. Although he has some limited discretion in the matter\u2014 i.e., he may (i) under certain circumstances, fill the prescription with a less costly substitute containing the same ingredients,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or (ii) consult the prescribing physician if he believes the prescription is mistaken or otherwise inappropriate in light of the patient\u2019s other prescriptions\u2014final authority for ordering the prescription filled still rests exclusively with the prescribing physician. At the same time, the physician, whose responsibility it is to properly diagnose, counsel, prescribe and warn his patient about proper use and risks associated with the prescribed drug, is exempt under <em>Bertr\u00e1n </em>from strict liability for defects in the drug he orders the pharmacist to dispense. <em>(Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at pp. 977-979.) In this situation\u2014in which policy considerations intervene to exempt the primarily responsible actor (the prescriber) from strict liability\u2014basic fairness and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>mon sense dictate it would be fundamentally unfair to treat pharmacists like any other retailer of any other product.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">I conclude strict liability should not apply in the case of a retail pharmacist, whose authority to sell prescription drugs is closely regulated by statute, and who dispenses his product only at the direction of a prescriber who is himself exempt from such liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\"> Justice Kaus, in his dissent, advocates modification of <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588 [163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, 2 A.L.R.4th 1061] to eliminate the \u201csubstantial share\u201d requirement.

A pharmacist, whose role in dispensing medication is severely circumscribed by statutory scheme, and whose preparation of a drug may be undertaken only pursuant to prescription, should not be held liable when the prescriber is himself excepted from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Unlike Justice Grodin, however, I find merit in Justice Mosk\u2019s statutory approach as well. Subdivision (b) of section 4046 of the Business and Professions Code states \u201cPharmacy practice is a dynamic patient-oriented health service that applies a scientific body of knowledge to improve and promote patient health by means of appropriate drug use and drug-related therapy.\u201d The Legislature has also announced that \u201cIn recognition of and consistent with the decisions of the appellate courts of this state, [it] hereby declares the practice of pharmacy to be a profession.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4046, subd.

I believe that the Legislature had in mind more than mere hortatory language when it defined the practice of pharmacy in terms of the provision of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Both parties agree, as the majority reiterates, that the sale of a service does not render one liable \u201c \u2018in the absence of negligence or intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>misconduct.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>ante, </em>p. 677.) The dissent matches Health and Safety Code section 1606, which states that transactions involving blood and blood products used for transfusions involve a service and are not to be viewed as a sale \u201cfor any purposes whatsoever,\u201d against the reference in section 4046 which characterizes the practice of pharmacy as a service. Chief Justice Bird concludes that because of the absence of language stating such transactions are not to be regarded as sales, one cannot discern in section 4046, subdivision (b), an intent to exempt a pharmacist\u2019s dispensing of prescription drugs from the reach of strict liability. I disagree. If services generally are recognized to be so exempted, and the Legislature specifically deems the practice of pharmacy a service, it seems to me that the only likely means of giving effect to his language is to interpret it in the same manner as that used for Health and Safety Code section 1606. The dissent gives no alternative interpretation for the statutory language nor does it explain how its approach renders subdivision (b) anything other than vacant jargon.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In summary, I join in the holding that pharmacists should not be held strictly liable for defects in drugs that they dispense at the direction of another.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Like Justices Mosk, Grodin, and Kaus, I agree that the question of strict liability for drug manufacturers is not and need not be addressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b718-5\">BIRD, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtI\">I dissent from the affirmance of the judgment in favor of defendant Exclusive Prescription Pharmacy Corporation (Exclusive). Under principles of products liability which are firmly established in this state, a retail druggist is strictly liable in tort for the sale of a defective prescription drug. Today\u2019s majority reach the opposite conclusion by retreating from sound principles which, in less turbulent times, were viewed as beyond serious challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Specifically, the majority take a narrow and cramped view of the policies served by strict liability. Several of the most important policies, first articulated in the pioneering opinions of Chief Justice Roger Traynor, are not even mentioned. The majority\u2019s failure to address these policies has unfortunate consequences which go beyond their incorrect conclusion regarding liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">As a result of this unfortunate opinion, doubts are cast on this court\u2019s past statements recognizing the applicability of the entire doctrine of strict liability to defective prescription drugs. In the process, the very foundations of the doctrine are called into question. I cannot join in a retreat from one of this court\u2019s most firmly established, highly acclaimed and beneficial adaptations of tort law to modern mass production and marketing methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The majority also embrace elitist distinctions based on the professional status of retail druggists and, thereby, draw utterly contradictory conclusions regarding the significance of this status. Contradictions aside, professionalism has nothing to do with the central question to be answered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The issue is whether retail druggists and pharmacies, which sell prescription drugs to consumers, are engaged primarily in selling a product or in performing a service. The simple answer is that in the marketing of prescription drugs by retail druggists, as in the marketing of automobiles and other consumer products, the sale aspect predominates over any incidental service provided to the consumer. For this reason, and because every one of the policies served by strict liability would be advanced by applying the doctrine to the sale of a defective prescription drug by a retail druggist, I would reverse the judgment in favor of defendant Exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Chief Justice Tray nor first proposed the doctrine of strict liability in tort as the basis of recovery in defective product cases in his landmark concurring opinion in <em>Escola </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 453, 461 [150 P.2d 436]. He cited important public policy considerations that demanded this development in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u201cEven if there [were] no negligence . . . public policy demands that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market. It is evident that the manufacturer can anticipate some hazards and guard against the recurrence of others, as the public cannot. Those who suffer injury from defective products are unprepared to meet its consequences. The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business. It is to the public interest to discourage the marketing of products having defects that are a menace to the public. If such products nevertheless find their way into the market it is to the public interest to place the responsibility for whatever injury they may cause upon the manufacturer, who, even if he is not negligent in the manufacture of the product, is responsible for its reaching the market. However intermittently such injuries may occur and however haphazardly they may strike, the risk of their occurrence is a constant risk and a general one. Against such a risk there should be general and constant protection and the manufacturer is best situated to afford such protection.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">In <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d 1049], this court unanimously adopted Chief Justice Traynor\u2019s theory of strict liability in tort. <em>Greenman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>did not restrict the application of the doctrine to any subclass of products. Writing for the court, Chief Justice Tray nor noted that such liability had been applied to a variety of products ranging from unwholesome food to defective vaccines. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 62.) The court\u2019s formulation of the rule was correspondingly broad in scope. \u201cA manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market . . . proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">While <em>Greenman </em>presented only the question of a manufacturer\u2019s liability for a defective product, the policies underlying the strict liability doctrine apply to others in the marketing chain by which the product reaches the consumer. This was made clear a year later in <em>Vandermark </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 256 [37 Cal.Rptr. 896, 391 P.2d 168]. Chief Justice Traynor\u2019s opinion, again expressing the unanimous view of this court, held that a retailer is strictly liable in tort for defects in products it sells. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 262-263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\u201cRetailers like manufacturers are engaged in the business of distributing goods to the public. They are an integral part of the overall producing and marketing enterprise that should bear the cost of injuries resulting from defective products. [Citation.] In some cases the retailer may be the only member of that enterprise reasonably available to the injured plaintiff. In other cases the retailer himself may play a substantial part in insuring that the product is safe or may be in a position to exert pressure on the manufacturer to that end; the retailer\u2019s strict liability thus serves as an added incentive to safety.. Strict liability on the manufacturer and retailer alike affords maximum'protection to the injured plaintiff and works no injustice to the defendants, for they can adjust the costs of such protection between them in the course of their continuing business relationship.\u201d <em>(Ibid;</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>accord <em>Becker </em>v. <em>IRM Corporation </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 454, 459 [213 Cal.Rptr. 213, 698 P.2d 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\"><em>Vandermark </em>was followed by a string of decisions affirming the importance and scope of the strict liability doctrine. <em>(Cronin </em>v. <em>J.B.E.

(See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 689-691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Specifically, it is inconsistent with SindelVs recognition that strict liability policies are \u201cparticularly significant where medication is involved, for the consumer is virtually helpless to protect himself from serious, sometimes permanent, sometimes fatal, injuries caused by deleterious drugs.\u201d <em>(Sindell, supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d at p. 611.) It is also inconsistent with the alternative tests for design defect which this court unanimously adopted in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 413 [143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1],</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The <em>Barker </em>court held that strict liability could be imposed on a theory of defective design under either of two tests. \u201cFirst, a product may be found defective in design if the plaintiff establishes that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. Second, a product may alternatively be found defective in design if the plaintiff demonstrates that the product\u2019s design proximately caused his injury and the defendant fails to establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design.\u201d <em>(Barker, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The \u201crelevant factors\u201d to be considered under the second test include \u201cthe gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design, the likelihood that such danger would occur, the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design, the financial cost of an improved design, and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 431.) Because the focus in a strict liability case is on the condition of the product itself and not on the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct, <em>Barker </em>directed that the trier of fact should consider the state of knowledge available at the time of trial, rather than restricting itself to what was known or could have been known by the defendant when the product was sold. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 430, 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The interpretation of comment k in the cases cited by the majority is inconsistent with <em>Barker </em>in at least two respects. First, these cases assume that comment k stands for the proposition that all prescription drugs are unavoidably unsafe products. That assumption appears unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The sole example given in the comment is the Pasteur treatment for rabies. Noting that the treatment \u201cnot uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences,\u201d the comment concludes nonetheless that its marketing and use are fully justified \u201c[s]ince the disease itself invariably leads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>to a dreadful death . . . .\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 402A, com. k.) Thus, the comment weighs the drug\u2019s harmful qualities against its benefits as the only efficacious product for treatment of a fatal disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">This weighing of benefits and risks is consistent with the approach adopted in <em>Barker. </em>Application of the same weighing approach in a different context could well lead to a different conclusion. For example, the drug at issue might be only one of several formulas designed to treat a condition that, unlike rabies, is non-life threatening. The interpretation of comment k adopted by the majority\u2019s cases, by precluding a meaningful case-by-case weighing of known benefits and risks, is inconsistent with <em>Barker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">However, comment k also states that \u201cnew or experimental drugs\u201d should not be subject to strict liability for defective design when, \u201cbecause of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety . . ., but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk.\u201d (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 402A, com. k.) This reasoning and, to the extent they rely on it, the majority\u2019s cases are at odds with <em>Barker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">As noted above, <em>Barker </em>emphasized that the focus in a strict liability case is on the safety of the product in light of the knowledge available to the trier of fact at the time of trial. <em>(Barker, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at pp. 430, 434.) \u201c[T]he fact that the manufacturer took reasonable precautions in an attempt to design a safe product or otherwise acted as a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have under the circumstances, while perhaps absolving the manufacturer of liability under a negligence theory, will not preclude the imposition of liability under strict liability principles if, <em>upon hindsight, </em>the trier of fact concludes that the product\u2019s design is unsafe to consumers, users, or bystanders.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 434, italics added; see <em>Finn </em>v. <em>G. D. Searle &amp; Co., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 722 &amp; fn. 17 (dis. opn.).) The quoted passage from comment k, with its emphasis on the limited medical experience available when a new prescription drug is marketed, is inconsistent with <em>Barker's </em>time-of-trial standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The majority\u2019s uncritical discussion of foreign cases exempting retail druggists from strict liability on the basis of comment k is troubling not so much because it provides the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of their opinion. As noted above, no direct reliance is placed on these cases or the Restatement approach. Rather, it is troubling because it reveals a willingness to deviate from established principles of strict liability where prescription drugs are concerned. At a more fundamental level, it suggests a weakened commitment to the well-established principles of strict liability in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Turning to the real question presented by plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant pharmacy, the majority concede that the retail druggist \u201cis in the business of selling prescription drugs, and his role begins and ends with the sale. His services are rendered only in connection with the sale, and a patient who goes to a pharmacy to have a prescription filled generally is seeking to purchase the drug rather than to obtain the advice of the pharmacist.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 679.) That statement should be enough to end the debate with a decision that the pharmacy is strictly liable for the sale of a defective prescription drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Under the test which the parties and the majority agree govern here, strict liability applies if the purchase of a product is the \u201cprimary objective\u201d or \u201cessence\u201d of the transaction. <em>(Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 958, 978 [95 Cal.Rptr. 381]; see <em>Magrine </em>v. <em>Krasnica </em>(1967) 94 N.J.Super. 228 [227 A.2d 539.) Strict liability is inapplicable only where the transaction is limited to the provision of a service and does not involve the sale of a product <em>(Gagne </em>v. <em>Bertran </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 481, 487 [275 P.2d 15] [defendant who performed soil tests not strictly liable]) or where the service aspect predominates and any sale included in the transaction is incidental to the provision of the service <em>(Silverhart </em>v. <em>Mount Zion Hospital </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 1022, 1027 [98 Cal.Rptr. 187, 54 A.L.R.3d 250] [hospital that supplied surgical needle which broke during operation not strictly liable]).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Accepting the majority\u2019s characterization of the retail druggist\u2019s business as \u201ca hybrid enterprise, combining the performance of services and the sale of prescription drugs\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 678), it is nonetheless abundantly clear that the sale aspect predominates.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The majority\u2019s own statistics bear this out. Only 22 percent of patients who purchase prescription drugs are counseled by the retail druggist, who spends an average of only one and one-half hours a day performing this service. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 678.) Thus, in the vast majority of prescription drug sales transactions, the customer receives only a product and no services from the retail druggist.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The predominance of the sale is also reflected by the fixed prices the retail druggist charges for prescription drugs, based on a markup from wholesale cost rather than an hourly fee calculation. (Compare <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Bertran, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d at p. 487 [hourly fee charged by soil tester showed that he was selling a service, not a product].)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The majority dismiss as \u201cpure hyberbole\u201d plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that the retail druggist\u2019s role is similar to that of a clerk in an \u201cordinary\u201d retail store. Yet, the average hardware store clerk probably devotes as much or more time to counseling customers on the applications and proper use of the items offered for sale by the store. I doubt that the majority would have any difficulty concluding that the essence of the transaction between the hardware clerk and the customer is a sale rather than a service.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The majority, diverging from the inquiry into the nature of the transaction, contend that the educational and professional standards which must be met to obtain a pharmacist\u2019s license somehow dictate the conclusion that the retail druggist and the pharmacy are primarily engaged in the provision of a service. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 678-679.) An almost mystical significance is attributed to the retail druggist\u2019s admitted expertise and professional status.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">For example, the majority quote with approval language contained in <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz, supra, </em>which suggests that once a defendant has been determined to be a professional, no inquiry into the nature of the transaction at issue is necessary. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 677, quoting <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 978- [\u201cWhere the services sought are professional in character, the [service/sale] distinction applies <em>a fortiori\u201d].) </em>Nowhere do they explain how the retail druggist\u2019s professional status converts the business of selling prescription drugs, in which the provision of services plays a subordinate role, into a business in which the service aspect predominates.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The majority also draw contradictory conclusions from the high standards of knowledge and professional responsibility to which retail druggists are held. On the one hand, they stress the retail druggist\u2019s extensive knowledge of the properties, proper dosages, contraindications and side-effects of prescription drugs as support for the view that the retail druggist is primarily a seller of services rather than products. Yet, if anything, the retail druggist\u2019s expertise supports the imposition of strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Armed with extensive knowledge of the products he or she sells, the retail druggist may be better equipped than other retailers to identify defective products. This capacity was a prime consideration supporting the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>tion of strict liability to retailers. \u201c[T]he retailer himself may play a substantial part in insuring that the product is safe or may be in a position to exert pressure on the manufacturer to that end; the retailer\u2019s strict liability thus serves as an added incentive to safety.\u201d <em>(Vandermark, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at p. 262.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On the other hand, the majority stress the statutory and professional restrictions that limit the retail druggist\u2019s discretion. Since a retail druggist may not sell a prescription drug except on a doctor\u2019s order and is prohibited from substituting a different drug (other than a generic equivalent), they suggest that it would be unfair to treat retail druggists like other retailers who are not subject to such restraints. This reasoning misses the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The retailer\u2019s capacity to select the product sold has <em>never </em>been held to be a <em>prerequisite </em>to the imposition of strict liability. On the contrary, the doctrine has been held to apply to a wholesale-retail tire distributor who supplied whatever tires the manufacturer specified. <em>(Barth </em>v. <em>B. F. Goodrich Tire Co., supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d at pp. 248-254.) This rule is consistent with the well-established principle that a retailer is strictly liable even though not equipped to test the product sold. (See <em>Escola, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 464.) It is also consistent with the focus of the strict liability doctrine on the <em>product </em>rather than on the <em>conduct </em>of the defendant. (See <em>Barker, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The majority attempt to dispel any persisting doubts by referring to the language of Business and Professions Code section 4046. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 679-681.) They conclude that the Legislature intended this provision to exempt retail druggists and pharmacies from strict liability in the same manner that Health and Safety Code section 1606 exempts all persons involved in the distribution of blood and blood products <em>(Fogo </em>v. <em>Cutter Laboratories, Inc. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 744 [137 Cal.Rptr. 417]; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Sacramento Medical Foundation Blood Bank </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 866 [133 Cal.Rptr. 444]; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Alexian Brothers Hosp. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 606 [109 Cal.Rptr. 132]). However, when the two statutes are placed side by side, the differences are striking.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Health and Safety Code section 1606 provides in its entirety as follows: \u201cThe procurement, processing, distribution, or use of whole blood, plasma, blood products, and blood derivatives for the purpose of injecting or transfusing the same, or any of them, into the human body shall be construed to be, and is declared to be', for all purposes whatsoever, the rendition of a service by each and every person, firm, or corporation participating therein, and shall not be construed to be, and is declared not to be, a sale of such whole blood, plasma, blood products, or blood derivatives, for any purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>or purposes whatsoever.\u201d It is difficult to imagine a clearer expression of an intent to create an exemption under the sale/service distinction established in the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">By contrast, subdivision (b) of Business and Professions Code section 4046 declares that the practice of pharmacy is a \u201cdynamic patient-oriented health service that applies a scientific body of knowledge to improve and promote patient health by means of appropriate drug use and drug-related therapy.\u201d Conspicuously absent from the general language of this provision is a declaration regarding the nature of the specific transaction by which a retail druggist transfers a prescription drug to a customer\u2014much less a declaration that this transaction is always to be construed as the rendition of a service and never as a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The foregoing comparison establishes that when the Legislature intends to exempt an occupational group or activity from strict liability, it knows how to say so. (See <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 243, 249-250 [211 Cal.Rptr. 517, 695 P.2d 1058].) It did so for those engaged in supplying blood and blood products when it enacted the explicit language of Health and Safety Code section 1606.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">No such intention can be gleaned from the vague and general language concerning the practice of pharmacy in Business and Professions Code section 4046. No amount of speculation by this court regarding matters of which the Legislature \u201ccould not have been unaware when it enacted this provision\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 680) can make up for the absence of a declaration by the Legislature of the intent which the majority seek to attribute to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The majority do not stop at speculation regarding the Legislature\u2019s intent. They also engage in the purest form of speculation, attempting to divine the motivation which underlay this supposed intent. It is fair to say that the concerns they settle on are their own rather than the Legislature\u2019s. These concerns range from a fear that imposing strict liability on retail druggists would lead to a scarcity of life-saving drugs to a fear of increased prices. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 680-681.) The majority also express concern about the fairness of imposing strict liability on those retail druggists who are small, \u201cindependent operators,\u201d particularly because the prescribing doctor and, in some circumstances, the manufacturer, can escape liability. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Apart from the lack of evidence that the Legislature shared the majority\u2019s concern when it enacted Business and Professions Code section 4046, these arguments do not support the exemption of retail druggists from strict lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>bility. There is no evidence that the imposition of strict liability would cause the supply of prescription drugs to dry up. Such fears are unfounded if one but reviews the experience with other retail sales businesses after they were made subject to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">For example, automobile dealers have been subject since <em>Vandermark </em>to strict liability for injuries caused by defects in the automobiles they sell. Although injuries from such defects are not uncommon, automobile dealers have continued in business, and there has been no noticeable decrease in the supply of cars for sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">As to the concern that prices might rise, this possibility has long been recognized and accepted as an integral part of the strict liability doctrine. (See, e.g., <em>Escola, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 462 (cone. opn. of Traynor, J.) [\u201cthe risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business\u201d]; <em>Becker </em>v. <em>IRM Corporation, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 466 [\u201cThe paramount policy of the strict products liability rule remains the spreading throughout society of the cost of compensating otherwise defenseless victims of manufacturing defects\u201d].) The same can be said of the claim that it would be unfair to impose strict liability on a retail druggist if the manufacturer is unavailable to answer in damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIf anything, the unavailability of the manufacturer is a factor militating in favor of liability of persons engaged in the enterprise who can spread the cost of compensation.\u201d <em>(Id.; </em>accord <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Alad Corp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 22, 33-34 [136 Cal.Rptr. 574, 560 P.2d 3]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 251.) As this court observed in <em>Vandermark, </em>\u201c[i]n some cases the retailer may be the only member of [the overall producing and marketing] enterprise reasonably available to the injured plaintiff. . . . Strict liability on the manufacturer and retailer alike affords maximum protection to the injured plaintiff and works no injustice to the defendants, for they can adjust the costs of such protection in the course of their continuing business relationship.\u201d (61 Cal.2d at pp. 262-263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The majority stress the small size of many pharmacy businesses. However, it cannot be denied that a high volume of prescription drugs are currently marketed by large-scale, modern commercial enterprises. The fact that there continue to be many single drugstores owned by the operating retail druggist does not justify an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">As one commentator has noted, \u201cthe inception of strict liability is an outgrowth of the food laws and is based on the human consumption theory. There is no reason why this theory of strict liability should not include drugs. This would tend to make the retail druggist an insurer of the safety of the product, even though he had exercised all reasonable care. This liability without fault has been criticized in the past as putting small business men in the constant jeopardy of being run out of business. This argument, however, is very weak in comparison to the opposite result of \u2018leaving the patient to pay.\u2019 Strict liability has not made small food dealers extinct, but has forced all food retailers to exert the highest duty of care expected of them. Thus, placing a similar strict liability on the retail druggist will likewise urge him to exercise the highest duty of care commensurate with his superior knowledge and justify the trust placed in him by the public.\u201d (Schmitz, <em>Retail Druggist\u2019s Warranty of Drugs </em>(1966) 15 Clev.-Mar. L.Rev. 285, 291, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">For all the reasons articulated above, retail druggists and pharmacies should be strictly liable for the sale of defective prescription drugs. The injured consumer should not assume that burden. The judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant Exclusive should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Kaus, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Broussard, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\"><em>Vandermark </em>echoed views Justice Tray nor had expressed 20 years earlier in the <em>Escola </em>concurrence. Noting that retailers had long been held strictly liable for defects in the products they sold under the warranty of safety included in the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability, Chief Justice Tray nor had observed in <em>Escola </em>that, as with the manufacturer, the retailer\u2019s duty had a basis in tort law. \u201cThis warranty is not necessarily a contractual one [citations], for public policy requires that the buyer be insured at the seller\u2019s expense against injury. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Escola, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 464.) He also noted that the retailer was under an <em>absolute </em>liability to his customer even if the retailer was not equipped to test a product. (Ibid.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Plaintiff here consciously rejected the \u201cfailure to warn\u201d approach. As plaintiff explains, she \u201chas not alleged in this case that DBS was defective because defendants failed to warn of the risks attendant to the use of the drug. Quite [] the contrary, it was plaintiff\u2019s intention to prove that this drug should have never been marketed at all for use in pregnant women. It was ineffective for the indication promoted by Squibb and it caused cancer in the daughters of women who ingested the drug while pregnant. Suffice to say that a drug marketed for use in pregnant women bearing a warning that it is not to be used by pregnant women is conceptually ludicrous. Plaintiff refused to base her case on such thinly constructed logic, but rather elected to establish strict products liability on the manufacturer and retailer of this pharmaceutical product based on its defective design.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The majority opinion does not rely on these cases or the Restatement\u2019s exemption from strict liability of prescription drugs as direct support for its holding that the pharmacies that sell such drugs are exempt. However, a reluctance to apply strict liability to prescription drugs is one of the opinion\u2019s recurring themes. This reluctance reappears, for example, when the majority permit themselves to speculate that the Legislature meant to exempt retail druggists from strict liability because \u201cthe wide availability of a full range of prescription drugs at economical cost outweighs the advantage to the individual consumer of being able to recover for injuries on a strict liability basis rather than to be limited to claims arising from negligence.\" (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 680; see <em>post, </em>at pp. 698-700.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Here it bears noting that section 402A and comment k have remained unchanged since their adoption in 1965, only three years after <em>Greenman </em>and one year after <em>Vandermark. </em>The intervening years have witnessed a dynamic evolution in this court\u2019s approach to strict liability, while the Restatement\u2019s formulation has remained static.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab8G\">This court has \u201cnot hesitated to reach conclusions contrary to those set forth in Restatement section 402A.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Cronin, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 131; see <em>Price </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 253.) <em>Barker </em>concerned an alleged design defect in a high-lift loader.

Rather, the doctor prescribes medication only as part of the effort to effect a cure of the disease for which the patient sought the doctor\u2019s services. <em>(Carmichael </em>v. <em>Reitz, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at pp. 978-979.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b730-7\">KAUS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJe\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">On the question of whether a retail pharmacist may be held strictly liable for the sale of a defective prescription drug, I agree with the conclusions of the Chief Justice and have signed her separate dissenting opinion.

While Justice Grodin is correct in noting that doctors and dentists have not been held strictly liable for injuries caused by defective products which they incidentally use in performing their service on patients <em>(ante, </em>p. 685 (cone. opn. of Grodin, J.)), I know of no authority which suggests that <em>the retailer </em>who sells a doctor or dentist a defective surgical needle or defective orthodontic wire should escape strict liability for a resulting injury to the patient simply because the defective product has been used in the course of a professional service.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion on the separate issue of whether plaintiff has stated a cause of action against the drug manufacturer under the \u201cmarket share\u201d doctrine set forth in <em>Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588 [163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, 2 A.L.R.4th 1061]. Although I recognize that <em>Sindell </em>purported to qualify the application of the market share doctrine by the requirement that plaintiff join the manufacturers of a \u201csubstantial share\u201d of the stilbestrol (DES) market (26 Cal.3d at p. 612), frankly I never could see how that qualification can logically be squared with the decision\u2019s general market share theory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As I understand the market share concept, under that doctrine\u2014in contrast, for example, to the doctrine of <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Tice </em>(1948) 33 Cal.2d 80 [199 P.2d 1, 5 A.L.R.2d 91] or <em>Ybarra </em>v. <em>Spangard </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 486 [154 Cal.Rptr. 687, 162 A.L.R. 1258]\u2014each manufacturer can only be held liable <em>for that proportion of the plaintiff\u2019s damages which equals the particular manufacturer\u2019s market share of the DES that was manufactured and sold. (Sindell, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 612.) Because the manufacturer\u2019s liability is limited in this fashion, I do not see how a particular manufacturer is harmed by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to join more manufacturers in the lawsuit; any particular defendant bears the same liability no matter how many or how few other manufacturers are joined. Thus, I do not think a plaintiff should be deprived of the limited recovery which <em>Sindell </em>allows against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>particular manufacturer simply because, for one reason or another, she has not been able to amass the manufacturers of a \u201csubstantial share\u201d of the DES drug.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\"> emphasize that the retailer\u2019s liability should simply be coextensive with that of the drug manufacturer. If\u2014for reasons not fully explored in existing California cases\u2014it is determined that, in a particular context, a drug manufacturer should not be held strictly liable for harm caused by a prescription drug, the retailer too should escape strict liability. But when the manufacturer may properly be held strictly liable\u2014as would clearly be the case, for example, if it marketed an impure batch of a prescription drug\u2014the retailer of the defective drug should also be strictly liable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">At least one academic commentator, who strongly supports the imposition of tort liability on a market share theory, has expressed similar misgivings about Sindell\u2019s \u201csubstantial share\u201d of the market requirement. (See Robinson, <em>Multiple Causation in Tort Law: Reflections on the DES Cases </em>(1982) 68 Va.L.Rev. 713, 725-726.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
