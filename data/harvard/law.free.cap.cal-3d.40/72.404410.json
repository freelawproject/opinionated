Code, \u00a7 51) guarantees every person in California \u201cfull and equal\u201d access to \u201call business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Act is this state\u2019s bulwark against arbitrary discrimination in places of public accommodation. Absent the principle it codifies, thousands of facilities in private ownership, but otherwise open to the public, would be free under state law to exclude people for invidious reasons like sex, religion, age, and even race. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Legislature\u2019s desire to banish such practices from California\u2019s community life has led this court to interpret the Act\u2019s coverage \u201cin the broadest sense reasonably possible.\u201d <em>(Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 468 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc., is a private charitable organization which operates a community recreational facility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Club is open to any local boy for a nominal membership fee, but plaintiffs in this case were excluded because they are girls. We must decide, among other things, whether the Club is among those \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d covered by the Act. If the Act does not apply, state law allows the Club to discriminate against female children, or on any other basis it chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">This state\u2019s law, as we shall demonstrate, has long prohibited arbitrary discrimination in places of public accommodation or amusement. Viewing the Unruh Act in its historical context, and in light of prior decisions of this court, we conclude that the term \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d was meant to embrace, rather than reject, that well established principle. On the particular record before us, there can be no doubt that the facility operated by the Boys\u2019 Club comes within the scope of that principle: its recreational facilities are open to the community generally but closed to members of a particular group. These facilities are the Club\u2019s principal activity and reason for existence. We therefore agree with the Santa Cruz Superior Court, which found that the Club is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d for purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Like the superior court, we also reject the contention that the Club may nonetheless discriminate against girls because their participation would contravene \u201cthe nature of its business enterprise and ... the facilities provided.\u201d (See <em>Marina </em>Point, <em>Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 741 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th 1161], cert. den., 459 U.S. 858 [74 L.Ed.2d 111, 103 S.Ct. 129] (hereafter <em>Marina Point).) </em>There is no substantial evidence on this record that the Club\u2019s programs, services, and facilities are unsuitable for girls, or that inclusion of both sexes in these programs would diminish their value or effectiveness. Nor is there proof that female memberships would cause serious and permanent danger to the Club\u2019s funding or its relationship with its national organization. We will therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We emphasize the limited scope of our holding. Nothing in our analysis necessarily extends to organizations which operate facilities not generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>open to the public, or which maintain objectives and programs to which the operation of facilities is merely incidental. Nor does our holding necessarily apply to an organization which can demonstrate a compelling need to maintain single-sex facilities. Finally, we do not preclude the Legislature from amending the Act to allow the Boys\u2019 Club to maintain its male-only policy. The validity of any such future legislation is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc., a private nonprofit California corporation, owns and operates a building which includes such recreational facilities as a gymnasium, an indoor competition-size swimming pool, a snack bar, and craft and game areas. The local Club is affiliated with the Boys\u2019 Clubs of America, Inc., a congressionally chartered organization. (See 36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 691 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Only members may use the Club\u2019s programs and facilities, but membership is open to all Santa Cruz children between eight and eighteen, so long as they are male. Members pay only a $3.25 annual membership fee. The principal source of funding for the Club\u2014providing approximately 50 percent of its annual budget\u2014is a gift in trust from John T. and Ruth M. Mallery (the Mallery Trust). The Mallerys also donated the money for the Club building. The trial court found that the Mallery Trust was \u201cunrestricted\u201d as to gender. In 1978, after this suit began, the Mallerys made a $200,000 donation which was expressly conditioned on restriction of membership to boys. Remaining funds come from the United Way campaign, an annual golf event, and miscellaneous private donations.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The Club is run by an adult board of directors, officers of the corporation, and a paid staff headed by an executive director. Club members have no power over Club affairs or membership policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The Club is unique in northern Santa Cruz County in the range and low cost of the recreational facilities and programs it provides under one roof. No single program or facility open to girls offers a similar range of activities at similar cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">In 1977, plaintiff girls were denied access to the Boys\u2019 Club\u2019s membership and facilities solely on the basis of their sex. This action for injunctive and declaratory relief followed. After a trial on the merits, the court found that the Club\u2019s membership policy violated the Unruh Act, caused harm to the rejected girls, and deprived members of a nondiscriminatory environment. It permanently enjoined the Club from denying membership or access to its facilities to girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">1. <em>The Boys\u2019 Club is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the Unruh Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Club first contends that it is not a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Adopted in 1959, the Unruh Act, \u201c[e]manat[es] from and [is] modeled upon\u201d California\u2019s earlier statute forbidding arbitrary discrimination in \u201cpublic accommodations. <em>(Marina Point, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 731.) The prior law, first adopted in 1897, derived from the common law doctrine that certain public enterprises are obliged to serve all without arbitrary discrimination. <em>(In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 212 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992]; see Tobriner &amp; Grodin, <em>The Individual and the Public Service Enterprise in the New Industrial State </em>(1967) 55 Cal.L.Rev. 1247, 1250 [fns. omitted].) The Unruh Act <em>\u201cexpanded </em>the reach of [the prior public accommodations statute] from common carriers and <em>places of public accommodation and recreation, e.g., </em>railroads, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and the like, to include \u2018all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u2019\u201d <em>(Marina Point, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 731 (italics added), citing Horowitz, <em>The 1959 California Equal Rights in \u201cBusiness Establishments\u201d Statute\u2014A Problem in Statutory Application </em>(1960) 33 So.Cal.L.Rev. 260, 272-294 (hereafter Horowitz).)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">By its use of the emphatic words \u201call\u201d and \u201cof every kind whatsoever,\u201d the Legislature intended that the phrase \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d be interpreted \u201cin the broadest sense reasonably possible.\u201d <em>(Burks, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 468.) Indeed, the Unruh Act was adopted out of concern that the courts were construing the 1897 public accommodations statute too strictly.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">That prior law, a model for subsequent civil rights legislation in other jurisdictions both state and federal, prohibited arbitrary discrimination by enumerated lodging, eating, transportation, recreational, and entertainment facilities as well as \u201call other places of public accommodation or amusement, . . .\u201d (See Stats. 1897, ch. 108, \u00a7 1, p. 137, as amended.) However, despite periodic additions to the list of covered facilities (see Stats. 1919, ch. 210, \u00a7 1, p. 309 [public conveyances]; Stats. 1923, ch. 235, \u00a7 1, p. 485 [soda fountains]), lower appellate courts used the principle <em>ejusdem generis </em>to limit the law\u2019s reach. (See, e.g., <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Hollywood Professional School </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d Supp. 887, 890 [338 P.2d 633] [private school not covered]; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Middlestaff </em>(1957) 147 Cal.App.2d Supp. 833, 834-836 [305 P.2d 1020] [dentist\u2019s office not covered]; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Mountain View </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Cemetery Assn. </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 328, 329 [278 P.2d 945] [private cemetery not covered].) \u201cAccordingly, the Legislature, enacting the Unruh Act, modified the [prior] mandate . . . and broadened its scope [to include] all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d <em>(Cox, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The original version of the bill which became the Unruh Act extended its antidiscriminatory provisions to \u201call public or private groups, organizations, associations, business establishments, schools, and public facilities; ...\u201d (See Assem. Bill No. 594, as introduced Jan. 21, 1959.) Later versions dropped all the specific enumerations except \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d but added to the latter phrase the modifying words \u201cof every kind whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u201cThe broadened scope of business establishments in the final version of the bill, in our view, is indicative of an intent by the Legislature to include therein <em>all private and public groups or organizations </em>[specified in'the original bill] that may reasonably be found to constitute \u2018business establishments of every type [sic] whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>(O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 790, 795-796 [191 Cal.Rptr. 320, 662 P.2d 427], italics added.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) Considering the Act\u2019s ancestry, its phrase \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d clearly includes at least those facilities subject to the predecessor statute\u2014i.e., \u201cplaces of public accommodation or amusement.\u201d (See 34 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 230, 232 (1959); <em>Horowitz, supra, </em>33 So.Cal.L.Rev. 260, 289; cf., <em>Burks, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions have consistently held that broad-based nonprofit community service organizations like the Boys\u2019 Club are \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d covered by statutes analogous to California\u2019s pre-1959 civil rights law. For example, in language similar to our prior law, title II of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000a et seq.) grants \u201call persons\u201d the right to \u201cfull and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d includes, among other specified facilities, \u201cany motion picture house, theater, concert hall, sports arena, stadium <em>or other place of exhibition or </em>entertainment. \u201d (Id., \u00a7 2000a(b)(3), italics added.) Title II has been applied to private, nonprofit recreational organizations which offer memberships to the public at large and exclude only a particular class of persons protected by the statute. (E.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n of Montgomery </em>(5th Cir. 1972) 462 F.2d 634, 649; <em>Nesmith </em>v. <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n of Raleigh, N.C. </em>(4th Cir. 1968) 397 F.2d 96, 100; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Slidell Youth Football Ass\u2019n </em>(E.D.La. 1974) 387 F.Supp. 474, 482-484; cf., <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 298, 306-308 [23 L.Ed.2d 318, 325-327, 89 S.Ct. 1697].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The same rule has obtained under \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d legislation in other states. New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination bars sexual bias, among other things, in \u201cplaces of public accommodation.\u201d These are defined to include, without limitation, a long list of facilities and services, as well as \u201cother placets] of amusement.\u201d (N.J.Stat. Ann., \u00a7 10:5-5, subd. <em>1.) </em>There is an express exception for accommodations which are \u201cdistinctly private\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>or \u201cin [their] nature reasonably restricted exclusively to individuals of one sex.\u201d (N.J. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 10:5-12, subd. f.) The New Jersey courts have ruled that a local Little League was a covered \u201cplace of amusement,\u201d too unselective in membership to be \u201cdistinctly private,\u201d and suited in its goals and facilities to participation by girls. <em>(National Org. for W., Essex Ch. </em>v. <em>Little L. Base., Inc. </em>(1974) 127 N.J.Super. 522 [318 A.2d 33, 35 et seq., 66 A.L.R.3d 1247], affd. summarily (1974) 67 N.J. 320 [338 A.2d 198],)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Recently the New York Court of Appeals said that state\u2019s similar Human Rights Law (Exec. Law, \u00a7 290 et seq.) prohibits gender-based membership restrictions by United States Power Squadrons, a national boating safety and educational organization. <em>(U.S. Power Squad, </em>v. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Human R. App. Bd. </em>(1983) 59 N.Y.2d 401 [465 N.Y.S.2d 871, 874-877, 452 N.E.2d 1199].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">These principles and authorities persuade us that the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz is a \u201cplace of public accommodation or amusement,\u201d and thus a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the Act. The Club certainly qualifies as a \u201cplace of amusement.\u201d Indeed, its primary function is to operate a permanent physical plant offering established recreational facilities which patrons may use at their convenience during the hours the Club is open.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Moreover, the Club is classically \u201cpublic\u201d in its operation. It opens its recreational doors to the entire youthful population of Santa Cruz, with the sole condition that its users be male. (See <em>National Org. for W., Essex Ch. supra, </em>318 A.2d at pp. 37-38.) There is no attempt to select or restrict membership or access on the basis of personal, cultural, or religious affinity, as a private club might do.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">While there are some organized activities, the emphasis is on drop-in use of the Club\u2019s facilities, thus minimizing any sense of social cohesiveness, shared identity, or continuity. Boys who join the Club have no power in its affairs and no control over who else may be members. A fee, though not a large one, is charged for the annually renewable membership. Thus, the Club provides an atmosphere deemed characteristic of a \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d by the principal commentator on the Unruh Act; relations with and among its members are of a kind which take place more or less in \u201cpublic view,\u201d and are of a \u201crelatively nongratuitous, noncontinuous, non-personal, and nonsocial sort.\u201d <em>(Horowitz, supra, </em>33 So.Cal.L.Rev. 260, 287, 288.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The Club, its amici, and Justice Mosk urge that the statutory phrase \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d includes only commercial or profit-seeking ventures. They point to Chief Justice Gibson\u2019s statement in <em>Burks, supra, </em>that a \u201cbusiness\u201d is generally defined as a \u201c \u2018calling, occupation, or trade, engaged in for the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.\u2019 \u201d (57 Cal.2d at p. 468.) When that language is read in context, however, it provides no support for the Club\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The principal issue in <em>Burks </em>was whether the sale of tract homes was a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the Act. In discussing the statutory words \u201call,\u201d \u201cbusiness,\u201d \u201cestablishments,\u201d and \u201cof every kind whatsoever,\u201d <em>Burks </em>intended only to make clear that the Act applies \u201cwithout any exception and without specification of particular kinds of enterprises.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Burks </em>implied, as <em>O\u2019Connor </em>later confirmed, that the expansive phrase \u201call business establishments of every kind whatsoever,\u201d as it appeared in the final version of the Act, was intended to encompass many of the private groups and organizations mentioned in the original bill but removed before passage. <em>(Id., </em>57 Cal.2d at pp. 468-469, and fn. 3.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Burks </em>did not consider whether a nonprofit enterprise might come within the Act. In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>however, this court subsequently found \u201cno reason to insist that profit-seeking be a <em>sine qua non </em>for coverage under the [A]ct.\u201d The opinion held that the Act\u2019s regulation of \u201cbusiness establishment[s]\u201d included a nonprofit condominium owners\u2019 association whose \u201cbusinesslike\u201d functions, including its responsibility for enforcing an arbitrary adults-only rule, were intended to protect and enhance the condominium project\u2019s economic value. (33 Cal.3d at p. 796.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The Boys\u2019 Club insists it is further removed from the commercial world, since it collects no substantial fees from its users and has no economic function. Of course, it has some of the \u201cbusinesslike attributes\u201d noted in <em>O\u2019Connor; </em>like the nonprofit hospital there cited as an example of a nonprofit \u201cbusiness establishment,\u201d the Club employs a substantial paid staff and \u201ccare[s] for an extensive physical plant\u201d used for public purposes. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>However, we need not rely exclusively on the Club\u2019s functional similarity to a commercial business.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we have seen, the Unruh Act replaced a statute governing all \u201cplaces of public accommodation or amusement\u201d and was intended at a minimum to continue the coverage of \u201cpublic accommodations.\u201d The Santa Cruz Boys\u2019 Club, as a public recreational facility, fits within that category. In these circumstances, the fact that its purposes and operations are not strictly commercial does not bar a conclusion that it is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d to which the Act applies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Club and its amici note that parallel California statutes banning discrimination in housing and employment\u2014also originally adopted in 1959\u2014 contain express exemptions which refer to \u201cassociation[s] or corporation[s] not organized for private profit.\u201d (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12926, subd. (c), 12927, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They urge that by excluding \u201cnonprofit\u201d groups from the housing and employment laws, the Legislature demonstrated its intent that the phrase \u201cbusiness establishments,\u201d as used in the Unruh Act, should have a strictly commercial meaning. We cannot agree. The disparate grammar of three statutes attests to their different legislative histories and purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>If the specific exemption in the housing and employment laws proves anything, it is that the Legislature knows how to draft such exceptions when it wishes to. The Unruh Act covers \u201call\u201d business establishments \u201cof every kind whatsoever,\u201d and the Legislature has never added <em>any </em>exemption, exception, or restriction. We are not free to import one from another law.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Indeed, as we noted in <em>Marina Point, </em>the FEHA specifically provides that \u201cnothing contained in this part shall be construed, <em>in any manner or way, </em>to limit or restrict the application of Section 51 of the Civil Code [i.e., the Unruh Act].\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12993, subd. (c), italics added; see <em>Marina Point, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 731, fn. 5.) We conclude that the fair employment and housing provisions imply no restrictions on the Unruh Act which would exempt the Club from its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It is suggested that extension of the Unruh Act to the Boys\u2019 Club will threaten all private organizations which traditionally serve the special cultural or charitable needs of particular minority groups with common interests. But we have emphasized that the Club\u2019s status as a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the act arises from its \u201cpublic\u201d nature; it offers basic recreational facilities to a <em>broad segment </em>of the population, <em>excluding </em>only a <em>particular </em>group expressly recognized by the Act as a traditional target of discrimination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Finally, and belatedly, the Club contends that forcing female participation in its activities would interfere with its current members' rights of association guaranteed by the state and federal Constitutions. The United States Supreme Court has recently rejected the identical argument in a similar context. In Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 104 S.Ct. 3244], the court ruled that First Amendment associational rights do not prevent application of the Minnesota Human Rights Act to prohibit sex-segregated membership policies by the Jaycees. (See fn. 8, ante.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Roberts </em>acknowledged that the Constitution protects both \u201cintimate\u201d and \u201cexpressive\u201d associational rights. (468 U.S. at p. 618 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 471].) However, it found no unconstitutional infringement of either of these separate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The court quickly dismissed the claim that the Jay cees\u2019 membership rules involved rights of \u201cintimate\u201d association. It noted that the Jaycees\u2019 character as a large, socially unselective membership institution places it \u201coutside the category of relationships\u201d to which the individual right of personal choice applies. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 621 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 473-474].) The same is true of the Boys\u2019 Club, as we have seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Jaycees also argued in <em>Roberts </em>that their rights of \u201cexpressive\u201d association would be infringed by forced admission of women, since the organization\u2019s cohesive purpose and creed was to promote the special views and interests of young men. The court disagreed, though it conceded, as the court of appeals had noted, that a \u201c \u2018not insubstantial part\u2019 of the Jaycees\u2019 activities constitutes protected expression on political, economic, cultural, and social affairs.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 626 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 477-478].) The Minnesota law, the court observed, was not aimed at protected speech, and it imposed no direct restraint on the Jaycees\u2019 freedom to express their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">On the other hand, the statute\u2019s protection of equal access rights, said the court, was the least intrusive means of satisfying a compelling state interest\u2014the redress of historical discrimination against full participation by women in political, economic, and cultural life. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 627-628 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 478].) The court refused to entertain unproven assumptions, based on stereotypes, that participation of women would substantially alter the expressive character of the Jaycees. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The Boys\u2019 Club, though it purports to focus on the particular needs of male youth, does not suggest that it is substantially engaged in protected \u201cexpression of views.\u201d In any event, our construction of the Unruh Act intrudes no further, and for no less compelling purpose, than was the case in <em>Roberts. </em>No federal constitutional violation is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">We reach a similar conclusion under California\u2019s Constitution, though we recognize it affords greater privacy, expressive, and associational rights in some cases than its federal counterpart. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; see <em>City of Santa Barbara </em>v. <em>Adamson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 123, 130, fn. 3 [164 Cal.Rptr. 539, 610 P.2d 436, 12 A.L.R.4th 219]; <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 908 [153 Cal.Rptr. 854, 592 P.2d 341] affd. (1980) 447 U.S. 74 [64 L.Ed.2d 741, 100 S.Ct. 2035].) Considering this state\u2019s special constitutional sensitivity to sexual discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>(see <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 584, 600 [150 Cal.Rptr. 435, 586 P.2d 916]; <em>Sail\u2019er Inn </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 1, 17 [95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 485 P.2d 529, 46 A.L.R.3d 351]), we see no basis to hold that a statutory requirement of equal access to the recreational facilities of a public, nonselective, nonexpressive community service organization offends rights guaranteed by the California charter. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">2. <em>The Boys\u2019 Club\u2019s male-only membership policy is prohibited by the Unruh Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Club next argues that, even if it is a covered \u201cbusiness establishment,\u201d its \u201ctraditional\u201d membership policy is \u201creasonable\u201d and therefore permitted by the Act. Justice Kaus also urges that view. Under the facts of this case, we cannot accept the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Unruh Act accords every person an individual right against \u201carbitrary\u201d discrimination of any kind, whether or not set forth expressly in the statute. <em>(Marina Point, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 721, 732, quoting <em>Cox, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 216.) Plaintiffs suggest that by condemning in particular those discriminations based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, and national origin, the Legislature deemed them arbitrary and unreasonable per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Plaintiffs find support for this view in the legislative history of the 1974 amendment to the Act, which added a specific reference to sexual discrimination. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1193, \u00a7 1, p. 2568.) Intermediate versions of the amending bill, they note, proposed to ban <em>\u201carbitrary </em>discrimination ... on account of sex\u201d (italics added), but the modifying phrase was deleted from the final statute. Plaintiffs also emphasize the Legislative Counsel\u2019s view that the addition of sex to the Act would not extend its reach, since sexual discrimination would probably be considered a form of arbitrary discrimination already prohibited. (See discussion, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">After examining the history of the 1974 amendment in <em>Marina Point, </em>this court affirmed the <em>Cox </em>rule that the Act\u2019s \u201cidentification of particular bases of discrimination ... is illustrative rather than restrictive.\u201d (See 3 Cal.3d at p. 216.) The <em>Marina Point </em>opinion emphasized a letter to Governor Reagan from Senator Petris, Chairman of the Select Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs and also the author of the 1974 bill. (30 Cal.3d at p. 734.) Urging the Governor\u2019s signature on the sex amendment, Senator Petris explained: \u201cThe purpose of the bill is to bring it to the attention of the legal profession that the Unruh Act provides a remedy against <em>arbitrary </em>discrimination against women (or against men) in public accommodations which are business enterprises. This <em>bill </em>does not bring such discrimination under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the Unruh Act, because that Act has been interpreted as making <em>all </em>arbitrary discrimination illegal, on whatever basis. <em>The listing of possible bases of discrimination has no legal effect, </em>but is merely illustrative.\u201d (Second and third italics in original.) If the last quoted sentence is true, the mere fact that sex is listed as a prohibited ground of discrimination does not give it a special \u201carbitrary per se\u201d status, as plaintiffs suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Official comments by other persons and agencies involved in passage of the 1974 amendment do not appreciably advance plaintiffs\u2019 argument. The most complete analysis is that of the Legislative Counsel, included by Senator Petris with his letter to the Governor. This report took mutually contradictory views of the Act and the proposed amendment. First, it noted that, under <em>Cox, </em>the listed bases of discrimination are \u201c illustration[s] of what [constitute] arbitrary discrimination.\u201d Hence, it said, the bill \u201cwould not extend the application of the Unruh Civil Rights Act under existing case law,\u201d since \u201cdiscrimination based solely on sex would [probably] be considered arbitrary\u201d even without addition of that word to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Legislative Counsel cautioned, however, that \u201ca construction of the act that would prohibit discrimination on any of the grounds enumerated therein <em>whether or not such action was arbitrary </em>would lead to absurd results.\u201d (Italics added.) Noted in particular was the opposition mounted against the 1974 amendment by those who feared it would prohibit sex-segregated dormitories, institutional housing, and residence hotels. Such distinctions, the Legislative Counsel speculated, could probably be justified under both existing law and the proposed amendment as not based \u201csolely\u201d on sex. (See also Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Digest of Sen. Bill No. 1380 (Aug. 13, 1974) p. 2.) This confusing appraisal is scant evidence of a legislative intent to alter <em>Cox\u2019s </em>determination that the identified bases of discrimination in the Act merely illustrate what may constitute arbitrary discrimination. Accordingly, we affirm that holding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In <em>Marina Point, </em>the court discussed the nature of arbitrary discrimination. Though one may be excluded from a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d on an individual basis \u201cif he conducts himself improperly or disrupts the operations of the enterprise,\u201d it is \u201carbitrary,\u201d and therefore prohibited, to exclude <em>an entire class </em>on the basis of stereotyped notions. (30 Cal.3d at pp. 738-739; see <em>Cox, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at pp. 217-218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\"><em>Marina Point </em>left open the possibility, however, that the Act might allow the exclusion of an entire class whose presence \u201cbasically [would] not ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>cord with the nature of [the] business enterprise and of the facilities provided.\u201d (30 Cal.3d at p. 741.) Specifically, it suggested that limitation of access to members of certain groups might operate in certain cases \u201cas a reasonable and permissible means under the Unruh Act of establishing and preserving <em>specialized facilities </em>for those <em>particularly in need </em>of such services or environment. [Citation and fn. omitted.]\u201d (Italics added.) An example was housing facilities reserved for the elderly, which by design and function served the unique physical, social, and psychological needs of this minority group. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 742-743.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The court suggested that the \u201csocial need\u201d served by such a \u201cspecialized institution\u201d must be well-documented and established as a matter of public policy. The case for \u201cspecialization\u201d is strengthened if the facility was designed to satisfy the particular concerns and characteristics of the needy group, making it less suitable for general use. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The Marina Point complex, the opinion said, could not qualify under those standards. As designed, it was suitable for children; indeed, the adults-only policy was of recent vintage. Moreover, compared to the special housing needs of the elderly, the preference of some childless adults to live away from children was not a \u201csimilarly compelling societal interest.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In fact, the no-children rule exacerbated a more serious social problem than it purported to alleviate, since there is considerable evidence that families with small children have particular trouble finding affordable housing. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Nonetheless, the Club argues here that it falls within the <em>Marina Point </em>exception as a \u201cspecialized facility\u201d designed and operated solely to serve the particular \u201csocial needs\u201d of boys. But the Club has failed to make the showing on this issue that <em>Marina Point </em>demands. There is no indication that the crafts, games, counseling programs, and recreational facilities offered by the Club are suited or safe only for males. Indeed, plaintiffs seek admission to membership because of their interest in using those programs and facilities. (See <em>National Org. for W., Essex Ch., supra, </em>318 A.2d at pp. 38-39.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The Club contends that its primary purpose\u2014to combat delinquency\u2014is an important social interest best served by concentrating on male youth. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>introduced juvenile hall statistics suggesting that Santa Cruz boys are four times more likely than their female counterparts to get into trouble with the law. By extending service to girls, the Club urges, it will have to dilute its efforts with boys, who present the greater social problem.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">It was conceded, however, that delinquency affects substantial numbers of girls. There was no evidence that boys need the recreation offered by the Club more than girls, that a sex-segregated \u201cdrop-in\u201d recreational facility is more effective in combating juvenile delinquency than one open to both sexes, or that extension of membership to girls would cause an impractical net increase (or decrease) in membership.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Most fundamentally, the Club argues that it nonetheless has the absolute right to choose to focus on the needs of boys alone. Again, the analogy is drawn to the many organizations which limit their services and programs to particular minority subgroups. As we have seen, however, noncommercial organizations open <em>only </em>to such well-defined subgroups are not \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d and thus may not be \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d covered by the Act. Here, by contrast, the Club will admit without distinction fully half the youthful population of Santa Cruz. The sole group excluded, though not numerically a minority, has been a traditional target of discrimination.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The effect of this policy in Santa Cruz is to deny the excluded group, and that group alone, access to recreational opportunities available nowhere else <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>in the vicinity. Thus, as was true of Marina Point, the Club may be creating a more compelling social problem than the one it seeks to alleviate.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Even the Club\u2019s argument that it traditionally serves only boys can no longer be sustained. There was undisputed evidence that a number of local Clubs, including several in California, have admitted girls with no untoward effects.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the Club is a \u201cspecialized facility\u201d entitled, despite the broad proscription of the Unruh Act, to deny access to girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The Club suggests that its funding is in jeopardy if its membership policies change. But the trial court found on substantial evidence that the original Mallery Trust, the Club\u2019s major financial source, is unrestricted on that score. We recognize with concern that the Mallery\u2019s 1978 gift of $200,000 is conditioned on continuation of the male-only policy. But admission of girls may well produce offsetting new revenue sources. There is no evidence of severe, permanent financial danger should the Club be forced to comply with the Act. In sum, this record provides no basis for an exception to the Act\u2019s rule against arbitrary discrimination by \u201cbusiness establishments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We have decided that the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the Unruh Act, and that its male-only membership policy is an arbitrary form of discrimination prohibited by that statute. In our view, these conclusions are compelled by the Legislature\u2019s very broad antidiscrimination policy. We caution again, however, that our holding is based on the particular nature and function of the Club. Nothing we say necessarily requires a similar result in the case of other single-sex youth organizations. Nor may we foreclose the Legislature from a more precise formulation of the situations in which private discrimination is forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Both dissenting opinions focus upon the question of sex discrimination, blithely ignoring the significance of the question presented here upon discrimination of other sorts. Under the dissenters\u2019 view, organizations such as appellant would be free to exclude members on the basis of race, or national ancestry, as well. Justice Poch\u00e9, dissenting in the Court of Appeal, made a pertinent observation in that regard: \u201cPerhaps the violation would be clearer if the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz had discriminated on the basis of race, not sex. But that lack of clarity is not the fault of the language of the statute. Instead, the difficulty is the long and well-ingrained tradition of women\u2019s dependency which even today causes statutory recognition of the equality of women to have a strange and unreal ring to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., and Chesney, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Section 51 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, or national origin are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d We sometimes refer to the statute hereafter as the Unruh Act, or simply the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We hereafter sometimes refer to both the local facility and the national organization with which it is affiliated as the Boys\u2019 Club or the Club.

The state supreme court concluded that the Minneapolis and St. Paul chapters of the United States Jaycees, though strictly nonprofit, are public \u201cbusiness facilities\u201d whose membership policies are covered by the Act. The court noted in particular that national Jaycee policy views the recruitment of unselective paid memberships as the sale of \u201cgoods\u201d and \u201cprivileges\u201d\u2014in that case, leadership training and social contacts which give members an \u201cedge\u201d in business life. <em>(United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>McClure </em>(Minn. 1981) 305 N.W.2d 764, 768-769.) The record here discloses no such blatantly commercial approach by the Boys\u2019 Club to membership policy. Nor are the benefits of membership in the Club so closely tied to aspirations for business success. Nonetheless, the Club does extend to members, in return for their dues, the special privilege of access to its recreational facilities. It also offers paid members counseling, craft classes, and other programs designed to promote healthy development toward adulthood.

Conversely, we have stressed that the statute was intended to include those kinds of recreational <em>facilities </em>traditionally deemed \u201caccommodations.\u201d Wc have not suggested that noncommercial groups which do not operate such facilities arc covered \u201cbusiness establishments.\u201d We simply affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz in particular operates \u201caccommodations\u201d which are \u201cpublic\u201d in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Of course, discrimination against a racial minority is always invidious, and where such discrimination is prohibited, it is prohibited absolutely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Seizing on this phrase in <em>Marina Point, </em>a Ninth Circuit panel has recently concluded that \u201cblanket exclusion\u2019\u2019 of a particular class, such as women, from a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d covered by the Unruh Act can only be justified by a \u201ccompelling\u201d social concern. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>International Olympic Committee </em>(1984) 740 F.2d 670, 677; see also <em>Koire </em>v. <em>Metro Car Wash </em>(1985) <em>ante, </em>pp. 24, 38 [216 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195].) We need not decide whether this is the precise semantic definition of the <em>Marina Point </em>test, since the Club has not proven, as <em>Marina Point </em>certainly requires, that its all-male policy directly ameliorates a well-documented need and aids a well-established public policy. (See discussion, <em>post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\">A member of the Club\u2019s staff testified that any necessary rearranging of restroom and dressing facilities would not be a major problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">There was testimony that the current \u201cdrop-in\u201d policy of the Club would have to be altered, and a system of specific hours for specific groups instituted, if membership rose much above the current fairly stable figure of 1,200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Amicus Tustin Boys\u2019 Club suggests that, because of their \u201cmacho\u201d culture, Latino boys from high-delinquency neighborhoods might refuse to attend a Club which admitted girls as members.

There is no evidence that the Santa Cruz facility has such cultural or demographic problems.</p>\n<p id=\"AzO\">Nor can we accept Justice Kaus' suggestion that the Club has obeyed the Act because its decision to devote its resources to the greater delinquency problem it perceives among male youth was \u201crational\u201d and taken in \u201cgood faith.\u201d <em>Marina Point </em>made clear that \u201creason\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d are not enough to avoid a finding of \u201carbitrary\u201d discrimination. Our opinion condemned the adults-only policy there at issue even to the extent it rested on <em>true </em>assumptions about the general difficulties of living with children. (30 Cal.3d at pp. 736-740.) There are any number of plausible reasons why the owner of a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d serving the public might wish, in good faith, to exclude or discriminate against a particular group. But the Legislature has decreed that, once a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d attains that public status, it has responsibilities to the entire community which cannot be lightly ignored. Were good faith and bare rationality sufficient to permit group discrimination, the Act would have little meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">For this reason, recent cases have suggested that sex is a \u201csuspect classification\u201d for purposes of constitutional analysis. <em>(Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 17-20; see <em>Frontiero </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 677, 688 [36 L.Ed.2d 583, 592-593, 93 S.Ct. 1764] [opn. of Brennan, J.].) Though sexual discrimination is not arbitrary per se under the Unruh Act (sec discussion, ante), the 1974 addition of \u201csex\u201d to the Act's list of prohibited discriminations was intended to highlight the problems of inequality traditionally faced by girls and women. (See discussion, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Club contends that its single-sex membership policy, like housing for the elderly, serves public policy, since it has won legislative approval at both the state and national level. It suggests that prohibition of that policy under the Unruh Act would violate the supremacy clause. At the least, it urges, legislative approval of the Club\u2019s practices in other contexts goes against the notion that the Unruh Act was intended to alter them.</p>\n<p id=\"ARn\">The Club points out that the national organization\u2019s \u201cpurpose,\u201d as stated in its congressional charter (36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 691 et seq.), is \u201cto promote the health, social, educational, vocational, and character development <em>of boys </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 693, italics added.) We find no preemptive purpose in that phrase. State remedial legislation is preempted only if it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\" and the congressional intent to preempt must be \u201cunambiguous.\" <em>(Perez </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 637, 649-650 [29 L.Ed.2d 233, 242, 91 S.Ct. 1704]; <em>Florida Avocado Growers </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 132, 146-147 [10 L.Ed.2d 248, 259, 83 S.Ct. 1210].) Here, the charter itself provides that the Club has power \u201cto adopt, amend, and alter a constitution and bylaws <em>not inconsistent </em>with the laws of the United States <em>or any State in which the corporation is to operate, </em>...\u201d (36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 694(5), italics added.) Its reference to boys seems more a passive recognition of the Club\u2019s then traditional character than a statement of affirmative congressional purpose to exclude girls. (See <em>National Org. for W., Essex Ch. </em>v. <em>Little L. Base., Inc., supra, </em>318 A.2d 33, 39-41.) According to the evidence, a number of local clubs have admitted girls, and the trial court found that this change in policy does not violate the national charter.</p>\n<p id=\"Alo\">As the Club notes, federal law also specifically permits tax-exempt \u201cvoluntary youth service organizations\u201d which traditionally serve one sex only to receive Education Act funds despite their policy of sex discrimination. (20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1681(a)(6)(B).) That provision is consistent with general federal \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d policy, which, unlike California\u2019s, does not prohibit gender-based discrimination. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>The federal choice not to do so does not preclude this state from more stringent regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"Adk8\">Finally, the Club emphasizes a California statute permitting use of public school property by community organizations, including the Camp Fire Girls and the Boy Scouts. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 40041, subd. (a).) Nothing in that provision reflects an intent to approve sex discrimination by a monopolistic local recreational facility otherwise open to the youthful public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b121-9\">BIRD, C.

In most respects, his analysis was identical to that of today\u2019s lead opinion. Indeed, this court granted a hearing largely due to the persuasive force of Justice Poch\u00e9\u2019s arguments. The inevitable but unfortunate consequence was to wipe out the published record of his excellent contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">It is worthwhile to reproduce here selected passages from Justice Poch\u00e9\u2019s opinion. Their value extends beyond historical interest. In these passages, Justice Poch\u00e9 pinpointed the wider implications of this case. In the process, he offered a forceful refutation of the views expressed by today\u2019s dissenters, particularly Justice Mosk.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Justice Poch\u00e9 recognized that much more is at stake here than the fate of sex-segregated children\u2019s swimming pools. The reasoning of the vacated majority opinion in the Court of Appeal below\u2014like that in Justice Mosk\u2019s dissent here\u2014would exclude \u201cthe Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz and therefore most nonprofit charitable service organizations from the operation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civil Code, \u00a7 51.) What this means is that services such as the Salvation Army lunch line or free legal advice offered by nonprofit law offices may be restricted on the basis of race, sex, religion, or any other arbitrary classification. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In terms which apply with equal force to Justice Mosk\u2019s dissent, Justice Poch\u00e9 criticized the vacated Court of Appeal opinion as a source of two convenient guidelines for \u201cthose who wish to engage in arbitrary discrimination without running afoul of the Unruh Civil Rights Act: (1) nonprofit volunteer, fraternal, sectarian, charitable or cultural organizations are not within the ambit of the statute; and (2) a business-like purpose cannot be found if such a nonprofit group is merely offering programs and facilities for a nominal fee to its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u201cThe first test allows the Ku Klux Klan or neo-Nazis to engage in the nonprofit, volunteer and fraternal offering of athletic facilities to some white children to combat the rise in juvenile delinquency. I find it difficult to believe that was or is the legislative intent behind the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201cThe second touchstone seems to center upon whether the fee is nominal. Thus the wealthy organization which can afford to discriminate will be allowed to do so. But only those clubs which like the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz have wealthy patrons who prefer to confer largess in a sexually discriminatory fashion will be free ... to discriminate. Unless we are to presume that the Unruh Civil Rights Act was meant to insulate a select few from the 20th century, it is impossible in my judgment to come to [that] interpretation of the statute ....</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u201cThe trial court understood the clear meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act: community services regardless of their source are to be provided in accordance with the legislative mandate of equal treatment for all. Perhaps the violation would be clearer if the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz had discriminated on the basis of race, not sex. But that lack of clarity is not the fault of the language of the statute. Instead, the difficulty is the long and well ingrained tradition of women\u2019s dependency which even today causes statutory recognition of the equality of women to have a strange and unreal ring to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>On the basis of my full concurrence with these remarks, I agree that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b123-5\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_k\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The incredible concept that a private, charitably funded recreational club for boys cannot be allowed to exist as such because it is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d would be an irresistible subject for ridicule and humor if it were not so serious in its impact. The majority opinion conjures up visions of young boys, who have been skinny-dipping in their club pool, donning three-piece suits to attend the board meeting of their \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d where they may discuss such matters as the antitrust implications of a proposed takeover of girl scout cookies. Precocious indeed these teen and preteen youngsters must be.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Growing up into a world of sex equality is inevitable for all children, but the court-ordered elimination of traditional childhood activity is an exorbitant price to pay for accelerating the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The majority purport to be blithely oblivious to the extended reach of their decision, and disingenuously attempt to restrict their opinion to this one case, involving only this one Boys\u2019 Club in this one city. At the same time they appear to implore the Legislature to rescue society from this judicial folly and its consequences. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 77 and 91.) That is a plea I can enthusiastically endorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">That the ultimate result of this case will strain our social fabric and send shock waves throughout the realm of children\u2019s organizations is made clear by the appearance of numerous apprehensive amici curiae representing both girls and boys. Girls\u2019 organizations throughout California are no more eager for an invasion by boys than are boys\u2019 groups for dilution of their programs by compulsory inclusion of girls. Briefs on behalf of the Santa Cruz club have been filed by the Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scout Councils of California, United Way of America, the Girls\u2019 Club of Vista, and the Boys\u2019 Clubs of Tustin, Vista, Oceanside, Chula Vista, Buena Park, Rio Hondo, Pasadena, Whittier, San Francisco, National City, Santa Clara County, Oakland, Santa Ana, and the San Dieguito Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Clubs and Fall-brook Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Clubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The majority\u2019s insouciance is disturbing. No girl\u2019s parents who are inclined to be litigious will fail to use this case as authority to demand their daughter\u2019s admission to other boys\u2019 clubs, the Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, and similar organizations that maintain camps or physical facilities. Conversely, boys could rely on this case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>insist on their right to join girls\u2019 clubs, the Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, Young Women\u2019s Christian Association, and like groups. There is no rational way to distinguish those situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In addition, the majority strike a death knell for fraternities and sororities as they exist on every college campus in California. There is-no way any court can read the rationale of the majority opinion and yet deny the right of a male student to join a sorority, or a female student to become a fraternity member. If the Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz is a business because it operates a gymnasium and swimming pool, a fortiori sororities and fraternities, which provide and charge for housing accommodations and eating facilities, are business establishments. Similar considerations will probably also affect separate college dormitories.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The natural extension of the majority opinion to women\u2019s colleges is even more potentially devastating. If a qualified male student seeks admission to Mills, Mount St. Mary\u2019s or Scripps\u2014California\u2019s renowned educational institutions for women\u2014there is no rational way in which a court could distinguish his demand from that of the plaintiff herein. Colleges that provide not only classes but living accommodations and food service are arguably more akin to a business establishment than is a recreational boys\u2019 club.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As is inevitable, the majority have considerable difficulty with legislative history. The original version of the measure that ultimately came to be known as the Unruh Act was expansive. It extended to \u201call public or private groups, organizations, associations, business establishments, schools and public facilities. ...\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 594 (1959 Reg. Sess.), as introduced Jan. 21, 1959.) By means of amendment, however, all groups other than \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d were eliminated. Specifically stricken was reference to \u201cprivate groups\u201d and \u201cassociations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">From the foregoing, the majority with amazing dexterity reach the conclusion that by limiting the scope of the act to the one remaining category-business establishments\u2014the Legislature somehow intended to embrace all the eliminated categories. This is comparable to insisting that when the states repealed the 18th Amendment they intended to retain prohibition. As stated in <em>Rich </em>v. <em>State Board of Optometry </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 591, 607 [45 Cal.Rptr. 512]: \u201cThe rejection by the Legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision.\u201d (Accord, <em>Madrid </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 819, 825 [125 Cal.Rptr. 348].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">There is a simple answer to the plaintiff\u2019s contention about legislative intent. If the Legislature really meant that the Unruh Act applies to chari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>table and noncommercial enterprises like boys\u2019 clubs and intended to simplify the act, it would not have used the word \u201cbusiness\u201d in the statute; \u201cestablishment\u201d would have sufficed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As this court declared in <em>In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 215 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992], we must presume the Legislature is aware of our decisions. Thus when over the years the Legislature retained the coupling of \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cestablishment,\u201d it obviously did so in deference to the definition given to \u201cbusiness\u201d by Chief Justice Gibson in <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 468 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313]: \u201cThe word \u2018business\u2019 embraces everything about which one can be employed, and it is often synonymous with \u2018calling, occupation, or trade, engaged in for the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.\u2019 \u201d It is obvious to the boys at the club, as it should be to my colleagues, that the Boys\u2019 Club is not operated \u201cfor the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Professor Horowitz in his law review article on the meaning of \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d declared that they are entities which enter into nongratuitous relationships with other persons, those relationships being relatively noncontinuous, nonpersonal and nonsocial. (Horowitz, <em>The 1959 California Equal Rights in \u201cBusiness Establishments\u201d Statute </em>(1960) 33 So.Cal.L.Rev. 260, 289.) Services and facilities are provided by the Boys\u2019 Club for a nominal nonprofit fee of $3.25 per year; the relationship between the Boys\u2019 Club and its members is essentially gratuitous. The purpose of the Boys\u2019 Club\u2014to help boys develop citizenship, leadership, values, health and fitness, personal adjustment and individual growth, and intergroup understanding\u2014is primarily to provide services of a personal and social nature, and the relationship between the Boys\u2019 Club and its members is clearly noncommercial. Finally, boys may remain members for years; the relationship is thus continuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">My colleagues did not need to strain to the point of reductio ad absurdum to prove judicial devotion to principles of sexual equality in business establishments. This court\u2019s record has been clear. Long before any of the present majority were on the court, we insisted on the right of women to be accorded equal treatment in the business world. In <em>Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 1, 20 [95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 485 P.2d 529, 46 A.L.R.3d 351], a unanimous court held sex classifications to be suspect, particularly in business and employment. The Legislature has been consistent with us in this area, and also spoke in terms of \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d as distinguished from nonprofit community service organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">A different view was taken in a recent federal case. In <em>Martin </em>v. <em>International Olympics Committee </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 740 F.2d 670, 82 women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>athletes experienced in 5,000 and 10,000 meter track races sought the right to compete in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. The federal court, conceding that the sporting event has become a \u201cbusiness establishment,\u201d nevertheless found no violation of the Unruh Act or related statutes in \u201cthe male-oriented approach taken in the Olympics from its modern-day inception.\u201d (See also <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of School Dist. 23 </em>(N.D.Ill. 1982) 545 F.Supp. 376 [girl not permitted on boys\u2019 basketball team]; <em>Forte </em>v. <em>Board of Ed., North Babylon, etc. </em>(1980) 105 Misc.2d 36 [431 N.Y.S.2d 321] [boy not permitted on girls\u2019 basketball team].)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The recent United States Supreme Court opinion involving Minnesota Jaycees is helpful, but clearly not to these plaintiffs. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 609 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 104 S.Ct. 3244].) The majority reiterated their devotion to the principle of protecting organizations of persons with shared ideals and beliefs from unwarranted state interference. Whether an organization is entitled to constitutional protection from incursion by the state depends upon such factors as its \u201csize, purpose, policies, selectivity, congeniality, and other characteristics that in a particular case may be pertinent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 620 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 473, 104 S.Ct. at p. 3251].)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In finding that the Jaycees were subject to state-imposed sex restrictions, the court relied upon the criteria used by Minnesota courts: the organization\u2019s size, selectivity, <em>commercial nature </em>and use of public facilities. It specifically drew a distinction between the Jaycees and such community groups as Kiwanis clubs. And if there were any question as to the limited reach of the Supreme Court opinion, in its conclusion it recognized the state courts\u2019 \u201carticulated willingness to adopt limiting constructions that would <em>exclude private groups from the statute\u2019s reach.\u201d </em>(Italics added, <em>id., </em>at pp. 630-631 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 480, 104 S.Ct. at p. 3256].)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Justice Sandra O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion is particularly instructive. She emphasized (at p. 632 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 481, 104 S.Ct. at p. 3257]) the goal of ensuring \u201cnondiscriminatory access to commercial opportunities in our society.\u201d She declared (at p. 632 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 483-484, 104 S.Ct. at pp. 3259-3260]) that organizations engaged in commercial activity-such as the Jaycees\u2014have only limited protection from governmental restrictions, in contrast to those groups engaged in \u201cthe training of outdoor survival skills or participating in community service [which] might become expressive when the activity is intended to develop good morals, reverence, patriotism and a desire for self-improvement. \u201d It is significant that she cited as examples of the latter the activities of boy scouts and girl scouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">From <em>Roberts </em>one gleans that organizations such as the Jaycees that foster the commercial benefits of its members may be regulated by government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>but that others enjoy \u201ca substantial measure of sanctuary from unjustified interference by the State.\u201d It is ludicrous to contend that the Boys Club of Santa Cruz is engaged in commercial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The effects, tangible and intangible, of the majority opinion in this case are devastating.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">First, the club will be required to compel joint use of facilities by boys and girls\u2014swimming, basketball, handball, etc. In the alternative, the club will be required to cut the boys\u2019 recreational time in half and restrict their hours in order to accommodate girls: e.g., not a full day on Saturday but only a half day; not two hours after school but only one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Second, the club will be compelled to build an additional locker room, showers, toilets and other physical facilities. This, of course, will require a considerable expenditure of charitable funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Third, while being thus obligated to expand, the club will simultaneously lose a $200,000 gift that is conditioned on a male-only policy. The majority gratuitously declare that the admission of girls \u201cmay well produce offsetting new revenue sources.\u201d I doubt that my colleagues would enjoy serving on a fund-raising committee seeking to raise a $200,000 \u201coffset\u201d for this purpose in the Santa Cruz community.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Fourth, the majority effectively stifle any community incentive to create and construct a girls\u2019 club comparable to the Boys\u2019 Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Fifth, the Boys\u2019 Club may very well lose its national charter. By act of Congress, the Boys\u2019 Clubs of America are authorized \u201cto promote the health, social, educational, vocational, and character development of boys throughout the United States of America. ...\u201d (36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 693.) Parenthetically, it may be observed that Congress has chartered other sex-exclusive organizations, e.g., Daughters of the American Revolution (36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 18-18c), Sons of the American Revolution (36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 20a-20g), and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (36 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 111-120).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Amicus Boy Scouts of America points out other significant policy considerations overlooked by the majority. By protecting the freedom to base sexual associations on personal affinities, society promotes its pluralism, with all the values that connotes\u2014values such as a diversity of views, a variety of ideas, and preservation of traditions. Here, the plaintiff and her supporters believe that their community will benefit by making certain private facilities with limited capacity and with limited adult supervision avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>able either to children of both sexes or to none at all. Other citizens\u2014those who charitably donated the property and those who charitably maintain it\u2014 believe their community will benefit by more narrowly focusing the use of that property on boys, many of whom are disadvantaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The value of a pluralistic, democratic society is that it permits members of each group to join with others sharing their views, to pool their resources as they wish, to seek the resources of new members, and to experiment to try to prove the validity of their respective concepts. The charitable donors of the Boys\u2019 Club property and funds, and the volunteers who charitably organize and operate the club, have done just that. No law or policy bars plaintiff and others from seeking out charitable contributors who share their views. Their unwillingness to look for or inability to find such contributors does not justify imposing a judicial compulsion on the existing charitable group to change its own views and policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Another important factor that the majority have ignored is the policy favoring private charitable contributions, a policy manifested in tax laws and laws authorizing charitable contributions. Citizens often, perhaps almost always, charitably contribute to organizations that promote or implement goals the contributors believe to be beneficial and worthy of support. The more the state arbitrarily dictates the permissible goals and practices of charitable organizations, the tighter the pursestrings of potential donors are likely to be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b128-7\">KAUS, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">\u2014Although the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Santa Cruz Boys\u2019 Club (Club) is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d is by no means compelling (see Comment, <em>The Unruh Civil Rights Act: An Uncertain Guarantee </em>(1983) 31 UCLA L.Rev. 443), I concede, at least for the sake of argument, that facilities such as the Club are, prima facie, covered by section 51. Were it otherwise, the Club could discriminate on bases\u2014e.g. race\u2014which would never pass muster under the test we laid down in <em>In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 217 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992]. Nevertheless I believe that the majority is tragically mistaken in holding that the exclusion of girls is unreasonable and arbitrary and, therefore, in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Before stating my reasons, I feel compelled to express puzzlement at the majority\u2019s repeated mention of the fact that there is no comparable facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for girls in the Santa Cruz area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If there were a Girls\u2019 Club in Santa Cruz, would the majority be satisfied with \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities? If there were two boys\u2019 clubs, would each have to admit girls? Two boys\u2019 clubs and one girls\u2019 club? Unless the majority is prepared to suggest that the existence of additional facilities might affect its conclusions, I respectfully submit that the references to the Club\u2019s monopoly are of no legal significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">To get down to business: at the outset of its opinion the majority states that its analysis does not \u201cnecessarily\u201d apply to (1) organizations which operate facilities not generally open to the public, or (2) organizations which can demonstrate a compelling need to maintain single-sex facilities. I submit that if these disavowals are sincere, the majority has reached the wrong result for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">To establish that the Club is a facility that is generally open to the public, the majority states that it \u201coffers basic recreational facilities to a <em>broad segment </em>of the population, <em>excluding </em>only a <em>particular </em>group expressly recognized by the Act as a traditional target of discrimination.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 84.) (Italics in original.) Sounds good, but what are the facts? The \u201cbroad segment\u201d of the population consists of boys between the ages of eight and eighteen. On the other hand, the \u201cparticular\u201d group which is excluded is the rest of humanity. I submit that the only way to reach the conclusion that the Club is \u201cgenerally open to the public\u201d is to look at the included and excluded groups through different ends of a telescope.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Further, I believe that the Club has demonstrated \u201ca compelling need to maintain single-sex facilities.\u201d The majority quite properly holds that section 51 only forbids arbitrary sex discrimination. One would think, then, that if one of the main goals of the Club is the control of juvenile delinquency and those who guide its affairs have made a reasoned decision that this goal is best advanced by a prophylactic application of the Club\u2019s limited resources to that group of youngsters from which the majority of serious delinquents seems to come\u2014boys\u2014that is surely not arbitrary. Yet all that the trial court had to say on the subject was to conclude, erroneously, that \u201c[discrimination on the basis of sex is per se illegal under [section 51]\u201d adding, however, that even if the act \u201cprohibited only arbitrary discrimination on the basis of sex, defendants have arbitrarily discriminated against plaintiffs . . . .\u2019\u2019No reason was given why it is arbitrary to spend the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>linquency prevention dollar where it is thought to do the most good.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of course, if those who guide the Club\u2019s fortunes could predict with some degree of accuracy which particular individuals\u2014girls as well as boys\u2014 were headed for a life of crime, it would obviously not do to classify boys as a group as potentially more delinquent than girls. No one, however, ascribes such clairvoyance to defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The majority seeks to improve on the trial court\u2019s <em>ipse dixit </em>by asserting that because some delinquents are girls, the Club should have proved that \u201ca sex-segregated . . . facility is more effective in combating juvenile delinquency than one open to both sexes, ...\u201d Why did the Club have a burden in that respect? If it acted in good faith\u2014and no one claims that it did not\u2014why should it have to prove that a perfectly defensible decision on how to spend its resources has actually proved to .be the most effective one? Is a reasonable decision, rationally related to the services and facilities of the Club\u2014the test of <em>Cox, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 205\u2014not reasonable tinless proved to be the best solution to the problem under attack?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">For obvious reasons the majority admits that there are certain activities which even section 51 permits to be carried on in sex-segregated fashion. The real problem is the extent of this immunity from the reach of section 51. Evidently those responsible for the Club\u2019s policy have decided that it is beneficial for boys to have some time when they do not have to adjust their behavior to the presence of girls. There is, of course, a vast professional literature on the subject.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Who are we to say that it is unreasonable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Club\u2019s management to believe that there is a rational basis for giving boys a few hours a day when they do not have to carry their machismo on their sleeves? Whether or not we share these views is immaterial. What matters is that we have no right to force contrary theories on those who have devoted considerable time, energy, devotion and financial resources to the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">If I may suggest, the basic mistake of the majority opinion is that it views the Club\u2019s policies as being pointed toward the exclusion of girls. With that chip on the majority\u2019s shoulder, pejoratives come easily. If the court looked at the Club\u2019s activities more benignly as providing a service for boys\u2014a service tailored to their needs\u2014it would not find it necessary to reach such a wondrous result.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">On December 10, 1985, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

Elementary Principal at page 38. The author describes the result of an experiment separating 31 fourth-grade boys from girls: \u201cThe teachers and I feel that the following are some of the reasonably obvious advantages of single-sex classes: [\u00b6] 1. There are fewer serious discipline problems. The behavior of the boys in separate classes seems more normal and is more acceptable to teachers. [\u00b6] 2. The students are much happier and display a greater interest in all subject-matter and skill areas. [\u00b6] 3. There is better attendance, which we feel is a direct result of the fact that the pupils like school more. [\u00b6] 4. Children who have been withdrawn become more outgoing, more confident. (This is true of both boys and girls.) [\u00b6] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>5. Students are more willing to ask questions if they do not understand something and feel freer to discuss ideas which otherwise might be embarrassing to them. In health, for example, both boys and girls are more at ease in studying the body, and the boys have made charts, drawings, and reports without urging. [\u00b6] 6. Boys are more thoughtful and considerate of each other. They seem to want to help each other when someone is having difficulty, [\u00b6] 7. Competition between the sexes is eliminated, and there is an excellent opportunity to establish the idea of working against one\u2019s own record rather than competing with others. [\u00b6] 8. There is evidence of more cooperation within an all-boy or an all-girl class. A tremendous <em>esprit de corps </em>develops within the classes, [\u00b6] 9. The lack of distractions from the opposite sex results in better work habits. [\u00b6] 10. Motivation can be developed much more easily because it is not necessary to gear class work to the interests of both sexes. Instructional materials can be selected in terms of the particular characteristics and interests of the sex being taught. (This is especially true in reading and science.) [\u00b6] 11. Boys take part more freely in art and music and do better work in foreign language when they are in separate classes, [\u00b6] 12. There is greater participation in class activities. Both boys and girls overcome their fear of standing in front of a class to give reports and oral readings. There have been cases of striking improvement in this area. [\u00b6] 13. Boys accept all phases of language arts instruction without complaint when there are no girls present. Boys who are below level in reading work harder in order to be nearer the level of their classmates, [\u00b6] 14. It is much easier to do a good job in physical education\u2014and this is significant in view of the importance of the first twelve years in developing physical skills, [\u00b6] 15.
