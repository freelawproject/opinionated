The lease at issue is for 14,400 square feet of hangar space at the San Jose Municipal Airport. The City of San Jose, as owner of the property, leased it to Irving and Janice Perlitch, who in turn assigned their interest to respondent Ernest Pesta\u00f1a, Inc.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to assigning their interest to respondent, the Perlitches entered into a 25-year sublease with one Robert Bixler commencing on January 1, 1970. The sublease covered an original five-year term plus four 5-year options to renew. The rental rate was to be increased every 10 years in the same proportion as rents increased on the master lease from the City of San Jose. The premises were to be used by Bixler for the purpose of conducting an airplane maintenance business.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Bixler conducted such a business under the name \u201cFlight Services\u201d until, in 1981, he agreed to sell the business to appellants Jack Kendall, Grady O\u2019Hara and Vicki O\u2019Hara. The proposed sale included the business and the equipment, inventory and improvements on the property, together with the existing lease. The proposed assignees had a stronger financial statement and greater net worth than the current lessee, Bixler, and they were willing to be bound by the terms of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The lease provided that written consent of the lessor was required before the lessee could assign his interest, and that failure to obtain such consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>rendered the lease voidable at the option of the lessor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, Bixler requested consent from the Perlitches\u2019 successor-in-interest, respondent Ernest Pesta\u00f1a, Inc. Respondent refused to consent to the assignment and maintained that it had an absolute right arbitrarily to refuse any such request. The complaint recites that respondent demanded \u201cincreased rent and other more onerous terms\u201d as a condition of consenting to Bixler\u2019s transfer of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The proposed assignees brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages seeking, inter alia, a declaration \u201cthat the refusal of Ernest Pesta\u00f1a, Inc. to consent to the assignment of the lease is unreasonable and is an unlawful restraint on the freedom of alienation. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The law generally favors free alienability of property, and California follows the common law rule that a leasehold interest is freely alienable. (See <em>Kassan </em>v. <em>Stout </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 39, 43 [106 Cal.Rptr. 783, 507 P.2d 87]; 49 Am.Jur.2d, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 398 (1980).) Contractual restrictions on the alienability of leasehold interests are, however, permitted. (See <em>Kassan </em>v. <em>Stout, supra.) </em>\u201cSuch restrictions are justified as reasonable protection of the interests of the lessor as to who shall possess and manage property in which he has a reversionary interest and from which he is deriving income.\u201d (Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant (1980) \u00a7 8:15, at pp. 578-579. See also 2 Powell on Real Property, \u00b6 246[1], at p. 372.97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The common law\u2019s hostility toward restraints on alienation has caused such restraints on leasehold interests to be strictly construed against the lessor. (See Schoshinski, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.16, at pp. 583-588; 2 Powell, <em>supra, </em>t 246[1], at pp. 372.97, 372.100.) Thus, in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Great Western </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Gypsum Co. </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 420 [14 P.2d 758, 85 A.L.R. 917], where the lease contained a covenant against assignment without the consent of the lessor, this court stated: \u201cIt hardly needs citation of authority to the principle that covenants limiting the free alienation of property such as covenants against assignment are barely tolerated and must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 426.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is particularly true where the restraint in question is a \u201cforfeiture restraint,\u201d under which the lessor has the option to terminate the lease if an assignment is made without his or her consent. (See <em>Karbelnig </em>v. <em>Brothwell </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 333, 341 [53 Cal.Rptr. 335]; <em>Ser-Bye Corp. </em>v. <em>C.P. &amp; G. Markets, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.2d at p. 919; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1442 [\u201cA condition involving a forfeiture must be strictly interpreted against the party for whose benefit it is created.\u201d]; 2 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 246[1], at pp. 372.100-372.101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Nevertheless, a majority of jurisdictions have long adhered to the rule that where a lease contains an approval clause (a clause stating that the lease cannot be assigned without the prior consent of the lessor), the lessor may arbitrarily refuse to approve a proposed assignee no matter how suitable the assignee appears to be and no matter how unreasonable the lessor\u2019s objection. (See, e.g., <em>B &amp; R Oil Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ray\u2019s Mobile Homes, Inc. </em>(1980) 139 Vt. 122 [422 A.2d 1267]; <em>Dress Shirt Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hotel Martinique Associates </em>(1963) 12 N.Y.2d 339 [236 N.Y.S.2d 613, 190 N.E.2d 10]; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Klawans </em>(1961) 225 Md. 147 [169 A.2d 677]; <em>Segre </em>v. <em>Ring </em>(1961) 103 N.H. 278 [170 A.2d 265]; <em>Gruman </em>v. <em>Investors Diversified Services </em>(1956) 247 Minn. 502 [78 N.W.2d 377]; Annot., 31 A.L.R.2d 831 (1953); 51C C.J.S., \u00a7 36(1).) The harsh consequences of this rule have often been avoided through application of the doctrines of waiver and estoppel, under which the lessor may be found to have waived (or be estopped from asserting) the right to refuse consent to assignment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The traditional majority rule has come under steady attack in recent years. A growing minority of jurisdictions now hold that where a lease provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the lessor, such consent may be withheld <em>only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable objection to the assignment, </em>even in the absence of a provision in the lease stating that consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld. (See <em>Boss Barbara, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newbill </em>(1982) 97 N.M. 239 [638 P.2d 1084]; <em>Jack Frost Sales </em>v. <em>Harris Trust &amp; Sav. Bank </em>(1982) 104 Ill.App.3d 933 [433 N.E.2d 941, 949]; <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(Fla.App. 1981) 397 So.2d 1171 [21 A.L.R.4th 181]; <em>Warmack </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat. Bank of Fort Smith </em>(1981) 272 Ark. 166 [612 S.W.2d 733]; <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Funk </em>(1981) 102 Idaho 521 [633 P.2d 586]; <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Freericks </em>(Alaska 1980) 620 P.2d 205; <em>Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cowden </em>(Ala. 1977) 350 So.2d 1035; <em>Shaker Building Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Lime &amp; Stone Co. </em>(1971) 28 Ohio Misc. 246 [57 Ohio Ops.2d 486, 277 N.E.2d 584]; Rest.2d Property, \u00a7 15.2(2) (1977); Annot., 21 A.L.R.4th 188 (1983).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the minority rule is the preferable position. Although this is an issue of first impression in this court, several decisions of the Court of Appeal have reflected the changing trend in the law on this question. In <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Degen &amp; Brody, Inc. </em>(1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 289 [5 Cal.Rptr. 263], the court adopted the majority rule: \u201c \u2018[W]here a subletting or assignment of the leased premises without the consent of the lessor is prohibited, he may withhold his assent arbitrarily and without regard to the qualifications of the proposed assignee, unless ... the lease provides that consent shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld. . . \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 299, quoting 51 C.J.S., \u00a7 36.) <em>Richard </em>was not followed or cited on this point until the decision in <em>Laguna Royale Owners Association </em>v. <em>Darger </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 670 [174 Cal.Rptr. 136], which questioned the \u201ccontinuing vitality\u201d of the rule in <em>Richard </em>and then distinguished it on its facts. (Id., at p. 681.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court in <em>Laguna Royale </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>rejected the contention that an approval clause confers an absolute right to withhold consent: \u201cWe hold that in exercising its power to approve or disapprove transfers or assignments Association must act reasonably, exercising its power in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner and withholding approval only for a reason or reasons rationally related to the protection, preservation and proper operation of the property and the purposes of Association as set forth in its governing instruments. \u201d (Id., at p. 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Two years later, in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 321 [195 Cal.Rptr. 84], the same district of the Court of Appeal that had decided <em>Richard </em>(the Second District) directly confronted and rejected the rule of that case. The court held that \u201cwhere, as here, the lease provides for assignment or subletting only with the prior consent of the lessor, a lessor may refuse consent only where he has a good faith reasonable objection to the assignment or sublease, even in the absence of a provision prohibiting the unreasonable or arbitrary withholding of consent to an assignment of a commercial lease. Examples of bases for such good faith reasonable objection would be inability to fulfill terms of the lease, financial irresponsibility or instability, suitability of premises for intended use, or intended unlawful or undesirable use of premises.  No such bases were raised by the lessor.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 330.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Shortly thereafter, the First District of the Court of Appeal followed suit in <em>Schweiso </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 883 [198 Cal.Rptr. 238], adopting the rule set forth in <em>Cohen. </em>The court further noted that \u201cdenying consent solely on the basis of personal taste, convenience or sensibility or in order that the landlord may charge a higher rent than originally contracted for have been held arbitrary reasons failing the tests of good faith and reasonableness under commercial leases. <em>(Chanslor-Western O. &amp; D. Co. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan San. D. </em>(1970) 131 Ill.App.2d 527 [266 N.E.2d 405]; citing <em>Broad &amp; Branford Place Corp. </em>v. <em>J.J. Hockenjos Co. </em>(1944) 132 N.J.L. 229 [39 A.2d 80, 82].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 886, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Before the conflict among the Courts of Appeal reached this court for resolution, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was forced to resolve the conflict in <em>Prestin </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>(9th Cir: 1984) 741 F.2d 268 (applying California law). The Ninth Circuit reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>cases discussed above and stated: <em>\u201c[Richard </em>has no support in later California cases,] having been rejected by the one court which has bothered to mention it <em>[Laguna </em>Royale].[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] We therefore find that the California Supreme Court would adopt the rule recently enunciated in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at 330, 195 Cal.Rptr. 84, that a lessor . . . may refuse consent to an assignment or sublease only when the lessor has a good faith reasonable objection to it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 271.)  We now adopt the rule tentatively ascribed to us by the <em>Prestin </em>court, and disapprove the holdings in <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Degen &amp; Brody, Inc., supra, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 289 and <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Dixon, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The impetus for change in the majority rule has come from two directions, reflecting the dual nature of a lease as a conveyance of a leasehold interest and a contract. (See <em>Medico-Dental etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Horton &amp; Converse </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 411, 418 [132 P.2d 457].)  The policy against restraints on alienation pertains to leases in their nature as <em>conveyances. </em>Numerous courts and commentators have recognized that \u201c[i]n recent times the necessity of permitting reasonable alienation of commercial space has become paramount in our increasingly urban society.\u201d <em>(Schweiso </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 887. See also <em>Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cowden, supra, </em>350 So.2d at 1037; <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Funk, supra, </em>633 P.2d at 589; 2 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 246[1], at pp. 372.97-372.98; Comment, <em>The Approval Clause in a Lease: Toward a Standard of Reasonableness </em>(1983) 17 U.S.F. L.Rev. 681, 683, 689; Note, <em>Landlord-Tenant\u2014Lessor\u2019s Rejection of Sublease Agreement, Pursuant to a Consent Clause, Must be Judged Under a Reasonable Commercial Standard </em>(1978) 9 Cum. L.Rev. 309, 312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Civil Code section 711 provides: \u201cConditions restraining alienation, when repugnant to the interest created, are void.\u201d It is well settled that this rule is not absolute in its application, but forbids only <em>unreasonable </em>restraints on alienation. <em>(Wellenkamp </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 943, 948 [148 Cal.Rptr. 379, 582 P.2d 970]; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 329; <em>Laguna Royale Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>Darger, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.3d at p. 682.) Reasonableness is determined by comparing the justification for a particular restraint on alienation with the quantum of restraint actually imposed by it. \u201c[T]he greater the quantum of restraint that results from enforcement of a given clause, the greater must be the justification for that enforcement. \u201d <em>(Wellenkamp </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>p. 949.) In <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, supra, </em>the court examined the reasonableness of the restraint created by an approval clause in a lease; \u201cBecause the lessor has an interest in the character of the proposed commercial assignee, we cannot say that an assignment provision requiring the lessor\u2019s consent to an assignment is inherently repugnant to the leasehold interest created. We do conclude, however, that <em>if such an assignment provision is implemented in such a manner that its underlying purpose is perverted by the arbitrary or unreasonable withholding of consent, an unreasonable restraint on alienation is established.\u201d (Id., </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 329, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">One commentator explains as follows; \u201cThe common-law hostility to restraints on alienation had a large exception with respect to estates for years. A lessor could prohibit the lessee from transferring the estate for years to whatever extent he might desire. It was believed that the objectives served by allowing such restraints outweighed the social evils implicit in the restraints, in that they gave to the lessor a needed control over the person entrusted with the lessor\u2019s property and to whom he must look for the performance of the covenants contained in the lease. Whether this reasoning retains full validity can well be doubted. Relationships between lessor and lessee have tended to become more and more impersonal. Courts have considerably lessened the effectiveness of restraint clauses by strict construction and liberal applications of the doctrine of waiver. With the shortage of housing and, in many places, of commercial space as well, the allowance of lease clauses forbidding assignments and subleases is beginning to be curtailed by statutes.\u201d (2 Powell, <em>supra, </em>f 246[1], at pp. 372.97-372.98, fns. omitted.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The Restatement Second of Property adopts the minority rule on the validity of approval clauses in leases: \u201cA restraint on alienation without the consent of the landlord of a tenant\u2019s interest in leased property is valid, <em>but the landlord\u2019s consent to an alienation by the tenant cannot be withheld unreasonably, </em>unless a freely negotiated provision in the lease gives the landlord an absolute right to withhold consent.\u201d (Rest.2d Property, \u00a7 15.2(2) (1977), italics added.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A comment to the section explains: \u201cThe landlord may have an understandable concern about certain personal quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ties of a tenant, particularly his reputation for meeting his financial obligations. The preservation of the values that go into the personal selection of the tenant justifies upholding a provision in the lease that curtails the right of the tenant to put anyone else in his place by transferring his interest, but this justification does not go to the point of allowing the landlord arbitrarily and without reason to refuse to allow the tenant to transfer an interest in leased property.\u201d (Id., com. a.) Under the Restatement rule, the lessor\u2019s interest in the character of his or her tenant is protected by the lessor\u2019s right to object'to a proposed assignee on reasonable commercial grounds. (See <em>id., </em>reporter\u2019s note 7 at pp. 112-113.) The lessor\u2019s interests are also protected by the fact that the original lessee remains liable to the lessor as a surety even if the lessor consents to the assignment and the assignee expressly assumes the obligations of the lease. <em>(Peiser </em>v. <em>Mettler </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 594, 602 [328 P.2d 953, 74 A.L.R.2d 1]; <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Ottinger </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 209, 212 [146 P. 638].)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The second impetus for change in the majority rule comes from the nature of a lease as a <em>contract. </em>As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, supra, </em>\u201c[s]ince <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Degen &amp; Brody, Inc. </em>[espousing the majority rule] was decided, . . . there has been an increased recognition of and emphasis on the duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contract.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 329.)  Thus, \u201c[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract. ...\u201d <em>(Universal Sales Corp. </em>v. <em>Cal. etc. Mfg. Co. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 751, 771 [128 P.2d 665]. See also <em>Bleecher </em>v. <em>Conte </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 345, 350 [213 Cal.Rptr. 852, 698 P.2d 1154].) \u201c[W]here a contract confers on one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other, a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.\u201d <em>(Cal. Lettuce Growers </em>v. <em>Union Sugar Co. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 474, 484 [289 P.2d 785, 49 A.L.R.2d 496]. See also, <em>Larwin-Southern California, Inc. </em>v. <em>JGB Investment Co. </em>(1979) 101 Cal.App.3d 626, 640 [162 Cal.Rptr. 52].) Here the lessor retains the discretionary power to approve or disapprove an assignee proposed by the other party to the contract; this discretionary power should therefore be exercised in accordance with commercially reasonable standards. \u201cWhere a lessee is entitled to sublet under common law, but has agreed to limit that right by first acquiring the consent of the landlord, we believe the lessee has a right to expect that consent will not be unreasonably withheld.\u201d <em>(Fernandez </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra, </em>397 So.2d at p. 1174; accord, <em>Boss Barbara, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newbill, supra, </em>638 P.2d at p. 1086.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Under the minority rule, the determination whether a lessor\u2019s refusal to consent was reasonable is a question of fact. Some of the factors that the trier of fact may properly consider in applying the standards of good faith and commercial reasonableness are: financial responsibility of the proposed assignee; suitability of the use for the particular property; legality of the proposed use; need for alteration of the premises; and nature of the occupancy, i.e., office, factory, clinic, etc. (See <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra, </em>397 So.2d at p. 1174; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 330; Rest.2d Property, \u00a7 15.2, reporter\u2019s note 7 at pp. 112-113; Annot., 54 A.L.R.3d 689 (1973); 1 Friedman on Leases (1974) \u00a7 7.304c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Denying consent solely on the basis of personal taste, convenience or sensibility is not commercially reasonable. <em>(Broad &amp; Branford Place Corp. </em>v. <em>J.

This is because the lessor\u2019s desire for a better bargain than contracted for has nothing to do with the permissible purposes of the restraint on alienation\u2014to protect the lessor\u2019s interest in the preservation of the property and the performance of the lease covenants. \u201c \u2018[T]he clause is for the protection of the landlord <em>in its ownership and operation of the particular </em>property\u2014not for its general economic protection.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ringwood Associates </em>v. <em>Jack\u2019s of Route 23, Inc., supra, </em>379 A.2d at p. 512, quoting <em>Krieger </em>v. <em>Helmsley-Spear, Inc. </em>(1973) 62 N.J. 423 [302 A.2d 129], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In contrast to the policy reasons advanced in favor of the minority rule, the majority rule has traditionally been justified on three grounds. Respondent raises a fourth argument in its favor as well. None of these do we find compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">First, it is said that a lease is a conveyance of an interest in real property, and that the lessor, having exercised a personal choice in the selection of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tenant and provided that no substitute shall be acceptable without prior consent, is under no obligation to look to anyone but the lessee for the rent. <em>(Gruman </em>v. <em>Investors Diversified Services, supra, </em>247 Minn. 502 [78 N.W.2d 377, 380]; see also, <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Funk, supra, </em>102 Idaho 521 [633 P.2d 586, 591] (Bakes, C. J., dis.).) This argument is based on traditional rules of conveyancing and on concepts of freedom of ownership and control over one\u2019s property. <em>(Funk </em>v. <em>Funk, supra, </em>633 P.2d at p. 591 (Bakes, C. J., dis.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">A lessor\u2019s freedom at common law to look to no one but the lessee for the rent has, however, been undermined by the adoption in California of a rule that lessors\u2014like all other contracting parties\u2014have a duty to mitigate damages upon the lessee\u2019s abandonment of the property by seeking a substitute lessee. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1951.2.)  Furthermore, the values that go into the personal selection of a lessee are preserved under the minority rule in the lessor\u2019s right to refuse consent to assignment on any commercially reasonable grounds. Such grounds include not only the obvious objections to an assignee\u2019s financial stability or proposed use of the premises, but a variety of other commercially reasonable objections as well. (See, e.g., <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Walter E. Heller International Corp. </em>(1975) 30 Ill.App.3d 631 [333 N.E.2d 50] [desire to have only one \u201clead tenant\u201d in order to preserve \u201cimage of the building\u201d as tenant\u2019s international headquarters]; <em>Warmack </em>v. <em>Merchants Nat. Bank of Fort Smith </em>(1981) 272 Ark. 166 [612 S.W.2d 733] [desire for good \u201ctenant mix\u201d in shopping center]; <em>List </em>v. <em>Dahnke </em>(Colo.App. 1981) 638 P.2d 824 [lessor\u2019s refusal to consent to assignment of lease by one restaurateur to another was reasonable where lessor believed proposed specialty restaurant would not succeed at that location].) The lessor\u2019s interests are further protected by the fact that the original lessee remains a guarantor of the performance of the assignee. (See <em>ante, </em>p. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The second justification advanced in support of the majority rule is that an approval clause is an unambiguous reservation of absolute discretion in the lessor over assignments of the lease. The lessee could have bargained for the addition of a reasonableness clause to the lease (i.e., \u201cconsent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld\u201d). The lessee having failed to do so, the law should not rewrite the parties\u2019 contract for them. (See <em>Gruman </em>v. <em>Investors Diversified Services, supra, </em>78 N.W.2d at pp. 381-382; <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Funk, supra, </em>633 P.2d at pp. 590, 592 (Bakes, C. J., dis.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Numerous authorities have taken a different view of the meaning and effect of an approval clause in a lease, indicating that the clause is not \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d as respondent suggests. As early as 1940, the court in <em>Granite Trust Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pac. T. Co., supra, </em>36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>F.Supp. 77, examined a standard approval clause and stated: \u201cIt would seem to be the better law that when a lease restricts a lessee\u2019s rights by requiring consent before these rights can be exercised, <em>it must have been in the contemplation of the parties that the lessor be required to give some reason for withholding consent.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 78, italics added.) The same view was expressed by commentators in the 1950\u2019s. (See Note, <em>Landlord and Tenant\u2014Right of Lessor to Refuse Any Settlement When Lease Prohibits Transfer Without Consent </em>(1957) 41 Minn. L.Rev. 355, 358-359; Note, <em>Real Property\u2014Landlord and Tenant\u2014Lessor\u2019s Arbitrary Withholding of Consent to Sublease </em>(1957) 55 Mich. L.Rev. 1029, 1031; 2 Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 229, fn. 79 (1950).) Again in 1963, the court in <em>Gamble </em>v. <em>New Orleans Housing Mart, Inc. </em>(La.App. 1963) 154 So.2d 625, stated: \u201cHere the lessee is simply not permitted to sublet without the written consent of the lessor. This does not <em>prohibit </em>or <em>interdict </em>subleasing. To the contrary, it permits subleasing provided only that the lessee first obtain the written consent of the lessor. <em>It suggests or connotes that, when the lessee obtains a subtenant acceptable or satisfactory to the lessor, he may sublet. . . . </em>Otherwise the provision simply would prohibit subleasing.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 627, final italics added.) In <em>Shaker Building Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Lime &amp; Stone Co., supra, </em>28 Ohio Misc. 246 [277 N.E.2d 584], the court expressed the same view: \u201cWhile the lease before the court clearly states that no assignment may take place without prior consent, inherent, however, in that provision is the representation that an assignment is possible. This court is of the opinion that <em>equally inherent in that provision is the representation that such prior consent will not be withheld under any and all circumstances, reasonable or unreasonable.\u201d (Id., </em>277 N.E.2d at p. 587, italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In light of the interpretations given to approval clauses in the cases cited above, and in light of the increasing number of jurisdictions that have adopted the minority rule in the last 15 years, the assertion that an approval clause \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d grants the lessor absolute discretion over assignments is untenable. It is not a rewriting of a contract, as respondent suggests, to recognize the obligations imposed by the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which duty is implied by law in every contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The third justification advanced in support of the majority rule is essentially based on the doctrine of stare decisis. It is argued that the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>should not depart from the common law majority rule because \u201cmany leases now in effect covering a substantial amount of real property and creating valuable property rights were carefully prepared by competent counsel in reliance upon the majority viewpoint.\u201d <em>(Gruman </em>v. <em>Investors Diversified Services, supra, </em>78 N.W.2d at p. 381; accord, <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Funk, supra, </em>633 P.2d at p. 592 (Bakes, C. J., dis.); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Dixon, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 1008.) As pointed out above, however, the majority viewpoint has been far from universally held and has never been adopted by this court. Moreover, the trend in favor of the minority rule should come as no surprise to observers of the changing state of real property law in the 20th century. The minority rule is part of an increasing recognition of the contractual nature of leases and the implications in terms of contractual duties that flow therefrom. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 624 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168].)  We would be remiss in our duty if we declined to question a view held by the majority of jurisdictions simply because it is held by a majority. As we stated in <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 382 [115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669], the \u201cvitality [of the common law] can flourish only so long as the courts remain alert to their obligation and opportunity to change the common law when reason and equity demand it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">A final argument in favor of the majority rule is advanced by respondent and stated as follows: \u201cBoth tradition and sound public policy dictate that the lessor has a right, under circumstances such as these, to realize the increased value of his property.\u201d Respondent essentially argues that any increase in the market value of real property during the term of a lease properly belongs to the lessor, not the lessee. We reject this assertion. One California commentator has written: \u201c[W]hen the lessee executed the lease he acquired the contractual right for the exclusive use of the premises, and all of the benefits and detriment attendant to possession, for the term of the contract. He took the downside risk that he would be paying too much rent if there should be a depression in the rental market. . . . Why should he be deprived of the contractual benefits of the lease because of the fortuitous inflation in the marketplace^] By reaping the benefits he does not deprive the landlord of anything to which the landlord was otherwise entitled. The landlord agreed to dispose of possession for the limited term and he could not reasonably anticipate any more than what was given to him by the terms of the lease. His reversionary estate will benefit from the increased value from the inflation in any event, at least upon the expiration of the lease.\u201d (4 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (1977) 1984 supp., \u00a7 27:92 at p. 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Respondent here is trying to get <em>more </em>than it bargained for in the lease. A lessor is free to build periodic rent increases into a lease, as the lessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>did here. (See <em>ante, </em>p. 493.) Any increased value of the property beyond this \u201cbelongs\u201d to the lessor only in the sense, as explained above, that the lessor\u2019s reversionary estate will benefit from it upon the expiration of the lease. We must therefore reject respondent\u2019s argument in this regard.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A different argument in favor of the majority rule is suggested by the Court of Appeal in its opinion in this case, though the point was never raised by the parties. The Court of Appeal drew an inference from Civil Code section 1951.4 that the Legislature, when it adopted that section in 1970, considered and rejected the minority rule on approval clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Section 1951.4 provides, in essence, that a lessor can avoid the statutory duty to mitigate damages (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1951.2) by contracting to shift that duty onto the lessee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Absent such a shifting, the lessor could only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>recover, in the event of the lessee\u2019s breach, that amount of damages which the lessor could not reasonably avoid by reletting the premises. Since the statutory scheme would be frustrated if the lessor could first contract to shift the duty of mitigation onto the lessee and then block the lessee\u2019s attempts to assign or sublease, the statute provides that where consent to assignment is required, the lease must expressly state that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1951.4, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">It is true that section 1951.4 impliedly recognizes that absent a \u201creasonableness\u201d clause, a lessor might believe that he or she had a common law right arbitrarily to withhold consent to assignment, and thus frustrate the statutory scheme.  However, implicit recognition in a statute of an existing common law rule that is not the subject of the statute does not constitute a codification of that rule, and certainly does not prevent a court from reexamining it. We cannot agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s speculation that the Legislature, when it adopted section 1951.4 in 1970, considered and rejected the minority position on the interpretation of an approval clause in a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In conclusion, both the policy against restraints on alienation and the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing militate in favor of adoption of the rule that where a commercial lease provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the lessor, such consent may be withheld only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable objection to the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>signee or the proposed use. Under this rule, appellants have stated a cause of action against respondent Ernest Pesta\u00f1a, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The order sustaining the demurrer to the complaint, which we have deemed to incorporate a judgment of dismissal,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Bird, C.

However, our holding applies equally to subleases. The difference between an assignment and a sublease is that an assignment transfers the lessee\u2019s entire interest in the property whereas a sublease transfers only a portion of that interest, with the original lessee retaining a right of reentry at some point during the unexpired term of the lease.

In my view we should follow the weight of authority which, as acknowledged by the majority herein, allows the commercial lessor to withhold his consent to an assignment or sublease arbitrarily or without reasonable cause. The majority\u2019s contrary ruling, requiring a \u201ccommercially reasonable objection\u201d to the assignment, can only result in a proliferation of unnecessary litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The correct analysis is contained in the opinion of Justice Carl Anderson for the Court of Appeal in this case. I adopt the following portion of his opinion as my dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">\u201cThis case is strikingly similar to a recent case this court decided\u2014 <em>Schweiso </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 883, ... In <em>Schweiso, </em>we decided to follow the case of <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 321 [195 Cal.Rptr. 84], which held that where \u2018the lease provides for assignment or subletting only with the prior consent of the lessor, a lessor may refuse consent only where he has a good faith reasonable objection to the assignment or sublease, even in the absence of a provision prohibiting the unreasonable or arbitrary withholding of consent to an assignment of a commercial lease.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 330.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">\u201cBoth <em>Schweiso </em>and <em>Cohen </em>recognize that they are themselves departures from the long-established rule in California that such a lease proviso had heretofore meant that the lessor may, indeed, refuse consent arbitrarily and even without a good faith reasonable objection. The lease in question herein was written long before <em>Schweiso </em>and <em>Cohen, </em>and was interpreted by the trial court four months before the first of these decisions was filed. For reasons which follow, we believe both <em>Schweiso </em>and <em>Cohen </em>were wrongly decided, now decline to follow them, and affirm the decision of the trial court sustaining the demurrer herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">\u201cThe plain language of the lease provides that the lessee <em>shall not </em>assign the lease \u2018without written consent of Lessor first had and obtained .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Any such assignment or subletting without this consent shall be void, and shall, at the option of Lessor, terminate this lease.\u2019 The lease does not require that \u2018consent may not unreasonably be withheld\u2019; the lease does not provide that \u2018the lessor may refuse consent only where he has a good faith reasonable objection to the assignment.\u2019 Neither have the parties so contracted, nor has the Legislature so required. Absent such legislative direction, the parties should be free to contract as they see fit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201cAppellant urges this court to rewrite the contract by adding a limitation on the lessor\u2019s withholding of consent\u2014\u2018that such consent may not be unreasonably withheld.\u2019 He urges that such must be implied in the term \u2018without written consent of lessor first had and obtained\u2019; and he places the burden on the lessor to add language to negate that, if such be his intent-language such as \u2018such consent may be arbitrarily, capriciously and/or unreasonably withheld.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201cHowever, it is obvious that the attorney for the lessor agreeing to such a term was entitled to rely upon the state of the law then existing in California. And at such time (Dec. 12, 1969), it is clear that California followed the \u2018weight of authority\u2019 in these United States and allowed such consent to be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld absent a provision to the contrary. <em>(Richard </em>v. <em>Degen &amp; Brody, Inc. </em>(1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 289 [5 Cal.Rptr. 263].) The <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Degen &amp; Brody </em>court clearly held that the weight of authority as expressed in 51 Corpus luris Secundum section 36 was the law of California: \u2018 \u201c. . . where a subletting or assignment of the leased premises without the consent of the lessor is prohibited, he [lessor] may withhold his assent arbitrarily and without regard to the qualifications of the proposed assignee, unless ... the lease provides that consent shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld, and in granting his assent may impose such conditions as he sees fit.\u201d\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 299.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cEven those few jurisdictions and authorities which have rejected the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 rule have forthrightly recognized that in doing so, they depart from the majority: \u2018The general rule throughout the country has been that when a lease contains an approval clause, the landlord may arbitrarily and capriciously reject proposed subtenants.\u2019 <em>(Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cowden </em>(Ala. 1977) 350 So.2d 1035, 1037.) See also the reporters\u2019 note to the Restatement Second of Property, section 15.2, at page 111, which <em>proposes </em>the very result advanced by appellants: \u2018The rule adopted in subsection (2) of this section that the landlord may not unreasonably withhold his consent to a transfer by the tenant is contrary to the established common-law rule that if the lease mandates the consent of the landlord to validate a transfer, and the lease does not provide for the landlord to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>consent if the transferee is reasonably suitable, such consent may be withheld arbitrarily by the landlord. \u2019 [Fn. omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cThose jurisdictions adopting the Restatement\u2019s proposed departure from the settled common law appear to do so upon the shaky public policy rationale that the consent of a lessor should not be withheld unreasonably and that to hold otherwise is to violate the principle that restraints on alienation should be narrowly construed. (See <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(Fla. 1981) 397 So.2d 1171; <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Funk </em>(1981) 102 Idaho 521 [633 P.2d 586]; <em>Shaker Building Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Lime &amp; Stone Co. </em>(1971) 28 Ohio Misc. 246 [277 N.E.2d 584]; <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Walter E. Heller International Corp. </em>(1975) 30 Ill.App.3d 631 [333 N.E.2d 50].) Some even cite \u2018moral needs\u2019 <em>(Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cowden, supra, </em>350 So.2d at p. 1038) or the \u2018increased recognition of and emphasis on the duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contract\u2019 <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Ratinoff, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d 321, 330), or the egregious motive in enforcing the clause seeking \u2018additional amounts of \u201cblood\u201d money from the appellants as a condition of consent to the assignments\u2019 <em>(Schweiso </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d 883, 887 . . .).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201cSome jurisdictions have overruled the common law, at least as to residential leases, by legislative action. (See Alaska Stat., \u00a7 34.03.060 (1975); Delaware Code Ann., tit. 25, \u00a7 5512, subd. (b) (1915); Hawaii Rev. Stat., \u00a7 516-63 (Supp. 1975).) This would appear to be the wisest procedure, if only to effect the repeal prospectively and thereby give force to those contracts entered into when the common law prevailed. See Justice Blood-worth\u2019s dissent in <em>Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cowden, supra, </em>350 So.2d at page 1039: \u2018To overturn a century and a quarter of existing real estate law without giving contracting parties \u201cfair notice\u201d is my principal complaint with the majority\u2019s opinion. At the very least, I think the majority ought to make the rule they have adopted \u201cprospective.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cHowever, those jurisdictions which reject the temptation to follow what the minority call \u2018the trend\u2019 (see <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Vasquez, supra, </em>397 So.2d at p. 1173) do so because they simply refuse to rewrite unambiguous language within a lease. <em>(B &amp; R Oil Company, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ray\u2019s Mobile Homes, Inc. </em>(1980) 139 Vt. 122 [422 A.2d 1267].) They so refuse in order to uphold the integrity of the contract and the inalienable rights of citizens to seek and obtain enforcement thereof by the courts. For those the motives and reasons for exercise of rights fairly contracted for are simply irrelevant: \u2018This commercial lease expressly provided that it could not be assigned without the landlord\u2019s consent; there was no limitation in the lease that such consent should not be unreasonably withheld. ... In the circumstances, the landlord was merely exercising its legal contractual rights in refusing to consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>an assignment of the lease unless the lease was modified to increase the rent. Such an exercise of the landlord\u2019s legal rights does not constitute economic duress so as to entitle the tenant to damages. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Herlou Card Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Co. of America </em>(1979) 73 App.Div.2d 562 [422 N.Y.S.2d 708] [reversing a $55,000 award to tenant].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">\u201cFurther persuading us that <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Schweiso </em>were wrongly decided is the failure of either case to discuss the history of what action the California Legislature has taken and, perhaps more importantly, not taken. For if the Legislature has considered adopting appellant\u2019s position as the law of California and, having so considered, has rejected such a change, that refusal to act certainly implies legislative recognition and approval of current law. And this appears to be precisely the case in California. For in 1970 the Legislature added section 1951.4 to the Civil Code (elf. July 1, 1971) to permit landlords to recover rent due under the lease when the lessee breaches and abandons <em>if </em>the lease permits the lessee to \u2018[s]ublet the property, assign his interest in the lease, or both, with the consent of the lessor, <em>and the lease provides that such consent shall not unreasonably be with</em>held'. \u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1951.4, subd. (b)(3), italics added.) If the lease does not so provide then section 1951.2 of the Civil Code places upon the lessor the burden of retaking the premises and reletting the property in order to minimize damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cThe Law Revision Commission comment on this addition makes clear the advantage to lessors in agreeing not to withhold consent unreasonably: \u2018Where the lease complies with this section, the lessor may recover the rent as it becomes due under the terms of the lease and at the same time has no obligation to retake possession and relet the property in the event the lessee abandons the property. This allocation of the burden of minimizing the loss is most useful where the lessor does not have the desire, facilities, or ability to manage the property and to acquire a suitable tenant and for this reason desires to avoid the burden that Section 1951.2 places on the lessor to mitigate the damages by reletting the property.\u2019 (Cal. Law Revision Com., com. \u00a7 1951.4.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cThus, the California Legislature has considered the situation of lessors contracting for the right (and then exercising it) of unreasonably withholding consent to an assignment. That it has provided an increased measure of damages (and thus an incentive) to those who forego this right is a clear recognition that the contractual right does exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cWhile we harbor great reverence for the doctrine of stare decisis and do not lightly reject the holdings in <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Schweiso, </em>we respectfully suggest that it is not for this court either in <em>Cohen </em>or <em>Schweiso </em>or the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>bar to imply a requirement of reasonableness when the Legislature specifically refused to do so 14 years earlier. [Fn. omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cTo rewrite this contract (as appellant would have us do) for the benefit of one who was not an original party thereto, and to the detriment of one who stands in privity with one who was, and to hold that there is a triable issue of fact concerning whether respondents unreasonably withheld their consent when they had already contracted for that right, creates only mischief by breeding further uncertainty in the interpretation of otherwise unambiguously written contracts. To so hold only encourages needless future litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cWe respectfully suggest that if California is to adopt the minority rule and reject the majority rule which recognizes the current proviso as valid, unambiguous and enforceable, that it do so by clear affirmative legislative action. To so defer to the legislative branch, protects not only this contract but \u2018those tens of thousands of landlords, tenants and lawyers who have relied on our unbroken line of judicial precedent. \u2019 <em>(Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cowden, supra, </em>350 So.2d at p. 1041.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Mosk, L, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
