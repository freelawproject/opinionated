The case was referred to H. Hubbard, who made a report of the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-14\">Matthew Van Deusen owned two adjoining lots, numbered 14 and 15, parallel to two adjoining lots, numbered 16 and 17, belonging to the plaintiff, the lot No. 15 being bounded on the north by the lot No. 16. On Matthew\u2019s lots, near the east end of them, was a steep hill. In drawing timber from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the part of his land east of the hill to that lying west of the mil. he went on the southerly half of the plaintiff\u2019s lot No. 16, that being the most convenient route. At the east end of this route the defendants drew out timber for the purpose of turning it round, it not being convenient to do it on Matthew\u2019s own land, occupying in this operation six or seven rods in width of the plaintiff\u2019s land. These were the trespasses complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-3\">Matthew, to establish his claim to a right of way in the route which he took, exhibited a deed from Isaac Van Deusen (grandfather) to his son Abraham, from whom the plaintiff\u2019s title to the south half of lot No. 16 was derived, dated December 5, 1787, conveying that south half, but \u201c reserving the privilege of a road to cross lot No. 16 above mentioned, to my son Isaac, his heirs and assigns, in a place which shall ne most convenient.\u201d Also a deed of the same date from the same grantor to his son Isaac, of lot No. 14 and part of No. 15, containing this clause :\u2014\u201cAlso I hereby grant a road to the two last described lots (No. 14 and No. 15) across lot No. 16, which I have by deed of equal date granted to my son Abraham.\u201d Also a deed of release from three of the heirs of Isaac (the son) to the defendant Matthew, the only other heir, dated in 1818, of all their right to the residue of lot No. 15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-4\">A road was opened as early as 1776, but which was not established as a public road until 1791, crossing the several lots mentioned in a direction north and south, westward of the place where the supposed trespass was done. Another road, beginning at the one just described, passed by a mill in lot No. 17 and along the north side of lot No. 16 to the east end of the lot. Matthew had formerly crossed the plaintiff\u2019s meadow several times, entering near the west end of the trespass route and coming into the mill road, and then pursuing that road to the east end of his land. When the mill pond has been so high as to render a lane on his own land impassable, he has gone up the public road and into the mill road, and turned thence and passed over the plaintiff\u2019s land to his own west of the hill. He has moreover, with others, used a sled path, in winter, crossing the plaintiff\u2019s land west o the public road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-9\">To prove that the grant and reservation in the two deeds from Isaac Van Deusen did not relate to the way afterwards established as a public road, the defendants proved that these deeds were a part of the division and settlement of the grant- or\u2019s estate among his children. Abraham was desirous of obtaining the south half of lot No. 16 for a sugar orchard, and- Isaac (the son) was willing to take lots No. 14 and No. 15, if he could have a right of way to the east end thereof; for without such right, he said he should be excluded from enjoying that part of his land, as it was deemed impracticable to make a road over the hill for loaded teams ; that the object of the grant and reservation was not to get to lots No. 14 and No. 15 by the road since made a public road, but to get to the east end of the lots ; and that the matter was talked over by the father and sons before the deeds were executed This proof was objected to by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">The questions arising out of the facts were : \u2014 1. Where was the road granted to Isaac to be located : \u2014 2. Had the defendant Matthew, by traversing the plaintiff\u2019s land in other directions and places, precluded himself from claiming a right of way in the route complained of: \u2014 and 3. If he had such a right, did he exercise it in a lawful manner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-11\"><em>Dwight </em>and Whiting, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoRf\">insisted that the word <em>across </em>was used in Isaac Van Deusen\u2019s deeds as synonymous with <em>over </em>or <em>through, </em>and did not mean directly across from one side of the lot to the other ; \u2014 that parol evidence of the conversation at the time of making the deeds was admissible to explain them, on the ground of a latent ambiguity arising from there being more than one place convenient for the way ; <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 Mass.

They contended that there had been a location of the way in the place which was afterwards made a highway, and the defendant could not alter that location; 12 Johns.

The right of way set up by the defendants depends on the construction of the deeds from Isaac Van Deusen to his sons Abraham and Isaac ; it being very clear that the parol evidence reported by the referee cannot be admitted to explain the intention of the parties, or the terms of the deeds. If a deed be defective, or ambiguous on the face of it, it may be void for uncertainty, but the defect cannot be supplied, or the ambiguity removed, by parol evidence. Facts and circumstances, existing at the time of a conveyance, may become important, and may be proved by parol evidence, as was decided in the case of <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>10 Mass. R. 459 ; but the evidence now offered goes to show the agreement of the parties, and the intention of the grant to Isaac Van Deusen, as to the location of the way ; which is clearly inadmissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The parol evidence as to the agreement being excluded, there is nothing to support the defendant\u2019s construction of the deeds in question. The way granted is to cross the plaintiff\u2019s lot; and the words of the grant are to be understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>according to their common meaning, unless it appears that ^le parties intended to use them in a different sense. The way claimed by the defendants is not <em>across </em>the plaintiff\u2019s lot, according to the usual acceptation of the word ; and it cannot be presumed from the facts and circumstances reported, that it was otherwise understood by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The language of the deed is not definite, but according to its most obvious meaning, the object seems to nave been to secure to the grantee access to the public highway The lots conveyed to him did not adjoin the public highway ; and although there was a way used, it was only a way by sufferance, which might be legally stopped up at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">This construction is strengthened by the subsequent acts of the grantee and his assigns. The case shows that there has been either a location of the way at another place, or a nonuser for nearly forty years, which raises a violent presumption against the present claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We are also of the opinion, that the defence must fail for another reason. It appears by the report of the referee, that the defendants drew their timber on the plaintiff\u2019s land \u201cfor the purpose of turning it around, it not being convenient to do it on the defendant Matthew\u2019s land.\u201d This was a misuser of the right of way, and could not be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We have, however, no doubt of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover on the ground first stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"><em> </em>But if the words in a deed creating or reserving a right of way be ambiguous as to the extent of the right, the acts and usage of the parties are admissible in evidence to explain the language of the deed. <em>Choate </em>v.
