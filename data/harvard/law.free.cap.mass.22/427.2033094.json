The Court therefore increased the allowance to 60 dollars a year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></summary>\n\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b441-7\">Alimony allowed without regard to the husbaud\u2019s income alone, the illness of the wife requiring extraordinary expenses.</p><p id=\"b441-8\">Upon a petition for an increase of alimony, it appeared that the parties were divorced <em>a mensa et thoro </em>in 1826, on the application of the wife, and 30 dollars a year allowed as alimony ; that she was now afflicted with a disease which rendered her unable to labor for her support, and occasioned extraordinary expenses to nearly the whole amount of the alimony; that her children were not able to support her, although they had contributed for that purpose ; that in the opinion of her physician she could not live longer than a year; that the husband\u2019s real estate was worth about 2100 dollars, and his personal 300, and that his debts amounted to about 600 ; and that his income from the real estate was about 42 dollars, and from his labor about as much more.</p><p id=\"b441-10\">Costs for the petitioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b441-11\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>76, \u00a7 31, 36.</p><p id=\"Ayqk\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>76, \u00a7 37.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
