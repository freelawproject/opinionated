Godfrey or bearer, in three months from date. Plea, the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-14\">At <em>the </em>trial in the Court of Common Pleas, before <em>Williams </em>J., the plaintiff produced the note with the name of Godfrey indorsed thereon in blank. The defendant objected to its being admitted in evidence without proof of the handwriting of the supposed indorser; but the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-15\">The defendant offered evidence tending to prove, that on the 8th of July, 1822, he paid to Godfrey, at Milton, the sum of 3 dollars, which Godfrey promised to indorse on the note on his return home to Easton where the note then was. The judge instructed the jury, that it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that he purchased the note before the payment of the 3 dollars to Godfrey, but that it was necessary for the defendant to satisfy them that this payment was made before the note was transferred, or his defence in this particular would fail him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-16\">A verdict being found for the plaintiff, the defendant filed his exceptions to the foregoing directions of the judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-17\"><em>King </em>supported the exceptions.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-18\"><em>C. </em>Laihrop, <em>contri,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ans\">cited as to the burden of proof, <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>5 Mass.

As to the alleged payment, they said that if it had appeared on the note to be before the transfer, the defendant might have availed himself of it in defence ; that the burden of proof was on him to show the time of the transfer ; and that if the promisor makes a partial payment without taking care to have it indorsed, and the note is afterwards transferred to an innocent person, the promisor is in fault and ought to be the sufferer ; unless the note shall appear to have been transferred after it was discredited.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\"> See Bayley on Bills, (Phil. and Sewall\u2019s 2d ed.) 544, 545, notes; <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Peters, ante, </em>1 ; <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Southgate, ante, </em>112.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
