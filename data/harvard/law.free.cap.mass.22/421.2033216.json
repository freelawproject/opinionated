The duration of the way therefore is sufficient to support the plea of prescription.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But to prove a prescriptive way it is not only necessary that it should have existed immemorially, but that the use of it should have been uninterrupted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-7\"><em>Hilliard </em>and <em>T. </em>Fuller, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEoj\">cited 3 Dane\u2019s Abr. 251, <em>et seq. </em>; <em>Gayetty </em>v.
