The evidence was of a note written, <em>I promised </em>&amp;c., and this was &lt; i, cted to, at the trial, as a variance ; but the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">It was also objected that there was no proof that the forgery was committed within the county of Worcester, or even witnm the commonwealth, the note bearing date Providence, <em>7th </em>August, 1825, and there being no evidence of the fact, other than that the note was uttered in Worcester in January 1827. But the jury were instructed that they might infer the fact of forgery within the county, from the fact of the note\u2019s having been uttered therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">If this direction was wrong, or if the variance above men tioned was material, the verdict was to be set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AsHC\"><em>Goodwin </em>and Allen, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoq\">referred, on the point of variance, to 2 Russell on Crimes, 1481, 1482, and the authorities there cited ; and on the other point, to the same book, <em>p. </em>1499.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-11\"><em>Davis </em>(Sol.

The evidence was only that the note was here uttered.
