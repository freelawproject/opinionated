Howard took possession of the land immediately after it was set off, and continued to occupy and receive the income of it until January 6, 1812, when, to satisfy an execution against him, he and his wife made a lease of the land for one year, to commence on the 16th of March, 1812, whereupon the execution was discharged. In May 1813, it was set off for the term of two years, in satisfaction of another execution, and in July 1814 Howard and his wife conveyed all their interest in the estate to one Whitman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\"><em>Morton </em>J. ordered the defendants to be called, but if upon these facts the settlement of the paupers was not in Pembroke, the default was to be taken off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"APL\"><em>K.

And he continued seised notwithstanding the lease, for the possession of the lessee was that of the lessor; and it is immaterial whether he received the rents and paid the debt, or paid the debt without receiving them, as virtually they were received by him. The paupers therefore gained a settlement in the fourth mode pointed out by the statute of 1793, c. 34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-17\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>45, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
