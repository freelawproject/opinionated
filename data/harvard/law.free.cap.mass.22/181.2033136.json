The demandant gave in evidence a deed duly executed from Joshua West to J. G. Norton and H. Stocking, dated September 12, 1823, on the back of which was written a condition in the usual form of a condition to a mortgage, without date, signature, or seal. The tenant objected that this was not a mortgage, but <em>Putnam </em>J. ruled that the writing on the back of the deed should be considered as a condition, in the same manner as if it had been inserted in the first page of the deel, above the signature and seal of the grantor. The deed and the condition were recorded on the 13th of September. There was a regular assignment from the grantees to he demandant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-7\"><em>Porter </em>and <em>Byington, </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AND\">objected that it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>not appear that the signature to the absolute deed was intended to be a signature to the defeasance, ard that there was no evidence that the condition was written at the same time with the absolute deed.
