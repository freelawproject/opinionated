Wiswall accepted the trust, and was in possession of the estate from the time of the probate of the will until his death in January 1822. In February 1822 letters of administration upon his estate were granted to his widow, who gave notice thereof, pursuant to the statute. She administered until April 1824, when she died ; and in May 1824 the defendant was appointed administrator <em>de bonis non </em>on the same estate ; of which he gave the like \"notice. This action was brought to recover the amount of the rents and profits of the estate devised in trust, which the plaintiff alleged had never been paid over to him or expended in his support, and also to recover the value of the plaintiff\u2019s labor while in the employment of Wiswall. The suit was commenced more than four years after the appointment of the widow as administratrix, but within four years from the appointment of the defendant as administrator <em>de bonis non. </em>If upon these facts the defendant was not liable, oy reason of <em>St. </em>1791, c. 28, \u00a7 2, limiting the time for bringing actions against administrators to four years, it was agreed that the plaintiff should become nonsuit. If the claim for rents and profits received by Wiswall more than six years before his death, and for the labor of the plaintiff previous to that time, or for either, was barred by the general statute of limitations, it was agreed that the plaintiff should not be permitted to give evidence of the part of his claim so barred. But if the plaintiff was not barred of his claims for either of the causes mentioned, it was agreed that the amount of damages to be recovered should be determined by a jury, on a trial of the action upon the general issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-3\"><em>Davis </em>and Allen, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayx\">on the point that the gen-</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9nC\">eral statute of limitation does not apply in the case of trusts, referred to 4 Bac.

The former administration continued but two years, leaving two for creditors to prosecute their actions ; there was then an interval when no suit could be brought; then the defendant became administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>and this suit was brought within four years from that time. Neither had there been four years of any administration subsisting before the suit was commenced. We consider the second administration, by virtue of the statute, open to suits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>for four years, as well as the first, and therefore the facts stated, if pleaded, would be no bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The general statute of limitations of six years does not affect trusts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> So much however of the demand as consists of labor and services may be barred by that statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> It is now provided by the Revised Statutes, that an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>shall be liable to the actions of the creditors of the deceased for a space of time, which being added to the time that shall have expired whilst the former administrator continued in office, shall make five years in the whole; provided that he shall never be liable for less than two years after he shall have given bonds for the discharge of his trust; and if the former administrator shall never have given the requisite notice of his appointment, the new administrator shall be liable to the actions of creditors for the space of four years after the date of his bond.
