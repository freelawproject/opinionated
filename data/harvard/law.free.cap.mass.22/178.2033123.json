The facts disclosed constitute a pledge. The,presumption of law is, that Lane-ton was the authorized agent of the debtor, for a written power was not requisite to enable him to pledge personal estate ; and if he was an agent, that he acted within the scope of his commission. But if he was not an agent, the plaintiff ought to have cited him in, and shown by his answer that he acted without authority. <em>Lane </em>v. Penniman, 4 Mass. R. 91. Cons'dering Lancton then as the agent of the debtor, the act of the wife in making the pledge was approved of at the time by the husband, in the person of his agent, and thus was in effect the act of the husband. If the property was pledged, it was not liable to the trustee process, as it did not exceed in value the amount of the debt for which it was pledged. <em>Hastings </em>v. Baldwin, 17 Mass. R. 552. \u2014 2. If there was not a legal pledge, then there was no act on the part of the debtor in regard to the supposed pledge, and the furniture not being by him \u201c intrusted or deposited \u201d in the hands of the respondent, it might \u201c have been come at to be attached by the ordinary process of law,\u201d and of course was not subject to the trustee process ; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Megguire, </em>15 Mass. R. 490 ; for this was not a fraudulent transfer, and there was no surplus to be returned to the debtor, nor any stipulation to that effect, and these are the only exceptions allowed in the construction of <em>St. </em>1794, <em>c. </em>65. <em>Burlingame </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>16 Mass. R. 318. At any rate, a demand should have been made upon the respondent, or some concealment on his part been shown. \u2014 3. The actual attachment of the furniture and taking it from the respondent, discharged him from any liability to which he might previously have been subject. <em>Burlingame </em>v. <em>Bell, ubi sup.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-3\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The first question which arises out of these answers is, whether the furniture of the debtor was so deposited in the hands and possession of the respondent as to make him chargeable as the trustee of the debtor. If it were necessary that he should hold it by virtue of any contract with the debtor, the plaintiff would fail on this point; for we see no authority in the wife or the friend of the debtor to transfer the furniture by pledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>or by sale j but the debtor would, notwithstanding this de^ver7 by the wife, have been able to reclaim the furniture, ot to maintain replevin or trover therefor. But the respondent having the possession, although not by the act or consent of the debtor, the goods were liable to attachment, or if they could not be come at to be attached by the ordinary process, they might be attached in his hands by virtue of the trustee process. We think the removal of them to his own house, under a claim to hold them as a pledge for the debt of Peirsons, was a sufficient embarrassment to an attachment by the ordinary writ, to enable the plaintiff to resort for his security to the trustee process. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Megguire, </em>15 Mass. R. 490 ; <em>Parker </em>v. Kinsman, 8 Mass. R. 486 ; <em>Burlingame </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>16 Mass. R. 318.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Arb\">But the respondent claims to be discharged on the ground, that when he took the furniture into his possession, he was the agent of Peirsons, a creditor who had authorized him to obtain security ; and that the goods were delivered to him by the wife of the debtor as and for a pledge or security of Peirsons\u2019s debt, and that Lancton, who had the care of settling the debtor\u2019s affairs in his absence, assented to the delivery for the above purpose ; so that when he was served with the trustee process, he'held the furniture in pledge as agent of Peirsons the creditor. We cannot however consider the goods as legally pledged, for want of a contract to that effect by the debtor. The wife had no authority to make such contract for him, and the verbal direction of the debtor to Lancton to settle his affairs, gave him no authority to transfer his property in this way; so that the possession of the furniture by the respondent was wholly without any title or lawful lien. But suppose him to have acquired a lien on behalf of Peirsons, he was nevertheless liable to the process ; so that the plaintiff\u2019s attachment would hold, and then, upon the surrender of the lien, the attachment was disembarrassed of the claim of Peirsons, whose.subsequent attachment cannot avail against that previously made by the plaintiff. The at* tachment of the furniture on the suit of Peirsons must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>presumed to have been made by consent of the respondent, and he thus relinquished the lien which he claims to have had by delivery of the goods as a pledge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They were still however charged with the attachment by the plaintiff when attached by Peirsons, so that the officer who made this last attachment took the goods subject to the lien created in favor of the respondent by his liability on the trustee process. According to the case of <em>Burlingame </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>therefore, the respondent must be charged, and his remedy, if he cannot produce the goods, is against the attaching officer, who, if he had notice of the prior attachment by the trustee process, will be held to indemnify the respondent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> See Revised Stat c. 107, $ 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> See Story on Bailments, 345, 246.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
