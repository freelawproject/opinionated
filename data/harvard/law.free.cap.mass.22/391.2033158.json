The defendant read the deposition of Adam Bullard, brother of Eli, in which it was testified, that the deponent himself, Eli, and some of his other brothers, after the death of their father, gave to their sister Mary Hill, each a note for ten pounds, because she did not receive so much of their father\u2019s estate as each of the brothers. The defendant then proposed to prove that the plaintiff, since the commencement of this action, acknowledged that the note in suit was given solely as a renewal of the ten pound note ; but the judge being of opinion that the confessions of the plaintiff were not admissible, and that the fact, if proved, would not be a defence against this action, rejected the evidence and directed the defendant to be called. But if this evidence was admissible, and the facts proposed to be proved, together with those before proved, amount to a defence, the default was to be taken off and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-4\">\n<em>Buckminster, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9M\">A promise made without considera-</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANm\">tion may be avoided. <em>Rann </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>7 T.

R. 134 ; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>13 Mass. R. 203 ; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>16 Mass. R. 429 ; <em>Atkins v.

R. 427, [Rand\u2019s edit. 430, n. a;] <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>3 Pick. 207, [2d edit. 211, n. 1 ;] and <em>Train </em>v. <em>Gold, ante, p. </em>380, and the authorities cited in those cases. And he contended that here the money was paid by giving the first note. But the case is still stronger, for the first note too was paid by giving the second. If the money had been actually paid when the first note was taken up, and had been immediately returned upon the new note\u2019s being given, there could be no question of the sufficiency of the consideration as money lent; but it surely could not be necessary to go through this ceremony. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>3 Pick, 322 ; <em>Maneely </em>v. <em>M\u2019Gee, </em>6 Mass. R. 145 ; <em>Goodenow </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>7 Mass. R. 39 ; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>10 Mass.

There the promisor was under a strong moral obligation. It was a case too, substantially, of a <em>donatio causa mortis. </em>There was an actual delivery of personal securities to a large amount, to a friend, with an express injunction to pay the note. The objection to the validity of the note was merely formal. Suppose the note had run thus,\u2014 <em>u </em>In consideration of the services rendered me in my sickness by A. B., I promise to pay her 100 dollars, although she did not expect to receive wages for those services,\u201d \u2014 no one would contend that it was <em>nudum'pactum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-12\">Giving up a note inherently void for want of a consideration, cannot constitute a sufficient consideration for a new note. If the defendant\u2019s intestate has once paid what he promised to give, let the plaintiff rest satisfied with that payment. But if the payment was only a fiction, the argument fails.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b404-13\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6v\">It is conceded by the counsel for the plaintiff, that the confession of the administrator who is plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>tiff in this action, was competent evidence ; and we think he is justified in such concession, for we do not find any case in which evidence of that kind has been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">We are to consider then, that the defendant offered to prove that the plaintiff had admitted that the consideration of the note in suit was a former note given by the defendant\u2019s intestate, which note, according to other testimony in the case, was given to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate by Eli Bullard her brother, because she had not received so much of her father\u2019s estate as her brothers had, and that her other brothers had each given her a similar note for the same cause. If we are to consider this a mere act of generosity on the part of the brothers, they not being indebted or in any manner obliged to pay any thing to their sister, they having a perfect and undisputed right to the portion of the estate given them b) their father, then it would follow that the note first given was without consideration, and so not recoverable. The case as reported is not explicit on this point. It may be, for aught appearing to the contrary, that the will of the father was disputed by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and that she intended to contest the probate of it, and that to induce her to withdraw her objections, these notes were given. If such were the facts, they would constitute a sufficient consideration and the notes could not be avoided If the plaintiff is able to make out a case of the kind, on a new trial, he will have opportunity. But as the case now appears, we cannot think the default ought to stand, for it would seem that the only consideration for the note in suit was the preexisting note, which was wholly without a consideration sufficient to sustain an action ; and we cannot see that the plaintiff\u2019s case is strengthened by the supervention of a second note.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We cannot consider the giving of the first note as a payment of the sum for which it was given, and the second note as therefore founded on a consideration as for money lent.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A negotiable promissory note given for a' debt is with us evidence of payment of the debt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, but where there was no previous debt or diuand, the note given is <em>nudum pactum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>In coming to this conclusion we undoubtedly overrule some of the expressions in the opinion, as reported, in the case ol <em>Bowers </em>v. Hurd, 10 Mass. R. 427, [see Rand\u2019s edit. 430, n. a] ; though the case itself was rightly decided upon other principles. It is in that opinion stated, that to a promissory note, in which value is acknowledged to have been received, it cannot be objected in defence, between the original parties, that there was no existing consideration when the promise was made, though it would be competent to show that the consideration had failed or that it was illegal. But further opportunity to examine the cases has convinced us, that the opinion so expressed is untenable ; there being cases in the English and other books, which are. cases clearly of defence founded upon no consideration, rather than a failure of one once existing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This, though contrary to the usual principle of holding a party to his acknowledgment, must be considered as the law, and we cannot depart from it, however disingenuous such defences generally appear to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\n<em>Default taken off and new trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> See <em>Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Williams, 4 </em>Pick (2d ed.) 231, n. 1; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>10 Mass.
