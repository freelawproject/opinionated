It appears that while execution on the judgment obtained by the plaintiff was satisfied January 28, .1950, and receipted for by her counsel as <em>paid in full </em>on February 1, 1950, the motions to reopen and for a new trial were not filed until over a year later on March 7,1951. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel does not deny that the notes were available even prior to bringing the writ, or that an examination of them at any time would have disclosed the error in the specifications. This in itself is sufficient reason for the denial of this motion. <em>Perley </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>91 N. H. 254. However, in addition to this the plaintiff failed to file copies of the notes upon which she sought judgment with the clerk of court, before taking out execution. Not only has our long established practice been to file such copies prior to taking out execution <em>(Hackett </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>5 N.

The plaintiff has indicated in oral argument that she desires to present certain affidavits and other evidence in support of this motion not produced at the hearing. She should have an opportunity to do so and it follows the order is .</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained in part and overruled in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
