H. 316, 317, that her pleadings \u201care model forms of unimpeachable clarity.\u201d They lack the necessary details as to \u201cspecific acts and dates relied upon to constitute a cause ... for divorce.\u201d Superior Court rule 125 (93 N. H. appendix). And if objection had been made for that reason the libel would have had to be amended in those respects or dismissed. <em>Geers </em>v. <em>Geers, supra, </em>317. However it alleges serious injury to libelant\u2019s health resulting from certain conduct on the part of the libelee which is the gist of the cause for divorce alleged therein. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>66 N. H. 600, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Libelant testified that during her marriage to libelee her weight was reduced to eighty-four pounds from a normal of ninety-eight to one hundred pounds; that she had nervous spells when she \u201cwould start to shake and cry and laugh all at the same time\u201d; and that she had to receive medical treatment therefor. Her testimony was corroborated by other witnesses including a doctor. She testified further that this condition resulted because the libelee did not earn money to pay their bills and insisted that she work and help to pay them although she preferred to stay home; also by reason of his general attitude toward her and his refusal to have children. This was evidence upon which the Trial Court could find treatment seriously to injure health. <em>Szulc </em>v. <em>Szulc, </em>96 N. H. 190, 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Libelee\u2019s motions to dismiss were therefore properly denied and the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
