H. 253, 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">While the Trial Court found that the way in question had been used continuously for more than twenty years, there was no ruling it was a public highway, nor did the relief sought by the plaintiff\u2019s bill call for such a ruling. Moreover it may be doubted whether the evidence would warrant such a ruling. <em>Wason </em>v. <em>Nashua, </em>85 N. H. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">It is plain that the plaintiff acquired a right of way by grant the use of which might extend to \"all necessary purposes of entrance and egress.\u201d Under these circumstances, the rights of the parties are to be determined \u201cby reference to the rule of reason.\u201d <em>Sakansky </em>v. <em>Wein, </em>86 N. H. 337, 339. See <em>True </em>v. <em>McAlpine, </em>81 N. H. 314. The Trial Court found that the use made of the plaintiff\u2019s land prior to trial was not unreasonable, and ruled that while the easement might not be converted into a public way by general use, it could be used \u201cfor all purposes to which dominant [tenement] could be devoted.\u201d The requirement of reasonable use is implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>in this definition of the plaintiff\u2019s right <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>59 N.
