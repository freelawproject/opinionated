The issue tried was whether the tract upon which the trees were cut belonged to the plaintiff or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In 1946 the plaintiff was deeded a tract of land in Alexandria \u201cknown as the Charles Cloutman piece,\u201d containing fifty acres more or less. This tract was bounded \u201cnortherly by land formerly of J. S. Chapman; easterly by land now or formerly of H. E. Hutchins; southerly by land formerly of O. S. Gale; and westerly by land of C. N. B. Cloutman.\u201d According to an abstract of title received in evidence, this description appears to have originated in 1903 in the conveyance of an undivided half interest by Ambrose L. Cloutman to C. N. B. Cloutman. Earlier deeds in the abstract tend to indicate that the plaintiff\u2019s tract was a part of a hundred acre tract conveyed by Charles Cloutman in 1875. The larger tract was bounded on the north by land of Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the \u201cJ. S. Chapman lot\u201d which bounds the plaintiff\u2019s land on the north is a tract about equal in size to the Cloutman lot, and is in turn bounded on the north by the Bailey property. There was testimony by a life resident of Alexandria that the Chapman lot is a \u201ccut over lot,\u201d north of the Cloutman lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">In 1934 the defendant acquired title to a fifty acre tract by deed of Sevigny and Nixon. His deed describes the tract as bounded upon the north by the Bailey farm, on the east by Hutchins land, and at the southwest corner by land of Brock. The description does not name the owner of the tract bounding it upon the south. According to the defendant\u2019s abstract the description originated with a deed to Jonathan S. and Mary E. Chapman in 1873. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tract is identified by the plaintiff as the J. S. Chapman lot which bounds the plaintiff\u2019s lot on the north.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">There was evidence which tended to show that the defendant\u2019s grantors cut over a lot prior to their conveyance to the defendant. The defendant conceded that the lot which he purchased was \u201csupposed to be a cut over lot\u201d of fifty acres, but asserted that the deed did not in fact convey the lot which his grantors cut over. He offered evidence tending to prove that the \u201cland formerly of O. S. Gale,\u201d which the plaintiff\u2019s deed describes as bounding on the south the land conveyed to the plaintiff, was acquired by Samuel Belinsky in 1929 by deed describing the premises thereby conveyed as bounded on the north by \u201clands of J. S. Chapman,\u201d as well as lands of certain others who were predecessors in title of the plaintiff. On a basis of this reference to Chapman, the defendant claims that the land which adjoins the Belinsky or Gale property on the north is the land which he acquired from Sevigny and Nixon, and not the land described in the deed to the plaintiff. Upon cross-examination, he testified that the owner of the Bailey land, which according to the description in the defendant\u2019s deed bounds his property on the north, notified him that land which he suggested might be the Chapman lot, was in fact the Bailey land.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The evidence warranted the finding implied in the verdict that the cutting took place upon land of the plaintiff and not of the defendant. The motion for a nonsuit was therefore properly denied. <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>96 N. H. 485; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>73 N. H. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The defendant called as a witness a civil engineer and surveyor who had prepared a plan based upon his survey of a tract which included the' lot where the alleged trespass occurred, as well as neighboring lots. The plan, which showed various landmarks upon the ground, was received in evidence. The witness testified that he had examined the records at the registry of deeds, but was unable to determine whether the cut over lot or the adjoining lot on the south was the Charles Cloutman lot. He was then asked if he could determine from his survey and examination of records whether the land which lay south of the more southerly lot was the Belinsky property. His answer that in his opinion it was, was excluded subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">There was no error in the ruling. The Court\u2019s remark that \u201cthe Court is probably as well qualified to pass upon these various deeds as the witness\u201d indicated a proper ground of exclusion, under the familiar rule that the admissibility of opinion evidence depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>upon the discretionary finding of the Presiding Justice as to whether the evidence will probably aid the trier of the facts. <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>91 N. H. 234, 236. See <em>Ricker </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>94 N. H. 313, 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The defendant excepted to proof that the defendant paid $175 for the conveyance of the fifty acre lot which he acquired from, Sevigny and Nixon, and moved to strike out testimony by a witness for the plaintiff that the going price \u201con cut over land\u201d in Grafton County is two to four dollars an acre. The motion was denied subject to exception. No error is apparent in these rulings. The price paid had some bearing upon the question of which of the two lots in dispute the parties considered to be described by the deed. <em>Cf. Weed </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>71 N. H. 581, 583. The question of the qualifications of the witness who testified to value was for the Trial Court. His concession that the presence of \u201cmineral value\u201d might change the price of land, if of any effect, could go merely to the weight of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Since there was no error in the rulings of the Court, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
