All furniture, fixtures, and personal property, and all implements for gambling and gambling apparatus, used or kept, or provided to be used in unlawful gaming, in any gaming-house, or in any building, apartment, or place resorted to for unlawful gaming, and found therein by an officer, shall be forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The law appears to be settled, and the State concedes, that the teletypewriter seized in these proceedings is not a gambling device <em>per se. </em>Section 11 of the statute provides that \u201cany slot machine or other machine or appliance intended for the purpose of winning money or any other thing by chance or hazard is a gambling implement. . . .\u201d As the claimant points out, its machine is not \u201cintended for the purpose of winning money or any other thing.\u201d As used, it did not determine whether a player should win or lose. It merely reported the results of races which determined that question. As was said of a like machine in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Certain Gaming Implements, </em>317 Mass. 160, 162, 163: \u201cIt is, like the telephone, telegraph or newspapers, merely one means of acquiring news. ... It serves to disclose whether a bettor <em>has </em>won or lost, but not to determine whether he <em>shall </em>win or lose. That the horses do.\u201d See also, <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Company\u2019s Appeal, </em>126 Pa. Super. 533; <em>Tollin </em>v. <em>State </em>(Del.), 78 A. (2d) 810, 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The State contends that the machine may be forfeited in these proceedings either as \u201cpersonal property . . . used or kept, or provided to be used in unlawful gaming,\u201d or as \u201cpersonal property . . . in any . . . place resorted to for unlawful gaming, and found therein by an officer <em>. . . .\u201d S. </em>10 <em>supra. </em>The statute as originally enacted treated property subject to forfeiture under two classifications: (1) \u201cimplements for gambling or gaming apparatus, used or kept and provided to be used in unlawful gaming in any gaming house, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>. . . place resorted to for unlawful gaming\u201d and (2) \u201cpersonal property found in such . . . place, that may be found upon a search-warrant or by any officer . . . .\u201d Laws 1881, c. 36, s. 2. The latter class of property was to be adjudged forfeited if \u201cfound ... at a time when any persons were there found playing at any unlawful game.\u201d <em>Ib., s. </em>3. <em>Cf. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Certain Gaming Implements, supra. </em>In the revision of 1891 when the statute took its present form, there was \u201cno intention to change the law.\u201d Commissioner\u2019s Report, (1891) iii, 858. The history of the statute thus tends to indicate that gambling implements may be forfeited regardless of the circumstances under which found, but that other personal property found in a place resorted to for unlawful gaming is subject to forfeiture only if persons were found gaming at the time of seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">If the latter qualification is properly to be implied in the statute, it is not here decisive since there is evidence that on the day of seizure of the machine, Krell was seen to accept wagers in the smoke shop, which were checked against information appearing upon the teletypewriter tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">It is unnecessary however in this case to determine the proper construction of the statute, because it does not appear that the machine was lawfully seized. While the facts relating to the seizure have neither been found nor agreed upon, it is alleged by the claimant\u2019s motion to dismiss and has not been controverted that the search warrant under which the seizure was made was issued upon a complaint for keeping \u201cgambling implements, to wit, slot machines, pinball machines, punch boards, dice and other so-called gambling paraphernalia.\u201d According to the motion, the warrant issued upon the complaint authorized search \u201cfor said gambling implements described in the annexed complaint and the paraphernalia and other things adapted for gambling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">As previously indicated, the claimant\u2019s machine was not subject to seizure as an implement of gambling. See R. L., c. 424, <em>s. </em>1 III. Nor does the statute authorize search for and seizure of \u201cthings adapted for gambling.\u201d But <em>cf. </em>R. L., c. 424, s. 1 IV; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>66 N. H. 619; <em>Albright </em>v. <em>Muncrief, </em>206 Ark. 319. If the teletypewriter was subject to seizure as property used in unlawful gaming or found in a place resorted to for gaming, its seizure as such was not authorized by the warrant in this case -as described by the claimant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The Constitution <em>(Pt. I, Art. </em>19th) provides that a warrant shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cbe . . . accompanied with a special designation of the . . . objects of . . . seizure.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Spirituous Liquors, </em>75 N. H. 273, 275, it was said to be essential to the maintenance of a libel for forfeiture that the seizure be legal, and that \u201cthere can be no decree for a forfeiture of property taken under a search warrant, if the constitutional guaranty against illegal search has been violated. <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>58 N. H. 317.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lager Beer, </em>70 N. H. 454, it was held that whiskey illegally kept could not be forfeited upon a warrant authorizing a search for lager beer. \u201cThe principle that the forfeiture of property can only be authorized when all the formalities of the law are complied with in the search, seizure and forfeiture proceedings is generally recognized and adhered to . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Liquors, </em>68 N. H. 47, 48. Moreover, it is settled by the case last cited, that where an officer proceeds under a warrant, he may not justify seizure under the provisions of R. L., c. 424, s. 6. Where property which does not fall within the class of gambling implements is to be seized, it should be described in the warrant, if not with particularity, at least by some plain reference to the other class of property which the statute makes subject to forfeiture. Cornelius, Search and Seizure (2d <em>ed.) s. </em>202. If, as alleged, the warrant in this case related only to gambling implements, seizure of the teletypewriter was not authorized. See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>The People, </em>193 Ill. 635, 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The proceedings must be returned to the Superior Court for determination of the facts relating to the complaint and warrant. If they are found to be correctly described by the claimant\u2019s motion, the motion should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
