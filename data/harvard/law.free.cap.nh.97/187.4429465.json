It is not necessary that there should be freedom from doubt and the balance may be only enough to turn the scales.\u201d <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>84 N. H. 455, 457. Applying this test it seems to us that it is probable the testatrix intended that the residue should be divided equally among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>five named legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Only the interpretation of an equal division among these named beneficiaries is consistent with the first direction in the residuary clause and generally when there is equivocation, the interpretation which is consistent with other provisions of the will should be adopted. See <em>Roaf </em>v. <em>Champlin, </em>79 N. H. 219, 224. It is significant that the testatrix knew how to make an unequivocal gift of a full portion to a subsidiary society of the New Hampshire Conference of the Methodist Church when she so desired as evinced by such a gift to the Preacher\u2019s Aid Society which is named separately as a beneficiary. She could have done the same with the \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cForeign\u201d Missions had she so intended. It may also be noted that the word \u201cshares\u201d is used only once. She did not use it when she provided for an equal division among the named legatees though she could easily have said \u201csix equal shares\u201d or used some similar expression to make her desires plain if she wished to give the Conference a full portion for each of the \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cForeign\u201d Missions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Lastly, it may be argued that had she intended a division into six equal parts, she would have made separate paragraphs of the provisions relating to the Conference of the Methodist Church. The words \u201cone share,\u201d when used in connection both with Home Missions and Foreign Missions are not capitalized. It would appear that what followed after the words \u201cTwo shares\u201d was merely explanatory, and was not intended to alter the meaning of the first direction in the residuary clause. This argument is strengthened by the fact that the testatrix knew how to specify the use to which a residuary legatee should put its legacy as shown by the provision, \u201cDeaconess Hospital, Boston, for free beds.\u201d This seems to show that what followed the bequest to the New Hampshire Conference was a statement of the use to which the legacy should be put rather than an indication that the amount should be doubled. It is as though she said, \u201cN. H. Conference of the Methodist Church \u2014 to be divided into two shares: \u2014 one share for Home Missions, one share for Foreign Missions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In conclusion, we believe it may fairly be said that the balance here tips in favor of an equal division among the five named legatees and the probate court is instructed to divide the residue accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Johnston, C.
