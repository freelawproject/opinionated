H. 102. All of these requisites are present in this case. The \u201csettlement and final distribution of estates of deceased persons\u201d (R. L., c. 346, s. 3) is an essential and integral part of its statutory jurisdiction. See <em>In re York Estate, </em>95 N. H. 435, 436. One of the matters duly before this probate court was the proper decision to be made in the distribution of the personal estate bequeathed. <em>In re Rose Estate, </em>95 N. H. 208. \u201cThe personal estate bequeathed by a testator shall be distributed by decree of the judge according to the will.\u201d R. L., c. 360, <em>s. </em>7. Since the probate judge could not allow a final account or approve a petition for a decree of distribution without first construing the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>involved in this proceeding <em>(Amoskeag Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>96 N. H. 89), it logically follows that the question of law certified by him sufficiently indicated that he desired instructions for the proper decision of matters duly before him. <em>In re Mooney Estate, </em>decided this day. See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>96 N. H. 216, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The phrase \u201cto the representatives of those not living ... in equal shares\u201d in the sixth clause of the will was not a crystal clear expression of the mode of distribution by which the representatives were to take under the will as many will cases have demonstrated. Anno. 13 A. L. R. (2d) 1023. Although the phrase was \u201cnot expressed with verbal precision\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>79 N. H. 69), a reasonable construction of it is not difficult when considered with the will as a whole. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Tamworth, </em>96 N. H. 223, 227. The principal objects of the testatrix\u2019 bounty were her two children and her granddaughter. The granddaughter was a young girl at the time the will was executed and the testatrix \u201cmust have realized\u201d that she might \u201coutlive\u201d all of her children and brothers and sisters \u2014 \u201cwhich she has done.\u201d <em>Romprey </em>v. <em>Brothers, </em>95 N. H. 258, 261. Here, as in the cited case, the testatrix \u201cknew that final distribution might be in the distant future and that [she] could not foresee who the legal heirs might be.\u201d At this point in the sixth clause of the will she was disposing of her property \u201cwhen all the people in whom the [testatrix] is primarily interested are out of the picture. . . .\u201d Casner, Construction of Gifts to \u201cHeirs\u201d and the Like. 53 Harv. L. Rev. 207, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cIn the ordinary use of language distribution by right of representation, or, as it is more technically called, per stirpes, is opposed to distribution in equal shares among persons, or per capita. Some way of reconciling these expressions must be discovered, or one of them must be rejected and given no effect. The latter course is never adopted except as a last resort. . . In this case we think it easy to reconcile them. In our opinion, the words \u2018in equal shares by right of representation\u2019 mean per stirpes, with equality among the stirpes.\u201d <em>Bradlee </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>318 Mass. 117, 119. Similar language has been construed in like manner in several wills in this state. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>69 N. H. 206; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>79 N. H. 69; <em>Conant </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>93 N. H. 398. See <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>93 N. H. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Since Almeda Goyscan predeceased the testatrix without heirs in the descending line, her interest lapsed by virtue of R. L., <em>c. 350, s. </em>12; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Tamworth, </em>96 N. H. 223. Consequently the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>due which passes under the sixth clause should be divided into five parts which is as many parts as there were brothers and sisters of the testatrix. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra. </em>The representatives of each of the deceased brothers and sisters will take one of such parts and share it per stirpes. Such a distribution gives full effect to all the language of the sixth clause of the will and is consistent with the equality of treatment which appears throughout the whole will which bequeathed property first to children, then to grandchildren and finally to collateral relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-6\">Johnston, C.
