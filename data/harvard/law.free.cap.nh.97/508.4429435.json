That is the only question for you to decide.\u201d Revised Laws, chapter 447, section 6 provides that \u201cNo person shall keep any house, shop, or place resorted to for the purpose of gambling <em>. . . .\u201d </em>The basis of the exception here seems to be that the Trial Court took from the jury the question of fact whether the respondents did keep a place resorted to for the purpose of gambling. This, we believe, was the effect of the charge and, therefore, the exception is well-founded. The word \u201ckeep\u201d implies a series of acts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>33 N. H. 212, 214; 51 C. J. S. 425, 426. So too, the words \u201cresorted to\u201d taken in their usual sense (R. L., <em>c. </em>7, s. 2) mean that the place was habitually or frequently used. <em>The Leme, </em>77 F. Supp. 773, 777; 77 C. J. S., Resort, 315, 316. When these words are used together as here, we believe the intent of the Legislature is unmistakable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cieri, </em>128 Conn. 149. While there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the respondents kept a place resorted to for gambling, the jury should have been allowed to pass on this question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The respondents also excepted to the testimony of a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>that they and eleven other persons who were present at their place, the Blue Jay Social Club, to which they allegedly resorted for gambling, were arrested. The record shows that the officer was merely testifying as to what happened in the course of a raid in which he participated, and as such the evidence was proper. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>90 N. H. 438, 440, 441. This testimony was relevant as corroborative of the respondents\u2019 presence at the club at the time of their arrest. The State is proceeding under R. L., c. 447, s. 6, which makes it an offense to keep a place resorted to for gambling. Section 9 of the same chapter requires that all persons found present at such a place \u201cshall be taken before a magistrate and there dealt with according to law.\u201d It was proper for the State to show that the persons present were taken into custody, pursuant to section 9, as bearing on the integrity of its case. Whether this competent evidence should have been excluded as tending to excite undue prejudice was a question of fact for the Trial Court and the exception must be overruled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Iacavone, </em>85 N. H. 207, 210. This appears to dispose of all exceptions of merit and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
