We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>are of the opinion that such rights are personal and expire upon the death of the dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Section 20 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Laws of 1947, 'c. 266) provides in part as follows: \u201cIf death results from the injury, the employer shall pay to, or for the dependent ... of the deceased employee, as defined in section 1, for a period of not exceeding three hundred weeks, a weekly compensation.\u201d This section (paragraph II) also provides that in case of remarriage of a widow without dependent children, \u201ccompensation payments shall cease.\u201d Under paragraph IV, if the deceased employee leaves no dependents, the employer is required to pay the expenses of burial. By section 1 VII, dependents are defined as those persons within specified degrees of relationship to the deceased \u201cwho were wholly or partially dependent in fact upon the earnings of the employee for support at the time of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The statute is clearly designed to provide a source of support for persons who would otherwise have relied upon the employee had he lived. It specifically provides for \u201cweekly\u201d payments <em>(Bolduc </em>v. <em>Company, </em>96 N. H. 235, 239) and establishes the period for which the payments shall extend as \u201cnot exceeding three hundred weeks\u201d .in contrast to the statute prior to 1947 which provided for a lump sum payment computed at its maximum at one hundred fifty times the average weekly earnings of the deceased employee. B. L., c. 216, s. 20. Such provisions emphasize the intention of the Legislature to provide payments regularly for the support of those dependent \u201cat the time of the injury\u201d during a period not fixed inflexibly but limited to a maximum number of weeks. By other terms of the statute, \u201cclaims for compensation . . . shall not be assignable; and the compensation . . . shall be exempt from all claims of creditors\u201d except those of a certain class not material in this case (s. 42). Were the right to the compensation payments deemed to survive to the dependent\u2019s estate, the balance of the payments after the decease of the dependent would go to his estate and there be subject to the claims of creditors. Furthermore, as part of the estate of the dependent, distribution of the compensation after payment of debts and expenses of the estate would be made to persons not dependent upon the deceased employee and therefore not entitled to receive the benefits of the statute. The fact that the remarriage of a dependent widow terminates the right to compensation payments by the terms of the statute underlines the personal quality of her rights. In our view that such rights do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>not survive to the dependent\u2019s estate, we are supported by the great weight of authority. See collection of annotations. 15 A. L. R. 821; 24 A. L. R. 441; 29 A. L. R. 1426; 51 A. L. R. 1446; 87 A. L. R. 864; 95 A. L. R. 254. The cases to the contrary cited by the plaintiffs are based on statutes decidedly different from the statute of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">The plaintiffs further claim that the rights of the widow\u2019s estate do not rest upon the statute alone but also upon the agreement for compensation entered into between her and the defendant. This agreement was made on a form provided by the Bureau of Labor and states \u201cthat the said Molly C. Lippman shall receive compensation at the rate of $25.00 per week ... for 300 weeks from Oct. 16, 1947.\u201d It further specifically provides that it must have the approval of the Commissioner of Labor and may be subject to review by the Superior Court as provided in section 38 of the law. Section 34 of the act provides in effect that if an agreement in regard to compensation is made, a memorandum thereof shall be filed with the Commissioner of Labor who shall approve such agreement only when the terms thereof conform to the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. It further provides that such agreements, after approval, are subject to modification (s. 38) and enforcement (s. 40). The agreement before us was not a lump sum settlement under section 31 but was intended to comply with the statute and was expressly made subject to its provisions. It was in the nature of an agreed award (s. 34) subject to modification under section 38. It must therefore be considered to provide for compensation for a period \u201cnot exceeding three hundred weeks\u201d (s. 20) rather than for three hundred weeks certain. The rights of the sole dependent of a deceased employee which are personal under the statute do not survive to the dependent\u2019s estate by reason of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The answer to the question transferred is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
