This action was within the scope of the attorney\u2019s authority <em>(Barry </em>v. <em>Bartis, </em>85 N. H. 202) and under our decisions it binds Dubuque. <em>Burtman </em>v. <em>Butman, </em>94 N. H. 412. The question before us, therefore, is whether the defendant O\u2019Connor had such an interest in the garage building that the lien could attach. We believe that he did and it follows that the lien thus secured takes precedence over Dubuque\u2019s mortgages. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Association, </em>90 N. H. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">It is undisputed that the defendant borrowed the money to build the garage and that it was erected on Dubuque\u2019s land with his assent. The defendant used his own lumber, took complete charge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>construction, named it \u201cJack\u2019s Garage\u201d and planned to run it, as Dubuque \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be in the business anyway.\u201d Evidence was introduced without objection that O\u2019Connor told a witness while it was being built, \u201cMr. Dubuque has nothing to do with it, the garage belongs to me.\u201d It also appears that the mortgages contained provisions that the heating plant and compressor which were installed in the garage were subject to any prior liens in the seller. Under these circumstances the Court was not only warranted in finding an implied agreement that the building remain O\u2019Connor\u2019s property (36 C. J. S. 921, 922) but it may fairly be said that such an understanding was \u201calmost necessarily implied.\u201d See <em>Dame </em>v. <em>Dame, </em>38 N. H. 429, 433. Again, the Court could reasonably find here that the equitable rights of O\u2019Connor were not extinguished by the mere fact that the garage was built on Dubuque\u2019s land, and upon this finding rule that the lien attached to these rights. <em>Cf. Marston </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>60 N. H. 112. In either event, the lien on the building was valid and the exceptions of the defendant O\u2019Connor and the intervenor Dubuque relative thereto must be overruled. There being no others of merit, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
