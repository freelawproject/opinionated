H. 82, and cases cited. The decision in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Estabrook, </em>68 N. H. 349, where agreements existed similar to those here is not authority for the defendants\u2019 position. There the broker was allowed to recover his agreed commission of $100 from a payment of $200 under a liquidated damages clause. However, the court was careful to say \u201cThere is no suggestion in the present case that the purchaser, Marston, was not pecuniarily responsible and able to answer according to his contract. When the vendor accepts the purchaser and enters into a contract with him, the solvency of the purchaser is to be presumed in the absence of proof.\u201d <em>Id., </em>350. In the case before us there is evidence which the Court could reasonably believe flatly rebutting any presumption of the buyers\u2019 solvency. The agreement of the parties and their practical construction of it warrants the conclusion that the commission was to be payable only upon performance of the purchaser\u2019s undertaking. Furthermore the facts compel no finding of any waiver or estoppel in favor of the defendants. <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>94 N. H. 474, and cases cited; <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Dublin Lake Club, </em>89 N. H. 87, 90.
