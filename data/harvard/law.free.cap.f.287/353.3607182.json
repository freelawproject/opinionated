Because of her possession of the same liquors, a prosecution was subsequently instituted against her in the United States court for a violation of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305). She objected that the state conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>was a bar to the federal prosecution. United States v. Lanza et al., 43 Sup. Ct. 141, 67 L.
