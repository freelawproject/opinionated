Had plaintiff made to its injured employ\u00e9the payments in question on account of a common-law liability therefor, it would clearly have a right of action over against the manufacturer the breach of whose warranty directly and proximately caused the injury. This proposition is too thoroughly established to justify numerous citations. We content ourselves with referring to the following which are cited by plaintiff, all of which are directly in point: Dushane v. Benedict, 120 U. S. 630, 636, 7 Sup. Ct. 696, 30 L. Ed. 810; Washington Gaslight Co. v. District of Columbia, 161 U. S. 316, 327 et seq., 16 Sup. Ct. 564, 40 L. Ed. 712; Boston Woven Hose, etc., Co. v. Kendall, 178 Mass. 232, 236, 237, 59 N. E. 657, 51 L. R. A. 781, 86 Am. St. Rep. 478; Travelers Ins. Co. v. Great Lakes Engineering Co. (C. C. A. 6) 184 Fed. 426. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>431, 107 C. C. A. 20, 36 L,. R. A. (N. S.) 60. The latter case does not fail of application from the fact that the action there was by the insurer against the representative of the insured, the negligence of which representative made the insured liable for the death of its employ\u00e9. The underlying principle which sustained the insurer\u2019s right of action was that the employer had itself a right of action, the plaintiff therein being merely subrogated to the rights of the insured. At the common law, as well as under the Sales Act, the defendant here would, under the facts stated, be liable to all damages which directly and proximately resulted from the breach of warranty of the machine sold. To our minds the loss suffered by plaintiff on account of the statutory liability to its employ\u00e9 was no less direct and proximate than would be a liability at common law for negligence. The loss certainly has not failed of being proximate through the intervention of some unlooked-for element.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">By electing to take the benefit of the provision referred to plaintiff was absolutely bound, as matter of law, to compensate its employ\u00e9 for his injury. A payment of compensation absolutely required by law, and because it is so imperatively required, can scarcely be other than a proximate and direct loss. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how a liability could be more proximate, more direct and more immediate than one so created. Whatever might be the result had the payments been made out of the general funds in the possession of the Industrial Commission, created by contributions from employers generally \u2014 in the instant case plaintiff, and plaintiff alone, directly and immediately was subjected to a fixed legal liability for a loss in fact occasioned solely through the breach of the warranty in question. The sequence of cause and effect is clear. It is no answer to say that plaintiff need not have elected to make payments directly to its employ\u00e9. It had so elected, and was bound by that election. When the injury occurred it was impossible to escape liability. The fact that the damages incurred by plaintiff through the payment of compensation under the act were special, rather than general, does not prevent their being the proximate result of the breach of warranty. Upon the proposition that plaintiff\u2019s loss incurred under the workmen\u2019s compensation act was the proximate result of the breach of defendant\u2019s warranty, the case of Mowbray v. Merryweather [1895] 2 Q. B. Div. 640, is ill point, notwithstanding the English act gives the employer a right of action against a tort-feasor who causes injury to a workman, and notwithstanding, under the English act, negligence of the employer seems necessary to recovery by the employ\u00e9. The action in Mowbray v. Merryweather was for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Nor can we in principle see anything to distinguish the right of recovery over in the instant case from the right existing at common law. The mere fact that in the instant case the employ\u00e9\u2019s legal right to compensation for his injuries was not based upon the fault or negligence of the plaintiff should not, on principle, and in the absence of statute providing otherwise, give the employer the less right to remedy over for a breach of defendant\u2019s warranty than were the employer\u2019s liability based on its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Defendant cites in support of the action of the court below the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>case of Interstate Telephone Co. v. Public Service Co., 86 N. J. Law, 26, 90 Atl. 1062. We cannot accept that case as persuasive authority in defendant\u2019s favor. In the first place, it is perhaps open to question whether the case is in point. It was an. action for an injury to plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9 through the act of an independent tort-feasor, on account of which injury plaintiff was liable \"to compensate his employ\u00e9 under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. That case did not involve right of action for breach of warranty. The present case does not involve the action of an independent tort-feasor, as did neither the Travelers\u2019 Insurance Co. Case, supra, nor Mowbray v. Merry-weather, supra. The action here is based entirely on breach of warranty. In the next place, we are not impressed by the proposition, as applied to the instant case, that compensation paid to the employ\u00e9 for an injury suffered must be regarded purely as wages paid to that employ\u00e9, on the theory that the loss to the employer represents the value of the services of the'employ\u00e9 to him, and thus a part of the compensation Lor services rendered for which the employer receives an equivalent. True, the theory of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts is that the industry should bear the losses due to the employ\u00e9s\u2019 injuries, and that is the reason for making the employer liable to a stated and certain compensation, regardless of negligence; but the fact remains, as applicable here, that the employer is subject to a direct and complete loss to which he would not have been subjected, but' for the breach of defendant\u2019s warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The proposition that plaintiff is seeking to recover by virtue of the doctrine of subrogation is to our minds a misapprehension of the situation. The cause of action stated in the petition arises directly in favor of the employer by virtue of, defendant\u2019s breach of warranty. It is thus not, in our opinion, important that under Ohio decisions an employ\u00e9 injured in the course of his employment by the wrongful act of a third person may maintain an action against such third person, unaffected either in amount of recovery or otherwise by the fact that he has received compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. We think it immaterial to the issues before us whether or not plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9 himself has a right of recovery against the defendant on the ground of the latter\u2019s negligence. That question is not before us. In the absence of statutory provision, as well as of controlling or persuasive authority to the contrary, we are constrained to hold that the petition in the instant case stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and the record remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
