The Saw Company defended as to a great part of the unpaid purchase price, and counterclaimed for recovery of what had already been paid, upon the ground that most of the steel was worthless for the intended use. Defendant also claimed damages for interruption to its business and loss of profits. The defendant\u2019s evidence would have supported a finding that 92 per cent, of the steel, including that paid for and that not paid for, was valueless. The plaintiff had a verdict for about $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The evidence offered to show defendant\u2019s loss of profits in support of the counterclaim did not with sufficient competence tend to show non-speculative profits, and was properly rejected. Central Co. v. Hartman (C. C. A. 8) 111 Fed. 96, 98, 49 C. C. A. 244; and see Hollweg v. Schaefer Co. (C. C. A. 6) 197 Fed. 689, 701, 117 C. C. A. 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the course of charging the jury, it was told in effect that if the defendant\u2019s full claim as to the bad quality of the steel was established, defendant would be liable for 92 per cent, of the amount involved. This was doubtless an inadvertent reference to defendant in the main suit, instead of to the plaintiff, which was defendant in the counterclaim. Other parts of the charge would perhaps have left it fairly clear that this was a mere inadvertence, and that the jury would not be misled. However, defendant\u2019s counsel promptly called it to the court\u2019s attention, asking that the correction be made. For some reason, which the record does not malee clear, the confusion persisted, and the mistaken substitution of \u201cdefendant\u201d for \u201cplaintiff\u201d in stating the respective rights of the parties was repeat\u00e9d. This was the last thing said to the jury, and it was necessarily so impressed on their minds as to be likely to supersede any previous more general instructions which did not involve this reversal of parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The verdict was apparently a compromise. It is quite impossible t&lt;&gt; find from the record that reasonable probability that the jury was not misled, which would be necessary to make the error nonprejudicial under section 269, Judicial Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 1246); indeed, there is a fair inference to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
