King, Treasurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The petition alleged that a certified copy of the following resolution referred to in said note was attached thereto at the time of the execution thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">\u201cWhereas, Wilcox county, 6a., desires to borrow the .sum of $20,000 for a perio'd of six months, from September 2, 1917, and at a rate of interest not exceeding eight per cent, per annum; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">\u201cWhereas said money is to be borrowed for the purpose of defraying expenses of said county in anticipation of collection of taxes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">\u201cNow, therefore, be it resolved, by the commissioners of roads and revenues of said Wilcox county, 6a., that the chairman of said commissioners of roads and revenues of Wilcox county, 6a., be authorized, empowered, and instructed, and he is hereby expressly authorized, empowered, and instructed, to borrow the sum of twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars for said Wilcox county, 6a., the same to be due and payable six months from September 2, 1917, and at a rate of interest not exceeding eight per cent, per annum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">\u201cBe it further resolved by the said commissioners of roads and revenues of said Wilcox county, 6a., that to better secure the payment of said sum, together with any interest that may accrue thereon after maturity, the chairman of said commissioners of roads and revenues is hereby expressly authorized, empowered and instructed to execute the said county of Wilcox\u2019s note therefor, according to the terms mentioned above, and to pledge the faith, credit, and resources of said Wilcox county, 6a., to the punctual payment of said note, together with any interest that may accrue thereon after maturity, according to the above-mentioned terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-12\">\u201cI hereby certify that the above is a true and correct copy of a resolution passed by the commissioners of roads and revenues of Wilcox county, 6a., at a meeting held the 29th day of August, 1917.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-13\">\u201c[Seal.] N.

The ruling on the demurrer is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">The following is a provision of section 7 of article 7 of the Constitution of Georgia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-17\">\u201cParagraph 1. <em>Debt of Counties and Cities Not to Exceed Seven Per </em>Cent. The debt hereafter incurred by any county, municipal corporation, or political division of this state, except as in this Constitution provided for, shall not exceed seven per centum of the assessed value of all the taxable property therein, and no such county, municipality, or division\u2019 shall incur any new debt, except for a temporary loan or loans to supply casual deficiencies of revenue, not to exceed one-fifth of one per centum of the assessed value of taxable property therein, without the assent of two-thirds of the qualified voters thereof, at an election for that purpose, to be held as may be prescribed by law; but any city, the debt of which does not exceed seven per centum of the assessed value of the taxable property at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, may be authorized by law to increase, at any\u2019 time, the amount of said debt, three per centum upon such assessed valuation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Under the above set out constitutional provision, a county, unless authorized by an election as stated, cannot incur any new debt, \u201cexcept for a temporary loan or loans to supply casual deficiencies of revenue, not to exceed one-fifth of one per centum of the assessed value of taxable property therein.\u201d The expression \u201ccasual deficiencies of revenue,\u201d as used in the above-quoted provision, means unforeseen or unexpected deficiencies of revenue, brought about, after the levy of taxes' for a year, by casual and unanticipated causes. Lewis v. Lofley, 92 Ga. 804, 19 S. E. 57; Commercial Trust Co. v. Laurens County (D. C.) 267 Fed. 901. The petition contains no allegation as to an election or as to a casual deficiency of revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In behalf of the plaintiff in error it is contended that the recital contained in the note sued on has the effect of estopping the county to deny that a casual deficiency of revenue existed or that there had been an election authorizing the creation of the debt which the note purports to evidence. The county was not so estopped by such recital, if the instrument sued on disclosed the circumstances under which it was executed, and that the borrowing it purported to evidence was not constitutionally authorized under the circumstances so disclosed. The test is: What does the instrument as a whole disclose ? \u2019 The taker of the note is chargeable with notice of the contents of the resolution, a certified copy of which was attached to the note at the time it was executed. Chaffee County v. Potter, 142 U. S. 355, 364, 12 Sup. Ct. 216, 35 L. Ed. 1040; Waite v. Santa Cruz, 184 U. S. 302, 316, 22 Sup. Ct. 327, 46 L. Ed. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The resolution specifies the purpose for which the money was to be borrowed, namely, \u201cfor the purpose of defraying expenses of said county in anticipation of collection of taxes.\u201d The resolution does not purport to show that the borrowing was authorized by an election or by the existence of a casual deficiency of revenue. One having the resolution before him could not be deceived thereby into believing that the action of the county authorities in authorizing the borrowing of the money and the execution of the note was based on anything in addition to what was stated in the resolution. The resolution plainly indicates that the action it evidenced was taken without any regard to the constitutional limitation on the county\u2019s power to borrow money, and that the taking of that action was influenced by the unwarranted assumption that, without qualification or condition, the county was empowered to borrow the amount stated \u201cfor the purpose of defraying expenses of said county in anticipation of collection of taxes.\u201d It further discloses that the authority undertaken to be conferred on the chairman of the body which passed the resolution did not include authority to make the recital in the note sued on which is relied on as having the effect of estopping the county. So far as appears, no one having authority to speak for the county made any statement or representation, other than what was embodied in the resolution, as to the circumstances under which the note sued on was executed or attempted to be authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The plaintiff could not properly have been influenced to take the note by the recital claimed to have been relied on, as the attached resolution showed that the signer of the note, in embodying such re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>cital therein; exceeded the authority under which he acted. Where the authority of an agent is disclosed, his principal is not bound by what the agent says or does beyond the scope of the authority conferred. Citizens\u2019 Bank of Moultrie v. Rockdale County, 152 Ga. 711, 720, 111 S. E. 434. The note, considered in connection with the resolution, a copy of which was attached, does not disclose a state of facts under which it had the effect of creating or evidencing an obligation binding on thie county, and it does not show that any one having authority to do so represented in behalf of the county that such a state of facts existed when the resolution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">' As the petition does not show either that the note sued on evidenced a constitutional borrowing of the amount promised to be paid, or that the county had estopped itself to require proof of a compliance with the constitutional requirement, it must be regarded as failing to show a right to recover on that instrument. It follows that the ruling complained of was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
