The petitioner commenced this proceeding seeking maintenance arrears and an order directing the respondent to resume payments pursuant to the terms of the stipulation and the judgment of divorce. The respondent contended that the parties had agreed that extra payments he made directly to the petitioner and to third parties on her behalf would be credited against his future maintenance obligations. According to the respondent, and as found by the Support Magistrate, those extra payments exceeded $96,000, the total amount of maintenance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">There is sufficient support in the record for the Support Magistrate\u2019s finding that the petitioner agreed to this arrangement, based on the two revised maintenance payment schedules the petitioner signed on October 29, 2001 and October 25, 2002, respectively, as well as the testimony by both parties that she consistently accepted the additional money without protest. While the petitioner claimed that she did not sign these documents voluntarily, the Support Magistrate was presented with an issue of credibility, and the documents and the testimony support the Support Magistrate\u2019s determination that there was no coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>However, the evidence in the record supports the petitioner\u2019s contention that the respondent\u2019s payment of $25,467.55 to Bryn Mawr College was for the daughter\u2019s educational expenses incurred prior to March 23, 1998, the date of the stipulation, pursuant to which the petitioner became responsible for such expenses. Therefore, the respondent was not entitled to a credit for any of that amount, because at the time, it was not the petitioner\u2019s obligation. As it is unclear from the record whether the Support Magistrate improperly credited the respondent with any or all of this payment, the matter should have been remanded to the Support Magistrate <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 439 [e]) to determine the amount of the improper credit, if any. If, as a result, the amount of extra payments and maintenance paid was less than $96,000, the total amount of the respondent\u2019s maintenance obligation, the petitioner is entitled to an award of arrears in the amount of the difference and the objection should be sustained to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit <em>(see Matter of Gambacorta v Gambacorta, </em>45 AD3d 839 [2007]). Mastro, J.P., Fisher, Dillon and McCarthy, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
