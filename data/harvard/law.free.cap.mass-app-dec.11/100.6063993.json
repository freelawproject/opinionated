Nash, </em>S. J.) upon the answer in abatement, defendant testified that at the time of the commencement of the action he lived in Andover and was employed by a corporation having a usual place of business in Stoneham.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Defendant\u2019s answer in abatement was overruled, no grounds for the action being given. The propriety of this ruling is the only question raised by defendant and now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Conceivably two reasons were in the court\u2019s mind as grounds for overruling the answer in abatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">1. The answer was defective in failing to state defendant\u2019s actual residence and the court where the case should have been brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">2. The place where defendant worked in Stone-ham was his place of business within the meaning of G. L. c. 223, \u00a72.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\"><em>As to ground No. </em>1, there is an ancient doctrine that one who answers in abatement\u2014which is a dilatory plea,\u2014shall give plaintiff \"a better writ.\u201d That is to say, he shall supply information to plaintiff whereby the latter may correct his writ. This doctrine, however, appears not to apply to answers in abatement where venue is the issue. C. J. S. 41. <em>Scott v. Waller, 65 </em>Ill. 181 was an action on a note to which a plea in abatement was filed representing that defendant was not a resident of the court whence the process issued as required by the statute. The court said in ordering that the writ be quashed, \"An objection is made by appellees to the plea. They claim it is a plea to the jurisdiction of the court and should have pointed to some court which had jurisdiction. It is not a plea to the jurisdiction of the court but in abatement of the writ only, founded on the fact alleged in it that the plaintiffs were not residents of the county whence it issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The above case is cited with approval in <em>Gemmill v. Smith, </em>274 Ill. 87, 90, and in <em>Winn v. Vogel, </em>345 Ill. App. 425, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>In <em>Second National Bank v. Leary, </em>284 Mass. 381, the answer in abatement asserted a \"misjoinder of defendants.\u201d The answer was overruled since, as the court said, no question of fact was raised by it and it therefore was not properly an <em>answer in </em>abatement. In any event, there was no question of venue at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In other words, the form of the answer in the case before us was not of itself adequate ground for the court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\"><em>As to the second point, </em>the simple issue is whether defendant\u2019s employment by a corporation in Stone-ham constituted his \"having a usual place of business\u201d in that town.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">G. 3L, c. 223, \u00a72, reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\". . . Except as provided in Section 21, Chapter 218 and except as provided in this section, a transitory action in a district court shall be brought in the county where one of the defendants lives or has his usual place of business . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">(Neither \u00a721 nor any other part of \u00a72 itself bears upon this case.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">In <em>Hanley v. Eastern Steamship Corp., </em>221 Mass. 125 at 132, where the language was similar to \u00a72 above, the court traced the history of the statutes controlling that case and analogous cases. It pointed out, among other things, that an earlier statute had added the phrase \"trade or calling\u201d to the words \"usual place of business\u201d and that this added phrase was later eliminated on revision of the statutes. The court, concluding that the omission was significant, held that an assistant manager of a store in Boston did not, by reason of that employment, have \"a usual place of business\u201d in Suffolk County. It said at pages 132, 133:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">\"It follows that the words used in our statute in the light of its history do not include a place where one pursues a 'trade or calling.\u2019 The work of the plaintiff and the intestate in a department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>store comes rather within the description of 'trade or calling\u2019 than 'place of business.\u2019 It is employment as distinguished from business. Therefore, the venue of these actions was laid improperly in Suffolk County. They should have been brought either in the county of the residence, which was Norfolk, or where the alleged act of neglect occurred, which was Essex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AVz\">A. <em>W. </em>Wunderly, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ash\">Arthur J. Travers, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In <em>Industrial Bankers v. Reid, Murdock &amp; Co., </em>297 Mass. 119, 124, a case originally argued in this court on appeal from the District Court and on subsequent appeal in the Supreme Judicial Court, the interpretation of the phrase \"transacts his business\u201d was considered. There the individual involved was a meat cutter employed in a store in Belmont. The court again reviewed the history of the pertinent legislation and concluded that the meat cutter did not \"transact his business\u201d in Belmont, citing <em>Hanley v. Eastern Steamship Corp., </em>221 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The above cases, in our opinion, control the case before us. Defendant did not have \"a usual place of business\u201d in Stoneham. It was merely his place of employment. If, as might appear, the court overruled the plea on the ground that this employment constituted a place of business, this, in our opinion, was error. The answer in abatement is to be sustained, the writ abated and the proceedings dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
