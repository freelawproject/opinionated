The siting board granted the Middletown Coke Company a certificate to build a \u201ccogeneration station,\u201d which is part of an integrated industrial facility that will produce both purified coal and electricity. The city of Monroe, which borders the project site, appeals from that order on four grounds, mainly relating to whether the siting board erred in refusing to exercise jurisdiction over portions of the facility used to generate electricity and also to produce coke.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">{\u00b6 2} We agree with Monroe and hold that the siting board erred in determining the scope of its jurisdiction. The siting board\u2019s ruling unreasonably denied Monroe an opportunity to test the company\u2019s assertion that its preferred location \u2014 a half-mile from Monroe\u2019s neighborhoods and 1,200 feet from a school\u2014 poses the \u201cminimum adverse environmental impact\u201d under R.C. 4906.10(A)(3). Accordingly, we reverse the order and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">I. Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">\n<em>A. The Siting Board\u2019s Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">{\u00b6 3} In Ohio, a \u201cmajor utility facility\u201d may not be built without the approval of the Power Siting Board. R.C. 4906.04. Under R.C. 4906.01(B)(1), a \u201cmajor utility facility\u201d includes \u201c[ejlectric generating plant[s] and associated facilities designed for, or capable of, operation at a capacity of fifty megawatts or more.\u201d The parties agree that some part of the proposed project constitutes an \u201celectric generating plant\u201d but disagree as to what extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\n<em>B. Middletcnm Coke\u2019s Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 4} The applicant in this case, the Middletown Coke Company, manufactures coke, a purified form of coal used in steel-making. The company optioned a 250-acre site in Middletown, Ohio, near the city of Monroe, where it intends to produce both coke and electricity. The coke will be supplied to the adjacent AK Steel Middletown Works, and the electricity will be used or sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 5} Because it will produce over 50 megawatts of power, the project required siting board approval. R.C. 4906.01(B)(1) and 4906.04. On April 21, 2008, the company notified the siting board of its intent to build, and on June 6, it filed its application to build what it termed \u201cthe cogeneration station.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 6} As explained in the application, the cogeneration process begins when coal is \u201cbaked\u201d in ovens to make coke, and the baking process produces superheated gases, which must be cooled to remove pollutants. Devices called \u201cheat recovery steam generators\u201d cool these gases and, as the name implies, generate steam. By channeling this steam into a generation turbine, what began as waste heat becomes electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 7} The company defined the cogeneration station (and thus limited the application) to include only the electricity-producing turbine and related apparatus, such as cooling towers and control equipment. The application, however, excluded the equipment that burned coal and produced steam \u2014 that is, the coke ovens and heat recovery steam generators. With the coal-burning equipment excluded, the company listed the cogeneration station as a \u201czero emission\u201d project.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\n<em>C. The Siting Board\u2019s Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">{\u00b6 8} Before it approves construction of any major utility facility, the siting board must determine that the facility \u201crepresents the minimum adverse environmental impact.\u201d R.C. 4906.10(A)(3). In addition, the siting board\u2019s rules require applicants to provide a detailed explanation of the process used to select the proposed site and a description of alternative sites. Ohio Adm.Code 4906-13-03 (\u201cSite alternatives analyses\u201d) and R.C. 4906.06(A)(4) (requiring applicants to explain \u201cwhy the proposed location is best suited for the facility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">{\u00b6 9} Middletown Coke sought and was granted a waiver from the requirement to develop an alternative-site analysis. The company reasoned, and the siting board agreed, that the location of the cogeneration station depended on \u201cthe location of the coke manufacturing facility, which is not required to undergo a formal site selection study.\u201d In accordance with this waiver, the application\u2019s description of the site-selection process consisted of one paragraph explaining that the location of the cogeneration station was \u201cconstrained by the need to be adjacent to the energy source, which is the coke facility.\u201d The application did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>explain whether the company had considered other sites for the entire project (that is, including the coke facility) or how it settled on the location chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<em>D. Intervention of Monroe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 10} The site selected by Middletown Coke borders the city of Monroe and lies a half-mile from the city\u2019s residential neighborhoods and about 1,200 feet from a school. On September 12, 2008, Monroe filed a motion to intervene, opposing the application. It asserted that the source of steam for the project (the coke ovens and heat recovery steam generators) would annually emit over 2,700 tons of air pollutants and up to 160 pounds of mercury. The city stated that construction of the facility had not yet begun and that \u201cit makes no more sense to disregard the source of steam for this Project than to disregard the combustion sources for a new coal-fired utility.\u201d On this basis, it asked the siting board to review the environmental impact of the entire facility, including the land and facilities used to produce coke, and to consider alternative sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 11} The siting board allowed the city of Monroe to intervene but disclaimed \u201cjurisdiction over any permits for construction of the coke plant.\u201d This disclaimer set a pattern. Over the months that followed, Monroe frequently attempted to bring the full project within the scope of the siting board\u2019s review, and the siting board consistently denied that it had jurisdiction to review the environmental impact or location of \u201cthe coke plant.\u201d On that basis and to that extent, the board disallowed Monroe\u2019s discovery requests, its questions on cross-examination, and its proffered evidence. For example, the siting board would not consider testimony that nearby residents and schoolchildren were downwind of the plant and \u201clikely to be exposed to air-borne particulate and toxic air pollutants,\u201d \u201cdaily increases\u201d of which \u201care followed by increases in the number of people who die from respiratory and cardiovascular causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>E. The Administrative Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 12} On October 30, 2008, Middletown Coke and the siting board\u2019s staff filed a stipulation recommending that the board approve the application. A hearing followed, and on January 26, 2009, the siting board issued an opinion and order approving the stipulation and granting the certificate for construction of the cogeneration facility. The order, consistent with prior rulings, disclaimed jurisdiction over land and facilities used in coke production.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 13} The city of Monroe sought rehearing, which the siting board denied on March 23, 2009. Monroe has appealed, and Middletown Coke has intervened in support of appellee, the siting board.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AI8\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A76\">{\u00b6 14} Pursuant to R.C. 4906.12, this court must apply the standard of review to power-siting determinations that it applies to orders of the Public Utilities Commission. <em>Chester Twp. v. Power Siting Comm. </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 231, 238, 3 O.O.3d 367, 361 N.E.2d 436. \u201cR.C. 4903.13 applies to board proceedings pursuant to R.C. 4906.12 and provides that an order \u2018shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds the order to be unlawful or unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Application of Am. Transm. Sys., Inc., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 333, 2010-Ohio-1841, 928 N.E.2d 427, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 50. We have \u201c \u2018complete and independent power of review as to all questions of law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d in appeals from the board. <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 362, 2009-Ohio-604, 904 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 15} Monroe offers four reasons for reversing the siting board. All favor the city if the siting board erred in determining the scope of its jurisdiction. For the following reasons, we agree with the city that the siting board erred and accordingly reverse the order and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>B. Error in the Board\u2019s Scope of Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhYh\">{\u00b6 16} All the parties agree that some part of the proposed project constitutes \u201celectric generating plant.\u201d No one disputes that the siting board is the agency charged with ensuring that such facilities \u201crepresent ] the minimum adverse environmental impact.\u201d R.C. 4906.10(A)(3). Nevertheless, although the facility is less than a mile from residential neighborhoods and only 1,200 feet from a school, the siting board declined even to consider whether there was another feasible location posing less environmental impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 17} The siting board reached this result by limiting its jurisdictional analysis to whether the contested facilities constituted a \u201ccoke plant.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding that they did, the siting board disclaimed jurisdiction. In resolving the issue this way, the board disregarded the governing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>{\u00b6 18} R.C. 4906.01(B)(1) controls the jurisdictional analysis and grants the siting board jurisdiction over \u201c[ejlectric generating plant[s] and associated facilities designed for, or capable of, operation at a capacity of fifty megawatts or more.\u201d \u201cPlant\u201d means \u201cthe land, buildings, machinery, apparatus, and fixtures employed in carrying on * * * a mechanical or other industrial business.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Ed.1986) 1731. In context, then, the siting board\u2019s jurisdiction extends to land, buildings, and equipment employed in carrying on the business of generating electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 19} The statute\u2019s additional coverage of \u201cassociated facilities\u201d suggests that the term should not be read restrictively. And while the statute provides a jurisdictional cut-off based on capacity (\u201cfifty megawatts or more\u201d), it makes no exception for an electric generating plant and \u201cassociated facilities\u201d that produce more than one commodity. The General Assembly could have modified or limited the siting board\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to cogeneration facilities, but it has not done so, and the statute \u201c \u2018must be applied as written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weiss v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 734 N.E.2d 775, quoting <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clemont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 338, 340, 673 N.E.2d 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 20} The siting board, as far as its orders show, never asked whether the contested land and equipment constituted an \u201celectric generating plant.\u201d It characterized as \u201cthe coke plant\u201d anything used to make coke and then disclaimed jurisdiction, regardless of whether it was also used to generate electricity. The statute, however, <em>grants </em>jurisdiction over \u201celectric generating plant[s]\u201d and does not <em>deny </em>jurisdiction over a \u201ccoke plant.\u201d The question, then, is whether the contested land and facilities constitute an electric generating plant. Concluding that they are \u201cpart of [a] coke plant\u201d does not answer that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 21} The assumption that any given parcel of land or piece of equipment can fit into only one of two categories \u2014 coke plant <em>or </em>electric generating plant \u2014 is false. The siting board has not explained why, as a matter of logic, the same land or equipment cannot be <em>both </em>a coke plant <em>and </em>an electric generating plant. Nor has it cited any legal authority in support of its either-or analysis. Factually, this case demonstrates that the same land and equipment may be used in both processes and thus fit both categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 22} We reverse the siting board\u2019s jurisdictional ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\n<em>C. The Proceedings on Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">{\u00b6 23} The siting board committed the jurisdictional error early in the proceedings. In addition to affecting the scope of its substantive investigation and analysis, the siting board also limited the scope of discovery, cross-examination, and Monroe\u2019s ability to introduce its own evidence into the record. It would be inconsistent with our reviewing function to conduct the requisite jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>analysis in the first instance, particularly in the absence of a developed record. See, e.g., <em>Indus. Energy Users-Ohio v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 486, 2008-Ohio-990, 885 N.E.2d 195, \u00b6 4 (remanding \u201cmatter to the commission for further findings\u201d where \u201crecord [was] not fully developed\u201d); <em>W. Res. Transit Auth. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 16, 19, 68 O.O.2d 9, 313 N.E.2d 811 (matters arising under R.C. Chapter 4905 related to the general powers of the Public Utilities Commission \u201care best heard, in the first instance, as required by law, by the * * * Commission\u201d). Therefore, on remand, the siting board may determine how best to revisit the matters affected by its jurisdictional ruling. Nevertheless, in the interests of judicial economy and to provide guidance on remand, we address the following points of dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">{\u00b6 24} First, at least some of the specific equipment over which the siting board disclaimed jurisdiction may constitute an \u201celectric generating plant\u201d \u2014 that is, equipment to be employed in the business of generating electricity. The siting board analyzed only one category of \u201ccoke plant\u201d equipment in detail: heat recovery steam generators. These steam generators perform at least two tasks. They cool gas produced during the coking process and produce steam \u201cused to generate electricity.\u201d As a company witness testified, \u201cthe cogeneration station can\u2019t operate without steam,\u201d and there is no \u201cother source of steam * * * aside from the steam generated by the * * * steam generators.\u201d Thus, although steam generators play a part in producing coke, they may also be essential to generating electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 25} We leave such questions to the board to resolve in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 26} Furthermore, although the fact that the project will produce a substantial amount of coke does not go to jurisdiction, it could well be relevant to the substantive analysis. R.C. 4906.10(A)(3), for example, requires the siting board to determine \u201c[t]hat the facility represents the minimum adverse environmental impact,\u201d but then tempers this stringent minimum-impact requirement by requiring the siting board to \u201cconsider[ ] the state of available technology and the nature and economics of the various alternatives, and other pertinent considerations.\u201d This statute broadly authorizes the siting board to balance just the sort of concerns raised by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 27} As a result of its erroneous jurisdictional ruling, the siting board never engaged in the balancing of interests required in this case. In any event, these balancing decisions must be \u201crendered] * * * upon the record,\u201d R.C. 4906.10(A), and the siting board\u2019s rulings unreasonably limited Monroe\u2019s opportunities to develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 28} It may well be that the best place for this generation facility is less than a mile from Monroe\u2019s homes and schools, but the city is entitled to test that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>proposition through an effective adversarial proceeding. With a fully developed record and fact-supported explanation, effective judicial review will be possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 29} The order of the Ohio Power Siting Board is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-7\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b490-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b490-9\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. Counsel for the siting board raise one jurisdictional argument that the board did not mention or rely on in its orders below. (We assume, without deciding, that this is appropriate.) Characterizing the city\u2019s appeal as an attack on a decision of the director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the siting board\u2019s counsel argue that decisions on permits regarding the coke plant fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Environmental Review Appeals Commission (\u201cERAC\u201d). See R.C. 3745.04(B). This argument lacks merit. Monroe plainly is not appealing from an action of the Ohio EPA, so ERAC\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction is not implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b490-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A45G\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">(\u00b6 30} I believe that the Power Siting Board has jurisdiction over the cogeneration station (power plant) only. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">{\u00b6 31} SunCoke Energy Inc., which owns Middletown Coke Company, filed an application for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to build a power plant as part of a coke plant adjacent to AK Steel Middletown Works in Butler County. The power plant is to include a steam turbine generator, a steam condensing system, a steam turbine operation and administra-, tive building, cooling towers, and a generator step-up transformer. Heat from the coke plant\u2019s ovens would be converted into steam, which would be used as fuel for the power plant. The board approved SunCoke\u2019s application for the power plant, concluding that the site chosen for the power plant would have \u201cminimum adverse environmental impact,\u201d R.C. 4906.10(A)(3), and would \u201cserve the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d R.C. 4906.10(A)(6). The board did not consider the environmental impact of the proposed coke plant in making this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">{\u00b6 32} The majority holds that the board has jurisdiction to examine the impact of the proposed power plant <em>and </em>the proposed coke plant. Consequently, the majority holds that on remand, the board may consider additional issues, such as whether coke production has an adverse environmental impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">{\u00b6 33} Although we have \u201ccomplete and independent power of review as to all questions of law\u201d in appeals from the siting board, <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922, we \u201cmay rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where \u2018highly specialized issues\u2019 are involved and \u2018where agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 362, 2009-Ohio-604, 904 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 12 O.O.3d 115, 388 N.E.2d 1370. In the instant case, I would defer to the board\u2019s conclusion that it had jurisdiction over the power plant but not the proposed coke plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Coke Plants Are Not \u201cAssociated Facilities\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 34} Pursuant to R.C. 4906.04, the board has jurisdiction over construction of a \u201cmajor utility facility,\u201d which is defined as an \u201c[ejlectric generating plant and associated facilities <em>designed for, </em>or <em>capable of, operation at a capacity of fifty megawatts or more.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4906.01(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 35} The majority reasons, \u201cThe statute\u2019s additional coverage of \u2018associated facilities\u2019 suggests the term should <em>not </em>be read restrictively.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 19. The majority later concludes that the proposed coke plant is an associated facility as defined in R.C. 4906.04(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 36} I believe that the majority takes the term \u201cassociated facilities\u201d out of context. The rule of noscitur a sociis assists in defining the terms \u201celectric generating plant\u201d and \u201cassociated facilities.\u201d The rule of noscitur a sociis, the word \u201c \u2018is known from its associates,\u2019 * * * follows from the premise that \u2018the coupling of words denotes an intention that they should be understood in the same general sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 453, 639 N.E.2d 105, quoting 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer Rev.1992) 183, Section 47.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 37} Applying this rule, I would hold that the phrase \u201cdesigned for, or capable of, operation at a capacity of fifty megawatts or more\u201d modifies both \u201c[e]leetric generating plant\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cassociated facilities.\u201d Thus, contrary to the majority, I would find that \u201cassociated facilities\u201d is a restrictive term, not an expansive term. Specifically, a facility would qualify as an \u201cassociated facility\u201d only if it is \u201cdesigned for\u201d or is \u201ccapable of\u2019 producing electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">{\u00b6 38} In the instant case, the proposed coke plant is <em>not </em>designed for, nor will it be capable of, producing electricity. It is intended to make coke. The heat that is used to create steam as fuel for the power plant is merely a waste product of that process. Thus, I would hold that the proposed coke plant is not an associated facility as defined in R.C. 4906.01(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The EPA Has Jurisdiction over Coke Plants</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">{\u00b6 39} The majority also supports its holding by reasoning that while R.C. 4906.01(B)(1) <em>\u201cgrants </em>jurisdiction over an \u2018electric generating plant,\u2019 \u201d it \u201cdoes not <em>deny </em>jurisdiction over \u2018coke plant[s].\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 20. Consequently, the majority indicates that on remand, the board may consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>environmental impact of the coke plant in deciding whether the power station should be permitted. The majority\u2019s reasoning and the scope of this remand are especially troubling when considered in the context of arguments made by appellant, the city of Monroe, that the proposed coke plant will threaten the \u201cregion\u2019s air quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">{\u00b6 40} The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) regulates coke ovens. R.C. 3704.03(F)(1). See also <em>State ex rel. Sierra Club v. Koncelik, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-643, 2005-Ohio-6477, 2005 WL 3304095, \u00b6 3 (construction of coke ovens requires a permit from the Ohio EPA). Consequently, any consideration by the board regarding the emissions of the proposed coke ovens necessarily intrudes upon the Ohio EPA\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 41} At the hearing before the administrative law judge in the instant case, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 42} F. Joseph Schiavone, an intervenor in the dispute, stated: \u2018Tour Honor, at this time I would ask a continuance of this matter in so much as to proceed at this time would be premature based upon \u2014 two reasons. First of all, the Ohio EPA has yet to rule on Middletown Coke\u2019s Application for permit to install and there is a possibility if this Board were to \u2014 or if this Judge were to grant the permit, construction would begin immediately on this cogeneration plant. And we could find ourselves in a situation with a generation plant without an upstream power source if the Ohio EPA were to find that for whatever reason a permit would not be granted or it would be granted conditionally upon conditions that could not be met by Middletown Coke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 43} M. Howard Petricoff, attorney for Middletown Coke, responded: \u201cYour Honor, the premise on which this motion is based is that the project would have to be ready to go and have approvals from other agencies other than the Power Siting Board before the Power Siting Board could rule. There is no citation in this motion as to any statute, rule, regulation, or other legal requirement that calls for the EPA permit to have been issued or for all the land to be purchased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 44} From this conversation, it is evident that the parties anticipated that the coke plant would be regulated by the Ohio EPA, not the board. Moreover, one of the board members who signed the board\u2019s opinion, order, and certificate considering and approving the power plant only was Christopher Korleski, who is also the director of the Ohio EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 45} The majority\u2019s holding will provide the board the authority to trump the EPA regarding the construction of the proposed coke plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 46} I believe that the majority\u2019s holding expands the board\u2019s jurisdiction beyond what the General Assembly intended and that it encroaches upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Ohio EPA\u2019s jurisdiction to regulate coke ovens. Consequently, I would defer to the board\u2019s decision that it has jurisdiction over the proposed power plant but not the proposed coke plant. Thus, I would affirm the decision of the Power Siting Board. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALk\">Van Kley &amp; Walker, L.L.C., Jack Van Kley, and Christopher A.
