The Court of Appeals for Franklin County upheld that decision and denied Johnson\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus. Johnson now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 2} In the course of the proceedings below, the matter was referred to a magistrate pursuant to Civ.R. 53 and Loc.R. 12(M) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals. The magistrate, in turn, issued a decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law. Johnson filed no objections to this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 3} Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(iii) specifically prohibits a party from \u201cassign[ing] as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any finding of fact or legal conclusion, * * * unless the party timely and specifically objects to that factual finding or legal conclusion as required by Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b).\u201d Johnson\u2019s arguments derive directly from the conclusions of law in the magistrate\u2019s decision, yet she did not object to them. Accordingly, we can proceed no further. <em>State ex rel. Findlay Industries v. Indus. Comm., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 517, 2009-Ohio-1674, 905 N.E.2d 1202; <em>State ex rel. Wilson v. Indus.
