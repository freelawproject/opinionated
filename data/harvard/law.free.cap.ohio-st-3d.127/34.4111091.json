Global further claims that the regulatory language is unconstitutionally void for vagueness, as it fails to clarify definitions such as \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d and \u201ccomputer systems.\u201d Global also challenges the tax imposed on training courses involving routers and switches, which it asserts are not computer equipment; courses involving nontaxable application-software training as opposed to systems-software training; and beginning courses taught to employees who do not, in Global\u2019s view, qualify as \u201ccomputer programmers and operators.\u201d The tax commissioner posits that the constitutional claims presented by Global are not properly raised in this court and that Global has not demonstrated that the decision of the BTA with respect to the other challenges is unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">{\u00b6 3} We lack jurisdiction over Global\u2019s free speech and equal protection claims because Global failed to raise them in its notice of appeal to the BTA, and we lack jurisdiction over its void-for-vagueness claim because Global failed to specify it in its notice of appeal to this court. Regarding its nonconstitutional claims, Global has not demonstrated that the decision of the BTA was unreasonable or unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>except with respect to two courses, which involved nontaxable application-software training, erroneously characterized as taxable by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, except for its decision regarding tax assessed on two courses, the decision of the BTA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 5} According to its Senior Vice President for Product Management and Enterprise Solutions, Global \u201cprovide[s] training for courses on a variety of topics to corporate employees, funded by the corporation, [and] to professionals in that corporation employed by the corporation.\u201d The tax commissioner performed an audit of Global as a vendor of such services for the period July 1, 1997, through June 30, 2000, and determined that Global had improperly failed to collect and remit use tax on a number of courses taught in various business locations in Ohio during that period. The commissioner determined that the courses at issue constituted taxable \u201ccomputer services\u201d under the \u201ctraining\u201d provision of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(b). With preassessment interest and penalty, the assessment amounted to $103,269.45. In his final determination, the tax commissioner remitted the penalty, resulting in a final assessment of $91,872.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 6} When purchased for use in business, computer services are subject to sales or use tax in Ohio. R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e), 5739.02, and 5741.02(A)(1) and (C)(2). The definition of \u201ccomputer services\u201d includes \u201ctraining of computer programmers and operators\u201d when the training is \u201cprovided in conjunction with and to support the sale, lease, or operation of taxable computer equipment or systems.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(Y)(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 7} The tax commissioner promulgated an administrative rule to clarify the statutory language. The version of the rule in effect during the audit period defined \u201ccomputer services\u201d as \u201c[t]raining computer programmers and operators,\u201d subject to the additional definitions for \u201cprogramming\u201d and \u201ctraining.\u201d Former Ohio Adm.Code 5703-9-46(A)(2), (5), and (6), 1992-1993 Ohio Monthly Record 824-825, effective March 21, 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">{\u00b6 8} The rule defined \u201ctraining\u201d to mean \u201cinstructing computer programmers and operators in the use of computer equipment and its system software.\u201d Id. at 825. The rule then defined \u201csystems software\u201d as \u201call programming that controls the basic operations of the computer, such as arithmetic, logic, compilation or similar functions whether it is an integral part of the computer hardware or is contained on magnetic media.\u201d Id. Explicitly excluded from \u201ctraining\u201d was \u201cinstruction in the use of application software or other result-oriented procedures.\u201d Id. Reinforcing the same point, the rule stated that \u201cthe service of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>writing, changing, or debugging of application software\u201d was not included in \u201cprogramming.\u201d Id. Finally, the rule defined \u201capplication software\u201d to include \u201cprograms that are intended to perform business functions or control or monitor processes.\u201d Id. Thus, with respect to software training, the rule in effect during the audit period extended the tax to training on \u201csystems software\u201d but not to application software. Id. However, with respect to the types of equipment involved in the training or the persons attending the training, the rule relied more broadly upon the terms \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d and \u201ccomputer programmers and operators.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">{\u00b6 9} Global appealed the tax commissioner\u2019s final determination to the BTA, arguing that the services it provided did not qualify as \u201ctaxable computer services\u201d because (1) it involved training on routers and switches, not \u201ccomputer equipment,\u201d (2) several classes involved nontaxable application software rather than taxable systems software, and (3) some of those attending courses often did not qualify as \u201ccomputer programmers and operators\u201d as required by statute. Its notice of appeal to the BTA, however, did not raise any constitutional challenges to R.C. 5739.01(Y)(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 10} In its hearing before the BTA, Global presented the testimony of Michael Kevin Fox, a vice-president of Global, and offered ten exhibits in support of its contentions. The BTA rejected Global\u2019s claims, finding that routers and switches qualified as \u201ccomputer equipment,\u201d the courses challenged pertained to systems software, except with respect to two challenged courses, and the persons trained qualified as \u201ccomputer programmers and operators\u201d as used in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 11} Global appealed the BTA\u2019s decision to this court, challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(l)(b) with respect to free speech and equal protection and urging that the statute as utilized with the tax commissioner\u2019s rule is void for vagueness. Global also presents three propositions of law contesting matters raised before the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783, we reiterated that our standard of review from a decision of the BTA is whether it is \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d While we \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion,\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789, we will affirm the BTA\u2019s resolution of factual issues if the record contains reliable and probative evidence that supports the BTA\u2019s findings. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483; <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14. As we noted in <em>Nusseibeh v.

Specifically, \u201cwhen an assessment is contested, the taxpayer has the burden \u2018 \u201cto show in what manner and to what extent\u201d \u2019 the commissioner\u2019s investigation and audit, and the findings and assessments based thereon, were faulty and incorrect.\u201d <em>Maxxim Med., Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 337, 339, 720 N.E.2d 911, quoting <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 213, 215, 5 OBR 455, 450 N.E.2d 687, quoting <em>Midwest Transfer Co. v. Porterfield </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 138, 42 O.O.2d 365, 235 N.E.2d 511, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">{\u00b6 13} Global presents three propositions of law challenging R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b), asserting that it infringes on constitutionally protected speech, violates its constitutional right to equal protection, and is void for vagueness. The tax commissioner contends that these claims are jurisdictionally barred because they either were not specified in the notice of appeal to the BTA or were not sufficiently specified in the notice of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>Free-Speeck and Equal-Protection Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 14} Global asserts that R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b) violates the free-speech guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution because the definition of \u201ctraining\u201d provided in former Ohio Adm.Code 5703-9-46(A)(6), 1992-1993 Ohio Monthly Record 825, impermissibly distinguishes between training in systems software and application software based on the content of speech. Global also advances an equal-protection claim pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, arguing that because otherwise similarly situated communicators are taxed or not taxed based on the content of their speech, the tax discriminates based on whether or not a person has exercised a fundamental right. In response, the tax commissioner contends that we lack jurisdiction to consider these claims because Global failed to raise them in its notice of appeal to the BTA. Relying on our decision in <em>Cleveland Gear Co. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 229, 520 N.E.2d 188, Global urges that these constitutional challenges are properly presented to this court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 5717.02 provides that a notice of appeal to the BTA \u201cshall * * * specify the errors therein complained of.\u201d It is well settled that these requirements are jurisdictional prerequisites to the exercise of authority by the BTA or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>this court on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Newman v. Levin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 26 (jurisdiction of the BTA is \u201climited to errors specified in the notice of appeal\u201d); <em>Osborne Bros. Welding Supply, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 175, 178, 532 N.E.2d 739 (where error was not specified, the BTA and the court on appeal lack jurisdiction over it).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">{\u00b6 16} However, we recognized an exception to this rule in <em>Cleveland Gear Co. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 229, 520 N.E.2d 188, in which we explained that \u201c[t]he question of whether a tax statute is <em>unconstitutional on its face </em>may be raised initially in the Supreme Court or the courts of appeals, although not previously raised before the Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. A facial challenge may therefore be raised for the first time in this court because the \u201cBoard of Tax Appeals is an administrative agency, a creature of statute, and is without jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of a statute.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 17} Pursuant to <em>Cleveland Gear, </em>\u201cthe facial unconstitutionality of the legislation * * * is to be decided by considering the Act itself without regard to extrinsic facts.\u201d Id. at 231, 520 N.E.2d 188; see also <em>ComTech Sys., Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 96, 100-101, 570 N.E.2d 1089 (a taxpayer\u2019s constitutional challenge to the \u201cone subject rule\u201d involved facial attacks and could be considered by this court in the first instance because the court needed to review only the act and its history alone, without considering extrinsic facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 18} While Global argues in its brief that its free speech and equal protection claims are facial challenges to R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(B), permitting it to raise them in the first instance in this court, the focus of Global\u2019s challenge does not involve the text of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(B), which merely defines \u201ccomputer services\u201d; rather, Global contends that the statute <em>as construed by the administrative rule </em>violates its rights to free speech and equal protection. Specifically, Global challenges the distinction made in former Ohio Adm.Code 5703-9-46(A)(5), 1992-1993 Ohio Monthly Record at 825, between course content involving <em>systems software </em>and course content involving <em>application software </em>as exemplifying the content-based distinction that offends free-speech and equal-protection principles. However, unlike former Ohio Adm.Code 5703-9-46(A), R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b) contains no explicit tax-related distinction between <em>systems-software </em>training and <em>application-software </em>training. While federal courts sometimes consider administrative practice when evaluating facial challenges to a statute, see <em>Forsyth Cty., Georgia v. Nationalist Movement </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 123, 131, 112 S.Ct. 2395, 120 L.Ed.2d 101 (\u201cIn evaluating respondent\u2019s facial challenge, we must consider the county\u2019s authoritative constructions of the ordinance, including its own implementation and interpretation of it\u201d), for purposes of the <em>Cleveland Gear </em>exception, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>text of the statute itself may be considered when evaluating a \u201cfacial\u201d challenge. <em>Cleveland Gear, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 231, 520 N.E.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">{\u00b6 19} To the extent that Global seeks to challenge the constitutionality of former Ohio Adm.Code 5703 \u2014 9\u201446(A)(5), Global could have challenged the administrative rule before the BTA, which does have jurisdiction to invalidate an administrative rule, but did not do so. See R.C. 5703.14(C) (affected person may file an application for review with the BTA to determine the reasonableness of an administrative rule promulgated by the tax commissioner); see also <em>Stone v. Limbach </em>(June 30, 1988), BTA No. 1985-C-931, at 21 (invalidating tax rule, noting that \u201cwhile O.A.C. Rule 5703-25-01 was properly promulgated, it is unreasonable as it conflicts with R.C. Section 5727.15\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">{\u00b6 20} Based on the foregoing, Global\u2019s free-speech and equal-protection claims are not facial challenges to R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b) as contemplated by <em>Cleveland Gear. </em>Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider them because they were never presented to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>Vagueness Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 21} Global also argues that the terms \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d and \u201ccomputer systems\u201d (sic) in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b) are \u201cimpermissibly vague\u201d and therefore violate the due process guarantees of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. The tax commissioner responds that Global failed to raise its vagueness claim in its notice of appeal filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 5717.04 provides that a notice of appeal from the BTA to the court \u201cshall set forth the decision of the board appealed from and the errors therein complained of.\u201d As this court stated in <em>Neuman v. Levin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 28, quoting <em>Norandex, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 26, 31, 630 N.E.2d 329, fn. 1, \u201cwhen a litigant fails to raise a particular argument in the notice of appeal to the court, the court \u2018do[es] not have jurisdiction to consider the argument.\u2019 \u201d See also <em>Lawson Milk Co. v. Bowers </em>(1961), 171 Ohio St. 418, 420, 14 O.O.2d 217, 171 N.E.2d 495 (dismissing an appeal from the BTA because the notice did \u201cnot sufficiently set forth \u2018the errors therein complained of \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">{\u00b6 23} In its notice of appeal to the court, Global argues that the BTA \u201cerroneously and unjustifiably applied R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e) and R.C. 5739.01(Y)[1](b) to Appellant\u2019s training courses at issue based upon the content of and the pedagogical methods used in the courses in violation of Sections 2 and 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d Notably, Global does not expressly allege that the statutory definitions of \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d and \u201ccomputer systems\u201d are unconstitutionally vague and therefore constitute a deprivation of due process. Nor does a reference to the Fourteenth Amendment itself sufficiently assert that these statutory provisions violate due process and are void for vagueness. Accordingly, Global\u2019s notice of appeal does not adequately set forth a constitutional vagueness challenge, and we, therefore, lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Statutory Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 24} Global does raise three separate claims pertaining to the application of R.C. 5739.01 and former Ohio Adm.Code 5703-9-46 to its training courses, arguing that the commissioner impermissibly assessed tax on several of its courses. In its brief, Global urges that 24 of its courses should not be taxed: 17 that involved instruction in the use of routers and switches, six that involved nontaxable application software, and ten that Global claims involved introductory courses not attended by \u201ccomputer programmers and operators.\u201d The tax commissioner maintains that each of these courses is properly taxed as \u201ccomputer services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Routers and switches as \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 25} Global argues that several courses effectuated training on routers and switches, not \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b), and are therefore not taxable. Specifically, Global urges that training may be subject to the use tax only if the equipment involved in the training is a computer. The tax commissioner responds that training on routers and switches involves training on \u201ccomputer equipment\u201d or \u201ccomputer systems\u201d and is therefore taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 5739.01(Y)(l)(b) does not limit taxation to courses involving training on computers. Rather, the statute levies the tax on instruction \u201cprovided in conjunction with and to <em>support the </em>* * * <em>operation </em>of taxable computer equipment <em>or systems.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The evidence presented to the BTA indicates that the instruction provided by Global in training employees on routers and switches would support the operation of computer systems. Significantly, Global\u2019s vice president testified at the BTA hearing that \u201cin today\u2019s network, the routing and switching environment is used in a more complex way to attach telephones, computers and printers.\u201d In addition, the course manual for \u201cUnderstanding Network Fundamentals,\u201d introduced at the BTA, shows that Global\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>courses focus on \u201cinformation technology\u201d training and that such training includes instruction relating to routers and switches.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, the BTA reasonably and lawfully applied the law as to routers and switches, its findings are supported by reliable and probative evidence, and we affirm this part of its decision. See <em>HIN, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-687, 923 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 13 (a BTA decision is to be affirmed if it correctly applied the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\n<em>Application software v. systems software</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 28} Global also argues that six of its training courses involved training in nontaxable <em>application </em>software as opposed to taxable <em>systems </em>software: # 6950 PERL Scripting, # 6980 PERL Scripting with CGI, # 8700 Nortel Hub Activity, # 8800 Router Installation &amp; Basic Configuration, # 8900 Router Configuration &amp; Management, and # 9300 Troubleshooting TCP/IP Networks.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 29} With respect to the BTA\u2019s tax determination involving # 6950 PERL Scripting and # 6980 PERL Scripting with CGI, Global asserts that PERL and PERL with CGI are programming languages that are \u201cused in web and network applications\u201d and further argues that this instruction is not taxable, because the programming language is used to write programs in the nature of application software, not systems software. The tax commissioner, on the other hand, relies on testimony that \u201coperating systems administrators\u201d use the programming language. However, that testimony does not by itself establish whether these languages primarily involve systems software or application software.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, the BTA determined that the PERL courses involved application software because \u201cMr. Fox testified that both courses cover systems software and that VMS stands for a software operation.\u201d However, that testimony was relative to the course Open VMS Fundamentals, not the PERL courses. Contrary to the BTA\u2019s determination, Fox did not provide any testimony as to whether the <em>PERL </em>courses related to systems software. Rather, Global characterized PERL and PERL with CGI as \u201cused in web and network applications\u201d before the commissioner and the BTA. Given the uncontroverted evidence that the courses at issue involve programming languages that are \u201cused in web and network applications,\u201d we note that the record simply does not support a finding that these courses qualify as taxable training. Therefore, we reverse the BTA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>determination with respect to these courses. See <em>NFI Metro Ctr. II Assoc. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 105, 107, 676 N.E.2d 881 (reversing a BTA decision that \u201creached the factual conclusions\u201d that \u201cthe testimony and evidence [did] not support\u201d), citing <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Cuyahoga Cty.

We decline to address the propriety of the tax assessed in conjunction with these courses in the first instance. <em>Neil House Hotel Co. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 231, 34 O.O. 127, 70 N.E.2d 646, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>Individuals attending introductory level courses as \u201ccomputer programmers or operators\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 32} Global next argues that the attendees of some of its courses were not \u201ccomputer programmers and operators.\u201d As noted previously, taxable \u201ccomputer services\u201d include \u201ctraining of computer programmers and operators, provided in conjunction with and to support the sale, lease, or operation of taxable computer equipment or systems.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">{\u00b6 33} Global argues that the introductory-level courses were so basic in their content that the people attending the training did not qualify as either \u201ccomputer programmers\u201d or \u201coperators\u201d as referenced in the statute. The tax commissioner believes that the training course attendees qualified, and therefore, the courses are taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 34} The dispute as to the scope of the term \u201coperators\u201d stems from a prior decision of the BTA, <em>Mentor Technologies Ltd. Partnership v. Tracy </em>(Aug. 25, 1995), BTA No. 94-A-1058, 1995 WL 514159, which the BTA relied on in the instant case. In <em>Mentor Technologies, </em>the commissioner argued that \u201ccomputer operators\u201d means those individuals who \u201coperated computers in the performance of their duties for their employers.\u201d Id. at *2. The BTA rejected the commissioner\u2019s position, holding that a \u201ccomputer operator\u201d must possess \u201ca higher level of training and understanding of the computer.\u201d Id. at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 35} We disagree. First, despite Global\u2019s claim that beginners taking introductory courses cannot be \u201ccomputer programmers and operators,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>General Assembly neither limited these terms to those with computer experience and knowledge nor further defined them. A plain reading of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1)(b) reveals that \u201ccomputer services\u201d includes training of individuals who are not yet computer programmers or operators and is not limited to those already trained. In fact, an \u201coperator\u201d is defined simply as \u201ca worker who operates a * * * specified machine or device as his regular trade.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 36} Second, it was unnecessary for the General Assembly to further define these terms, as it expressly limited the scope of the tax in a manner that is relevant to the question of who may qualify as a \u201ccomputer programmer or operator\u201d by directing that computer services are subject to tax only when they are purchased <em>\u201cfor use in business.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e). In other words, training becomes subject to the tax when an employer purchases the training to enable its employees to operate computers in the context of their employment. See <em>Compuserve, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 777, 780, 639 N.E.2d 1227 (when R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e) was enacted, \u201cthe provision of computer services to business customers became a taxable transaction,\u201d while the \u201cprovision of computer services to nonbusiness customers remained nontaxable\u201d). The record in this case demonstrates that the commissioner assessed the tax with respect to employer-purchased training that enabled its employees to operate computers and computer systems in the course of their employment. Thus, the \u201cfor use in business\u201d requirement of R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e) assures that the persons being trained qualify as computer operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 37} Accordingly, the BTA reasonably and lawfully applied the law as to the status of the trainees, its findings are supported by reliable and probative evidence, and we affirm this part of its decision. See <em>HIN, L.L.C., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-687, 923 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 38} Based on the foregoing, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Global\u2019s constitutional claims because they either were not properly presented to the BTA or were not incorporated into the notice of appeal filed in this court. With respect to its other claims, Global has not demonstrated that the determination made by the BTA in connection with routers and switches, application software, and the status of trainees was unreasonable or unlawful, and we therefore affirm the decision, except that we reverse with respect to the PERL and PERL with CGI courses, as they involve nontaxable training on application software.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-10\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AZm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Buckingham, Doolitle <em>&amp; </em>Burroughs, L.L.P., Steven A.

In any event, Global failed to challenge the constitutionality of the administrative rule in the notice of appeal to this court, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. See <em>Newman v. Levin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\">. To the extent that Global argues that routers and switches might be used as part of telecommunications or cable networks, as distinct from computer networks or systems, Global has not shouldered its burden as the taxpayer to offer proof that any particular course that the tax commissioner assessed was not taxable because it pertained to telecommunications systems, as opposed to computer systems. See <em>Maxxim Med., Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 337, 339-340, 720 N.E.2d 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\">. In its decision and relying on an exhibit provided by Global to the BTA, the BTA noted that Global had challenged only four courses as involving nontaxable training in systems software. Global has not corrected the BTA\u2019s characterization of its claims to the BTA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
