We hold that R.C. 3314.015(D) grants such a right to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2007, appellant, Brookwood Presbyterian Church (\u201cBrook-wood\u201d), submitted an application to appellee, Ohio Department of Education (\u201cODE\u201d), to sponsor community schools in Ohio. Brookwood sought approval as a sponsor pursuant to R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f), which allows \u201ceducation-oriented,\u201d tax-exempt entities under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to sponsor community schools. Brookwood submitted information regarding both itself and its parent organization, the national Presbyterian Church USA. In March 2008, ODE determined that Brookwood is not eligible to sponsor community schools, concluding that it is not an \u201ceducation-oriented\u201d entity as required by R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f). Brookwood sought reconsideration of its eligibility to sponsor a community school, and on May 9, 2008, ODE again issued its determination that Brookwood was not eligible. ODE stated, \u201cDespite the contributions of the Presbyterian Church USA, in your original application and in the recently supplied supporting documentation, Brookwood Presbyterian Church <em>is </em>the legal entity making application for sponsorship; not the Presbyterian Church USA, nor any of the colleges associated with it. The 501 c(3) [sic] documentation is for the national Presbyterian Church. Thus the national Presbyterian Church should be the applicant, not Brookwood Presbyterian Church. The national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Presbyterian Church is clearly organized for religious purposes. Brookwood Presbyterian Church, however, is the named applicant indicated in the original sponsorship application and supported by conversations with John Taracko and others in our office. Neither the national Presbyterian Church nor Brookwood Presbyterian Church is eligible to apply to become a sponsor. Also please know that no church has been approved as a sponsor.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, Brookwood filed an administrative appeal in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. ODE filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The common pleas court granted ODE\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 4} Brookwood appealed to the Tenth District Court of Appeals. On September 8, 2009, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the common pleas court. The court of appeals held that although R.C. 3314.015(D) states that ODE decisions disapproving an entity for sponsorship of a community school are appealable under R.C. 119.12, a more specific statute, R.C. 3314.015(B)(3), provides that ODE\u2019s determination that an entity is not education-oriented is \u201cfinal.\u201d The court concluded that the ODE\u2019s determination was thus not subject to appeal. 2009-Ohio-4645, 2009 WL 2872974, \u00b6 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 3301.13 states the general rule that the ODE \u201c[i]n the exercise of any of its functions or powers * * * shall be subject to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.\u201d One of the statutory functions of ODE is to approve entities to be sponsors of community schools. R.C. 3314.015(A)(2). R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) sets forth six categories of entities that may become community-school sponsors, and R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f) makes eligible for sponsorship any qualified tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that (i) has been in operation for at least five years prior to applying to be a community-school sponsor, (ii) has assets of at least $500,000 and a demonstrated record of financial responsibility, (iii) has been determined by ODE to be an education-oriented entity under R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) and has a demonstrated record of successful implementation of educational programs, and (iv) is not a community school. R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 7} Pursuant to R.C. 3314.015(B)(3), it is up to the ODE to determine, pursuant to criteria adopted by rule, whether the tax-exempt entity applying for sponsorship is education-oriented. R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) further provides, \u201cSuch determination of the department is final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>{\u00b6 8} ODE found that Brookwood is not an education-oriented entity as required under R.C. 3314.02(C)(l)(f)(iii) and denied its application for sponsorship. Brookwood seeks to appeal ODE\u2019s determination pursuant to R.C. 3314.015(D). R.C. 3314.015(D) grants a right of appeal to entities disapproved for community-school sponsorship: \u201cThe decision of the department to disapprove an entity for sponsorship of a community school or to revoke approval for such sponsorship * * * may be appealed by the entity in accordance with section 119.12 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">{\u00b6 9} The crux of this case is the interplay between R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) and 3314.015(D). R.C. 3314.015(D) grants a right of appeal to entities disapproved for community-school sponsorship; the question is whether R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) takes it away in certain circumstances. ODE asserts that its determination that Brookwood is not education-oriented is final and therefore not subject to appeal based upon R.C. 3314.015(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 1.51 provides the guiding principle in determining the interaction between statutes: \u201cIf a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.\u201d We should not, however, seek out a conflict where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 11} Whether R.C. 3314.015(D) and 3314.015(B)(3) conflict depends upon the meaning of \u201cfinal\u201d in regard to the board of education\u2019s determination of whether an entity is education-oriented under R.C. 3314.015(B)(3). Does \u201cfinal\u201d mean that the administrative process is complete and the matter is ripe for appeal to the common pleas court, or does \u201cfinal\u201d mean that the unsuccessful, would-be sponsoring entity is consigned to an administrative abyss? We hold that R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) establishes that a determination that an entity is not education-oriented is a \u201cdecision of the department to disapprove an entity for sponsorship of a community school\u201d under R.C. 3314.015(D) and therefore \u201cmay be appealed by the entity in accordance with section 119.12 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 3314.015(D) grants the right to an R.C. 119.12 appeal to any entity disapproved for sponsorship. R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) would conflict with R.C. 3314.015(D) if it stated that the department\u2019s determination whether an entity is education-oriented was \u201cnot appealable.\u201d It does not \u2014 it merely says that the determination is \u201cfinal.\u201d We can look to our own jurisprudence and the Ohio Constitution to determine the legal significance of the word \u201cfinal.\u201d In <em>Walburn v. Dunlap, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 373, 2009-Ohio-1221, 904 N.E.2d 863, at \u00b6 13, this court explained, \u201c \u2018It is well-established that an order must be final before it can be reviewed by an appellate court. If an order is not final, then an appellate court has no jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>Gen. Ace. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>[1989], 44 Ohio St.3d [17] 20, 540 N.E.2d 266.\u201d Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution grants courts of appeals appellate jurisdiction \u201cas may be provided by law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>review and affirm, modify, or reverse <em>final </em>orders or actions of administrative officers or agencies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, in our system of law, \u201cfinal\u201d can mean the opposite of \u201cnot appealable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 13} Had the General Assembly intended that the department\u2019s determination of whether an entity is education-oriented not be subject to administrative appeal, it could have done so by appropriate language, i.e., by specifying that the department\u2019s decision is final and not subject to appeal. See <em>Riedel v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 358, 2010-Ohio-1926, 928 N.E.2d 448, \u00b6 9 (General Assembly would have used specific language if it had intended R.C. 2307.93(C) to administratively dismiss an entire tort action instead of simply a claim). In fact, the General Assembly has employed this language carefully to specify when certain final actions are not appealable. See R.C. 2712.21 (decision by common pleas court regarding appointment of arbitrator \u201cis final and not subject to appeal\u201d), 3318.051(E) (decision of School Facilities Commission to approve or not approve transfer of money under section \u201cis final and not subject to appeal\u201d), and 5126.0214 (decision of director of developmental disabilities whether to waive removal requirement \u201cis final and not subject to appeal\u201d). The statute at issue here includes no comparable prohibition against appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 14} Appellee points to appellate court decisions holding that a statute\u2019s characterization of an administrative body\u2019s holding as final precludes review through an R.C. 119.12 appeal. See, e.g., <em>Carney v. School Emps. Retirement Sys. Bd. </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 71, 528 N.E.2d 1322 (holding that a statute precluded an administrative appeal from a decision of the School Employees Retirement System\u2019s board because the decision was final according to statute); <em>State ex rel. Shumway v. Ohio State Teachers Retirement Bd. </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 280, 284, 683 N.E.2d 70, fn. 1 (holding that a statute precluded an administrative appeal from a decision of the State Teachers Retirement System board because the statute provided, \u201cAny determination of the board under this division shall be final\u201d); <em>Heartland Jockey Club, Ltd. v. Ohio State Racing Comm. </em>(Aug. 3, 1999), 10th Dist. No. 98AP-1465, 1999 WL 566857 (holding that a statute that provides that a decision of the State Racing Commission is \u201cfinal\u201d is not subject to appeal through R.C. 119.12).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 15} The cases cited by ODE are inapposite. In those cases, the statutes lacked what is present in this case \u2014 a specific, statutory grant of jurisdiction to the trial court to review the decisions of the administrative body pursuant to R.C. 119.12. Here, that makes all the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 16} Why did the General Assembly term the ODE\u2019s determination of whether an entity is education-oriented \u201cfinal\u201d? Ours is not to question why. But of the four requirements set forth in R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f) for a tax-exempt entity to qualify as a community-school sponsor, the board\u2019s determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>other three qualifiers is mechanical: whether the entity \u201chas been in operation for at least five years prior to applying to be a community school sponsor,\u201d R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f)(i); whether the entity \u201chas assets of at least five hundred thousand dollars and a demonstrated record of financial responsibility,\u201d R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f)(ii); and whether the entity \u201cis not a community school,\u201d R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f)(iv). Those factors are black-and-white. Only the \u201ceducation-oriented\u201d factor requires a nuanced approach requiring a subjective and substantive judgment of the board. It is a determination different in character from the other R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f) factors. And by calling that determination \u201cfinal\u201d but not calling it \u201cnot subject to appeal,\u201d the General Assembly has concluded that that judgment is susceptible of review pursuant to R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 17} The ODE asserts that there is a two-tiered process for approving community-school sponsors, a preliminary judgment of eligibility followed by an application review. The ODE argues that the application process is open only to an \u201celigible entity\u201d and that its R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) \u201ceducation-oriented\u201d determination is part of determining eligibility to apply for sponsorship. The ODE further argues that the R.C. 3314.015(D) right to appeal is granted only to \u201celigible entities\u201d disapproved for sponsorship. However, the statutes at issue set up no such two-tiered process and do not use the term \u201celigible entity.\u201d Although the Administrative Code at times uses the term \u201celigible entity,\u201d it does not use that term in describing the right to appeal. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-102-03(G) uses the language of the statute, referring to the right to appeal of \u201can entity,\u201d not \u201can eligible entity\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe decision of the department to disapprove an entity for sponsorship of a community school may be appealed by the entity in accordance with section 119.12 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, even if the ODE employs a two-tiered approval process for community-school sponsorship, the right to appeal applies to an entity disapproved at either tier.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 20} The determination of whether an entity is education-oriented is substantive and important. R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) and 3314.015(D) should be construed so as not to conflict, allowing an entity to appeal the board\u2019s R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f)(iii) determination. The board\u2019s power to determine whether an entity is education-oriented is no trifle, and the grant of a right to appeal in R.C. 3314.015(D) is a check on that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b610-4\">Brown, C.J., and Cupp, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b610-5\">Brown, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aiy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 22} At the heart of this matter is the meaning of the word \u201cfinal\u201d in R.C. 3314.015(B)(3). The majority has decided that use of the single word \u201cfinal\u201d means final <em>and appealable. </em>Because I believe that the correct interpretation of \u201cfinal\u201d as used in R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) is that the determination of the Ohio Department of Education (\u201cODE\u201d) whether an entity is education-oriented is not subject to appeal under R.C. 119.12,1 respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 23} The primary assumption for the majority\u2019s interpretation is that the General Assembly used the word \u201cfinal\u201d as a legal term of art to mean a judgment or order that is subject to appellate review. The majority further assumes that the General Assembly would have stated explicitly that determinations of education-oriented status are \u201cfinal <em>and not subject to appeal\u201d </em>if it had intended there to be no appeal right under R.C. 3314.015(B)(3), particularly given that R.C. 3314.015(D) grants a general appeal right for ODE denials of applications to sponsor community schools. The majority cites several statutory provisions in which the General Assembly has provided explicitly that a decision is \u201cfinal and not subject to appeal.\u201d See R.C. 2712.21, 3318.051(E), and 5126.0214.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 24} The majority\u2019s assumptions are not borne out by other provisions of the Revised Code. If the General Assembly so clearly intended the use of \u201cfinal\u201d in R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) to mean final <em>and appealable </em>without actually using those words, why is the Revised Code replete with instances in which the General Assembly explicitly says both when it intends a decision to be reviewable on appeal? See R.C. 3769.0810(1) (decision by the State Racing Commission to impose certain assessments is \u201cfinal, subject to appeal under section 119.12 of the Revised Code\u201d), 3905.14(G) (decision by the superintendent of insurance to issue a cease-and-desist order is final, and \u201c[t]he final order may be appealed\u201d), 3905.50(F) (\u201cAll final orders and decisions of the superintendent [of insurance] are subject to judicial review\u201d), 4141.26(F) (\u201cThe validity of any general order or rule of the director [of job and family services] * * * or of any final order or action of the unemployment compensation review commission respecting any such general order or rule may be determined by the court of common pleas of Franklin county\u201d), 4517.58 (decision of the Motor Vehicle Dealers Board is \u201cfinal * * * except that any person adversely affected by the decision may appeal in the manner provided by sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code\u201d), 4731.23(E) (decision of the State Medical Board is \u201cfinal * * * except that the certificate holder may appeal in the manner provided by Chapter 119. of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Revised Code\u201d), 4763.11(F) (decision of Real Estate Appraiser Board \u201cis final, subject to review in the manner provided for in Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and appeal to any court of common pleas\u201d), and 5709.22(B) (\u201cThe final determination [by the tax commissioner] is subject to appeal\u201d); see also R.C. 5703.70(C)(3), 5711.31, and 5727.47(E). Would it not have been sufficient under the majority\u2019s interpretation for the General Assembly to provide simply that decisions under these statutes are final?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 25} And what is this court to make of the host of other instances in which the General Assembly has simply provided that a decision of an administrative agency or other individual or entity is \u201cfinal\u201d? See R.C. 122.30(C)(1)(2), 122.42(A)(2), 122.74(A)(2), 124.03(A)(1), 145.01(R)(3), 173.19(F), 742.01(L)(3), 1513.05, 1515.02, 3302.10(J), 3306.34(1), 3307.01(B), 3307.74(E), 3309.01(A) and (B), 3309.31(E), 3311.06(G), 3314.08(0)(2)(d), 3769.02, 3769.089, 5126.281(A)(3), and 5505.01(S)(3). Did the General Assembly intend for all of these decisions to be final orders subject to review on appeal even where the statutes make no mention of an appeal right?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 26} The lesson gained from a review of the varying uses of the word \u201cfinal\u201d throughout the Revised Code is that the word is susceptible of more than one meaning. Where statutory language is susceptible of more than one meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation must be applied to determine the true intent of the legislature. <em>Wingate v. Hordge </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 55, 58, 14 O.O.3d 212, 396 N.E.2d 770. A guiding principle of statutory interpretation is that the statute must be construed as a whole and each of its parts must be given effect so that they are compatible with each other and related enactments. <em>Humphrys v. Winous Co. </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 45, 49, 59 O.O. 65, 133 N.E.2d 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 27} By interpreting the statutory scheme as establishing a two-stage process for the review of applications to sponsor community schools, R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) can be construed in a way that gives each part of the statute effect and renders the statute compatible with the other statutes governing these sponsorship applications. R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) allows only six categories of entities to sponsor community schools. Therefore, ODE must make a preliminary determination regarding whether an entity falls within one of these categories and is eligible to become a sponsor of a community school. ODE\u2019s administrative regulations specifically define an entity that falls within one of the categories enumerated in R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) as an \u201celigible entity.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3301-102-02(H). For an entity claiming eligibility under R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f), this preliminary determination of eligibility includes a determination, within the discretion of ODE, whether the entity is education-oriented. R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f)(iii) and 3314.015(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Once there has been a preliminary determination that an entity is an eligible entity, ODE must review the application in light of its rules regarding the criteria, procedures, and deadlines for processing applications to become a sponsor of a community school. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-102-03. A decision disapproving an application from an entity listed in R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) is subject to appeal pursuant to R.C. 119.12. R.C. 3314.015(D); see also Ohio Adm.Code 3301-102-03(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 29} Most of the determinations regarding eligibility under R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) are mechanical and involve no exercise of discretion by ODE. Certainly, an ODE determination that an applying entity fails to satisfy one of these mechanical criteria would result in the end of consideration of that entity\u2019s application for community-school sponsorship, yet no one could reasonably suggest that such a determination is based upon the merits of the application or that such a determination is entitled to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 30} A finding that an entity is education-oriented admittedly is different from most of the other preliminary eligibility requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It contains a subjective component and requires exercise of discretion by ODE. But this determination is no more on the merits of the application than any other determination made by ODE under R.C. 3314.02(C)(1). It is also the only one of the criteria under subsection (C)(1)(f) that the General Assembly found necessary to designate as \u201cfinal.\u201d This language suggests that the General Assembly recognized the potential for attempted litigation on this issue, but intended to foreclose such litigation because it is not a decision on the merits of the application that would be subject to appeal in accordance with R.C. 3314.015(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 31} Viewing the ODE\u2019s review of. a community-school sponsorship application under R.C. 3314.015 as a two-stage process is further supported by the last sentence of R.C. 3314.02(C)(1), which permits any entity that falls within one of the six enumerated categories to enter into preliminary agreements with any person or group of individuals proposing to establish a new community school to finalize plans for the school, to establish a governing authority for the school, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to negotiate contracts. R.C. 3314.02(C)(2). The ability of an eligible entity to enter into preliminary agreements prior to a final decision on the merits of its application to sponsor a community school presumes that there has been a threshold determination by ODE that an entity falls within one of the R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">{\u00b6 32} The majority\u2019s interpretation renders superfluous the language in R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) that \u201c[s]uch determination of the department is final.\u201d If, as the majority contends, a determination that an entity is not education-oriented is a disapproval of the entity for sponsorship of a community school under R.C. 3314.015(D), why did the General Assembly specifically include language in R.C. 3314.015(B)(3) that determinations that an entity is education-oriented are final? Why is a determination regarding whether an entity is education-oriented singled out in the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 33} The majority claims that it is not our place to question why the General Assembly chose to treat determinations of education-oriented status differently from all other ODE decisions under R.C. 3314.02 and 3314.015. It is precisely our place to do so. It is this court\u2019s role to interpret Ohio statutes. That interpretation can be aided by ascertaining the intent of the legislature where the statutory language is susceptible of more than one meaning. In ascertaining legislative intent, this court must presume that the language employed was deliberate and meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 3314.015(D) generally grants a right to appeal ODE decisions disapproving an entity for sponsorship of a community school. But R.C. 3314.015(B)(2) and (3) designate as final two types of decisions by ODE: the approval of the mission of schools sponsored by state universities and the determination of whether an entity is education-oriented. By specifying only those determinations as final, the General Assembly clearly intended to convey that these subjective decisions should be treated differently from other subjective decisions made by ODE regarding community-school sponsorship. The only reasonable explanation for the different treatment of these determinations is that the General Assembly intended to provide exceptions to the general appeal right granted in R.C. 3314.015(D) for certain decisions requiring ODE\u2019s exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 35} Additionally, the majority\u2019s rejection of the two-stage application process yields strange results. The majority concludes that a decision finding that an entity is not an entity specified in R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) is a decision disapproving the entity for sponsorship of a community school, which would be appealable under R.C. 3314.015(D). Yet the majority also appears to conclude that an ODE determination that an entity does not fall within the group of entities set forth in R.C. 3314.02(C)(1) for any reason other than that the entity is not education-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>oriented under R.C. 3314.02(C)(l)(f)(iii) is not subject to appeal under R.C. 3314.015(D). The majority has to read language into R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(a) through (e) and (f)(i), (ii), and (iv) to render these determinations not subject to appeal under R.C. 3314.015(D) in order to justify its conclusion that an ODE determination that an entity is not education-oriented is a decision disapproving the entity for sponsorship of a community school.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 36} Based on the language of R.C. 3314.015 in its entirety and the other statutory provisions regarding community schools, I believe that the General Assembly intended ODE\u2019s determination regarding whether an entity is education-oriented not to be subject to review under R.C. 119.12. It is clear to me that the majority believes that an ODE determination that an entity is not education-oriented ought to be subject to review on appeal and not consigned to what it perceives to be \u201can administrative abyss.\u201d Perhaps this would be the wiser course. But the General Assembly has given us a statute that cannot be read reasonably to permit this outcome without reading significant additional language into the statutory scheme and rendering portions of the scheme ineffective or redundant. It is not our place to substitute our views about how the process of applying for community-school sponsorship ought to work for the procedure set forth by the General Assembly. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">. R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(e) provides that a community school may be sponsored by a designee of the board of trustees of any of the 13 state universities or the board of trustees itself as long as a mission of the proposed school will be \u201cthe practical demonstration of teaching methods, educational technology, or other teaching practices that are included in the curriculum of the university\u2019s teacher preparation program approved by the state board of education.\u201d R.C. 3314.015(B)(2) provides that ODE shall determine, pursuant to criteria adopted by administrative rule, \u201cwhether the mission proposed to be specified in the contract of a community school to be sponsored by a state university board of trustees or the board\u2019s designee under division (C)(1)(e) of section 3314.02 of the Revised Code complies with the requirements of that division.\u201d Like a determination that an entity is education-oriented, a determination that the mission complies with R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(e) is final.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b614-5\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aiml\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 37} A plain and fair reading of the statute in question, I believe, is that the decision of the Ohio Department of Education (\u201cODE\u201d) regarding whether the applicant, Brookwood Presbyterian Church (\u201cBrookwood\u201d), is an education-oriented entity is final, in the plain and ordinary sense of the word \u201cfinal,\u201d as that word is used in R.C. 3314.015(B)(3). \u201cFinal\u201d in this context means \u201cleaving no further chance for action, discussion, or change; deciding; conclusive [a <em>final </em>decree].\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, Third College Edition (1988) 506. Contrary to the interpretation of the majority, the legislature has clearly expressed its intent that the decision of ODE on this issue may not be appealed. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 38} My conclusion is not based upon any public-policy considerations, which are not within the province of the courts when the intent of the legislature is clear. It is not for us to decide whether the General Assembly has made a wise policy choice or an undesirable policy choice in entrusting this determination to ODE.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 39} I generally agree with most of Chief Justice Brown\u2019s analysis, but I would note also that appellant Brookwood, while not granted a statutory right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>appeal, is not without a remedy. An action in mandamus is available when a statute makes an agency\u2019s decision, such as the one here, \u201cfinal\u201d in that it may not be appealed through the usual appeals process. See, e.g., <em>Ohio Academy of Nursing Homes v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 14, 2007-Ohio-2620, 867 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 26 (\u201ccourts have determined that a writ of mandamus provides an appropriate balance between the extreme of allowing no challenge at all and the other alternative of completely ignoring the explicit directive that an agency\u2019s particular determination is not meant to be appeal-able\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKM\">Buckley King, L.P.A., Donell Grubbs, and James S. Callender Jr., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A--F\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, Benjamin C. Mizer, Solicitor General, Elisabeth A. Long, Deputy Solicitor, and Mia Meucci, Assistant Solicitor, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 40} In fact, appellant has filed an action in mandamus with this court to challenge ODE\u2019s decision. The mandamus action has been stayed pending the resolution of this case. Case No. 2009-2055, <em>State ex rel. Brookwood Presbyterian Church v. Ohio Dept. of Edn., </em>motion for stay granted, 124 Ohio St.3d 1479, 2010-Ohio-430, 921 N.E.2d 249. Appellant alleges in the complaint in that case that it has operated an educational program since 2002 to provide services to special-needs students who are not adequately served in traditional education programs and that students are referred to appellant\u2019s program by area schools, public community schools, juvenile court personnel, counseling services, and parents. Based on these allegations, appellant\u2019s mandamus action may well have merit. But that action in mandamus is the proper manner in which to address this issue \u2014 not this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 41} Consequently, while I would hold that appellant does not have a right of appeal due to the specific requirement of R.C. 3314.015(B)(3), I would simultaneously lift this court\u2019s stay of the presentation of evidence and the briefing of appellant\u2019s mandamus action, and proceed to a resolution of case No. 2009-2055. Because the majority decides otherwise, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
