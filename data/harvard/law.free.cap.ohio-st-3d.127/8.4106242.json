Arnold, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 290, 2010-Ohio-2742, 933 N.E.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">{\u00b6 2} We are unable to determine from the court of appeals\u2019 opinion whether the juvenile court erroneously admitted statements by the child victim to child advocacy center employees. It is uncertain whether the statements were made for forensic or medical purposes and, if the statements were made for forensic purposes, whether their admission was harmless error. Accordingly, the portion of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment with respect to appellant J.M.\u2019s third assignment of error is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings consistent with <em>State v. Arnold.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b144-15\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b144-16\">Brown, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Angela Miller, Assistant Public Defender, for appellant, J.M.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b145-5\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5e\">concurs in the judgment to vacate the judgment of the court of appeals in part but would remand for application of the principles articulated in his dissenting opinion in <em>State v.
