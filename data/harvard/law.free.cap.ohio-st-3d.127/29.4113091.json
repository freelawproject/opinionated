As the court of appeals correctly concluded, our holding in <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus, \u201crequires a full resolution of those counts <em>for which there were convictions. </em>It does not require a reiteration of those counts and specifications for which there were no convictions, but were resolved in other ways, such as dismissals, nolled counts, or not guilty findings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93814, 2010-Ohio-1066, 2010 WL 972808, \u00b6 8. And the erroneous inclusion of postrelease control in Davis\u2019s original sentencing entry<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> constituted mere error for which he had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of appeal. See, e.g., <em>Manns v. Gansheimer, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 251, 2008-Ohio-851, 883 N.E.2d 431, \u00b6 6 (\u201csentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not remediable\u201d by extraordinary writ); <em>State ex rel. Pruitt v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 402, 2010-Ohio-1808, 928 N.E.2d 722, \u00b6 4 (sentencing entry containing language that postrelease control was part of sentence afforded sufficient notice to defendant so that he could raise any claimed errors on appeal rather than by extraordinary writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-6\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b166-7\">Brown, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">.
