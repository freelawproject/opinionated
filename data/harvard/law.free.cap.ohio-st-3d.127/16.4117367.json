He has served as a judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County since 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violating Canons 2, 3(B)(5), and 3(B)(9) of the former Code of Judicial Conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">{\u00b6 3} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the case, issued findings of fact, and concluded that respondent violated the canons and rule as charged. The panel recommended a sanction of a public reprimand. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law but amended the recommended sanction to a one-year suspension from the practice of law, with the entire year stayed. We accept the board\u2019s findings and conclusions, but we amend the sanction to a six-month suspension from the practice of law, with all six months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">{\u00b6 4} The charges in the complaint arise from respondent\u2019s conduct in a single criminal trial. The defendant in the case was accused of burglary and of assaulting an 83-year-old woman and her caregiver. In the first two days of the defendant\u2019s trial, preliminary matters such as witness availability and plea bargains were discussed, and the prosecution commenced and concluded its portion of voir dire. On the third day of trial, November 29, 2007, respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>was informed that the detective who was to transport the victims to court that morning had been unable to locate them when he went to pick them up.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 5} The news that the victims had not been found made respondent suspicious; he had previously begun to suspect that the defendant in the case might be trying to prevent the elderly woman from testifying. He stated that he had learned that the caregiver had admitted after the assault and burglary that she had a personal relationship with the defendant and that she had been smoking crack with him on the day that the crimes were committed. This fact, and the fact that the women were not at the house at the confirmed pickup time, caused respondent to worry for the elderly woman\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent\u2019s concern was also based on a review of the dockets from the defendant\u2019s past criminal cases. He noted that a previous complaint against the defendant had been dismissed when the witnesses did not appear to testify and that bench warrants had to be issued for the witnesses in another case, although he could not be sure that the defendant had prevented the witnesses from testifying in those past cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent placed his concerns for the witness on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThis is not an 83 year old woman who can just go somewhere on her own. And given the fact that the alleged victim in this case [the caregiver] is a drug abuser and has had a relationship with this defendant, I am very suspicion [sic],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cI mean, this isn\u2019t a case that has to be researched. It\u2019s just a case of common sense and Psychology 101, and I am concerned [the caregiver] may be trying to manipulate this trial and prevent this 83 year old woman from being here, and I will not permit that to happen under any circumstances whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent explained that he was making a record so that the relationships between the defendant and the witnesses would be understood if the case was appealed. He promised to allow the defense to make an objection when he was finished and then stated that he would grant a mistrial and arrest the caregiver if the witnesses did not appear the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent continued: \u201cIf there is anybody involved in this case who was involved in what is obstruction of justice, I will see to it that case will be indicted. And if that case comes to me, I will see to it that person gets maximum consecutive time. I let no one manipulate the system of justice. I will not permit that to occur in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">{\u00b6 12} The state asked for a one-day continuance to locate the witnesses. The court granted the motion and ordered that the trial reconvene the next morning. Respondent also issued a bench warrant for the caregiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The next morning, November 30, 2007, at the time the trial was to resume, respondent met with the attorneys in chambers. Respondent was informed that the detective had again been unable to find the women and that the state wanted to dismiss the case without prejudice. The defense counsel testified at the disciplinary hearing that respondent was irate that the prosecution wanted to dismiss the case; respondent indicated that he wanted to find a way out of the situation, and then respondent addressed the prosecutor, saying, \u201c[W]e are all on the same team.\u201d The defense counsel testified that although he was present in the room, he did not take part in that conversation, that the comment was directed to the prosecutors, and that he could not imagine a situation in which he would be on the same side as a judge during a proceeding. Respondent then informed the parties that he was intending to recuse himself when he took the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 14} In order to locate the 83-year old witness, respondent told his bailiff that he was issuing an Amber Alert, which is an emergency-alert program designed to locate abducted children by coordinating efforts between law enforcement and the media. Respondent asked the bailiff to inform the media of the Amber Alert, and members of the local media came to respondent\u2019s courtroom. Respondent intended to saturate the local area with information to gain the help of the public in locating the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 15} However, before going on the record, respondent was notified that the elderly woman had been located. The detective who had been looking for the witnesses had contacted the dialysis center where he knew the older woman was scheduled to be on Fridays after he had heard that respondent thought that she had been kidnapped. The dialysis center informed the detective that the woman had been at the dialysis center that morning but had since left.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 16} With the media who responded to the Amber Alert present, respondent went on the record: \u201cI\u2019ve called my friends in the media, and I\u2019ve asked them to be here because I thought we were going to need their help, and I still do think we need their help to find witnesses in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent continued: \u201cI want to make a record, because it\u2019s very important in this case. * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe victim in this case \u2014 one of the victims in this case is * * * [name of the elderly victim]. I don\u2019t know her. I haven\u2019t met her. I don\u2019t know where she lives, but I do know that she\u2019s 83 years old and allegedly had her hip broken by this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: She didn\u2019t have her hip broken by me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to tell you something right now. I\u2019m not here to hear from you, and if you make one more comment to me, I\u2019m going to have you bound and gagged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 21} Respondent outlined the basic facts of the case and explained that the caregiver said that she had been smoking crack and drinking with the defendant when a fight broke out over money and the defendant assaulted the two women. Respondent declared, \u201cThis defendant is presumed innocent,\u201d and he described the progress of the trial to that point, including the failure of the women to appear. Respondent explained that he had continued the trial the day before without impaneling a jury so that jeopardy would not attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent continued, \u201c[A]s of 9:30 this morning as we prepared to try this case, we did not have witnesses, and we have some very tough decisions to make. Because if this case was dismissed after we impanel the jury, we cannot retry the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cBut perhaps more importantly, if this case was dismissed, [the defendant] has to be returned to our community and I am not prepared to do that at this time, because we have issues as to the care and protection of the 83 year old woman. And as of 9:30 this morning, we have no idea where she is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cNow we have learned within the last 45 minutes that [the elderly victim] is today in dialysis, but we still cannot find [the caregiver], [The caregiver] is a most crucial witness in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cAnd I have to step out of my role now as being a fair and impartial Judge and indicate that I have become an advocate in this case, an advocate for justice. Because justice may be blind, but just has a heart, and it has a soul, and it has common sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cAnd I would bet my life on the fact that you, sir, have been involved in obstruction of justice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE COURT: \u2014 through [the caregiver].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And I also would bet my life, if I had to right now, that you have been involved in a technical kidnapping through [the caregiver].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s what I would bet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE COURT: You may object. You may object. That is this Court\u2019s finding, okay. It\u2019s not binding. And I\u2019m going to recuse myself from this case, because obviously I cannot be fair and impartial anymore, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cBut I felt it important to step out of my role as a Judge and to become an advocate to protect the well-being of an 83 year old woman who has no one else in this world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cAnd if nothing else, even if he\u2019s not convicted, we\u2019ll know this. We\u2019ll know where [the elderly victim] is, and she will be in safekeeping, because she\u2019s no longer going to be provided care by [the caregivex*], your friend who was smoking crack with you. She\u2019s not going to be in that household. Because [the caregiver] is going to be in the county jail and she\u2019s going to sit in the county jail until this case is tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cWhat\u2019s more important than me stepping off this case is that justice is done. There are 33 other wondex-ful Judges in this building that are willing to try you, and when you go to trial, I won\u2019t be surprised if you face obstructions of kidnapping [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 38} Respondent recognized the prosecutor, who stated that while he did not feel that the respondent had to recuse himself, he would understand if respondent did declare a mistrial. Respondent then asked if the state would like to move to continue the case until the caretaker had been incarcerated; the state indicated that it would.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 39} The defense attorney objected to the continuance because earlier that morning, the prosecution had been willing to dismiss the case. The defense attorney ax-gued that the prosecution had other witnesses and that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial would be violated if the txial did not move foxward.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 40} Respondent then responded by saying: \u201cAll right. Thanks * * *, I appx-eciate that.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cYou know, what is paramount, even more important than a speedy trial, even more important than the effective administration of justice, what\u2019s even more important is the integrity of the system. And there are so many unusual circumstances that have occurred during this case, including the role I had to take on to address this issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">{\u00b6 42} Respondent explained that he was going to recuse himself and that the defendant would stay in jail. Then respondent challenged \u201cthe law enforcement of the community and of the City of Cleveland, and in Cuyahoga County and in the State of Ohio to find [the caregiver] and have her incarcerated\u201d to determine \u201cwhether this defendant was involved in the disappearance of this 83 year old woman yesterday.\u201d Respondent added, \u201cAnd I suspect when all said is done, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>that\u2019s exactly what they are going to find out, because I have [the defendant\u2019s] rap sheet right here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">{\u00b6 43} The defense attorney then moved to dismiss the case with prejudice. Respondent denied the motion and declared a mistrial with respect to the jury members who had been selected. He repeated his intention to recuse himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 44} Respondent returned to his chambers with members of the media and, in response to a question, stated: \u201c[S]ometimes you get checked into the boards and sometimes you gotta check somebody else into the boards, but I\u2019m not going to sit idly by and dismiss this case. If I dismiss this case, [the defendant] wins and he could be out on the streets of our community tonight. He could be at this elderly woman\u2019s house again, smoking crack again. And that\u2019s not going to happen on my watch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 45} Eventually, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of felonious assault before a different judge and received a sentence of two years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Rules of Professional Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 46} The board found that the actions taken by respondent in this case violated former Canons 2, 3(B)(5), and 3(B)(9) of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d). Respondent filed objections to the board\u2019s final report. Two of the objections are general evidentiary issues and will be addressed before discussion of each violation and the related objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">{\u00b6 47} Prior to the disciplinary hearing, the panel issued a pretrial order refusing to allow several witnesses to testify as experts on behalf of respondent. Respondent proposed to have the witnesses interpret the Code of Judicial Conduct and give their opinion whether respondent had violated the code in this case. At the hearing, the panel again refused to allow these witnesses to testify as experts, and respondent proffered the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">{\u00b6 48} Respondent objected to the panel\u2019s decision not to admit the testimony from these witnesses on the ground that the decision denied him a fair hearing. Respondent argued that numerous courts in the United States have admitted expert testimony in disciplinary hearings against judges and lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">{\u00b6 49} We review a decision on the admission of expert testimony under an abuse-of-discretion standard. See <em>Scott v. Yates </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 219, 221, 643 N.E.2d 105. Citing Evid.R. 702, the panel found that the expert testimony would not have provided information that was beyond the panel\u2019s understanding and knowledge of the Code of Judicial Conduct. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Karto </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 109, 113, 760 N.E.2d 412, we held that expert testimony was properly excluded because the panel was qualified to determine whether a judge had abused his contempt power. In this case, it was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>abuse of discretion to exclude the expert testimony, because the panel was capable of interpreting and applying the Code of Judicial Conduct without an expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 50} In the pretrial order, the panel also refused to admit transcripts of jailhouse telephone conversations between the defendant and the caregiver. The transcripts were proffered into evidence at the disciplinary hearing. The panel refused to admit the transcripts on the ground that they were irrelevant to the charges against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 51} Respondent objects to the exclusion of these recordings. He argues that the exclusion of the transcripts deprived him of a fair hearing because it did not allow him to introduce all relevant evidence of the context in which he made his decisions. This objection has no merit, because respondent was not even aware that the jailhouse recordings existed at the time of the trial. The panel did not abuse its discretion by excluding this irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\n<em>Violations of Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 52} Former Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states, \u201cA judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d 103 Ohio St.3d XCVII. The commentary to this section indicates that \u201c[a]ctual improprieties under this standard include violations of law, court rules or other specific provisions of this Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">{\u00b6 53} The board found that respondent violated Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct by making factual findings that the defendant had obstructed justice or committed a kidnapping when those findings were not based on evidence before respondent. He announced on the record that he would \u201cbet his life\u201d that the defendant had committed one of these crimes. The board concluded that respondent\u2019s comments about the case and the defendant, both on and off the record, did not promote confidence in his integrity and impartiality. The board found that respondent also violated Canon 2 by misusing the Amber Alert system and the media\u2019s responsiveness to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">{\u00b6 54} Respondent objects to the finding that he violated Canon 2. He argues that he had a legally sufficient basis for drawing the conclusion that the defendant had kept the victims from appearing and that the elderly victim was in danger. Therefore, he was justified in not holding a hearing before declaring a mistrial sua sponte, issuing a bench warrant to enforce a subpoena, and recusing himself from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">{\u00b6 55} Although respondent may have appropriately recused himself due to his suspicions about the defendant, his recusal did not excuse the highly prejudicial and unnecessary comments he directed toward the defendant both before and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>after the recusal decision. Respondent did not have any evidence before him or hold a hearing before announcing his judicial findings on the record. Respondent found that the defendant had caused the mistrial by preventing the witnesses from appearing merely on suspicion. As he later testified, he didn\u2019t know \u201cif it would have been possible to prove [any misconduct] by clear and convincing evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d A finding of fact must be based on evidence; to find that contemptuous conduct has occurred outside the presence of the court, the court must hold a hearing and analyze record evidence. See, e.g., <em>State v. Local Union 5760, United Steelworkers of Am. </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 75, 79, 15 O.O.2d 133, 173 N.E.2d 331 (before making a finding of indirect contempt, hearing and notice are required).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">{\u00b6 56} In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Medley, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 251, 2004-Ohio-6402, 819 N.E.2d 273, we sanctioned a judge for deciding the merits of legal issues without first hearing from both parties. In this case, respondent considered no evidence. Although respondent wanted to make a stand against what he perceived as witness intimidation, he could not \u201cblatantly disregard procedural rules simply to accomplish what he * * * unilaterally considered] to be a speedier or more efficient administration of justice.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">{\u00b6 57} Respondent also objects on the ground that he could not have violated Canon 2 for improperly issuing an Amber Alert because the Amber Alert was never officially issued. Although respondent is correct that an Amber Alert was never officially issued because he did not have the authority to do so, he did have his bailiff contact the media to tell them he was issuing such an alert. Respondent admits that he had thought that issuing an Amber Alert might not have been appropriate in this case, but he testified that it \u201c[d]idn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d His misuse of the name of the service, in his judicial role, to attract media attention eroded public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and thus violated Canon 2. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Hoague </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 321, 323, 725 N.E.2d 1108, we found a violation of Canon 2 when a judge sent improper and intimidating letters on court letterhead to force individuals to appear before him on matters not before the court to achieve \u201chis personal goal of reprimanding persons he believed were guilty of reckless driving.\u201d Here, respondent used the Amber Alert system in a similar improper fashion by having his bailiff contact the media to achieve his goal of gaining media attention, despite knowing that he probably did not have the authority to issue that alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>Violations of Canon 3(B)(5) of the Code of Judicial Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 58} Canon 3(B)(5) of the former Code of Judicial Conduct states, \u201cA judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice. A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice * * 78 Ohio St.3d CLXXIII. We have defined bias or prejudice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>judicial context as behavior that \u201c \u2018implies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism towards one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Cleary </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 191, 201, 754 N.E.2d 235, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 59} The board found that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Canon 3(B)(5) because he exhibited clear prejudice against the defendant during the proceedings. He manifested that bias in his speech, accusing the defendant of unproven acts such as obstruction of justice, kidnapping, and smoking crack. He also threatened to have the defendant bound and gagged, proclaimed that he was on the \u201csame team\u201d with the prosecution in the matter, and explained his behavior by saying that \u201csometimes you got to check somebody else into the boards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 60} The board also found that respondent manifested his bias in his conduct, denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice <em>after </em>he had announced to the media-filled courtroom that he was no longer able to act as a fair and impartial judge, that he was acting as an advocate, and that he was recusing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">{If 61} Respondent\u2019s bias was apparent when he told the media that he would not dismiss the case because the defendant then \u201cwins.\u201d His bias was further confirmed at the disciplinary hearing when he testified that he viewed his actions as confronting the defendant\u2019s \u201cevil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 62} Respondent argues that his words and conduct merely supported his decision to declare a mistrial and to recuse himself; thus, they did not manifest bias, because every judicial decision is naturally in favor of one party and against another. This argument passes over the fact that respondent\u2019s words and conduct manifested a hostile feeling and a spirit of ill will and that he continued to rule on defense counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss the case even after he had admittedly stepped out of his role as a fair and impartial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 63} Respondent next argues that the impermissible bias or prejudice in Canon 3(B)(5) is limited to the extrajudicial sources listed in the Canon, such as race, gender, and religion. Canon 3(B)(5) states that impermissible judicial bias includes but is <em>not limited to </em>these listed sources of bias. We have rejected the argument that bias must be rooted in a listed extrajudicial source to constitute a violation of Canon 3(B)(5). See <em>Cleary, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 202, 754 N.E.2d 235. Regardless of the source of the bias, respondent impermissibly acted in a way that implied a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill-will\u201d toward the defendant, instead of approaching the matter with an \u201copen state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d See id. at 201, 754 N.E.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\n<em>Violations of Canon 3(B)(9) of the Code of Judicial Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">{\u00b6 64} Former Canon 3(B)(9) states, \u201cWhile a proceeding is pending or impending in any court, a judge shall not make any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect its outcome or impair its fairness * * 78 Ohio St.3d CLXXIV. However, judges are not prohibited \u201cfrom making public statements in the course of their official duties or from explaining for public information the procedures-of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 65} The board found that respondent violated Canon 3(B)(9) when he made statements accusing the defendant of unproven misconduct and when he told the defendant that he would personally see to it that anyone involved in obstruction of justice would be indicted, convicted, and given the maximum sentence. The board found that these statements could reasonably be expected to impair the fairness of any future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 66} Respondent objects to the conclusion that he violated Canon 3(B)(9), arguing that he made many of his comments in the course of his official duties while on the bench and that the discussion in chambers with the media was merely designed to explain court procedures. However, the exception in Canon 3(B)(9) clarifies that it does not prohibit all public comments but only those public comments that reasonably can be expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of proceedings. Respondent\u2019s statements that he was checking the defendant \u201cinto the boards\u201d and that he would not let the defendant out of jail to go smoke crack again were adversarial in nature, not a description of court procedure. Therefore, respondent\u2019s public comments could reasonably be expected to impact the fairness of the defendant\u2019s continuing case.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 67} Respondent also objects to the conclusion that he violated Canon 3(B)(9) on the ground that no evidence was presented that a reasonable judge would have found that the defendant\u2019s expectation of a fair trial was violated. The standard found in Canon 3(B)(9) is one of an objective expectation. When analyzing Canon 2, we have found that it is unnecessary for Disciplinary Counsel to submit public-opinion polls to show that the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary was actually undermined by a judge\u2019s behavior. See <em>In re Complaint Against Harper </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 211, 217, 673 N.E.2d 1253. Likewise, there is no need here to submit evidence that other jurists would have found that respondent\u2019s actions violated a defendant\u2019s expectation of a fair trial to prove a violation of Canon 3(B)(9). The panel heard sufficient evidence to determine that respondent\u2019s actions \u201cmight reasonably be expected to affect\u201d the outcome or fairness of the proceedings against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\n<em>Violations of Prof Cond.R. 8.4(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">{\u00b6 68} Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) states, \u201c[I]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to * * * engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>We have interpreted the phrase \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u201d when disciplining a judge, to be \u201cconduct that would appear to an objective observer to be unjudicial and prejudicial to the public esteem for the judicial office.\u201d <em>Cleary, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 206, 754 N.E.2d 235 (interpreting DR 1-102(A)(5), Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d)\u2019s predecessor). A demonstrated bias on the part of a judge, and the failure to show the integrity and independence of the judiciary, will result in violations of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d). See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Parker, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 64, 2007-Ohio-5635, 876 N.E.2d 556, \u00b6 12, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 69} The board concluded that respondent\u2019s on-the-record treatment of the defendant was both unjudicial and prejudicial to the esteem for the office. Based primarily on the conduct discussed in the sections concerning respondent\u2019s violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, the treatment of the defendant was found to be unfair, to demonstrate a bias on the part of respondent, and to undermine the integrity and independence of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 70} Respondent objects to the finding that he violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) and argues that his actions furthered, instead of prejudiced, the administration of justice. For instance, respondent argues that when he said he would see to it that anyone who obstructed justice would be indicted and convicted and would receive a maximum sentence, he was merely discussing his judicial philosophy and sending a strong statement against witness intimidation. Respondent did not simply articulate his judicial philosophy. He promised to take actions that would have been unethical for him to take: respondent later admitted that he could not have presided over the case had he been involved in procuring the indictment, because he would have been a witness against the defendant. These comments did not enhance the administration of justice; his blurring of the judicial role and his lack of neutrality were prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 71} Respondent also argues that he was justified in putting his findings that the defendant had obstructed justice or kidnapped the witnesses on the record before recusing himself. As we noted in the discussion of the violation of Canon 3(B)(5) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, the comments made by respondent went far beyond those necessary for recusal. The recusal itself was not inappropriate, but the comments made throughout the trial made respondent appear to be biased and prejudiced against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">{\u00b6 72} Finally, respondent argues that disciplining him for taking decisive action against obstruction of justice would be irresponsible because a judge should be able to protect witnesses. He quotes <em>State v. Busch </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 613, 615-616, 669 N.E.2d 1125, making the argument that \u201c[tjrial courts deserve the discretion to be able to craft a solution that works in a given case.\u201d Unlike the trial judge in <em>Busch, </em>however, respondent did not act based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>evidence before him. Instead, respondent acted on emotion, or what he termed \u201ccommon sense and Psychology 101,\u201d rather than on evidence and careful deliberation. Our decision does not prevent judges from protecting witnesses, but it does require a judge to do so while acting impartially and within the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 73} Therefore, we adopt the board\u2019s conclusions and find that respondent committed the violations as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 74} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider all relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer has violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">{\u00b6 75} The board found that the factors mitigating respondent\u2019s conduct included the lack of a prior disciplinary record, BCGD Proc.Reg. (10)(B)(2)(a), an absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, (10)(B)(2)(b), his full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board, (10)(B)(2)(d), and respondent\u2019s good character and reputation, (10)(B)(2)(e). Additionally, the board found that the defendant suffered no actual prejudice, because the plea bargain he had accepted was more favorable to him than the offer he had received while the case was in front of respondent. The board found that the factors in aggravation included respondent\u2019s refusal to acknowledge any misconduct and his attempt to portray himself as a victim of persecution by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel because he had previously criticized that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">{\u00b6 76} The panel recommended a sanction of a public reprimand after considering all the aggravating and mitigating factors. The board, troubled by respondent\u2019s inability to carry out his duty to decide a matter based on properly admitted evidence in a fair and impartial manner and his refusal to acknowledge his misconduct, recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for one year with the entire year stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">{\u00b6 77} We do not adopt either of the proposed sanctions and instead impose a six-month suspension, with all six months stayed. Like the judge who received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>six-month stayed suspension for a single violation of former Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Hoague, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 321, 725 N.E.2d 1108, respondent\u2019s misconduct was isolated. Respondent may have felt strongly about the defendant\u2019s supposed violations of law. As in <em>Hoague, </em>however, a judge is not excused from complying with the judicial canons. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ferreri </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 649, 710 N.E.2d 1107, we imposed an 18-month suspension, with 12 months stayed, but the stricter sanction imposed in <em>Ferreri </em>need not be imposed here. The judge in <em>Ferreri </em>clearly intended to influence public opinion. In comparison, the board in this matter found that respondent truly believed that he was protecting the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">{\u00b6 78} Respondent objected to the board\u2019s recommended sanction as well as the weight and consideration the board gave to mitigating factors. He claims that the board did not give proper consideration to his belief that Article I, Section 10a of the Ohio Constitution, which provides that victims of criminal offenses shall be accorded fairness, dignity, and respect, required him to consider the safety of the witnesses. He argues that the language in the Preamble to the Code of Judicial Conduct makes this a case in which discipline is not appropriate, or in which a public reprimand is the strictest sanction warranted, because he acted with good faith and preserved the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The Preamble states, \u201cIt is not intended, however, that every transgression will result in disciplinary action\u201d and that factors such \u201cas the seriousness of the transgression, whether there is a pattern of improper activity and the effect of the improper activity on others or on the judicial system\u201d and the protection of the public should determine whether discipline is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 79} We have already concluded that respondent\u2019s actions did not further the integrity of the judicial proceedings. Although judges should protect witnesses, they must do so within the law and the ethical rules. Respondent\u2019s argument that he had a good motive for his actions in wanting to protect the witnesses from harm has been rejected in past cases. \u201c[SJtrong feelings do not excuse a judge from complying with the judicial canons and the Disciplinary Rules.\u201d <em>Ferreri, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 654, 710 N.E.2d 1107. Therefore, despite his strong feelings and the motivation respondent claims for his actions, this case is one that warrants discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 80} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the suspension is stayed on the condition that he commit no further misconduct during the stayed suspension period. If respondent violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>this condition, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the six-month suspension.
