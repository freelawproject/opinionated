Because the board of elections neither abused its discretion nor clearly disregarded applicable law by determining that the recall petition contained a sufficient number of valid signatures, we deny the writ of prohibition. We dismiss the mandamus claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">\n<em>Recall Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, M. Jane Murray, is the mayor of the city of Portsmouth, Ohio. On October 9, 2010, a petition seeking an election to recall the mayor was filed with the city. The petitioners sought the recall based on their claims against the mayor specified in the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cEPA compliance issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cArbitrary/unlawful placement of traffic control devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-17\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cCame out against the best hope for jobs and future security for area families at the Piketon USEC facility by casting the only negative vote to their plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-18\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cPlacing her own personal wants ahead of the other city employees working under deplorable conditions in the city building by arbitrarily and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>unlawfully contracting prior to taking office, and after taking office having renovations done to the Mayor\u2019s office without having funds authorized and appropriated in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and Portsmouth City ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cFailure to provide a budget for the city of Portsmouth in accordance with the City Charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMaking public remarks about persons that have resulted in three lawsuits having been filed against her and the City of Portsmouth alleging slander and libel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 9} The petition comprises 66 part-petitions containing a total of 1,368 signatures. Each part-petition includes a space for the circulator\u2019s affidavit, which provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cI,_, being duly sworn, depose and say that I, and I only personally circulated the foregoing petition paper and that all signatures appended thereto were made in my presence and are the genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">\u201cSubscribed and sworn before me this_day of-, 20\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">\u201cNotary Public</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">\u201c(seal)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 11} Each part-petition also included the following \u201cnotice\u201d: \u201cWhoever commits election falsification is guilty of a felony of the fifth degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">{\u00b6 12} On part-petition 5, which contains seven signatures found by the Portsmouth city clerk to be valid, the circulator signed the first blank of the affidavit but failed to sign the second blank. For part-petition 2, the Portsmouth city clerk credited 15 valid signatures even though it contained only 14 valid signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">{\u00b6 13} On October 20, 2010, the city clerk certified the sufficiency of the recall petition by finding that it contained 1,171 valid signatures, which exceeded the 1,148 valid signatures required by Section 151 of the Portsmouth Charter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a recall petition. On October 28, the Portsmouth City Council enacted Ordinance No. 2010-69, which ordered that a special election on the mayoral recall be held on December 7, 2010. The next day, the city clerk provided a certified copy of the ordinance to the Scioto County Board of Elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\n<em>Protest and Board of Elections Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 14} On October 29, Murray filed a protest with the board of elections against the recall petition. Murray raised several grounds, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 15} 1. \u201cAll part-petitions fail to contain a statement by the circulator indicating the number of signatures on the part-petition as required by Sections 143 and 165 of the City of Portsmouth Charter (\u2018Charter\u2019) and R.C. \u00a7 3501.38(E) and are invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 16} 2. \u201cAll part-petitions fail to contain a statement by the circulator as required by Sections 143 and 165 of the Charter and R.C. \u00a7 3501.38(E) that to the best of the circulator\u2019s knowledge and belief all signers were qualified to sign the petition and are invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 17} 3. \u201cPart-petition 5 is invalid because it is not signed by the circulator as required by Sections 27, 143, and 165 of the Charter and R.C. \u00a7 3501.38.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 18} 4. \u201cThe petition fails to contain the minimum number of valid signatures of electors of the City of Portsmouth required by Section 151 of the Charter for the question to be submitted to the voters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 19} On that same day, the board of elections issued a notice that a hearing on the protest would be held on November 8. On November 5, 2010, Murray supplemented her protest with several additional grounds, including that the city clerk had mistakenly counted one invalid signature on part-petition 2 as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">{\u00b6 20} Just before the board\u2019s November 8 hearing on Murray\u2019s protest against the recall petition, the committee representing the recall petitioners filed its own protest, claiming that the city clerk had erroneously stricken three signatures from the petition. Murray objected to the board\u2019s hearing of the recall petitioners\u2019 protest on that date due to the protest\u2019s lack of timeliness. The board decided not to consider the recall petitioners\u2019 claim at the hearing, instead leaving it in abeyance until the board\u2019s November 17 regular meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">{\u00b6 21} At the November 8 board hearing on Murray\u2019s protest, the parties submitted sworn testimony and other evidence. The board sustained certain grounds of Murray\u2019s protest and invalidated an additional 16 petition signatures. The board denied the remaining grounds of Murray\u2019s protest, including those previously set forth. The board concluded that the recall petition contained a total of 1,155 valid signatures, which still exceeded the minimum of 1,148 valid signatures required for the December 7, 2010 special recall election.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\n<em>Mandamus and Prohibition Case and Subsequent Board Meeting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">{\u00b6 22} Four days later, on November 12, Murray filed this expedited election action for writs of mandamus and prohibition to prevent the board of elections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>and its members from submitting the mayoral recall to the electorate at the December 7, 2010 special election. We issued an accelerated schedule for the submission of an answer, evidence, and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Murray v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1433, 2010-Ohio-5534, 936 N.E.2d 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 23} On November 17, at its regular meeting, the board of elections corrected its tabulation of valid signatures in the recall petition by deducting the additional signature the city clerk had mistakenly counted as valid on Part-Petition 2, which was one of the grounds of Murray\u2019s protest, and adding the three signatures that the city clerk had previously stricken, which were the subject of the recall committee\u2019s November 8 protest. The board validated the three additional signatures when it determined that they were the signatures of the electors they purported to be. The board thus concluded that the correct number of valid signatures on the recall petition was 1,157, which exceeded the 1,148 signatures required. The board made this determination without holding an additional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 24} The board of elections and its members filed an answer, and the parties submitted evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 25} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 26} Murray requests a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to sustain the specified grounds of her protest and to invalidate the recall petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThis court lacks jurisdiction over complaints in mandamus if the allegations establish that the relator actually requests relief in the nature of a declaratory judgment and a prohibitory injunction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Knowlton v. Noble Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 483, 2010-Ohio-4450, 935 N.E.2d 395, \u00b6 29. \u201cWe have applied this jurisdictional rule to expedited election cases by examining the complaint to determine whether it actually seeks to prevent, rather than compel, official action.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 437, 2006-Ohio-5439, 857 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">{\u00b6 28} Athough some of the allegations and requests for relief in Murray\u2019s complaint are couched in terms of compelling affirmative duties, she actually seeks (1) a declaratory judgment that the board erred in denying the specified grounds of her protest and (2) a prohibitory injunction preventing the recall election.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, because Murray seeks relief in the nature of declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of her mandamus claim and therefore dismiss it. See <em>Knowlton </em>at \u00b6 31; <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>rel. Stewart v. Clinton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 584, 2010-Ohio-1176, 925 N.E.2d 601, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\n<em>Prohibition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 30} Muiray also requests a writ of prohibition to prevent the board of elections and its members from submitting the mayoral recall to the electorate. To be entitled to the writ, Murray must establish that (1) the board of elections and its members are about to exercise quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Eshleman v. Fornshell, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-1175, 925 N.E.2d 609, \u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 31} Murray established the first and third requirements for the writ because the board of elections exercised quasi-judicial authority by ruling on her protest after a hearing that included sworn testimony, and she lacks an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law given the proximity of the December 7 special election. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 32} For the remaining requirement to establish entitlement to the requested writ of prohibition, \u201c[i]n extraordinary actions challenging the decisions of * * * boards of elections, the standard is whether they engaged in fraud, corruption, or abuse of discretion, or acted in clear disregard of applicable legal provisions.\u201d <em>Whitman v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 216, 2002-Ohio-5923, 778 N.E.2d 32, \u00b6 11; <em>State ex rel. Ross v. Crawford Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 438, 2010-Ohio-2167, 928 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 33} Murray claims that the board of elections abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law, including R.C. 3501.38(E) and certain provisions of the Portsmouth Charter, by not sustaining certain grounds of her protest and invalidating the recall petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">R.C. 3501.38(E)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">{\u00b6 34} Murray first contends that the petition was defective because each part-petition did not comply with R.C. 3501.38, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAll declarations of candidacy, nominating petitions, or other petitions presented to or filed with the secretary of state or a board of elections or with any other public office for the purpose of becoming a candidate for any nomination or office or for the holding of an election on any issue shall, in addition to meeting the other specific requirements prescribed in the sections of the Revised Code relating to them, be governed by the following rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>{\u00b6 37} \u201c(E)(1) On each petition paper, the circulator shall indicate the number of signatures contained on it, and shall sign a statement made under penalty of election falsification that the circulator witnessed the affixing of every signature, that all signers were to the best of the circulator\u2019s knowledge and belief qualified to sign, and that every signature is to the best of the circulator\u2019s knowledge and belief the signature of the person whose signature it purports to be or of an attorney in fact acting pursuant to section 3501.382 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 38} Murray contends that the petition did not comply with R.C. 3501.38(E)(1), because each circulator statement (1) did not \u201cindicate the number of signatures contained on it\u201d and (2) did not specify that \u201call signers were to the best of the circulator\u2019s knowledge and belief qualified to sign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 39} Noncompliance with either of these statutory requirements normally requires invalidation of the part-petitions. See, e.g., <em>Rust v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 139, 2005-Ohio-5795, 841 N.E.2d 766, \u00b6 11-13 (board of elections did not err in invalidating petition because circulator statements specified numbers less than the actual numbers of signatures contained on the part-petitions); <em>State ex rel. Commt. for Referendum of Lorain Ordinance No. 77-01 v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 308, 2002-Ohio-4194, 774 N.E.2d 239, \u00b6 49 (\u201cR.C. 3501.38(E) demands strict compliance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 40} Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n matters of local self-government, if a portion of a municipal charter expressly conflicts with a parallel state law, the charter provisions will prevail.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lightfield v. Indian Hill </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 441, 442, 633 N.E.2d 524; Sections 3 and 7, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution. Therefore, although we will construe municipal charters to give effect to all separate provisions and to harmonize them with statutory provisions whenever possible, see <em>State ex rel. Finkbeiner v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 462, 2009-Ohio-3657, 912 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 31, we will not do so when there is a conflict. <em>State ex rel. Ditmars v. McSweeney </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 472, 475, 764 N.E.2d 971; see also Portsmouth Charter, Sections 143 (\u201cthe provisions of the general election laws of the State shall apply to all such elections <em>except as otherwise provided by this Charter </em>\u201d [emphasis added]) and 165 (\u201cAll general laws of the State applicable to municipal corporations, now or hereafter enacted, and <em>which are not in conflict with the provisions of this Charter </em>* * * shall be applicable to this City\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 41} Notwithstanding the requirements of R.C. 3501.38(E)(1) detailing the contents of a circulator statement for each petition paper, Section 27 of the Portsmouth Charter provides otherwise by requiring that each petition paper instead include the specified circulator affidavit, which affidavit must be strictly construed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe affidavit attached to each petition paper shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>{\u00b6 43} \u201cState of Ohio,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cCounty of Scioto, SS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cI,_, being duly sworn, depose and say that I, and I only personally circulated the foregoing petition paper and that all the signatures appended thereto were made in my presence and are the genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201cSigned _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\u201cSubscribed and sworn to before me this_day of_, 19_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201cNotary Public</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe foregoing affidavit shall be strictly construed and any affiant convicted of swearing falsely as regards any particular thereof shall be guilty of perjury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 47} In effect, the specific Section 27 circulator affidavit for municipal initiative, referendum, and recall petitions in Portsmouth stands in lieu of the general state-law requirement of an R.C. 3501.38(E)(1) circulator statement for petitions. Section 27 of the Portsmouth Charter requires that each petition paper include a circulator affidavit made under penalty of perjury, a felony of the third degree, see R.C. 2921.11(F), that states that (1) the circulator personally circulated the petition paper, (2) all signatures appended thereto were made in the circulator\u2019s presence, and (3) the signatures are the genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">{\u00b6 48} The charter provision requiring strict construction of the affidavit evinces an unmistakable intent on the part of the Portsmouth electors who adopted it that no comparable state-law requirement regarding the circulator\u2019s statement on petitions is applicable. The affidavit required by the charter serves the same purpose as the statement required by statute-it prevents fraud by supplying the circulator\u2019s attestation that the circulator witnessed each of the signatures on the part-petition and that the signatures are genuine. In fact, until it was amended in 1974, R.C. 3501.38(E) likewise required a circulator <em>affidavit </em>instead of a circulator <em>statement </em>on each part-petition. See 135 Ohio Laws, Part II, 799. The charter provision, by its own terms, demands strict construction of the specified form of the circulator affidavit and prevails over the conflicting state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">{\u00b6 49} This result is consistent with precedent. In <em>Ditmars, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 475, 764 N.E.2d 971, we held that because Section 42 of the Columbus Charter \u201crequires circulator affidavits and [R.C. 3501.38(E) ] does not * * *, the charter provision prevails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>{\u00b6 50} Murray\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Finkbeiner, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 462, 2009-Ohio-3657, 912 N.E.2d 573, to claim that the circulator-affidavit requirement specified in Section 27 of the Portsmouth Charter does not conflict with the circulator-statement requirement of R.C. 3501.38(E), is misplaced. In <em>Finkbeiner, </em>we held that a recall petition that failed to include the R.C. 3501.38(J) election-falsification statement was defective because nothing in the Toledo Charter conflicted with that provision. <em>Finkbeiner </em>is distinguishable because in that case, the recall provisions of the Toledo Charter and other general petition-form requirements of the charter were silent on the requirement of an election-falsification statement. Id. at \u00b6 34. Further, Toledo voters had repealed the specific recall-petition requirements in 1934 and had rejected a 1959 amendment to reinstate those requirements. Id. No comparable facts are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 51} Notably, the Toledo Charter (1) did not specify a form for petitions that explicitly required strict construction and (2) did not expressly exclude the election-falsification statement. By contrast, Section 27 of the Portsmouth Charter specifies the complete form for the circulator affidavit for petitions and mandates strict construction of that form. And the mere fact that the petition here also included the R.C. 3501.38(J) election-falsification statement does not alter our conclusion. Although that statement would not apply to a petition circulator, who would be governed by the charter\u2019s requirement of an affidavit, subjecting the circulator to perjury for swearing falsely, R.C. 2921.13(A)(6), it would still be effective for any noncirculator committing election falsification regarding the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 52} Further, Murray\u2019s reliance on various other cases like <em>Rust </em>and <em>State ex rel. Macko v. Monzula </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 35, 2 O.O.3d 129, 356 N.E.2d 493, is also misplaced because these cases do not address any claimed conflict between R.C. 3501.38(E) and municipal charter provisions. Although Murray may disagree with whether the charter provision satisfies the fraud-prevention objective as well as its statutory counterpart, it was within the municipality\u2019s constitutional home-rule authority to resolve such policy concerns by adopting its own specific provision. \u201c[Njeither the wisdom nor the desirability of these [charter] provisions is subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fattlar v. Boyle </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 123, 127, 698 N.E.2d 987; see also <em>State ex rel. Cater v. N. Olmsted </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 315, 324, 631 N.E.2d 1048, quoting <em>Fuldauer v. Cleveland </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 114, 118, 61 O.O.2d 374, 290 N.E.2d 546 (\u201cthe feasibility or wisdom of charter provisions is \u2018not a matter for our consideration\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 53} Therefore, the board of elections neither abused its discretion nor clearly disregarded applicable law by denying Murray\u2019s protest premised on the recall petition\u2019s purported failure to comply with R.C. 3501.38(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Mathematical Error</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">{\u00b6 54} The board of elections concedes that it abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law by initially denying Murray\u2019s protest concerning part-petition 2. The clerk determined that the part-petition contained 15 valid signatures, but she erroneously counted as valid one of the signatures that had been crossed out. The board later corrected this mistake at its November 17 meeting. Therefore, insofar as Murray seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the board to correct this mistake, her claim has now been rendered moot. See <em>State ex rel. Law Office of Montgomery Cty. Public Defender v. Rosencrans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-5793, 856 N.E.2d 250, \u00b6 15 (\u201cSubsequent performance of the act requested in the mandamus action generally renders the action moot\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. </em>Kelly, 123 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-5259, 915 N.E.2d 1223, \u00b6 1 (\u201cMandamus will not compel the performance of an act that has already been performed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Section 27 Signature Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 55} Murray finally contends that the board of elections erred in failing to sustain her protest against part-petition 5 because it was not signed by the circulator in the blank required by Section 27 of the Portsmouth Charter. Part-petition 5 contained seven valid signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 56} At its regular meeting on November 17, which occurred after this case was instituted but before the board of elections and its members filed their answer, the board of elections revised its previous determination that the recall petition contained 1,155 valid signatures by deducting from this total the signature on part-petition 2 that Murray had protested and by adding three signatures that had been invalidated by the city clerk and had been the subject of the recall committee\u2019s November 8 protest. This resulted in the board\u2019s November 17 finding that the recall petition contained 1,157 valid signatures, which exceeded the minimum of 1,148 valid signatures required for the recall election by nine signatures. Although this fact was not evident at the time that Murray commenced this expedited election case, we consider it because it is relevant to Murray\u2019s claims. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Lemmerman, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 296, 2010-Ohio-137, 921 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>State ex rel. Portage Lakes Edn. Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 533, 2002-Ohio-2839, 769 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 54 (\u201c \u2018in mandamus actions, a court is not limited to considering the facts and circumstances at the time a proceeding is instituted but should consider the facts and conditions at the time it determines whether to issue a peremptory writ\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 57} In her reply brief, Murray asserts that the board of elections abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law by granting the recall commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tee\u2019s protest and validating the three signatures that the clerk had invalidated. She claims that the board erred by considering the merits of the untimely protest without holding a hearing. Murray\u2019s initial merit brief, however, which was filed six days after the board\u2019s November 17 revision of the number of total valid signatures and five days after the board of elections and its members relied on this decision in their answer, includes no argument concerning this contention. The parties\u2019 stipulated facts, which were filed on the same date as Murray\u2019s initial merit brief, also included evidence of the board\u2019s November 17 revised determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 58} Because Murray could have raised this argument in her initial merit brief but failed to do so, we do not address this claim. See <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 61 (relators in expedited election case were forbidden to raise new argument in their reply brief that was not raised in their initial merit brief); <em>State ex rel. Ohio Liberty Council v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 315, 2010-Ohio-1845, 928 N.E.2d 410, \u00b6 61 (court, in an election-related writ case, will not address request for relief that was raised in relators\u2019 complaint and resuscitated in reply brief, but was not included in their initial merit brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 59} Moreover, even if Murray\u2019s contention concerning part-petition 5 is correct, the number of valid petition signatures would be reduced from 1,157 to 1,150, which is still more than the 1,148 signatures required for the recall election. \u201c[W]e will not issue advisory opinions, and this rule applies equally to election cases.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Barletta v. Fersch, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 295, 2003-Ohio-3629, 791 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 22; <em>State ex rel. LetOhioVote.org v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 420, 2010-Ohio-1895, 928 N.E.2d 1066, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 60} Murray finally claims that based on the specified grounds of her protest, she has thus established that the board of elections should have invalidated the recall petition because the petition failed to contain a sufficient number of valid signatures. But for the reasons previously set forth, she has failed to establish either an abuse of discretion or a clear disregard of applicable law by the board of elections that would result in an insufficient number of signatures on the recall petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 61} Therefore, Murray is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ of prohibition to prevent the recall election. We deny the writ of prohibition and dismiss the mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-10\">Pfeifer, Acting C.J., and Brogan, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b425-11\">Brogan, J., of the Second Appellate District, sitting for Brown, C.J.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A4y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>McTigue &amp; McGinnis, L.L.C., Donald J.
