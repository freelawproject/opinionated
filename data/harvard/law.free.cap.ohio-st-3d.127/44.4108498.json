The Franklin County auditor determined that a value that had been stipulated by the parties for tax year 2002 in a case pending before the BTA should be carried over to tax years 2005 and 2006. The auditor made that determination even though the stipulation occurred after the auditor had conducted the reappraisal for tax year 2005 and had already determined a lower value for the property for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">{\u00b6 2} When the owner objected to the carryover, the Franklin County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) upheld the auditor\u2019s determination, and thereafter, the BTA affirmed. The owner has appealed and argues that the auditor and the BOR should have retained the lower reappraisal valuation for tax years 2005 and 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">{\u00b6 3} We must decide whether the carryover provision of R.C. 5715.19(D) required the county auditor to undo the 2005 reappraisal retroactively and to use instead the value stipulated for tax year 2002 as the value for tax years 2005 and 2006. We conclude that the taxing authorities and the BTA erred, and we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant, AERC Saw Mill Village, Inc. (\u201cAERC\u201d), owns a 340-unit residential apartment complex that was constructed in 1986 on a 22.6-acre parcel located in the city of Columbus/Dublin City Schools taxing district. For tax year 2005, the Franklin County auditor performed the reappraisal of property in the county that R.C. 5713.01 requires every six years (the \u201csexennial reappraisal\u201d), and the auditor determined that the true value of AE RC\u2019s property was $17,900,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 5} Subsequently, in August 2006, AERC decided to settle a dispute concerning the value of the property for tax year 2002 by stipulating to a value of $20,100,000 for that year in BTA case No. 2005-M-377. The BTA adopted the stipulated value in a decision and order dated September 1, 2006. That decision ordered the auditor to \u201cadjust his tax records for January 1, 2002,\u201d in accordance with the stipulated taxable value of $7,035,00o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In accordance with the stipulation, the decision also ordered that the \u201cstipulated values be carried forward according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 6} After the BTA\u2019s decision, the auditor changed his valuation and assessment for tax year 2005. The auditor restated the value for 2005 at $20,100,000, based on the theory that the BTA decision required him to carry over the value stipulated for tax year 2002 to tax year 2005. As a matter of course, the 2005 value was also applied to tax year 2006, which was the next year of the new triennial period.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 7} Because the period for filing a complaint against 2005 valuation had expired at the end of March 2006, R.C. 5715.19(A)(1), AERC challenged the carryover for 2005 by a letter to the BOR that invoked the \u201ccontinuing complaint\u201d jurisdiction of the board pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(D). As for tax year 2006, AERC filed a valuation complaint on March 28, 2007, seeking to restore the reappraisal value of $17,900,000 for tax year 2006. The BOR held separate hearings for the two tax years, and at each hearing, counsel for AERC advanced the legal argument that the auditor should not have carried the 2002 valuation over to tax years 2005 and 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">{\u00b6 8} The BOR rejected AERC\u2019s contention as to both tax years. The BOR concluded that because AERC presented no affirmative evidence of value, the auditor\u2019s carryover of the $20,100,000 valuation should be retained. AERC appealed both decisions to the BTA. The appeals were consolidated. At the BTA, the parties waived a hearing and submitted the case on a stipulated evidentiary record that, in addition to the transcript certified by the BOR, consisted of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>county\u2019s formal responses to AERC\u2019s request for admissions, along with attached documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">{\u00b6 9} The BTA issued a single decision that addressed both tax years. <em>AERC Saw Mill Village, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Sept. 1, 2009), BTA Nos. 2007-A-764 and 2008-A-157, 2009 WL 2846576. Citing <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 305, 720 N.E.2d 517, and its own earlier decision in <em>David W. Swetland Bldg. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(June 30, 2005), BTA Nos. 2003-A-1183, 2003-A-1184, 2003-A-2107, and 2003-A-2108, 2005 WL 1618198, the BTA stated, \u201cWith no complaint filed for tax year 2005 to otherwise suspend the application of the carryover provision, we find that the Franklin County Auditor properly carried the values determined by the BTA for tax year 2002 forward into tax year 2005.\u201d <em>AERC Saw Mill Village, Inc., </em>at 7. With respect to tax year 2006, the BTA observed that AERC in essence sought to carry forward the reappraisal value that the auditor had originally determined for tax year 2005. Because AERC had presented no evidence in support of the lower number, the BTA concluded that the BOR properly retained the higher value for tax year 2006 as well. Id. at 8-9. AERC has appealed, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>The continuing-complaint provision of R.C. 5715.19(D) confemd jurisdiction on the BOR and the BTA to review the auditor\u2019s reappraisal and redetermination of value for tax year 2005</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AuI\">{\u00b6 10} Although no party has asserted a lack of jurisdiction for tax year 2005, the court has a duty to ensure that the tribunals below did have jurisdiction with respect to tax year 2005. As the BTA stated, AERC did not file a complaint regarding tax year 2005, but the filing of such a complaint was not necessary under the circumstances for the tribunals below to obtain jurisdiction. R.C. 5715.19(D) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIf a complaint filed under this section for the current year is not determined by the board within the time prescribed for such determination, the complaint and any proceedings in relation thereto shall be continued by the board as a valid complaint for any ensuing year until such complaint is finally determined by the board or upon any appeal from a decision of the board. In such case, the original complaint shall continue in effect without further filing by the original taxpayer, the original taxpayer\u2019s assignee, or any other person or entity authorized to file a complaint under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 12} This is known as the continuing-complaint provision, and its operation is triggered when the BOR does not issue a decision within the time frame set forth in R.C. 5715.19(C). We have summarized the operation of these divisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>statute by stating that \u201cwhen a board of revision has not rendered its decision within the statutorily prescribed 90 days, \u2018the complaint and any proceedings in relation thereto shall be continued by the board as a valid complaint for any ensuing year until such complaint is finally determined.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fogg-Akron Assoc., L.P. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 112, 2009-Ohio-6412, 919 N.E.2d 730, \u00b6 8, quoting R.C. 5715.19(D). Once the continuing-complaint provision has been triggered, the original complaint \u2014 in this case, the complaint filed for the 2002 tax year- \u2014 -continues as a valid complaint through the year in which the final decision, by the board of revision or on appeal, is rendered in the proceedings on that complaint. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 305, 307, 720 N.E.2d 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 13} From the foregoing, it follows that if the BOR in the 2002-tax-year case had issued its decision within 90 days of the filing of the valuation complaint pertaining to that earlier tax year, then the continuing-complaint provision would not apply. As a result, the BOR would not have had jurisdiction to consider the auditor\u2019s reappraisal for tax year 2005 or his decision to displace the reappraisal value with the stipulated value for 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 14} In the present case, no party has contended that the 90-day requirement was satisfied. Moreover, although the record in the tax-year-2002 case is not before us, we do not question the applicability of the continuing-complaint provision for two reasons. First, the presumption of regularity requires that we presume that the lower tribunals predicated their merits rulings upon a proper jurisdictional basis. <em>Dayton-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd,. of Revision, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Evatt </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 71, 28 O.O. 21, 54 N.E.2d 132, paragraph seven of the syllabus. Second, the BTA decision in the 2002-tax-year case bears a 2005 case number at the BTA, indicating that the BOR decision in the 2002 case was not appealed to the BTA until 2005. Because an aggrieved party must appeal a board of revision decision to the BTA within 30 days, R.C. 5717.01, it follows that the BOR issued its decision in late 2004 at the earliest. Therefore, the 2002 complaint was continued as a jurisdictionally viable means of reviewing property value in later years until tax year 2006 \u2014 the year when the 2002 value was finally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>The carryover provision of R.C. 5715.19(D) should be read in pari materia with the statutes that require the auditor to reappraise and update the valuation of real property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">{\u00b6 15} On the merits, this case presents the question whether R.C. 5715.19(D) required the auditor to use the 2002 stipulated value for tax year 2005. When a BTA decision is appealed, this court looks to see if that decision was reasonable and lawful. R.C. 5717.04; <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14. In reviewing a BTA decision under this standard, we acknowledge that \u201c \u2018[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u2019 this court will affirm them.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. On the other hand, the court \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. The issue of how to apply R.C. 5715.19(D) to the undisputed facts requires us to decide a purely legal issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 16} The starting point for that analysis is to examine the statutory language at issue. R.C. 5715.19(D) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cLiability for taxes and recoupment charges for such year and each succeeding year until the complaint is finally determined and for any penalty and interest for nonpayment thereof within the time required by law shall be based upon the determination, valuation, or assessment as finally determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 18} Appellee Dublin City Schools Board of Education urges that the auditor, the BOR, and the BTA correctly applied the quoted carryover language in this case. According to the school board, because the tax-year-2002 complaint was not \u201cfinally determined\u201d until the BTA decision in September 2006, the tax officials acted properly in carrying the stipulated 2002 value of $20,100,000 over to tax years 2005 and 2006. In response, AERC does not question the school board\u2019s reading of the statute but instead points to the auditor\u2019s duties under other statutes \u2014 duties that stand in potential conflict with the mandate that the redetermined value for an earlier tax year be carried over to the next year.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 19} As the county\u2019s tax assessor, the county auditor is required to value and assess property tax against the taxable property in the county. R.C. 5713.01(B) and 5713.03. Specifically, the auditor must reappraise property values once every six years and update the values at the interim three-year point. R.C. 5713.01(B), 5713.03, 5715.33, and 5715.24; Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-16(B); <em>Cleveland Mun. School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 404, 2005-Ohio-2285, 827 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 2. In addition to the periodically required adjustments, the auditor is under a standing duty to \u201crevalue and assess at any time all or any part of the real estate in such county * * * where the auditor finds that the true or taxable values thereof have changed.\u201d R.C. 5713.01(B). This duty might be triggered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>an arm\u2019s-length sale; the statutes require the auditor to consider the sale price to be the value of the property. R.C. 5713.03. Or the reporting of an improvement or casualty to the property might lead to a revaluation and reassessment. See <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 20} In this case, the auditor encountered potentially conflicting duties. Having carried out his statutory duty to reappraise the property at issue for tax year 2005, the auditor would have been led by the statutes to use and retain that value for 2005 and 2006. But instead, the auditor treated the 2006 stipulation of value for tax year 2002 as retroactively superseding the 2005 reappraisal value. AERC argues that this conflict in the auditor\u2019s duties under different statutes calls for a harmonizing construction that gives effect to the various statutes while avoiding absurd and unintended outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 21} We agree. To give full literal effect to the carryover provision and allow it to supersede the auditor\u2019s ongoing duty to value and revalue real property leads to the absurd result that the assessor arrived at in the present case. Here, a revaluation of the property for tax year 2005 was displaced by a different value stipulated for January 1, 2002, that no one had determined or agreed constituted the value on January 1, 2005, or January 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 22} To be sure, the carryover does properly apply to a subsequent year in which the auditor has <em>not </em>performed a new valuation of the property pursuant to his statutory duties. But to allow the carryover to displace a new valuation both defeats the purposes of the valuation statutes and thwarts the constitutional mandate that \u201c[l]and and improvements thereon\u201d be \u201ctaxed by uniform rule according to value.\u201d Section 2, Article XII, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 23} Our eases have recognized situations, both generally and in regard to construing R.C. 5715.19, in which conflicting statutes and competing mandates must be read in a manner designed to harmonize the different statutory provisions. See <em>Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 639, 642, 660 N.E.2d 1179 (construing \u201ccompeting portions\u201d of R.C. 5715.19 in a manner designed to \u201charmonize\u201d them); <em>United Tel. Co. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 369, 372, 643 N.E.2d 1129 (\u201cin reading such statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>and construing them together, this court must give such a reasonable construction as to give the proper force and effect to each and all such statutes\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Midway Motor Sales, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 234, 2009-Ohio-2610, 910 N.E.2d 432, \u00b6 25, citing <em>Maxfield v. Brooks </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 566, 144 N.E. 725, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Couts v. Rose </em>(1950), 152 Ohio St. 458, 461, 40 O.O. 482, 90 N.E.2d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 24} Indeed, our reasoning in <em>Cincinnati School Dist. </em>controls in the present case. In <em>Cincinnati, </em>the property value for 1989 had been challenged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>complaint and was adjusted on appeal. Meanwhile, the owner filed a new complaint for tax year 1990, which was the year of a triennial update in Hamilton County. The school board did not offer evidence of value below but argued on appeal that the valuation as determined on the 1989 complaint should be carried over to 1990. We disagreed, holding that \u201cthe filing of a valid new complaint in the second triennium stops, for the tax year at issue and succeeding years, the automatic carryover of the value determined under a prior complaint.\u201d 74 Ohio St.3d at 642-643, 660 N.E.2d 1179. Accord <em>Fogg-Akron Assoc., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 112, 2009-Ohio-6412, 919 N.E.2d 730, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 25} Just as the school board in the present case argues that the carryover provision trumps the 2005 sexennial appraisal, the board of education in <em>Cincinnati </em>contended that the plain language of the carryover provision trumped the board of revision\u2019s duty to hear the fresh complaint for the new triennium. We rejected that contention, finding that the owner\u2019s right to file a complaint for the new triennium potentially conflicted with the carryover and continuing-complaint provisions. That conflict necessitated a harmonizing construction, under which the fresh complaint prevailed against the carryover. By the same logic, the carryover provision should not have displaced the statutory reappraisal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Under the case law, the auditor may perform the triennial update and the sexennial reappraisal in spite of the carryover provision of R.C. 5715.19(D)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 26} <em>Cincinnati School Dist. </em>is also instructive in another respect. In that case, the first complaint concerned tax year 1989, and the second complaint concerned tax year 1990, which was the first year of the new triennial interim period in Hamilton County. By allowing the consideration of the second complaint, the court continued the practice in previous cases of applying the carryover only within one triennium. See <em>Wolf v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 205, 208, 11 OBR 523, 465 N.E.2d 50 (holding that the value determined for first year of triennial period should be carried forward to the next two years); <em>Oberlin Manor, Ltd. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 1, 2, 629 N.E.2d 1361 (\u201cThe final determination of Oberlin Manor\u2019s complaint as to the assessment of real property taxes for 1982 applies to the subsequent years <em>in the same </em>triennium,\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 27} On this point, an even more significant case is <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn., </em>87 Ohio St.3d 305, 720 N.E.2d 517. While <em>Cincinnati </em>involved the collision of the carryover provision with the board of revision\u2019s statutory duty to hear a fresh complaint, the court in <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>(often referred to as <em>Inner City, </em>after the property owner) addressed the interaction of the carryover and the triennial update.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>{\u00b6 28} In <em>Inner City, </em>the owner had filed a complaint for tax year 1993, which was finally determined at the BTA in August 1996. The county effectuated that decision by applying the reduced value to tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995. For 1996, however \u2014 a triennial update year \u2014 the county assessed the property at a standard 5 percent markup from the previous value. But instead of using the redetermined value for 1993, the auditor used the 1993 value <em>as originally determined. </em>The court held that the county had erred \u2014 the 5 percent markup should have been applied to the redetermined value, not to the value as originally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">{\u00b6 29} The school board misconstrues the decision in <em>Inner City. Inner City </em>focused not on the carryover provision of R.C. 5715.19(D) but rather on the continuing-complaint provision of R.C. 5715.19(D): the court held that the board of revision had jurisdiction under the continuing-complaint provision to make the proper adjustment to the auditor\u2019s 1996 valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 30} The significant aspect of <em>Inner City </em>for this case is that the auditor was permitted to perform the update in spite of the carryover provision \u2014 the only effect of the earlier complaint being that the update percentage must be applied to the value of the earlier year as redetermined. By the same logic as applied in <em>Inner City, </em>the auditor\u2019s sexennial reappraisal of AERC\u2019s property should have been permitted to stand in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 31} We emphasize that the point to be drawn from <em>Cincinnati </em>and <em>Inner City </em>is not that the carryover provision is effective only within a triennium, i.e., the three-year interim period between updates or reappraisals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) (defining \u201cinterim period\u201d). Instead, the point established by the case law is that the carryover provision operates with full force only when the auditor is not under a separate statutory duty to adjust the value assigned to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 32} Typically, the auditor does carry over the value from the first year of a triennium to the next year, unless some event that triggers a need to change the valuation. In those instances, R.C. 5715.19(D) establishes the figure the auditor uses when carrying forward a previous year\u2019s value is the value as redetermined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>through the proceedings conducted on a valuation complaint. But when the auditor performs a new valuation pursuant to a separate statutory duty for any year subsequent to the filing of a valuation complaint, that newly determined value constitutes the value for that year. Moreover, that new value can be displaced only by a showing that some other value is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">{\u00b6 33} The foregoing discussion establishes that the auditor erred by retroactively applying the carryover to displace his 2005 reappraisal value for the property. We therefore reverse the BTA\u2019s determination in BTA No. 2008-A-157 and order that the $17,900,000 reappraisal value be restored as the value of the property for tax year 2005. Moreover, as for the 2006 tax year, unless some event justified a change in valuation, the 2005 reappraisal value would ordinarily be assigned to the second year of the triennium. This principle leads us to reverse the BTA\u2019s determination in BTA No. 2007-A-764 and order that the $17,900,000 be assigned as the true value of the property for the 2006 tax year as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>The ease is remanded to permit the school board to challenge the 2005 reappraisal valuation of the property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">(\u00b6 34} Our conclusion that we must reverse the BTA\u2019s decision raises the further question whether we should remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">{\u00b6 35} We have already discussed how the operation of the continuing-complaint provision permitted AERC to challenge the auditor\u2019s decision to change the 2005-tax-year valuation (\u00b6 10-14, above). By \u201ccontinuing\u201d the proceedings conducted under the complaint filed for an earlier tax year \u201cas a valid complaint for any ensuing year until such complaint is finally determined,\u201d R.C. 5715.19(D) creates ongoing jurisdiction in the pending case to (1) carry over the value determined for the year at issue and (2) hear objections to later actions taken by the auditor that change the value of the property during those ensuing years. Any party to the 2002-tax-year proceedings may avail itself of the continuation of the complaint: the statute explicitly permits continued jurisdiction without further filing by \u201cthe original taxpayer, the original taxpayer\u2019s assignee, or any other person or entity authorized to file a complaint under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">{\u00b6 36} It follows that the school board did not need to file a complaint in order to challenge the 2005 reappraisal value of $17,900,000. Moreover, as to the 2006 tax year, AERC\u2019s complaint and the school board\u2019s countercomplaint created jurisdiction in the BOR to determine the value for that year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A51\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Siegel, Siegel, Johnson &amp; Jennings, L.P.A., J. Kieran Jennings, and Jason P. Lindholm, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AcG\">Rich &amp; Gillis Law Group, Mark H. Gillis, and Allison J. Crites, for appellee Dublin City Schools Board of Education.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 37} Because the auditor erroneously carried over the 2002 value and displaced the 2005 reappraisal value, the school board had no incentive to present any evidence that it might have supporting a value of $20,100,000 for the property as of January 1, 2005. Additionally, because the auditor also assigned $20,100,000 as the value of the property for tax year 2006, the school board was deprived of its incentive to present evidence in support of its countercomplaint regarding the property\u2019s value on January 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 38} Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand the case to the BTA with the instruction that the school board be afforded an opportunity to present additional evidence of the property\u2019s value for tax years 2005 and 2006. On remand, the BTA may exercise discretion to determine whether additional hearings are necessary and whether evidence should be presented to the BTA itself or to the BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 39} For the reasons set forth previously, we conclude that the BTA erred by upholding the carryover of the 2002 value to 2005 and 2006. We therefore reverse and remand in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-10\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b189-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in reversing the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals but would not remand the cause.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b189-12\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-13\">. Because the taxable value of real property in Ohio is 35 percent of the property\u2019s true value, a taxable value of $7,035,000 correlates to a true value of $20,100,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. The school board argues that AERC invited or acquiesced in the carryover of the 2002 stipulated value to tax year 2005 based on the language of the stipulation submitted to the BTA in connection with the 2002-tax-year valuation. We disagree. The language of the stipulation and the BTA decision merely provide that the 2002 value should be \u201ccarried forward according to law.\u201d It follows that AERC did not explicitly agree to carry the value forward to 2005 and also that the issue before us is whether the law required the auditor to carry the 2002 value forward to 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\">. The school board regards <em>Cleveland Mun. School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 404, 2005-Ohio-2285, 827 N.E.2d 306, as authority for a mandatory carryover of a value determined by the BTA into a new triennial period. The school board is mistaken, because the court in that case did not reach the issue of whether a BTA-determined value should be carried over into the new triennial period. Instead of addressing the merits of carrying over or reducing the value, the court declined to view the untimely filed complaint as invoking the continuing-complaint jurisdiction for certain earlier years and ordered dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. In doing so, the court observed that continuing-complaint jurisdiction still existed for two tax years, and the court held that the BTA\u2019s affirmance of certain adjustments performed by the auditor for those two years was \u201cpremature.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\">.
