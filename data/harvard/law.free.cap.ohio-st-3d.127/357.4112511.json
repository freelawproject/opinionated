In <em>State v. Carpenter </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 59, 623 N.E.2d 66, syllabus, we held, \u201cThe state cannot indict a defendant for murder after the court has accepted a negotiated guilty plea to a lesser offense and the victim later dies of injuries sustained in the crime, unless the state expressly reserves the right to file additional charges on the record at the time of the defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>answer depends upon the meaning of \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d and whether the facts show such a plea in Dye\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 2} For the reasons that follow, we hold that Dye\u2019s original guilty plea was a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of <em>Carpenter, </em>and accordingly, his conviction for aggravated vehicular homicide under R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a) is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 3} On August 10, 1999, appellee, James Dye, drove his truck while Dye was under the influence of alcohol and while his driver\u2019s license was suspended. Dye\u2019s vehicle struck Robbie Arnold, a 13-year-old boy, in front of Arnold\u2019s home in Concord Township, Ohio. The boy suffered severe injuries, which left him a quadriplegic. Police who came to the scene of the accident observed that Dye smelled of alcohol and slurred his speech, and Dye eventually admitted having drunk seven beers before driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 4} In September 1999, the grand jury indicted Dye on one count of aggravated vehicular assault in violation of R.C. 2903.08, a fourth-degree felony, and one count of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19, a first-degree misdemeanor. The aggravated-vehicular-assault count also added three specifications: (1) that Dye was under the influence of alcohol during the offense, (2) that he was driving with a suspended license when he committed the offense, and (3) that he had a previous conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. Dye initially pleaded not guilty to these charges, but in November 1999, he changed his plea to guilty of aggravated vehicular assault and the first specification, driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as to the second count. Based on Dye\u2019s guilty plea, the trial court, on the state\u2019s motion, dismissed the other two specifications in the first count of the indictment. Despite the gravity of Arnold\u2019s injuries, apparent at the time of the plea, the state did not reserve the right to file additional criminal charges should Arnold die from those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 5} In addition to recommending that the second and third specifications be dismissed, the state represented that an agreement had been reached with Dye regarding bond pending sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: * * * You want to continue his bond? I was considering cancelling his bond today. Had you made an agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[THE STATE]: I had assumed that bond was continued. <em>We had represented to the Defendant that that would happen.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE COURT: You would recommend that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[THE STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE COURT: You were involved with the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[THE STATE]: Yes. <em>That\u2019s ivhat we had agreed to ivith the same conditions, </em>one, no driving, and two, no drug and alcohol use pending the presentence report. We are also asking that a victim impact statement be ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cTHE COURT: I will order the victim impact statement as well. And <em>with your recommendation </em>I will allow him to continue on bond.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 13} In December 1999, the trial court sentenced Dye to the maximum prison term for each count: 18 months for aggravated vehicular assault and six months for driving under the influence, to be served concurrently. Dye was released from prison in June 2001 after serving his full prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 14} On December 26, 2006, more than seven years after the date of the original incident, Robbie Arnold died from complications of his injuries, prompting the state to pursue new charges of aggravated vehicular homicide against Dye. In July 2007, the grand jury indicted Dye on three counts of aggravated vehicular homicide: (1) as a proximate result of driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of the current R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a), a first-degree felony, (2) recklessly, in violation of the current R.C. 2903.06(A)(2)(a), a second-degree felony, and (3) recklessly, in violation of the 1999 version of R.C. 2903.06(A), a third-degree felony. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 238, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 10416, 10427.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 15} Dye moved to dismiss the indictment on the authority of <em>Carpenter, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 59, 623 N.E.2d 66, contending that his 1999 guilty plea to the aggravated-vehicular-assault and driving-under-the-influence charges was a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of <em>Carpenter, </em>and therefore, further prosecution of him for the 1999 incident was barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that Dye had not pleaded guilty to a lesser offense in 1999 and that there was insufficient evidence that the guilty plea was \u201cnegotiated\u201d within the meaning of <em>Carpenter. </em>Dye then changed his plea to \u201cno contest\u201d to Count One of the indictment, which charged aggravated vehicular homicide under the current R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a). The trial court found Dye guilty on that count and sentenced him to nine years\u2019 imprisonment, less the time served on the prior aggravated-vehicular-assault conviction, for a total of seven and a half years\u2019 imprisonment, and ordered Dye to pay restitution to the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 16} On appeal, the court of appeals sustained Dye\u2019s claim that <em>Carpenter </em>barred the prosecution for aggravated vehicular homicide. The court of appeals concluded that Dye\u2019s 1999 plea was \u201cnegotiated\u201d under <em>Carpenter </em>because the state had obtained the benefit of a conviction without a trial and that the defendant, by pleading guilty, had given up the trial rights enumerated in Crim.R. 11(C). <em>State v. Dye, </em>Lake App. No. 2008-L-10, 2009-Ohio-2949, 2009 WL 1743986, at \u00b6 29-30. The court of appeals did not find consequential that the state had not given a favorable recommendation concerning sentencing or that Dye had been sentenced to the maximum at the state\u2019s request. Id. at \u00b6 28. Nor did the court of appeals find it significant that the two specifications that were dismissed on the state\u2019s motion did not provide for a greater penalty than the specification to which Dye had pleaded guilty. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 17} The state sought review in this court. We accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal on its first proposition of law. <em>State v. Dye, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1492, 2009-Ohio-6015, 916 N.E.2d 1073. It asserts, <em>\u201cState v. Carpenter </em>does not stand for the proposition that every plea of guilty is a negotiated plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Carpenter, </em>the defendant had stabbed a victim and was indicted for one count of felonious assault. 68 Ohio St.3d at 60, 623 N.E.2d 66. Four months later, Carpenter engaged in plea negotiations with the state and entered a guilty plea to the lesser included offense of attempted felonious assault. The opinion does not describe the substance of the plea agreement in that case, but stated that Carpenter pleaded guilty to attempted felonious assault, a lesser included offense than the felonious assault charged in the indictment, and the state agreed to and did recommend the minimum allowable sentence. Carpenter was sentenced to the minimum prison term of two to ten years. The plea agreement did not reserve the state\u2019s right to prosecute for any death of the victim resulting from the defendant\u2019s crime. One year and two months later, in March 1986, the victim of Carpenter\u2019s assault died. Carpenter was released from prison in 1987, after almost three years in prison on the attempted-assault charge. In 1988, he was indicted for the murder of the victim. The trial court eventually dismissed the indictment based on the terms of the 1985 plea agreement, but the court of appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 19} This court reversed and dismissed the murder indictment against Carpenter. 68 Ohio St.3d at 61, 623 N.E.2d 66. We concluded that when the state accepts a negotiated guilty plea and the victim later dies of injuries sustained in the crime, the defendant cannot be indicted for murder when the state does not expressly reserve the right to file additional charges in the event of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the victim\u2019s death. 68 Ohio St.3d at 60-61, 623 N.E.2d 66. We decided that Carpenter\u2019s expectation that his initial guilty plea would terminate prosecutions was reasonable under the circumstances. Id. at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 20} The basis for the rule announced in <em>Carpenter </em>was the application of contract law to the construction of the plea agreement: \u201cThe holding in <em>Carpenter </em>is essentially a synthesis of contract and criminal law in a particular factual setting. Its supporting analysis is ultimately derived from the proposition that plea agreements are a necessary and desirable part of the administration of criminal justice, and, therefore, \u2018 \u201cmust be attended by safeguards to insure the defendant what is reasonably due in the circumstances.\u201d \u2019 Id., 68 Ohio St.3d at 61, 623 N.E.2d 66, quoting <em>Santobello v. New York </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427.\u201d <em>State v. Zima, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 61, 2004-Ohio-1807, 806 N.E.2d 542, \u00b6 II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018[A] plea bargain itself is contractual in nature and \u201csubject to contract-law standards.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 781 F.2d 85, 90, quoting <em>United States v. Krasn </em>(C.A.9, 1980), 614 F.2d 1229, 1233, quoting <em>United States v. Arnett </em>(C.A.9, 1979), 628 F.2d 1162, 1164. \u201cIn the process of determining whether disputed plea agreements have been formed or performed, courts have necessarily drawn on the most relevant body of developed rules and principles of private law, those pertaining to the formation and interpretation of commercial contracts.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey </em>(C.A.4, 1986), 791 F.2d 294, 300. Because the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are at stake in the plea process, the concerns underlying a plea agreement differ from and go beyond those of commercial contract law. <em>Carpenter, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 61, 623 N.E.2d 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Our concern in <em>Carpenter </em>was to avoid the breaking of promises made by the prosecutor in the original plea agreement. <em>Carpenter's </em>citation of cases from other states underscores the court\u2019s concern with enforcing the promises in a valid plea agreement. See id. at 61, citing <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1972), 61 N.J. 314, 294 A.2d 57, and <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1990), 23 Conn.App. 215, 579 A.2d 1104. <em>Thomas </em>relied on <em>Santobello, </em>which involved a concession by the state that a particular plea agreement had been made following plea bargaining with the defendant. <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 258, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427. The question in <em>Santobello </em>was whether that plea agreement could be enforced when a new assistant prosecutor sought a different sentence at the sentencing hearing, unaware of the earlier plea agreement. Id. at 259. The United States Supreme Court upheld the validity of the plea agreement. Id. at 262. <em>Thomas </em>quotes <em>Santobello </em>for this proposition: \u201c \u2018[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u2019 \u201d 61 N.J. at 323, 294 A.2d 57, quoting <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427. See also <em>Nelson, </em>23 Conn.App. at 221, 579 A.2d 1104 (\u201cspecific performance of the [plea] agreement is the only appropriate remedy * * * \u201d). These cases underscore the basis of the rule in <em>Carpenter </em>\u2014effect must be given to the intention of the state and the defendant in their plea bargain, and courts should enforce what they perceive to be the terms of the original plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 23} In order for a guilty plea to be a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of <em>State v. Carpenter, </em>the record must show the existence of the elements of a contract (the plea agreement). The state maintains that there was no plea agreement and that Dye effectively pleaded guilty to the indictment in the first case. Dye pleaded guilty to both counts of the first indictment, but only to the first of the three specifications attached to the aggravated-vehicular-assault charge. (To be sure, that specification not only imposed a mandatory prison term, as did the other specifications that were dismissed, but it included a mandatory permanent revocation of Dye\u2019s driver\u2019s license.) The state sought the maximum sentence, which was imposed. The state contends that Dye did not gain a reduced charge, a more favorable sentencing recommendation, or anything else, as one would expect from a negotiated plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 24} This matter is not without some difficulty. However, a close examination of the record supports the conclusion that a negotiated plea existed within the meaning of <em>Carpenter. </em>Although the record is limited regarding the plea negotiations in Dye\u2019s first case, the transcript of the plea hearing reflects that some form of communication occurred before that hearing during which Dye notified the state that he would plead guilty to Counts One and Two and the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>specification. Because Dye agreed to plead to this portion of the charges, the state recommended dismissal of the two remaining specifications. In addition, the state indicated that it had made an agreement with Dye to recommend the continuation of bond on the condition that Dye refrain from driving and using drugs or alcohol. The state contends that this latter part of the agreement at most related to the continuation of the bond and not the overall plea, but, although it is a close question, we view the agreement for continuation of the bond as corroborating the defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was negotiated with the state. Dye\u2019s change of plea from not guilty to guilty and the state\u2019s later recommendation that the second and third specifications be dismissed, in conjunction with the agreement on continuation of bond, support the conclusion that Dye\u2019s guilty plea was a negotiated plea within the meaning of <em>Carpenter. </em>The state obtained a definite prison term and avoided the uncertainties of trial. Dye gave up rights that may have resulted in acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 25} As the court of appeals concluded, any time a defendant enters a guilty plea, he or she will have relinquished the right to a trial at which the defendant could be acquitted, and the state gains the benefit of obtaining a conviction without having to go to trial. <em>State v. Dye, </em>2009-Ohio-2949, 2009 WL 1743986, at \u00b6 28. We caution that our holding that a negotiated plea existed in Dye\u2019s case does not mean that every plea of guilty necessarily is the result of a negotiated plea agreement within the meaning of <em>Carpenter. </em>On this record, the evidence of plea negotiations and the parties\u2019 awareness of the gravity of the victim\u2019s injuries, together with the state\u2019s failure to reserve the right to prosecute for any later homicide charge, justify the conclusion that the state agreed to forgo further prosecution of Dye.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 26} Holding that Dye\u2019s plea was a negotiated plea is consistent with the rule in <em>Carpenter </em>and upholds important rights afforded to defendants generally. Both the state and Dye were aware of the grave nature of Arnold\u2019s injuries, and the record contains testimony that Arnold\u2019s death from those injuries was foreseeable. As in <em>Carpenter, </em>without an expressed reservation by the state of the right to prosecute for any later homicide charge, Dye had a reasonable expectation that his plea of guilty would end criminal prosecution based on this incident. Given the extreme nature of Arnold\u2019s injuries and the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation that pleading guilty would end the criminal proceedings arising out of the incident, we conclude that if the state had wished to reserve the right to bring further charges in the event of Arnold\u2019s death, it would have so reserved on the record. Requiring the state to make this reservation under these circumstances places no unreasonable burden on prosecutors and ensures that defendants are fully aware of the consequences of their guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Because Dye\u2019s 1999 plea was a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of Carpenter; the state had a duty to \u201cexpressly reserve} ] the right to file additional charges\u201d if the victim dies of his injuries. Id., 68 Ohio St.3d 59, 623 N.E.2d 66, syllabus. Thus, <em>Carpenter </em>precluded the aggravated-vehicular-homicide charge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 28} We hold that Dye\u2019s 1999 guilty plea to aggravated vehicular assault was a \u201cnegotiated plea\u201d to a lesser offense within the meaning of <em>Carpenter. Carpenter </em>thus required the state to expressly reserve its right to bring a later homicide charge against Dye in the event that the victim died from injuries sustained in the aggravated vehicular assault to which Dye had pleaded guilty. Accordingly, the state was precluded from bringing the aggravated-vehicular-homicide charge against Dye after the victim died. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-8\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AHP\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b500-9\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\">. Dye also filed another motion, urging the court to apply the aggravated-vehicular-homicide statute that existed in 1999, which provided a lesser penalty than the law as it existed at the time of the victim\u2019s death in 2006. The trial court denied that motion. The court of appeals did not reach that issue, and it is not before us here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. The rule in <em>Carpenter </em>was based on contract-law principles, not the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. When the victim dies after the defendant has pleaded guilty to an offense less serious than homicide, that plea does not of itself bar the state from prosecuting the defendant for the homicide under double-jeopardy principles. See generally <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 254, 262, 15 O.O.3d 262, 400 N.E.2d 897, overruled on other grounds, <em>State v. Crago </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 243, 559 N.E.2d 1353 (\u201cThe courts have long held that where a fact necessary to the commission of one offense occurs after the defendant has been convicted of another offense, multiple prosecutions are not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d). The principal element of a homicide offense is the death of the victim, and that element is not part of an assault charge. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides: \u201c[N]o person * * * shall be subject <em>for the same offence </em>to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If at the time of the guilty plea to the assault charge, the victim has not died, the final element of the homicide has not occurred, so the offenses are not \u201cthe same.\u201d See <em>Diaz v.

Crago </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 243, 559 N.E.2d 1353 (\u201cThe courts have long held that where a fact necessary to the commission of one offense occurs after the defendant has been convicted of another offense, multiple prosecutions are not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 32} Instead, the basis for our concern for the defendant\u2019s expectation that he would not face additional prosecution was the \u201cnegotiated guilty plea.\u201d <em>Carpenter, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 59, 623 N.E.2d 66, syllabus. <em>Carpenter </em>noted that the guilty plea had followed \u201cplea negotiations with the state.\u201d Id. at 60, 623 N.E.2d 66. The opinion does not describe the substance of the plea agreement, but the court observed that Carpenter did not plead guilty to felonious assault, the crime charged in the indictment, but instead to attempted felonious assault, a lesser included offense of felonious assault. Id. Additionally, Carpenter was sentenced to the minimum prison term for attempted assault, and the court noted that the \u201cstate had agreed to recommend\u201d that minimum sentence. Id. The lesser charge, combined with the state\u2019s favorable sentencing recommendation, indicated that a negotiated plea agreement had been reached in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 33} I agree with the cases cited by the majority. However, I believe that their application to this case merits a different result. In this case, the state maintains that there was no plea agreement and that Dye effectively pleaded guilty to the indictment in the first case. Dye pleaded guilty to both counts of the first indictment. While he pleaded guilty only to the first of the three specifications attached to the charge of aggravated vehicular assault, that specification carried the most serious consequences for the defendant. It not only imposed a mandatory prison term (as did the other specifications that were dismissed), but it included a mandatory permanent revocation of Dye\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Further, the dismissal of the other two specifications did not affect Dye\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 34} The state sought the maximum sentence, which was imposed. The state contends that Dye did not gain a reduced charge, a more favorable sentencing recommendation, or anything else that one would expect from a negotiated plea agreement. Dye, on the other hand, contends that the dismissal of two of the three specifications shows that there was a negotiated plea agreement. He also argues that the state\u2019s comments to the effect that the prosecutor had assumed that Dye\u2019s bond would be continued pending sentencing (and that he had so represented to Dye and his counsel) show that a negotiated plea existed, because the trial judge had been prepared to revoke Dye\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 35} The record does not contain the details of a plea agreement. However, Dye essentially pleaded guilty to the crimes charged. The state requested a maximum sentence, which was imposed. There was no negotiated reduced plea or plea bargain. The dismissal of the two specifications to the charge of aggravated vehicular assault did not result in a reduced sentence. Dye received no more lenient a sentence than he would have if he had been found guilty at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 36} The fact that there is a written entry memorializing defendant\u2019s guilty plea is not dispositive of the characterization of the plea as a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea.\u201d The guilty plea form\u2019s recitation that \u201cNo promises other than those which are part of this plea agreement have been made\u201d does not prove a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of <em>Carpenter. </em>The written entry is on a form used for guilty pleas. Thus, the typed words \u201cplea agreement\u201d that appeared as part of the form do not suffice of themselves to satisfy Carpenter\u2019s requirement of a negotiated guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 37} The record regarding the continuation of bond does not unequivocally support appellee\u2019s position. The judge inquired of the assistant prosecutor about continuation of the bond: \u201cHad you made an agreement?\u201d The prosecutor responded: \u201cI had assumed that bond was continued. We had represented to the Defendant that that would happen.\u201d The judge then asked the prosecutor: \u201cYou would recommend that?\u201d and the prosecutor replied affirmatively. Upon being asked by the judge whether he had been involved with this case previously, the prosecutor responded: \u201cYes. That\u2019s what we had agreed to with the same conditions, one, no driving, and two, no drug and alcohol use pending the presentence report. We are also asking that a victim impact statement be ordered.\u201d The court then continued the bond for Dye. At most, this brief discussion shows an agreement with regard to the continuation of bond pending sentencing on the terms earlier provided. And a bond is not part of a sentence. A bond only provides assurance that the defendant will appear for trial. When considered with the substance of the plea \u2014 essentially pleading guilty to the offense charged \u2014 and the state\u2019s sentencing recommendation of the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>sentence, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Dye\u2019s plea was not a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of <em>Carpenter </em>is not error.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ah_\">Charles E. Coulson, Lake County Prosecuting Attorney, and Teri R. Daniel, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AjR\">Blakemore, Meeker &amp; Bowler Co., L.P.A., and Michael B. Bowler, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 38} I agree with the court of appeals that any time a defendant enters a guilty plea, he or she will have relinquished the right to a trial at which the defendant could be acquitted, and the state gains the benefit of obtaining a conviction without having to go to trial. <em>State v. Dye, </em>Lake App. No. 2008-L-106, 2009-Ohio-2949, 2009 WL 1743986, at \u00b6 28. But to hold that this detriment to the defendant and benefit to the state \u2014 which will be true of every guilty plea- \u2014 -amounts to a negotiated plea agreement under <em>Carpenter </em>is to read that case\u2019s holding too broadly. Under that reading, any guilty plea would be considered \u201cnegotiated.\u201d That is not what <em>Carpenter </em>held. Instead, <em>Carpenter </em>addresses those guilty pleas in which both the state and the defendant understand at the time of the agreement that the state does not intend to seek further prosecution of the defendant for the incident, even if the victim later dies from injuries suffered from the incident. Not every guilty plea will satisfy that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 39} Because Dye\u2019s 1999 plea was not a \u201cnegotiated guilty plea\u201d within the meaning of <em>Carpenter, </em>I believe that the state had <em>no </em>duty to expressly reserve the right to file additional charges in the event of the death of the victim. Accordingly, I would hold that the state was not precluded from bringing the aggravated-vehicular-homicide charge against Dye after the victim died. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-13\">. In determining whether an offense is the \u201csame\u201d for double-jeopardy purposes, courts employ the \u201csame elements\u201d test of <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306. The same-elements test inquires as to whether each offense contains an element not included in the other: if not, they are the \u201csame offence,\u201d and the Double Jeopardy Clause bars successive prosecution. <em>United States v. Dixon </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 688, 696, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
