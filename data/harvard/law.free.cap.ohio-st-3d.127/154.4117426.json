The auditor had denied the request for the exemption, and the Hamilton County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) upheld that denial. The auditor asserted, and the BOR agreed, that the property did not qualify for the tax reduction because the property was held in trust and its current occupant, Julia M. Gilman, was the trustee but not the settlor of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, however, the BTA reversed. The BTA concluded that the property qualified for the tax reduction because Gilman occupied the property as her home and, as trustee, owned legal title to the property that qualified as \u201cone of the several estates in fee\u201d under the statute. The auditor has appealed and renews his contention that when property is held in trust, the property qualifies for the homestead exemption under R.C. 323.151(A)(2) only if the settlor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>trust is the resident and occupant of the property. We disagree, and we therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee Julia M. Gilman is the surviving spouse of Ronald Keith Gilman, who while alive settled a trust and included the property at issue within the corpus of that trust. The property is residential real estate on which Julia Gilman herself resides. Pursuant to the excerpt of the trust instrument in the record, Gilman succeeded her husband as trustee upon her husband\u2019s death. The excerpt of the trust instrument indicates that Ronald Gilman was the sole grantor of the trust, and the deed in the record by which the property was conveyed into the trust listed Ronald Gilman as the sole grantor of the property. By the terms of the trust, the settlor retained the power to revoke during his lifetime; the excerpt does not include provisions that directly address the character of the trust after the death of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 4} On June 7, 2007, Julia Gilman submitted an application for a homestead exemption to the Hamilton County Auditor. By correspondence dated November 29, 2007, the auditor denied the application because the \u201capplicant is not the grantor/settlor of the trust in which the subject property is held.\u201d On December 7, 2007, Gilman appealed the denial through the filing of a complaint at the BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 5} On August 11, 2008, the BOR held a hearing, and a follow-up hearing was held on October 30, 2008, at Gilman\u2019s request. The hearing revealed that the county prosecutor had furnished the auditor with a legal opinion concluding that under R.C. 323.151, the settlor of a trust who occupied residential property as a matter of right under the trust terms could qualify as an \u201cowner,\u201d but that the trustee could not. On this basis, the BOR denied the tax reduction, and Gilman appealed to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">{\u00b6 6} Without holding a hearing or otherwise taking additional evidence, the BTA issued its decision on January 19, 2010. Relying on case law that the trustee owns the legal title to the property held in the trust, the BTA concluded that Gilman as trustee qualified as an owner under R.C. 323.151(A)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by virtue of being the \u201cholder of one of the several estates in fee.\u201d Accordingly, the BTA reversed and remanded to the BOR. The auditor has appealed, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">{\u00b6 7} When a BTA decision is appealed, this court looks to see whether that decision was reasonable and lawful. <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14. In reviewing a BTA decision under this standard, we acknowledge that \u201c \u2018[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u2019 \u201d we will affirm them. Id., quoting <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. On the other hand, we \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">{\u00b6 8} This appeal presents the question whether the trustee of a trust that holds title to real property qualifies as an \u201cowner\u201d under R.C. 323.151(A)(2). Because this question calls for us to construe the statute, it presents an issue of law that we determine de novo on appeal. <em>Brennaman v. R.M.I. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 460, 466, 639 N.E.2d 425; <em>State v. Consilio, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, 871 N.E.2d 1167, \u00b6 8. To resolve that issue, we turn to an examination of the pertinent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>The enactment and expansion of the homestead exemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 9} Beginning in 1971, the General Assembly provided real-property-tax relief to owner-occupied residential property belonging to persons 65 and over.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Referred to as the homestead exemption, the tax break took the form of a credit against real property taxes that was tied to the income of the owner-occupants of the property. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 475, 134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1485, 1490-1494. Originally available only because of the age of the owner-occupants, the tax reduction in 1975 became available to permanently and totally disabled homeowners. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 23, 136 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1409-1413. In 1991, the law extended the benefit to certain surviving spouses who did not independently qualify for the reduction. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 66, 144 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2877.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 10} In 1999, the General Assembly extended the tax break to mobile and manufactured homes, and in 2001, the credit was extended to units in a housing cooperative. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 142, 147 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7986, 8002; Am.Sub. H.B. No. 595, 148 Ohio Laws, Part III, 6422. Finally, in 2007, the General Assembly broadened the availability of the tax reduction by eliminating the income test as a limit on its availability, with the result that the homestead exemption now affords tax freedom on $25,000 of a property\u2019s value whenever the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>owner-occupants satisfy the age or disability criteria. See R.C. 323.151 to 323.153, as amended, 127th General Assembly, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 11} The tax reduction applies to real property taxes imposed on a \u201chomestead,\u201d which is defined as various types of dwellings together with whatever surrounding land \u201cnot exceeding one acre, as is reasonably necessary for the use of the dwelling or unit as a home.\u201d R.C. 323.151(A)(2). The dwelling must be \u201cowned and occupied as a home by an individual whose domicile is in this state.\u201d R.C. 323.151(A)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>Because R.C.323.151 predicates the homestead exemption on a dwelling being owned and occupied by the person who uses the property as a home, the statute addresses who qualifies as an \u201coumer\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 12} Crucial to the decision of this case is R.C. 323.151\u2019s language concerning who may qualify as an \u201cowner.\u201d At its first enactment in 1971, the statute stated that an owner \u201cincludes a vendee in possession under a purchase agreement or a land contract, a mortgagor, one or more joint tenants with right of survivorship, and tenants in common.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 475, 134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1485, 1490. In 1991, the General Assembly added to this inclusive list a \u201csettlor of a revocable inter vivos trust holding the title to a homestead occupied by the settlor as of right under the trust.\u201d Sub.H.B. No. 641, 144 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6034.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 13} In 1995, the General Assembly added a \u201clife tenant\u201d to the list along with a \u201cholder of one of the several estates in fee.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 117, 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 898, 1070.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the statute in effect for tax year 2007 addressed who qualified as an \u201cowner\u201d by stating that \u201c[a]n owner includes a holder of one of the several estates in fee, a vendee in possession under a purchase agreement or a land contract, a mortgagor, a life tenant, one or more tenants with a right of survivorship, tenants in common, and a settlor of a revocable inter vivos trust holding the title to a homestead occupied by the settlor as of right under the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 14} In the present case, the Hamilton County Auditor read R.C. 323.151(A)(2)\u2019s reference to the settlor of property held in trust as constituting the exclusive circumstance in which trust property could qualify for the tax reduction. By contrast, the BTA construed the phrase \u201ca holder of one of the several estates in fee\u201d to apply to a trustee, who under established law holds the legal title to the corpus of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\n<em>R.C. 323.151(A)(2) does not foreclose extending the tax reduction to trust property that is occupied by the trustee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">{\u00b6 15} The auditor regards R.C. 323.151(A)(2)\u2019s list of those encompassed by the term \u201cowner\u201d as exhaustive. We disagree. By using the phrase \u201cowner <em>includes,\u201d </em>the General Assembly indicated its intent not to set forth an exhaustive list. (Emphasis added.) Instead, the list clarifies that certain persons qualify in accordance with, or in addition to, an \u201cowner\u201d under the meaning of that term in common usage. See R.C. 1.42 (requiring that words and phrases be \u201cread in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage\u201d). See <em>Trans Rail Am., Inc. v. Enyeart, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1, 2009-Ohio-3624, 913 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 28 (by listing items that an \u201cact\u201d or \u201caction\u201d <em>includes, </em>the General Assembly showed its intent \u201cto illustrate the types of actions that may be appealable, rather than to set out an exhaustive list\u201d). Indeed, had the list been intended as exhaustive at the outset, \u201cowner\u201d in 1971 would not even have included the holder of full legal title to property that was not subject to a purchase agreement, land contract, mortgage, or joint tenancy. Plainly, the creation of an exhaustive list was not the intent of the General Assembly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 16} In its ordinary meaning, \u201cowner\u201d generally refers to \u201c[o]ne who has the right to possess, use, and convey something; a person in whom one or more interests are vested.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 1214. In cases that address issues of real property taxation, we have construed \u201cowner\u201d narrowly to encompass only the legal-title holder and not the holder of an equitable interest in the property. See <em>Performing Arts School of Metro. Toledo, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 284, 2004-Ohio-6389, 819 N.E.2d 649, \u00b6 12; <em>Victoria Plaza Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 712 N.E.2d 751. Again, when we apply common usage and plain meaning in legal contexts, a \u201ctrustee\u201d is \u201c[o]ne who, having legal title to property, holds it in trust for the benefit of another and owes a fiduciary duty to that beneficiary.\u201d Black\u2019s at 1656. Accord <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Wilkins, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 200, 2005-Ohio-4556, 833 N.E.2d 726, \u00b6 11, citing <em>Goralsky v. Taylor </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 197, 198, 571 N.E.2d 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>{\u00b6 17} We hold that \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of R.C. 323.151(A)(2) encompasses the trustee of a trust to which real property is subject. It follows that when the other requirements of the statute are satisfied, a dwelling that is held in trust may qualify as a \u201chomestead\u201d when the trustee is an individual who occupies the property as a home.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 18} The auditor predicates his contrary position on an erroneous reading of the \u201cowner\u201d provision. In the auditor\u2019s view, a dwelling held in trust can qualify as a \u201chomestead\u201d only by virtue of the one status listed under \u201cowner\u201d that explicitly refers to a trust arrangement. Because that portion of the list specifies that the <em>settlor </em>of the trust may qualify as an owner, the trustee cannot qualify under this theory. The auditor\u2019s error lies in his reading the list as an exhaustive one that excludes all holders of legal title who do not fall within one of the specified categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 19} In advancing his argument, the auditor necessarily takes issue with the BTA\u2019s holding that Gilman as trustee qualifies as the \u2018\u201cholder of one of the several estates in fee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilman v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Jan. 19, 2010), BTA No. 2008-M-2304, 2010 WL 234919, at *2, quoting R.C. 323.521(A)(2). Concerning the addition of that language in 1995 through Am.Sub.H.B. No. 117, the Legislative Service Commission\u2019s Bill Analysis explained that a \u201cholder of one of the several estates in fee has an absolute and unconditional interest in real property\u201d and observed that \u201c[s]ince a person holding an estate in fee is commonly regarded as the owner, this addition is for the purpose of form rather than substance.\u201d Id. at 186-187. Because under a trust arrangement the legal and equitable estates are divided, the legal title held by a trustee may be deemed not to constitute a fee-simple interest in the property in some instances and for certain purposes. See <em>Hill v. Irons </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 21, 27, 50 O.O. 485, 113 N.E.2d 243. The auditor argues that the trust situation in this case is one in which the title to the dwelling is not a fee-simple interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 20} We need not determine the technical question whether Gilman\u2019s legal title in this case involves holding a fee-simple interest in the property, because we more generally conclude that \u201cowner\u201d encompasses holders of legal title without regard to any division of legal and equitable estates. Accordingly, Gilman qualifies as an owner under R.C. 323.151(A)(2) by virtue of her authority over the property as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, the auditor urges that recognizing a trustee\u2019s status as owner will lead to absurd results that the General Assembly did not intend. The auditor points out that in many cases, a bank or an \u201cunrelated third party\u201d might be the trustee, and rhetorically asks whether those trustees would \u201cbe entitled to the Homestead Exemption in derogation of the rights of the beneficiaries.\u201d But the plain terms of R.C. 323.151 limit the exemption to a dwelling \u201cowned and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>occupied as a home by an individual,\u201d along with other personal restrictions. As a result, a bank-trustee will not qualify, because a bank is not an individual and will not be able to occupy a \u201cdwelling\u201d as its \u201chome.\u201d Nor do we anticipate that fiduciary duty and trust terms will usually permit an individual trustee to occupy a dwelling as a home apart from a familial relationship with the settlor or beneficiary, and the statute restricts the availability of the exemption where related persons transfer the property for the purpose of creating an entitlement to the exemption.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, if the legislature decides that the exemption extends too far, it is free to restrict it through further amendments.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AjiC\">Julia M.

Scheve, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 22} For the reasons set forth, we conclude that the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it reversed the determination of the BOR and granted the homestead exemption for tax year 2007. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-8\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-12\">. The BTA decision actually cites \u201cR.C. 353.521(A)(2),\u201d but there is no Chapter 353 in the Revised Code. Based on the context of the cite, we conclude that the BTA meant to cite R.C. 323.151(A)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">. Parallel to but distinguishable from the homestead exemption based on age or disability is the generally available 2.5 percent rollback on homesteads, which was originally enacted in 1979 (Am.Sub.H.B. No. 204, 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1915, 1983), and in its amended form is codified at R.C. 323.152(B). Under the statute, the availability of the 2.5 percent rollback is tied to the definition of homestead, so that the issue of who qualifies as an \u201cowner\u201d determines the availability of the rollback as well as the availability of the homestead exemption itself. See <em>State ex rel. Swetland v. Kinney </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 23, 24,16 O.O.3d 14, 402 N.E.2d 542.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. Subsequent to the 2007 tax year at issue, the 127th General Assembly in 2008 broadened the list of owners by allowing the settlor of an irrevocable as well as a revocable trust to qualify. See R.C. 323.151(A)(2), 2008 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. The Department of Taxation\u2019s Division of Tax Equalization has issued Bulletin 23 (Rev.Nov.2007), explaining aspects of the homestead exemption. A copy of that publication is in the record. In it, the tax department declares that the seven categories of owner listed in R.C. 323.151 are \u201cexclusive,\u201d a statement that is incompatible with our reading of the statute. Id. at 17. On the other hand, the publication does not appear to support the auditor\u2019s specific conclusion that the legal title held by a trustee does not qualify as a fee-simple interest in real property. Indeed, the publication acknowledges that ownership need not involve a \u201cfee simple absolute,\u201d but fee ownership may be subject to a condition, limitation, or restriction to particular heirs. Because the publication does not discuss whether a trustee\u2019s legal title to real property qualifies her as an \u201cowner,\u201d we will not evaluate the publication as a statement of administrative practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-11\">.
