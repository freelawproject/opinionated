Appellee Anderson/Maltbie Partnership (\u201cAMP\u201d) is a for-profit entity that leases property to an Ohio community school. Appellee LKH Victory Corporation is a nonprofit entity that runs the school under the name Cincinnati College Preparatory Academy (\u201cCCPA\u201d). AMP and CCPA sought to exempt the parcel under R.C. 5709.07(A)(1), the \u201cpublic-schoolhouse exemption.\u201d The Tax Commissioner denied the exemption because of the for-profit nature of the lease, but the BTA reversed. Applying its analysis from the earlier ease <em>Performing Arts of Metro. Toledo, Inc. v. Wilkins </em>(Dec. 20, 2002), BTA No. 2001-J-977, reversed on other grounds, 104 Ohio St.3d 284, 2004-Ohio-6389, 819 N.E.2d 649, the BTA held that the property was entitled to a tax exemption based on the lessee\u2019s nonprofit use of the property as a public school.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">{\u00b6 2} The Tax Commissioner appealed, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 3} On December 30, 2002, AMP and CCPA jointly filed their exemption application, which sought to exempt the property for tax year 2002 and to obtain remission of taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001. The application cited R.C. 5709.07(A)(1) as the basis for exemption and explained its claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c[CCPA] is a public community school established under the authority of O.R.C. Chapter 3314, and was incorporated as an Ohio non-profit corporation on December 14, 1998. [CCPA] was incorporated for educational purposes and operates as a community school. As an entity organized for educational purposes, [CCPA] has applied for and received Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service as a public charity. * * * In accordance with O.R.C. \u00a7 3314.02, [CCPA] entered into a charter contract with the State of Ohio Department of Education in 1999, which formally established [CCPA] as a public community school under Ohio law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 5} At the BTA, the parties agreed to a set of stipulations based upon the documents in the record. The stipulations included the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u2022 Since its inception in 1998, CCPA has operated as a community school for children in kindergarten through eighth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u2022 On July 28, 1999, CCPA entered into a triple-net lease with AMP as lessor, and occupied the property under that lease and its amendments from October 7,1999 through October 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u2022 AMP had purchased the property leased by CCPA in 1987 for $1,325,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u2022 The monthly rental for the leased property was $22,958.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u2022 CCPA is contractually obligated under the triple-net lease to pay all real estate taxes and assessments during the lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u2022 AMP did not conduct any business at the property during the lease term, other than leasing it to CCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">{\u00b6 12} For its part, AMP stipulated that it was an \u201centity of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 1775.05(A),\u201d i.e., a for-profit partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 13} This case presents a significant issue that arises in the context of Ohio\u2019s community schools. By statute, a community school \u201cis a public school, independent of any school district, and is part of the state\u2019s program of education.\u201d R.C. 3314.01(B); see <em>State ex rel. Ohio Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers v. State Bd. of Edn., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 568, 2006-Ohio-5512, 857 N.E.2d 1148, \u00b6 7 (detailing aspects of community schools). Since 1852, Ohio law has provided the exemption for \u201cpublic schoolhouses\u201d that is currently codified at R.C. 5709.07(A)(1). 50 Ohio Laws 135, 137. The exemption has been applied to public and private property: to public schools owned and operated by the public school districts in Ohio, and to nonprofit private and parochial schools operated for the public benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 14} Typically, public school districts own their own school buildings; but as a community school, CCPA is not owned and operated by any school district. Community schools raise novel issues of exemption because, by statute, they qualify as public schools but often operate on privately owned property. And in this case, the school occupies the property under a commercial, for-profit lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">{\u00b6 15} The Tax Commissioner in his final determination held that although community schools are public schools, the fact that the property is privately owned and is leased to the school under a for-profit lease makes the property ineligible for the exemption. Because we conclude that the commissioner\u2019s determination reflects a proper application of the standard for exemption that we articulated in <em>Gerke v. Purcell </em>(1874), 25 Ohio St. 229, paragraph eight of the syllabus, we reverse the decision of the BTA and reinstate the commissioner\u2019s denial of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\"><em>Property leased to a school under a for-profit lease is not exempt as a \u201cpublic schoolhouse, </em>\u201d <em>because private property can qualify for the exemption only if it is used \u201cwithout any view to profit\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">{\u00b6 16} When a property owner applies for an exemption, we consider an overarching principle. Because laws that exempt property from tax are in derogation of equal rights, they must be strictly construed. <em>First Baptist Church of Milford v. Wilkins, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 496, 2006-Ohio-4966, 854 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 10; <em>Campus Bus Serv. v. Zaino, 98 </em>Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 8. The principle of strict construction requires that the statute\u2019s language be construed against the exemption, meaning that the onus is on the taxpayer to show that the language of the statute \u201cclearly expresses] the exemption\u201d in relation to the facts of the claim. <em>Ares, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 102, 104, 554 N.E.2d 1310; <em>Lakefront Lines, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 627, 629, 665 N.E.2d 662; <em>H.R. Options, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2004-Ohio-2085, 807 N.E.2d 363, \u00b6 2; <em>In re Estate of Roberts </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 311, 314, 762 N.E.2d 1001. The fact that the burden is on the taxpayer means that \u201c \u2018[i]n all doubtful cases exemption is denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>A. Schulman, Inc. v. Levin, </em>116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Ohio St.3d 105, 2007-Ohio-5585, 876 N.E.2d 928, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Youngstown Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Evatt </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 268, 273, 28 O.O. 163, 55 N.E.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 17} The statute we must consider is currently codified at R.C. 5709.07(A)(1) and provides: \u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation: (1) Public schoolhouses, the books and furniture in them, and the ground attached to them necessary for the proper occupancy, use, and enjoyment of the schoolhouses, and not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 18} The public-schoolhouse exemption was enacted along with other exemptions in the wake of the adoption of the new constitution in 1851. 50 Ohio Laws 135, 137. Before the adoption of the 1851 Constitution, \u201cthe whole matter of taxation was committed to the discretion of the general assembly.\u201d <em>Zanesville v. Richards </em>(1855), 5 Ohio St. 589, 592. And the \u201cright to make exceptions and exemptions was unquestionable.\u201d Id. But the 1851 Constitution circumscribed that power through Article XII, Section 2, which required uniform taxation of property and enumerated specific types of exemption the legislature could pass. Id. The legislature\u2019s power to pass exemptions was construed to be limited to exemptions expressly authorized by the Constitution. Id. at 592-593; <em>Denison Univ. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 17, 24, 31 O.O.2d 10, 205 N.E.2d 896.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 19} This court in <em>Gerke, </em>25 Ohio St. 229, considered the claimed tax exemption of Catholic parochial schools in view of the specific constitutional authorizations and the statutory language of the exemptions. We determined that the Constitution\u2019s authorization of a public-schoolhouse exemption was applicable only to school buildings that \u201cbelong to the public,\u201d buildings that \u201care designed for the school established and conducted under the authority of the public.\u201d Id. at 242. In contrast, we held that the <em>statute\u2019s </em>reference to public schoolhouses is \u201cnot used in the sense of ownership\u201d but rather of the \u201cuses to which the property is devoted,\u201d with the result that the exemption applies to private property used to support instruction that is \u201cfor the benefit of the public.\u201d Id. at 246-247.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">{\u00b6 20} The term \u201cpublic\u201d was construed differently in the statute to make sense of the statute\u2019s limitation that the schoolhouse grounds must not be \u201cleased or otherwise used with a view to profit.\u201d Because political subdivisions such as public school districts are inherently nonprofit, the condition did not seem \u201cappropriate if intended to apply only to institutions established by the public.\u201d Id. at 247. On the other hand, the prohibition against making a profit had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u201cmarked significance when applied to private property,\u201d and accordingly, the statute was construed to reach private property. Id. The <em>constitutional </em>basis for exempting private property when used as a school lay in the authorization of exemptions for \u201cinstitutions of purely public charity.\u201d Id. at 243-244. As a result, the \u201cexclusion of all idea of private gain or profit\u201d constitutes a basic condition that private property must satisfy to qualify for this exemption. Id. at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">(\u00b6 21} One dispute between the parties is therefore immaterial: the question whether R.C. 5709.07\u2019s limiting clause \u201cnot leased or otherwise used with a view to profit\u201d applies to the schoolhouse itself as well as the \u201cground attached to\u201d the schoolhouse. Ultimately, the dispute is inconsequential because the holding of <em>Gerke </em>clearly establishes that the schoolhouse itself cannot qualify for exemption unless it is used \u201cwithout any view to profit.\u201d <em>Gerke, 25 </em>Ohio St. 229, paragraph eight of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 22} <em>Gerke </em>holds that the public-schoolhouse exemption does extend to privately owned property, but only when that property is \u201cappropriated to the support of education for the benefit of the public without any view to profit,\u201d an essential element being the \u201cexclusion of all idea of private gain or profit.\u201d <em>Gerke </em>at 247. By seeking to exempt a commercial office building that is leased to the school for profit, AMP seeks a broader exemption, an application that we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 23} The Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination did not cite <em>Gerke, </em>but he did deny AMP\u2019s exemption because the property was subject to a for-profit commercial lease. We hold this analysis to be correct under <em>Gerke: </em>property cannot be exempted from taxation as a public schoolhouse when the owner leases the property to the school for profit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\n<em>Cleveland State Univ. v. Perk does not authorize the grant of a public-schoolhouse exemption when land with permanent structures is leased to a school for profit under a commercial lease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">{\u00b6 24} Both the BTA decision and AMP\u2019s brief heavily rely on <em>Cleveland State Univ. v. Perk </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 1, <em>55 </em>O.O.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577. <em>Cleveland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>State </em>is inapposite for two reasons. First, <em>Cleveland State </em>involved temporary modular structures installed on the university\u2019s land. Both the reasoning and the syllabus law of that case restrict <em>Cleveland State\u2019s </em>holding to that particular situation. Second, although the public-college exemption in R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) generally parallels the public-schoolhouse exemption at R.C. 5709.07(A)(1), the former expressly authorizes a broader exemption of \u201cbuildings\u201d so long as they are \u201cconnected with\u201d the public college.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Cleveland State, </em>the university (an instrumentality of the state of Ohio) enjoyed the exemption of a parcel of land under R.C. 5709.08, which exempts \u201cpublic property used exclusively for a public purpose.\u201d Not having the wherewithal to construct permanent buildings on the site, Cleveland State University rented temporary modular buildings that were installed at the site and used for classrooms and faculty offices. The narrow question was whether the modular buildings could qualify for exemption from real property taxation under the public-college exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 26} In answering affirmatively, we noted two significant predicates for granting the exemption. First, this court had rejected the proposition that <em>college buildings </em>were required to be used for \u201ccharitable purposes\u201d to qualify for exemption. <em>Cleveland State, </em>26 Ohio St.2d at 6, 55 O.O.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577, citing <em>Denison Univ., </em>2 Ohio St.2d 17, 31 O.O.2d 10, 205 N.E.2d 896, paragraph four of the syllabus. Second, given the structure of the public-college exemption, the express limitation to property \u201cnot used with a view to profit\u201d applied only to the <em>\u201clands </em>connected with\u201d public colleges, not to the separately mentioned <em>\u201cbuildings </em>connected with\u201d the institution. <em>Cleveland State </em>at 6-7, citing <em>Kenyon College v. Schnebly </em>(Knox C.P.1909), 12 Ohio C.C.(N.S.) 1, affirmed, 81 Ohio St. 514, 91 N.E. 1138. R.C. 5709.07(A)(4) exempts \u201c[p]ublic colleges and academies and all buildings connected with them, and all lands connected with public institutions of learning, not used with a view to profit\u201d; the phrase \u201cnot used with a view to profit\u201d modifies \u201clands,\u201d but not \u201cbuildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b627} Combining these principles, we concluded that the modular buildings qualified as \u201cbuildings connected with\u201d the university, since they were \u201c \u2018with reasonable certainty used in furthering or carrying out the necessary objects and purposes of the college.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland State, </em>26 Ohio St.2d at 8, 55 O.O.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577, quoting <em>Denison Univ., 2 </em>Ohio St.2d at 21-22, 31 O.O.2d 10, 205 N.E.2d 896. The syllabus states that an exemption could be allowed for \u201cbuildings located on the campus of a state university and used exclusively for classrooms and faculty offices\u201d even though the buildings were \u201cleased for a term of years, with provision for rental therefor, from a corporation for profit.\u201d <em>Cleveland State, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. Cf. <em>Athens Cty. Aud. v. Wilkins, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 293, 2005-Ohio-4986, 834 N.E.2d 804, \u00b6 19-22 (public-college <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>exemption not available for off-campus private dormitories owned by a for-profit company, when college did not lease the buildings and would not itself benefit from the tax exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">{\u00b6 28} In contrast, the present case raises the distinct issue whether the \u201cschoolhouse\u201d itself and the land beneath it may qualify for a public-schoolhouse exemption, when both are leased from a for-profit landlord. <em>Cleveland State </em>does not control the present case, and we cannot extend its holding to the present facts in light of the restrictive character of the public-schoolhouse exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\n<em>Although leased property may sometimes qualify for exemption, property subject to a commercial lease with a for-profit landlord does not qualify</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 29} AMP also contends that a commercial lease is irrelevant to the issue of exempt status so long as the lessee uses the property for exempt purposes. AMP emphasizes certain decisions that allow the exemption of leased property.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 30} This argument raises two questions. The first is whether ownership and use must coincide for a building to qualify as an exempt public schoolhouse. <em>Gerke </em>answers this question by declaring that the \u201cpublic\u201d in \u201cpublic schoolhouse\u201d \u201cis not used in the sense of ownership, but as descriptive of the uses to which the property is devoted.\u201d <em>Gerke, </em>25 Ohio St. at 246-247. Thus, property \u201cappropriated to the support of education for the benefit of the public without any view to profit\u201d qualifies for exemption, id. at 247, and that standard contains no requirement that the owner be the entity that operates the school. It follows that a community school that leases its building may still receive the benefit of tax exemption as a public schoolhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 31} But property subject to a commercial, for-profit lease is a different matter. <em>Gerke </em>specifically limits the exemption of privately owned property to property that is used \u201cwithout any view to profit.\u201d The second question raised by AMP\u2019s argument is whose use should be considered \u2014 the lessee\u2019s, or both the lessor\u2019s and the lessee\u2019s?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 32} AMP relies on <em>Bexley Village, Ltd. v. Limbach </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 306, 588 N.E.2d 246, to maintain that the commissioner and the BTA must focus exclusively on the lessee\u2019s use of the property. In <em>Bexley Village, </em>the Tenth District Court of Appeals granted the public-college exemption for a parking lot that was leased by a private developer to Capital University for a rent of $1 per year. Instead of drawing the obvious conclusion that the nominal character of the rent ensured that the lease was not for profit, the Tenth District held that in deciding whether the property was \u201cused with a view to profit,\u201d one entity must be considered, which in that case was the lessee, Capital University.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Because <em>Bexley Village </em>addresses the public-college exemption, we regard the case as inapposite. We hold that under the public-schoolhouse exemption, the restriction that the property not be used with a view to profit requires examination of the total use of the property by both lessor and lessee. If the lease is intended to generate profit for the lessor, the property does not qualify for exemption; similarly, the property does not qualify if the lessee\u2019s use is intended to generate profit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 34} It follows that because AMP leases the property to CCPA under a for-profit lease, the public-schoolhouse exemption is not available in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>Case law interpreting the exemption for houses of public worship does not apply to this case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 35} AMP also relies on BTA decisions in which the BTA reversed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s denial of exemption under R.C. 5709.07(A)(2), the house-of-public-worship exemption. See <em>Gary Glair/Christ United Church v. Tracy </em>(Sept. 11, 1998), BTA No. 97-K-306; <em>Northcoast Christian Ctr. v. Tracy </em>(July 18, 1997), BTA No. 96-M-811; <em>Jubilee Christian Fellowship, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(May 17, 2002), BTA No. 99-R-239. AMP argues that denying the exemption in this case necessarily contradicts the grant of exemption in those cases. We disagree. Although each of the BTA cases that AMP cites involved a religious congregation leasing a building for use as a place of worship under leases that were commercial, or presumed to be commercial, these cases are not dispositive of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 36} The issue of whether buildings devoted to public worship that are subject to a commercial lease are tax exempt is not before us, and we do not decide it. But the analysis differs in cases involving houses of public worship because Gerke\u2019s requirement that a privately owned schoolhouse be operated \u201cwithout any view to profit\u201d does not apply to them. Unlike schoolhouses, houses of worship, by their nature, are privately owned. Moreover, the 1851 Constitution explicitly authorized an exemption for houses of worship, whereas it did not authorize exemption of private schools unless they were \u201cinstitutions of purely public charity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 37} Furthermore, the exemption for houses of public worship as currently codified does not expressly prohibit a for-profit use of the building devoted to worship. Although for more than a century this exemption and the public-schoolhouse exemption were closely linked, that link was broken in 1988 with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>enactment of Am.S.B. No. 71. 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 147 (\u201cS.B. 71\u201d). S.B. 71 separately codified them at R.C. 5709.07(A)(1) (exemption for public schoolhouse) and at R.C. 5709.07(A)(2) (exemption for house of public worship). The latter exemption now provides the exemption for \u201c[hjouses used exclusively for public worship, the books and furniture in them, and the ground attached to them that is not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit and that is necessary for their proper occupancy, use, and enjoyment.\u201d R.C. 5709.07(A)(2). That wording unambiguously applies the not-for-profit limitation only to the \u201cground attached\u201d to the building, not to the budding itself. It follows that any limitations on the exemption for the building must relate to the requirement that it be used exclusively for public worship.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>The Tax Commissioner\u2019s argument that Gerke has been overruled is jurisdictionally barred</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 38} Departing from the analysis he employed in his final determination, the Tax Commissioner\u2019s briefs in this court insist that our case law holds that the public-schoolhouse exemption applies only when the property is publicly owned, i.e., owned by the state or a political subdivision such as a school district. As indicated in footnote three of this opinion, the cases cited by the Tax Commissioner do not overrule <em>Gerke. </em>But we lack jurisdiction to address this assertion as a ground for reversal, because the Tax Commissioner did not assign any error in the notice of appeal in relation to this argument. See <em>Fogg-Akron Assoc., L.P. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 112, 2009-Ohio-6412, 919 N.E.2d 730, \u00b6 12, citing <em>Newman v.

The BTA granted the exemption in <em>Performing Arts, </em>but on appeal, this court reversed on other grounds, holding that the exemption application had to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the lessee, but not the owner, had applied. <em>Performing Arts, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 284, 2004-Ohio-6389, 819 N.E.2d 649, \u00b6 13, 15, 20.

In 1931, an amendment restored to the General Assembly the plenary power to enact exemptions: the power is limited only by the provisions of Article I of the Constitution.

Although he did not properly raise the alternative argument, the Tax Commissioner cites cases that allegedly overrule Gerke\u2019s holding that a schoolhouse could be \u201cpublic\u201d even though privately owned. We disagree. The later cases the Tax Commissioner cites in this regard do not undermine <em>Gerke. </em>See <em>Weir v. Day </em>(1878), 35 Ohio St. 143 (granting injunction against private school\u2019s use of a public school building under a lease given the circumstances of the case; this case does not address any issue of taxation or exemption); <em>Gilmour v. Petton </em>(1877), 5 Ohio Dec.Rep. 447 (although common pleas court exempted parochial schools based on a charitable exemption rather than the public-schoolhouse exemption, according to the unofficial reporter\u2019s note on the history of the case in Ohio Decisions Reprint, the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance cited and did not retreat from Gerke); <em>Watterson v. Holliday </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 150, 82 N.E. 962 (holding that parish houses used as residences by priests did not qualify for a charitable exemption or an exemption for a house of worship; this case does not address the schoolhouse exemption).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\">. We note, however, that there may be situations in which an exemption could be allowed under R.C. 5709.07 even though the property generated rental income for the owner. See R.C. 5709.07(B) (possibility of exemption for leased property when income goes to municipal corporation or school district).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b322-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">{\u00b6 40} Case law constrains me to concur in the majority\u2019s holding, but I write to express my concern that our holding places community schools in a conundrum as to how to pay property taxes on leased property, because community schools <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>are funded by state funds but are prohibited by law from using those funds to pay taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">{\u00b6 41} Cincinnati College Preparatory Academy (\u201cCCPA\u201d) is a community school as defined in R.C. Chapter 3314. Pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3314, community schools are <em>public </em>schools and are part of the state\u2019s program of education. R.C. 3314.01(B). Thus, community schools receive state funding. See R.C. 3314.08. However, community schools cannot use state funds to pay any taxes that they owe. R.C. 3314.082.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 42} CCPA leased property to use for its schoolhouse pursuant to a triple-net lease, which is standard practice for commercial properties and requires the lessee to assume certain obligations pertaining to the leased property, including utilities, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. See, e.g., <em>AEI Net Lease Income &amp; Growth Fund v. Erie Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 563, 2008-Ohio-5203, 895 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 6. Thus, CCPA was obligated by the lease to pay any taxes due on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 43} Generally, R.C. 5709.07 exempts property from taxation that is used for certain charitable activities, and in particular, subsection (A)(1) exempts from taxation \u201cpublic schoolhouses\u201d and \u201cthe ground attached to them\u201d as long as the property is \u201cnot leased or otherwise used with a view to profit.\u201d In my opinion, it is the lessee\u2019s <em>use </em>of the property that should determine whether the property qualifies for a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.07(A)(1). For example, if the lessee uses property for a public schoolhouse and has no view to profit in doing so, the property should be exempt from taxation. However, as the majority opinion makes clear, case law does not support my view and instead supports our holding that a public schoolhouse is not exempt from taxation if the owner of the property leases it with a view to profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 44} My concern is that our holding creates a predicament for community schools that lease the property and buildings that they use to operate the schools. Under our holding, lessors who lease property for use as a schoolhouse will fail to qualify for an exemption under R.C. 5709.07(A)(1) when the lessor leases the property with a view to profit. The property-tax obligation is passed on to the community school pursuant to the triple-net lease. However, community schools are prohibited by law from using state funds to pay these taxes. In my opinion, disqualifying property from the schoolhouse exemption when it is <em>used </em>for a public schoolhouse merely because the property\u2019s lessor has a view to profit seems to run contrary to the general intent within R.C. 5709.07, and causes community schools that lease property to face a conundrum as to how they will pay the real estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, although I concur in the holding in this case, I invite the General Assembly to amend R.C. 5709.07(A)(1) if its members share my concerns. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The General Assembly created an exemption for buildings that are \u201cconnected with\u201d colleges, irrespective of whether the lessor leases buildings with a view to profit. See <em>Cleveland State Univ. v. Perk, </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 1, 55 O.O.2d 1, 268 N.E.2d 577. The General Assembly could amend R.C. 5709.07(A)(1) to achieve a similar result.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWb\">Eastman <em>&amp; </em>Smith, Ltd., Graham A. Bluhm, M. Charles Collins, and Amy J.
