For the reasons that follow, we conclude that contractual obligations in administrative-employment contracts entered into by school districts governed by R.C. Chapter 124 are not impaired by R.C. 3319.391 and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01, and R.C. 3319.391 is not a retroactive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">{\u00b6 2} According to the order certifying the questions to this court and the facts agreed upon by the parties in their briefs, John Doe,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petitioner, was convicted in 1976 of drug trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03 and spent three years in a correctional facility. After he was released, Doe obtained a college degree, became a licensed social worker, and was certified as a chemical-dependency counselor. In 1997, Doe\u2019s conviction was expunged pursuant to R.C. 2953.32. Doe has had no other criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">{\u00b6 3} In 1997, Doe began his employment with respondent Cincinnati Public School (\u201cCPS\u201d) as a drug-free-school specialist. In 2002, Doe began to work in an administrative capacity as a hearing officer. In this position, Doe\u2019s only direct contact with students was at administrative hearings, and the students\u2019 guardians were also present at those hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">{\u00b6 4} Doe entered into a two-year administrative-employment contract with CPS in July 2008, with the two-year term beginning on August 1. The employment contract was made \u201csubject to confirmation of appropriate state certification.\u201d Beginning in 2008, this confirmation process required Doe to submit to a background check. This background-check requirement previously applied only to licensed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> positions, but legislation enacted in 2007 extended it to include administrative employees within the school district. R.C. 3319.39 and 3319.391, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>2007 Sub.H.B. No. 190, eff. Nov. 14, 2007 (\u201cH.B. 190\u201d). H.B. 190 also authorized respondent Ohio Department of Education (\u201cODE\u201d) to promulgate administrative rules related to the background-check process, including rules specifying circumstances under which persons with certain convictions could still be hired. R.C. 3319.39(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 5} In November 2008, CPS notified Doe that his 32-year-old drug-trafficking conviction was discovered during the background check.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CPS further advised Doe that the same recently enacted legislation that now required CPS to conduct background checks on administrative employees also required CPS to terminate its employment relationship with Doe because of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 6} Doe filed suit on April 3, 2009, in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. Doe alleged that CPS breached the July 2008 employment contract and that the recently enacted legislation expressed in H.B. 190 violated, among other things, the Contracts Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution. CPS removed the case to the federal district court pursuant to Section 1441, Title 28, U.S.Code, and on April 24, 2009, Doe filed an amended complaint in federal court. Respondent Mary Ronan was the interim superintendent at the time the amended complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 7} Thereafter, Doe filed a motion to certify his state-based retroactivity and contract-impairment claims as state-law questions. The federal district court granted the motion, and this court accepted the certified questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 124 Ohio St.3d 1440, 2010-Ohio-188, 920 N.E.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>II. Legislation and Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 8} For many years, this state has required criminal background checks for licensed and certificated school-district employees who have responsibility for the care, custody, and control of a child. See former R.C. 3319.39(A)(1), Am.Sub.S.B. No. 38, 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 367, 383, eff. Oct. 29, 1993 (\u201cS.B. 38\u201d). If the background check uncovered a conviction of an offense listed in former R.C. 3319.39(B)(1)(a), the school district was required to release that employee from employment, unless the \u201cstandards in regard to rehabilitation\u201d were met. Former R.C. 3319.39(B)(1) and (E), S.B. 38. In keeping with the ODE\u2019s concern that persons who have drug-trafficking convictions on their record may jeopardize the health, safety, or welfare of students, no rehabilitation was available under the administrative regulation for a licensed employee who committed a drug-trafficking offense under R.C. 2925.03. Former Ohio Adm.Code 3301 \u2014 20\u201401(B)(1), 1993-1994 Ohio Monthly Record 1257, eff. Mar. 4, 1994, and 3301-20-01(E)(1)(c) and (E)(2)(e), 2005-2006 Ohio Monthly Record 1261, eff. Sept. 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 9} In 2007, H.B. 190 expanded the background-check statutes to require, among other things, criminal-background checks for administrative, or nonlicensed, school-district employees. Former R.C. 3319.391(A), H.B. No. 190. The list of enumerated offenses in R.C. 3319.39(B)(1) and the effect that a conviction of one of the enumerated offenses had on an employee\u2019s employment within a district were not revised. Former R.C. 3319.391(C), H.B. 190 (stating that a person convicted of an offense listed in R.C. 3319.39(B)(1) \u201cshall not be hired or shall be released from employment\u201d unless the person meets the rehabilitation standards promulgated by the ODE pursuant to R.C. 3319.39(E)); and former R.C. 3319.39(B)(1)(a), H.B. 190 (enumerated offenses not revised in H.B. 190). Thus, an R.C. 2925.03 drug-trafficking offense remained an enumerated offense, and an employee who had been convicted of such an offense could not be employed by the school district unless the rehabilitation standards were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 10} Prior to August 27, 2009, the ODE had promulgated only one regulation to address how a person with a prior conviction of an enumerated offense could be rehabilitated, allowing that person to be employed with the school district. However, the regulation provided that for a conviction of an R.C. 2925.03 drug-trafficking offense, no rehabilitation was available to relieve a person from employment disqualification. Former Ohio Adm.Code 3301 \u2014 20\u201401(E)(1)(c) and (A)(11), 2005-2006 Ohio Monthly Record 1261, eff. Sept. 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 11} Effective August 27, 2009, the ODE revised its background-check regulations to respond to the 2007 revisions to the statutes. Rather than have one regulation apply to all persons subject to a background check, the ODE promulgated two regulations: one applicable to employees who hold positions that require licenses, and one applicable to employees who hold nonlicensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>positions. Both of the regulations detail how a person with a conviction of an enumerated offense may demonstrate the person\u2019s rehabilitation to relieve the person from employment disqualification with a school district. Ohio Adm.Code 3301 \u2014 20\u201401(E) and 3301-20-03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 12} The regulation that applies to licensed positions is essentially a continuation of the original, pre-August 2009 ODE regulation. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01. In this regulation, the prior rule with respect to an R.C. 2925.03 drug-trafficking offense is maintained: no rehabilitation is permitted. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01(E)(l) and (A)(10)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 13} The second regulation created by the ODE was new and applied to nonlicensed positions within a school district. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03. For these positions, the rehabilitation rule for R.C. 2925.03 drug-trafficking offenses is different. If the drug-trafficking offense occurred within ten years of the criminal-record check, no rehabilitation is permitted. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03(D)(1) and (A)(6)(e). But if the person committed the drug offense more than ten years before the criminal-record check, a district may employ that person if the rehabilitation conditions contained in Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03(D) are met. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03(A)(6)(e). But even if a person meets the rehabilitation conditions so that the school district may deem that person rehabilitated, a \u201cdistrict maintains the discretion whether to employ or retain in employment [that] individual.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">(\u00b6 14} Doe argues that R.C. 3319.391 and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01 unconstitutionally impaired his employment contract with CPS. Doe also argues that R.C. 3319.391 is unconstitutionally retroactive. After consideration of the arguments presented in this case, we cannot agree with Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\n<em>A. Contract Impairment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">{\u00b6 15} The Ohio Constitution provides that the \u201cgeneral assembly shall have no power to pass * * * laws impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. This provision applies to contracts that \u201cexisted prior to the effective date of the statute [at issue in the litigation].\u201d <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Schilling </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 164, 168, 616 N.E.2d 893. In contrast, \u201ccontracts entered into <em>on or after </em>the effective date of [a statute] are subject to the provisions of the statute.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">(\u00b6 16} A two-part test has been established to determine whether a statute unconstitutionally impairs a contract. The first question is whether the legislation at issue operates as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship. <em>Middletown v. Ferguson </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 71, 77, 25 OBR 125, 495 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>380. If the answer is yes, the next question is whether the legislation is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose. Id. at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 17} When CPS advised Doe that it was terminating his 2008 employment contract for the sole reason of Doe\u2019s 1976 expunged drug-trafficking conviction, it did so in accordance with the requirements of the 2007 revisions to the background-check legislation. Doe not only claims that R.C. 3319.391 unconstitutionally impaired his 2008 employment contract with CPS, but he further asserts that applying the administrative regulation in effect at the time of his termination notice compounds the constitutional infirmity. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01, 2005-2006 Ohio Monthly Record 1261, eff. Sept. 23, 2005. Doe maintains that application of this administrative regulation to his circumstance is inappropriate because it was promulgated when only licensed school-district employees were subject to criminal-record checks. According to Doe, if the revised August 2009 regulation applicable to nonlicensed school-district employees had been promulgated sooner than it was following R.C. 3319.391\u2019s effective date, he would have met the new rehabilitation standard for nonlicensed employees and could have remained employed by CPS. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03(A)(6)(e) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 18} The General Assembly has enacted detailed statutes regulating the employment of school employees. See R.C. Chapter 3319. When an employment contract between a school district and its employee is made pursuant to these statutes, that contract must be construed as though the statutes are incorporated into the contract and become implied terms and conditions of any contract or contractual right. See, e.g., <em>Jacot v. Secrest </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 553, 558, 42 O.O. 31, 93 N.E.2d 1, quoting <em>Banks v. De Witt </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 263, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201c \u2018A contract made in pursuance of a statute or resolution, must be construed as though such statute or resolution had been incorporated into such contract\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, the 2008 employment contract between Doe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>CPS was made \u201csubject to confirmation of appropriate state certification.\u201d Passing a statutorily mandated background check is necessary \u201cstate certification\u201d and is therefore a condition that must be met before obligations in the conti'act become effective. In recognition of this condition precedent, all prior and current versions of the background-check legislation permit an employee to be conditionally employed until the results of the background check are obtained. See, e.g., former R.C. 3319.39(B)(2), S.B. 38, eff. Oct. 29, 1993, and former R.C. 3319.39(B)(2), H.B. 190, eff. Nov. 14, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">{\u00b6 19} Doe was conditionally employed pending the results of his background check. When these results indicated that Doe failed to meet the state-certification requirement, Doe was unable to meet the condition precedent that would have triggered CPS\u2019s obligation to perform the contract. Consequently, the contract between CPS and Doe failed to become binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 20} We further note that Doe and CPS executed the July 2008 employment contract eight months after the effective date of the provisions of H.B. 190, which imposed the new background-check requirements. Because Doe\u2019s 2008 employment contract with CPS was executed after the date the statutory change became effective, the new background-check requirements and the employment-disqualification standards of Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01 became incorporated as implied terms and conditions of Doe\u2019s contract. Thus, Doe cannot demonstrate that R.C. 3319.391 impaired his employment contract with CPS, because there was no contract between Doe and CPS to substantially impair.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 21} Doe\u2019s reliance on R.C. 3319.081 to establish that his employment contract was a continuing contract is misplaced. R.C. 3319.081 applies to school districts that are not governed by R.C. Chapter 124. CPS, however, is governed by R.C. Chapter 124. R.C. 124.01(A) and 3319.081. Thus, there is no continuing contract under R.C. 3319.081. Moreover, a public employee who meets the classified-service criteria of R.C. 124.11(B) does have protection from termination without specific cause, as defined in R.C. 124.34(A). One of the specific causes for which an employee can be terminated, however, is the conviction of a felony drug-abuse offense under R.C. 2925.03. R.C. 124.34(A)(2). Because the conviction was under R.C. 2925.03, it falls within the purview of R.C. 124.34(A), and Doe has no statutory right to continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 22} Doe also claims that application of the pre-August 2009 administrative rule to his circumstance impaired his 2008 employment contract with CPS. Had Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03 been promulgated more quickly upon the enactment of H.B. 190, Doe\u2019s R.C. 2925.03 drug-trafficking conviction would not have constituted a nonrehabilitative offense, and he could likely have met the conditions to show rehabilitation so that CPS could have maintained its employment relationship with him. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03(A)(6)(e) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Nonetheless, these laws reflect the General Assembly\u2019s conclusion that the health, safety, and welfare of students required an expansion of the background-check laws to include nonteaching employees, e.g., administrators, cafeteria workers, custodians, and maintenance personnel. Unfortunately, delay is often an inherent characteristic of the rulemaking process. The effect that the delay in the administrative rulemaking process had on Doe\u2019s career is regrettable. Doe\u2019s past experiences and rehabilitation appear to have made him especially qualified for the duties of the position for which he was hired, and Doe claims in his amended complaint that he has received either an \u201cacceptable\u201d or \u201caccomplished\u201d job evaluation every year since he became employed at CPS. When his conviction was expunged in 1997, Doe was found to be rehabilitated. The district court found that Doe has been \u201ca model citizen since being released from jail.\u201d Regardless, the ODE acted pursuant to its statutory grant of discretionary rulemaking authority and was under no obligation to amend the Administrative Code to make different rehabilitation provisions for nonlieensed positions. R.C. 3319.39(E) and 3319.391(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, the revisions to the background-check statutes and corresponding administrative regulations did not substantially impair the contractual relationship between Doe and CPS; they merely prevented Doe from being able to meet the condition precedent of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\n<em>B. Retroactivity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 25} The Ohio Constitution also provides that the \u201cgeneral assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws.\u201d Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. A determination that a law is unconstitutionally retroactive involves a two-step inquiry. If the statute is expressly retroactive and is substantive, as opposed to merely remedial, the statute violates the proscription against retroactive laws. <em>State v. LaSalle, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 178, 2002-Ohio-4009, 772 N.E.2d 1172, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 26} Doe asserts that the background-check legislation is unconstitutionally retroactive. In Doe\u2019s view, his vested right in continued employment was impaired when the General Assembly enacted R.C. 3319.391 and caused nonlieensed school-district employees to be terminated from current employment if a background check disclosed a criminal conviction that predated the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">{\u00b6 27} Doe\u2019s contention notwithstanding, the background-check legislation in R.C. 3319.391 is prospective in application. This legislation simply imposed a new restriction on the school district regarding the qualifications of persons it could employ after a specific date, with a focus on those persons who have had felony convictions. This legislation does not go back to the date of the employee\u2019s initial hire, terminate that person effective as of the hire date, and eliminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>any of that person\u2019s accrued benefits. Doe has not been deprived of any pay, retirement credit, or other benefits he accrued during his tenure with CPS. Instead, the conduct that the background-check legislation prohibits, i.e., continued employment after a disqualifying criminal-background check, occurs only after the effective date of the statute, November 14, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">{\u00b6 28} Even if we did consider the statute to be expressly retroactive, we have already concluded in our contract-impairment analysis that R.C. 3319.391 does not impair, in Doe\u2019s circumstances, any vested right to continued employment. In view of the foregoing, we conclude that R.C. 3319.391, as expressed in H.B. 190, is not expressly retroactive, did not affect a vested right, and thus does not violate the retroactive-law proscription in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 29} Based on the above discussion, we conclude that as applied to administrative-employment contracts entered into by school districts governed by R.C. Chapter 124, R.C. 3319.391 and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01 do not violate the provision in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution that prohibits the General Assembly from passing laws that impair the obligation of contracts. Further, we conclude that R.C. 3319.391 does not violate the provision in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution that prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">So answered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-8\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b332-9\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\">.

Finally, this court has held in the context of subrogation rights that the statutory \u201cprovisions must control, regardless of the terms and conditions written into the policy by the contracting parties.\u201d <em>Verducci v.

Thus, applying the principle that existing statutory provisions are incorporated into a contract is recognition of a basic legal concept of longstanding and accepted use.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b332-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A66\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">{\u00b6 30} While I sympathize with Doe\u2019s plight, the law is clear, and I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of the two narrow legal questions certified to us by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">{\u00b6 31} Although we have resolved the federal court\u2019s legal questions under the Ohio Constitution, I believe that on remand the court may resolve this case by resorting to the doctrine of relation back. Under this doctrine, \u201can act done at a later time is, under certain circumstances, treated as though it occurred at an earlier time.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.1999) 1314. This doctrine applies to the amendments of pleadings, see Civ.R. 15(C), but I believe that it should apply here in the interest of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>{\u00b6 32} The Ohio Department of Education had statutory authority to formulate the rules to carry out the legislative intent of 2007 Sub.H.B. No. 190, eff. Nov. 14, 2007 (\u201cH.B. 190\u201d). R.C. 3319.39(E). The department promulgated Ohio Adm. Code 3301-20-03 to carry out the legislative intent of H.B. 190. Unfortunately, Doe fell into the gap between enactment of the new law and the department\u2019s regulations in response to the 2007 statutory revisions. The parties agree that had the 2009 regulation been in effect, Doe would have remained in his position, because he had been rehabilitated. Thus, I believe that the regulation should relate back to the statute\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 33} Courts must give due deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation and implementation of the law. <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Indus. Comm., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 125, 2004-Ohio-339, 802 N.E.2d 650, \u00b6 41; <em>Northwestern Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Conrad </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 282, 289, 750 N.E.2d 130. Under such circumstances, the court should apply the subsequent regulation to Doe\u2019s contract in this case, which would allow him to continue his employment but would also fulfill the overall intent of the law.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b333-7\">Brown, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXy\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 34} I agree with the majority that R.C. Chapter 124, R.C. 3319.391, and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01 do not violate the Contract Clause, Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. However, I would hold that R.C. 3319.391 violates the prohibition against retroactive laws in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 35} Today the majority holds that a long-term school-district employee \u2014 a person who has successfully turned his life around and has not been in trouble for over 30 years \u2014 can be summarily fired based upon a new law that looks back to conduct that occurred prior to his employment. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, Doe\u2019s vested right to continued public employment provided him with constitutional rights, which should not be summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that R.C. 3319.391 does not violate the prohibition against retroactive laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">{\u00b6 37} According to the order certifying the questions to this court, Doe was convicted 34 years ago for drug trafficking and spent three years in jail. That conviction was expunged in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">{\u00b6 38} Doe obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1983 and became a licensed social worker and certified chemical-dependency counselor. The federal court that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>hearing this case found that Doe \u201chas been a model citizen since being released from jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 39} Beginning in 1997, Doe spent five years working for the school district as a drug-free-school specialist. Doe has since worked in an administrative capacity as a hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 3319.391 was enacted, effective November 14, 2007, to expand the categories of school-district employees who were required to undergo criminal background checks. 2007 Sub.H.B. No. 190. Doe was among the employees who were newly subject to background checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 41} However, the statute provided that any employee whose background check revealed crimes requiring termination could avoid termination if that person met rehabilitation standards adopted by the Department of Education. R.C. 3319.391(C). Doe\u2019s 1976 conviction made him subject to termination, and under the then-existing regulations, the drug offense was a nonrehabilitative offense. Former Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-01(E)(1)(c) and (A)(11), 2005-2006 Ohio Monthly Record 1261, eff. Sept. 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 42} In July 2008, Doe signed a new employment contract with the school district; the contract stated that Doe\u2019s employment was \u201csubject to confirmation of appropriate state certification.\u201d In November 2008, the school district informed Doe that a background check had revealed his former felony and that his employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">{\u00b6 43} Subsequently, the Department of Education passed regulations that would have permitted Doe to retain employment by demonstrating rehabilitation. Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03 (eff. Aug. 27, 2009). Had this regulation been in effect in November 2008, it is unlikely that Doe would have been fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 44} Doe\u2019s termination was incongruous in that had the General Assembly not passed R.C. 3319.391, Doe would not have been fired, and had the Department of Education more quickly promulgated its rule regarding rehabilitation (Ohio Adm.Code 3301-20-03), Doe would not have been fired. As noted by the federal court, Doe is a model citizen, a person who turned his life around in a remarkable and exemplary way. His life and experiences made him uniquely qualified for his service to the school district. Yet because his background check occurred during the gap between November 2007 (when R.C. 3319.391 was enacted) and August 2009 (when the Department of Education finally promulgated the rule that would allow rehabilitation for Doe\u2019s offense), Doe was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">{\u00b6 45} Doe filed suit in state court, alleging breach of contract and violation of constitutional rights. The school district removed the case to federal court. The federal court certified questions of state law to this court concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>constitutionality of certain state laws in effect at the time of Doe\u2019s termination. We accepted the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">{\u00b6 46} For the majority, the analysis of whether R.C. 3319.391 violates the prohibition against retroactive laws begins and ends with Doe\u2019s 2008 employment contract. According to the majority, Doe did not have a vested right to employment, because his 2008 contract was contingent on \u201c \u2018confirmation of appropriate state certification.\u2019 \u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 18, quoting the employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 47} In order to reach this result, the majority equates passing the criminal background check required by R.C. 3319.391 with \u201cconfirmation of appropriate state certification\u201d under Doe\u2019s employment contract. The majority springboards from this proposition to the holding that Doe did not meet the \u201ccondition precedent\u201d in his employment contract and therefore had no \u201cvested right\u201d to continued employment. Without such a right, the majority concludes, the law is not unconstitutionally retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 48} I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the contract makes Doe\u2019s employment conditional on a background check. The contract does not clearly and unambiguously say that Doe would be subject to a background check and that he could be fired based on the result. It says instead that his employment is \u201csubject to confirmation of appropriate state certification.\u201d The phrase \u201cstate certification\u201d is ambiguous. In the context of a school-district employment contract, \u201ccertification\u201d could as easily mean \u201clicensed,\u201d since certain school-district jobs require licenses. See R.C. 3319.22, describing \u201ceducator licenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 49} Thus, the contract is ambiguous, at best, with regard to whether passing a criminal background check equates to \u201cconfirmation of appropriate state certification.\u201d In contracts, we construe ambiguities against the proponent of the instrument. <em>Monnett v. Monnett </em>(1888), 46 Ohio St. 30, 34-35, 17 N.E. 659. \u201cAny ambiguities in the document setting forth the rights and responsibilities of each party must be construed against the drafter of the document. Otherwise the nondrafter of the document may ultimately forfeit far more than he or she reasonably contemplated at the time the agreement was signed.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 464, 471, 628 N.E.2d 1343 (Resnick, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 50} In light of the ambiguity, the court should not deprive Doe of his vested right to continued employment. Instead, the court should hold the ambiguity against the contract\u2019s proponent \u2014 the school district \u2014 and hold that the clause does not mean that the employee must pass a criminal background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 51} The majority next asserts that Doe\u2019s satisfying R.C. 3319.391 was an implied term of the employment contract because the statute was in effect before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the contract was executed. In other words, the majority holds that Doe loses the ability to raise his otherwise viable constitutional right based upon terms of the contract that were added to the contract by this court by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">{\u00b6 52} I cannot agree to so casually dispose of Doe\u2019s constitutional claims through the use of a legal artifice (contract terms implied in law).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 53} This is not a proper use of the court\u2019s ability to supply implied contractual terms. The court should imply terms to prevent injustice and to conform the contract to the parties\u2019 actual intent, but not to deprive a person of his ability to enforce his constitutional rights. This is particularly true when, as here, the terms being implied are from a newly passed law and would significantly alter the contractual relationship between the parties. Accordingly, I would not find that Doe\u2019s satisfying R.C. 3319.391 was an implied term of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 54} The majority also states that R.C. 3319.391 is not retroactive because it does not go back in time and terminate Doe from the date of his initial hire or deprive him of pay and benefits that he previously acquired. But these facts are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 55} What is relevant is that the new law required Doe\u2019s termination from employment based on his past conduct. We have held that laws are unconstitutionally retroactive when they impair a vested right based upon prior conduct. <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 285, 2006-Ohio-2419, 847 N.E.2d 414, \u00b6 6. The principle is that a law cannot add new burdens to rights that are presently lawfully enjoyed, based upon events that occurred in the past. R.C. 3319.391 is such a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">{\u00b6 56} R.C. 3319.391 applies retroactively by its own terms. The statute applies to new and current employees alike and instructs that an employee whose background check discloses a proscribed felony \u201cshall be released from employment.\u201d R.C. 3319.391(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 57} Our caselaw establishes that public employees, like Doe, have a vested right to continued employment. <em>Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emps., AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. Lakewood City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 175, 176, 624 N.E.2d 1043. And where, as here, that vested right is impaired by a new law requiring the employee\u2019s termination based on the employee\u2019s prior conduct, the law is unconstitutionally retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b6 58} For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that R.C. 3319.391 violated the constitutional prohibition against retroactive laws. Accordingly, I dissent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the majority\u2019s holding that R.C. 3319.391 does not violate the prohibition against retroactive laws.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ar9\">Dinsmore &amp; Shohl, L.L.P., Christopher R.
