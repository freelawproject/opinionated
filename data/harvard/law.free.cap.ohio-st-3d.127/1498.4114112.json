Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>S.D.Ohio (W.D.) No. 1:10-CV-820, and are not subject to the consent decree in <em>Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. Brunner, </em>S.D.Ohio (E.D.) No. C2-06-896, with exactly the same procedures and scrutiny applied to any provisional ballots during the board\u2019s review of them leading up to its decision on November 16, without assuming that poll-worker error occurred in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Shortly after we granted the writ, the secretary of state issued a tie-breaking decision and directive relating to the December 9 and December 28 tie votes of respondent Hamilton County Board of Elections. This cause is now before the court upon relators\u2019 January 10, 2011 amended complaint for a writ of mandamus challenging the secretary\u2019s January 7 tie-breaking vote and directive and their motions for expedited issuance of alternative writ and for temporary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Upon consideration thereof, it is ordered by the court that because the applicable procedural rules do not authorize a postjudgment right to file an amended complaint in the same ease to attack a decision that was filed after judgment was entered, the amended complaint in mandamus is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
