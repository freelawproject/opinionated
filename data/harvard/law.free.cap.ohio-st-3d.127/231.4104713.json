Ceccarelli was assessed not as a motor-fuel dealer himself, but rather as a \u201cresponsible party\u201d by virtue of his status as owner and president of Restructure Petroleum Marketing Services, Inc. (\u201cRPMS\u201d). RPMS itself had previously been assessed for the unpaid taxes, which amounted to $396,565.16. The tax commissioner found that Ceccarelli was a responsible party who was liable to pay the amount assessed against the corporation because he was the indirect owner and the president of RPMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">{\u00b6 2} Before the BTA, Ceccarelli did not contest his status as a responsible party under the statute, but instead asserted that the assessment was barred because it had been issued after the statutory four-year limitation period expired. The tax commissioner argued that the limitation statute in question, R.C. 5735.12, applies to assessments issued against motor-fuel dealers, but not to assessments issued against \u201cresponsible parties\u201d who were their officers or employees. The BTA agreed with the commissioner\u2019s position and affirmed the assessment against Ceccarelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, Ceccarelli again contends that the four-year limitation also applies to assessments against employees or officers of motor-fuel dealers who qualify as responsible parties. We agree, and we therefore reverse the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">{\u00b6 4} Underlying the assessment against Ceccarelli in this case are four assessments previously issued against RPMS pertaining to motor-fuel taxes reported but not fully paid for April, May, June, and August 2000. Jack Ceccarelli was identified as corporate president of RPMS on filings with the office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of the Ohio secretary of state and in correspondence with the Ohio Department of Taxation. The four months of unpaid taxes amounted to $396,565.16, finally totaling $665,797 after assessment of interest and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 5} RPMS had belatedly filed motor-fuel-tax returns for April, May, June, and August 2000 on July 7, December 19, September 18, and December 11, 2000, respectively. The commissioner issued his assessment against Ceccarelli as a responsible party on February 24, 2005 \u2014 more than four years after the tax reports had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 6} The record is sparse, but Ceccarelli has not disputed the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. The commissioner found that Ceccarelli was not only president of RPMS, but also \u201c100% owner of Restructure, Inc., who owned 100% of RPMS.\u201d The final determination also relied on filings and correspondence signed by Ceccarelli to establish that he \u201chad the authority to exercise control of the corporation\u2019s fiscal responsibilities,\u201d a criterion for responsible-party liability under R.C. 5735.35(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 7} The third paragraph of R.C. 5735.12(A) states: \u201cNo assessment shall be made against any motor fuel dealer for taxes imposed by this chapter more than four years after the date on which the report on which the assessment was based was due or was filed, whichever is later. This section does not bar an assessment against any motor fuel dealer who fails to file a report required by section 5735.06 of the Revised Code, or who files a fraudulent motor fuel tax report.\u201d Thus, when motor-fuel-tax reports have been filed late, the four-year limitation period runs from the time of filing. It is undisputed in the present case that the commissioner issued the assessment against Ceccarelli more than four years after the filing of the underlying corporate motor-fuel-tax reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 8} The question is whether the four-year time limitation set forth in R.C. 5735.12(A) applies to assessments against employees or officers of motor-fuel dealers who qualify as responsible parties pursuant to R.C. 5735.35. R.C. 5735.35(A)(2) provides that the \u201csum due for the liability [of responsible parties] may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in sections 5735.12 and 5735.121 of the Revised Code.\u201d The BTA affirmed the commissioner\u2019s assessment, holding that the four-year limitation does not apply to responsible-party assessments. Ceccarelli asserts that the \u201cmanner\u201d of assessment against him as a responsible party incorporates the four-year limitation on assessment against motor-fuel dealers. This question of statutory construction presents an issue of law that we determine de novo on appeal. <em>State v. Consilio, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, 871 N.E.2d 1167, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\n<em>R.C. 5735.35(A)(2) provides that motor-fuel-tax liabilities of responsible parties be assessed \u201cin the manner\u201d of assessments issued against motor-fuel dealers, and the manner of assessment includes the four-year limitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\n<em>in R.C. 5735.12(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Bowshier v. Limbach </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 140, 556 N.E.2d 463, we considered whether an assessment of sales tax against a responsible corporate officer was barred by the four-year limitation on sales-tax assessments set forth at R.C. 5739.16(A). That section explicitly imposed the time limit on assessments \u201cissued against a vendor or consumer,\u201d and because of that restrictive language, we held that the limitation did not apply to assessments against responsible parties, who were neither vendors nor consumers under the sales-tax law. The commissioner regards <em>Bowshier </em>as dispositive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 10} As an initial matter, the commissioner points to the fact that the third paragraph of R.C. 5735.12(A) limits the prohibition against assessments to assessments issued against \u201cany motor fuel dealer.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Bowshier, </em>R.C. 5739.16(A)\u2019s limitation restricted assessments against vendors and consumers\u2014 not against responsible parties who were assessed when the primary obligors failed to discharge their legal duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 11} But this argument overlooks a crucial distinction between the motor-fuel-tax statutes and the sales-tax law. R.C. 5735.12(A) both authorizes motor-fuel-tax assessments and imposes the four-year limitation on assessments against motor-fuel dealers. By contrast, the statute of limitation for <em>sales-tax </em>assessments is set forth in R.C. 5739.16, which is an entirely different section from the section that authorizes the tax commissioner to make assessments (R.C. 5739.13).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 12} The distinction is significant because the respective code sections that address responsible-party liability provide that assessments against responsible parties should be made \u201cin the manner provided\u201d in the section that authorizes the making of assessments. R.C. 5739.33 (sales tax); R.C. 5735.35 (motor-fuel tax). As a result, the language of R.C. 5739.33 incorporates the sales-tax-assessment provisions at R.C. 5739.13, but does not incorporate the four-year limitation at R.C. 5739.16. By contrast, R.C. 5739.35 does incorporate the time limitation because the limitation is set forth in R.C. 5735.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">{\u00b6 13} To be sure, the commissioner can argue that the \u201cmanner\u201d of making assessments does not encompass the timing of those assessments, but that argument is unavailing. \u201cManner\u201d means \u201ca mode of procedure or way of acting.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(11th Ed.2006) 756. While time limitations may in some contexts be distinguished from other aspects of a \u201cmode of procedure,\u201d we see no justification for regarding the time for making an assessment as any less a part of the statutorily prescribed procedure in this context. Quite simply, R.C. 5735.12 sets forth a mode of procedure for assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ment that includes the four-year limitation, and R.C. 5735.35 incorporates that mode of procedure (including the time limitation) by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>The commissioner\u2019s exclusive focus on R.C. 5735.12(A) is not justified, because it would accord no significance to the language of R.C. 5735.35(A)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 14} The commissioner also argues that because R.C. 5735.12(A) itself authorizes assessments against responsible parties, there is no need or justification for an incorporation by reference of the time limitation by virtue of R.C. 5735.35(A)(2). Under the tax commissioner\u2019s reading of the statutes, the proper method of determining the scope of the four-year limitation on assessments is to construe the assessment and time-limitation provisions within the four corners of R.C. 5735.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 15} The second paragraph of R.C. 5735.12(A) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">(\u00b6 16} \u201cIf <em>any person required by this chapter to </em>file reports and <em>pay the taxes, </em>interest, or additional charge levied by this chapter fails to file the report, files an incomplete or incorrect report, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax, interest, or additional charge due for the period covered by the report, the commissioner may make an assessment <em>against the person </em>based upon any information in the commissioner\u2019s possession.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">{\u00b6 17} The third paragraph then sets forth the time limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cNo assessment shall be made against any <em>motor fuel dealer </em>for taxes imposed by this chapter more than four years after the date on which the report on which the assessment was based was due or was filed, whichever is later.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">{\u00b6 19} The commissioner relies on the contrast between the broad language authorizing assessments against \u201cany person\u201d with liabilities under the motor-fuel-tax law and the third paragraph\u2019s reference to \u201cmotor fuel dealer\u201d: under this reading, the contrasting language means that the four-year limitation should not be viewed as incorporated into the manner for making assessments against responsible parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">{\u00b6 20} We disagree. To adopt the commissioner\u2019s proposed reading would violate the precept that we \u201cshould construe statutes to give effect to all the enacted language.\u201d <em>Church of God in N. Ohio v. Levin, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 36, 2009-Ohio-5939, 918 N.E.2d 981, \u00b6 30, citing <em>State ex rel. Bohan v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 249, 251, 34 O.O. 151, 70 N.E.2d 888 (courts should \u201c \u2018accord meaning to each word of a leglislative [sic] enactment if it is reasonably possible to do so\u2019 \u201d). Namely, the commissioner\u2019s construction of the statutes would make a nullity out of R.C. 5735.35(A)(2)\u2019s mandate that assessments against responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>parties be made \u201cin the manner provided in sections 5735.12 and 5735.121 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">{\u00b6 21} Although we acknowledge that the contrasting language of the second and third paragraphs of R.C. 5735.12(A) may imply that <em>some </em>persons who are subject to being assessed do not enjoy the benefit of the four-year time limitation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject the contention that the employees, officers, or trustees of a motor-fuel dealer fall within that category. Because assessments against employees, officers, or trustees of a motor-fuel dealer must be made \u201cin the manner provided in\u201d R.C. 5735.12, and because that section imposes the four-year time limit on assessments against the motor-fuel dealer itself, we hold that assessments against a motor-fuel dealer\u2019s employees, officers, or trustees as responsible parties are also subject to the four-year limitation period. As a result, the assessment against Ceccarelli in this case was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, we address the commissioner\u2019s contention that any \u201cdoubt concerning the reasonableness and lawfulness of the Commissioner\u2019s and the BTA\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 5735.12(A)\u201d should be \u201cresolved against Mr. Ceccarelli\u2019s statute of limitation claim.\u201d This argument is premised on the doctrine that a statute of limitations does not restrain the state unless the restraint is expressly provided for in the statute. See <em>State ex rel. Springfield City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Gibson </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 318, 320-321, 4 O.O. 352, 199 N.E. 185 (holding that although the state is immune from statutes of limitation and such immunity \u201ccan only be waived by express provision to that effect within the statute,\u201d the state\u2019s immunity does not extend to a political subdivision); <em>Seeley v. Thomas </em>(1877), 31 Ohio St. 301, 308 (laches does not run against the state); <em>State ex rel. Parrott v. State Bd. of Public Works </em>(1881), 36 Ohio St. 409, 414 (statute providing for payment of interest with late payment did not apply to state); <em>Heddleston v. Hendricks </em>(1895), 52 Ohio St. 460, 465, 40 N.E. 408 (no adverse possession against the state). Unlike the cases cited, however, the present case involves an explicit limitation on state authority, i.e., the power to issue tax assessments. By contrast, the cited cases hold only that a <em>general </em>statute that binds <em>private litigants </em>does not bind the state absent express language to that effect. The cases are inapposite, and the doctrine they articulate does not apply to the four-year limitation at issue.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOqq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Carlile, Patchen &amp; Murphy, L.L.P., Leon Friedberg, and Robert T.

The motor-fuel-tax statutes authorize assessments against some persons who may not themselves qualify either as motor-fuel dealers or as responsible-party employees, officers, or trustees of a motor-fuel dealer. See, e.g., R.C. 5735.064(C), 5735.101, 5735.123, and 5735.124. Because the present case involves an assessment against a corporate officer of a motor-fuel dealer, we need not and do not address the applicability of the four-year limitation to assessments against any person who is assessed on some basis other than his or her status as an employee, officer, or trustee of a motor-fuel dealer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
