Rees, </em>553 U.S. 35, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420 (2008), or under Ohio law?\u201d The district court recertified the question to us on September 3, 2009, due to an inadvertent failure to provide notice of the original order to the parties. We accepted the question for review. 123 Ohio St.3d 1420, 2009-Ohio-5340, 914 N.E.2d 1062. On September 14, 2010, we heard oral argument from the petitioner. The respondent forfeited his argument by not filing a merit brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 2} There are several established methods for an Ohio death-penalty defendant to receive state review of his or her case. These methods, created by the legislature, are clear in their application to death-penalty defendants. See Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV, Ohio Constitution (direct appeal of death-penalty case to this court); R.C. 2953.21 (postconviction-relief procedure for persons convicted of crimes, including those sentenced to death); and R.C. 2725.01 (state habeas corpus petition). Additionally, we allow a death-penalty defendant to file an application to reopen his or her appeal in the courts of appeals and in this court under App.R. 26(B). See, e.g., <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1463, 2007-Ohio-1722, 864 N.E.2d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 3} We have held that these opportunities for review more than satisfy defendants\u2019 \u201cconstitutional rights to due process and fair trials\u201d while also protecting Ohio\u2019s \u201cinherent power to impose finality on its judgments.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 407, 412, 639 N.E.2d 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 4} The Ohio General Assembly has not yet provided an Ohio-law cause of action for Ohio courts to process challenges to a lethal-injection protocol, and given the review available on this issue through Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code, for injunctive relief against appropriate officers or federal habeas corpus petitions, we need not judicially craft a separate method of review under Ohio law. Accordingly, until the General Assembly explicitly expands state review of death-penalty cases by creating a methodology for reviewing Ohio\u2019s lethal-injection protocol, we must answer the certified question as follows: There is no state postconviction relief or other state-law mode of action to litigate the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>whether a specific lethal-injection protocol is constitutional under <em>Baze v. Rees, </em>553 U.S. 35, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420, or under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">So answered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-6\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b455-7\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b455-8\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b455-9\">David L.

Rees </em>(2008), 553 U.S. 35, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420, or under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">{\u00b6 6} The dissent of Chief Justice Brown contends that this court has abdicated its responsibility to the federal courts to hear and settle this matter, thereby shirking its duties to enforce and interpret Ohio law. The dissent begins from the faulty starting point that the central issue in this case is whether we will ensure that the delivery of death does not needlessly inflict severe pain. However, the true issue in this case is whether this court is required, via judicial fiat, to set up yet another layer of appeals when the legislature has not. For the reasons that follow, I concur with the majority\u2019s decision today that Ohio has no such postconviction or other forum to litigate the issue of whether Ohio\u2019s lethal injection protocol is constitutional under <em>Baze </em>or under Ohio law, that the federal courts are well equipped to handle such challenges, and that this court need not create an appellate procedure where one does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">{\u00b6 7} The dissent seems to begin with the assumption that all methods of executions are suspect. As noted in <em>Baze v. Rees, </em>\u201c[r]easonable people of good faith disagree on the morality and efficacy of capital punishment, and for many who oppose it, no method of execution would ever be acceptable.\u201d <em>Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 61, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420. This philosophical debate, however, is misplaced in this case. Our duty is to uphold the law, not to opine on whether there could be a more humane manner of administering the penalty of death in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">{\u00b6 8} Capital punishment is constitutional. <em>Gregg v. Georgia </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859. Therefore, \u201c[i]t necessarily follows that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>must be a means of carrying it out. Some risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution \u2014 no matter how humane \u2014 if only from the prospect of error in following the required procedure. It is clear, then, that the Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions.\u201d <em>Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Eighth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 9} Our decision today is guided by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that \u201c[ejxcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d Further guidance is found in R.C. 2949.22(A), Ohio\u2019s lethal injection statute, which provides that \u201ca death sentence shall be executed by causing the application to the person, upon whom the sentence was imposed, of a lethal injection of a drug or combination of drugs of sufficient dosage to quickly and painlessly cause death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 10} Throughout the history of this country, the United States Supreme Court has time and again upheld various methods of carrying out a sentence of death. \u201cFor much of American history, capital punishment was carried out by public hanging.\u201d Elliot Garvey, A Needle in the Haystack: Finding a Solution to Ohio\u2019s Lethal Injection Problems (2010), 38 Cap.U.L.Rev. 609, 622. In 1878, the court upheld the use of a firing squad in carrying out executions in <em>Wilkerson v. Utah </em>(1878), 99 U.S. 130, 134-135, 25 L.Ed. 345. In 1890, the court upheld the use of the newly created electric chair in <em>In re Kemmler </em>(1890), 136 U.S. 436, 10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519. Today, at least 36 states, along with the federal government, have now adopted lethal injection as the exclusive or primary means of implementing the death penalty. <em>Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 42-43, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 11} The dissent seems to advocate a 100 percent guarantee of a painless death. But the <em>Baze </em>court, in upholding Kentucky\u2019s lethal injection protocol, held that \u201c[sjimply because an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death, does not establish the sort of \u2018objectively intolerable risk of harm\u2019 that qualifies as cruel and unusual.\u201d Id. at 50. <em>Baze </em>held that \u201c[pjermitting an Eighth Amendment violation to be established on [a showing that better alternatives exist] would threaten to transform courts into boards of inquiry charged with determining \u2018best practices\u2019 for executions, with each ruling supplanted by another round of litigation touting a new and improved methodology. Such an approach finds no support in our cases, would embroil the courts in ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise, and would substantially intrude on the role of state legislatures in implementing their execution procedures \u2014 a role that by all accounts the States have fulfilled with an earnest desire to provide for a progressively more humane manner of death.\u201d Id. at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>R.C. 2949.22</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 12} The dissent argues that although the Eighth Amendment may not bar Ohio\u2019s new execution protocol, R.C. 2949.22(A) provides greater protection against pain and suffering than does the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. As noted in our order, there are already several established methods for an Ohio capital defendant to receive state review of his or her case. These methods, created by the Constitution or the legislature, are clear in their application to capital defendants. Section 2(B)(2)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution authorizes a direct appeal to this court of all death-penalty cases. R.C. 2953.21 creates postconviction-relief procedures for persons convicted of crimes, including those who have been sentenced to death. R.C. 2725.01 prescribes procedures for state habeas corpus petitions that apply to capital defendants. Finally, capital defendants may file an application for reopening their appeals in the court of appeals and in this court under App.R. 26(B). Apart from state review, federal review includes federal habeas corpus under Section 2254, Title 28, U.S.Code, as well as an action under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code, for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 13} This court is correct to refrain from creating another appellate process when the General Assembly has not so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Declaratory Judgment and Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 14} The dissent highlights what it believes to be two avenues by which a death-row petitioner may challenge the method of execution in Ohio courts: declaratory-judgment actions and mandamus. In my view, neither of these methods is necessary, as the federal courts have done a thorough job thus far of adjudicating this issue. Further, a writ of mandamus to ensure that the warden fulfills his duty to carry out the death penalty quickly and painlessly under R.C. 2949.22 would simply order the warden to do that which he or she is already required to do by law and that which he or she is already doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">{\u00b6 15} The Ohio General Assembly did not choose to create an Ohio cause of action specifically to litigate the issue of whether Ohio\u2019s lethal injection protocol is constitutional under <em>Baze </em>or under Ohio law. I support this court\u2019s decision not to create a cause of action that does not exist, but rather to leave that policy decision up to the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 16} With the existing system of direct appeals, postconviction relief, state habeas corpus, applications for reopening, federal habeas corpus, and Section 1983 actions, along with the various levels of appeals attendant to each action, there are more than adequate protections for those given the ultimate sentence. At some point, the victims\u2019 families and the state deserve finality in judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>For those reasons, I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-4\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b458-5\">O\u2019Connor, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_s\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 17} I concur in the majority\u2019s answer to the certified question that there is no state postconviction relief or other state-law mode of action to litigate the issue of whether a specific lethal-injection protocol is constitutional under <em>Baze v. Rees </em>(2008), 553 U.S. 35, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420, or under Ohio law. I write separately, however, to address the flawed argument in the dissent of Chief Justice Brown, that a declaratory-judgment action is the proper avenue for litigating this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 18} The dissent declares that Michael Scott has the right to a quick and painless death under R.C. 2949.22(A) and that Ohio courts are obligated to enforce that right by determining whether the lethal-injection protocol satisfies the statutory criteria. The dissent sanctions a declaratory-judgment action as the appropriate mechanism through which a petitioner can protect his right. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 19} Ohio\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes courts of record to \u201cdeclare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d R.C. 2721.02(A). And as this court has held, a declaratory-judgment action provides a \u201cmeans by which parties can eliminate uncertainty regarding their legal rights and obligations.\u201d <em>Mid-Am. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Heasley, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-1248, 863 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">(\u00b6 20} The flaw in the dissent\u2019s position, however, is that R.C. 2949.22(A) does not create a cause of action to enforce any supposed right to a quick and painless death. <em>Cooey v. Strickland </em>(C.A.6, 2009), 589 F.3d 210, 234. Rather, the statute directs that the death sentence be carried out by lethal injection of a drug, or combination of drugs, of sufficient dosage to quickly and painlessly cause death to the person upon whom the death penalty was imposed. R.C. 2949.22(A). The statute, therefore, imposes a <em>duty </em>upon the individual administering the lethal-injection protocol, but it does not plainly create any <em>right </em>to a quick and painless death as the dissent mistakenly presumes. In the absence of demonstrating an established right, a declaratory judgment does not lie under R.C. 2721.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 21} The dissent\u2019s summary suggestion that all death-row petitioners should be permitted to assert both constitutional and statutory challenges to the lethal-injection protocol by means of a declaratory-judgment action is also flawed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>speculative nature of such a claim. While the declaratory-judgment statutes should be liberally construed, the statutes are not without limitation:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cMost significantly, in keeping with the long-standing tradition that a court does not render advisory opinions, they allow the filing of a declaratory judgment only to decide \u2018an actual controversy, the resolution of which will confer certain rights or status upon the litigants.\u2019 <em>Corron v. Corron </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 75, 79, 531 N.E.2d 708. Not every conceivable controversy is an actual one. As the First District aptly noted, in order for a justiciable question to exist, \u2018 \u201c \u2018[t]he danger or dilemma of the plaintiff must be present, not contingent on the happening of hypothetical future events * * * and the threat to his position must be actual and genuine and not merely possible or remote.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>League for Preservation of Civil Rights v. Cincinnati </em>(1940), 64 Ohio App. 195, 197, 17 O.O. 424, 28 N.E.2d 660, quoting Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (1934) 40.\u201d <em>Mid-Am. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Heasley, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-1248, 863 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 23} A death-row petitioner\u2019s challenge to the lethal-injection protocol is based on the <em>possibility </em>that the application of the protocol could violate his rights under the Constitution and/or Ohio law. Thus, the claim would be contingent on the happening of a hypothetical future event, which is an impermissible basis to support a declaratory-judgment action. <em>Ex parte Alba </em>(Tex.Crim.App.2008), 256 S.W.3d 682, a case upon which the dissent relies, lends further credence to my view. Therein, the court rejected a death-row convict\u2019s application for habeas relief challenging the lethal-injection protocol and addressed the pitfalls of using a declaratory-judgment action to challenge the protocol:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[Ejven if the mixture currently used for lethal injection is determined to violate the Eighth Amendment, Applicant would still not be entitled to release or retrial\u2014 he would still be subject to the same sentence, which would be carried out using a different mixture as determined by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Additionally, the three-drug mixture Applicant complains about may not even be used when the date of his execution is set. Therefore, any consideration of the merits would result in a declaratory judgment and would not result in relief for Applicant. <em>See Ex Parte Puckett, </em>161 Tex.Crim. 51, 274 S.W.2d 696, 697 (1954) (stating, \u2018This court is not authorized to enter a declaratory judgment.\u2019).\u201d Id. at 686.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 25} In addition to the remoteness of Scott\u2019s challenge to the possibility that the injection protocol may cause him severe pain, the current protocol may not even be used when his execution date is set. In fact, media outlets repeatedly have reported on an alleged shortage of sodium thiopental, the drug currently used by Ohio in executions. See, e.g., Kathy Lohr, States Delay Executions Owing to Drug Shortage (Sept. 16, 2010), http://www.npr.org/templates/story/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>story.php?storyId=129912444 (last accessed Nov. 10, 2010). Furthermore, as noted in <em>Ex parte Alba, </em>a declaratory judgment potentially would not offer Scott any relief from his death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, the \u201cpossibility\u201d that the lethal-injection protocol would cause Scott or any death-row convict severe pain is further undermined by the recent holding in <em>Cooey, </em>589 F.3d 210. In <em>Cooey, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals thoroughly reviewed evidence presented regarding Ohio\u2019s current one-drug protocol and determined that the current protocol is similar to the three-drug protocol held constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Baze. </em>589 F.3d at 221. The court therefore concluded that the risk of severe pain was no greater \u2014 and likely less \u2014 than that inherent in any constitutional lethal injection. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 27} The dissent\u2019s endorsement of a declaratory-judgment action for litigating Scott\u2019s claim is not only misguided, it is unsupported by Ohio\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Act. Accordingly, I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b460-7\">Brown, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 28} In this case, Michael Scott, who has been sentenced to death, does not ask to stay the executioner\u2019s hand, but instead prays that the tools used to terminate his life will be humane. At the heart of his plea is a question that probes our common conscience: whether we will ensure that the delivery of death does not needlessly inflict severe pain upon those we have condemned. Cases such as this are the measuring stick of our civilization, in which we stake the boundaries of our government\u2019s obligation to protect the weakest, the least popular, and the worst of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 29} The federal court that is considering Scott\u2019s case has asked us a question of Ohio law: whether there is a court in Ohio in which Scott may seek to enforce his rights regarding the amount of risk, pain, and suffering that he will endure during his execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 30} The majority today summarily answers \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">{\u00b6 31} I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">{\u00b6 32} It is unthinkable that there could be no judicial forum in Ohio within which to explore the legal ambit of humane execution. Ohio has sentenced Scott to death, and Ohio has provided the means and guidelines under which he will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>die. Ohio must also take the responsibility of ensuring that the method of death does not violate Scott\u2019s remaining rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">{\u00b6 33} The majority abdicates this court\u2019s responsibility to federal courts to hear and settle this matter. In doing so, we have shirked our duties to enforce and interpret an Ohio statute, Ohio\u2019s Constitution, and the United States Constitution. Worse, we have rendered unenforceable the General Assembly\u2019s statutory mandate that death shall be administered \u201cquickly and painlessly,\u201d and we have foreclosed from consideration whether Ohio\u2019s Constitution provides greater protection from pain and suffering than the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 34} Scott has the right to a quick and painless death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R.C. 2949.22(A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that the drug protocol \u201cshall\u201d be administered in such a manner as to \u201cquickly and painlessly cause death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>{\u00b6 35} This statutory right provides greater protection against pain and suffering than the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. The United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[s]imply because an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death, does not establish the sort of \u2018objectively intolerable risk of harm\u2019 that qualifies as cruel and unusual\u201d under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Baze v. Rees </em>(2008), 553 U.S. 35, 50, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420, quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 825, 846, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811. In order for a petitioner to succeed on an Eighth Amendment challenge, he must show that an \u201calternative procedure [is] feasible, readily implemented, and [will] in fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\u201d <em>Baze </em>at 52. Thus, the burden on a petitioner to establish an Eighth Amendment violation is worlds apart from establishing a violation of the affirmative requirement in R.C. 2949.22(A) that the warden shall ensure that an execution be quick and painless.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, Ohio courts are obligated to enforce the policy announced in this statute and determine whether the lethal-injection protocol meets the criteria of R.C. 2949.22, independent of constitutional considerations. Through R.C. 2949.22, the General Assembly has provided that those condemned to death should experience a quick and painless death. Ohio courts are duty-bound to ensure that that policy is realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 37} Yet today\u2019s holding closes the courthouse doors to death-row petitioners who wish to protect their right to a quick and painless death under R.C. 2949.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 38} Federal courts will not protect that right. The Sixth Circuit has recently ruled that federal courts cannot enforce R.C. 2949.22, because the statute does not \u201ccreate[ ] a federal right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Cooey v. Strickland </em>(C.A.6, 2010), 604 F.3d 939, 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 39} If Ohio\u2019s courthouses too are closed to claims under R.C. 2949.22 \u2014 as the majority says they are \u2014 the statute is rendered meaningless and unenforceable, and the right, though laudable, becomes hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 40} Further, Ohio courts must resolve whether those persons facing execution are entitled to greater protections under the Ohio Constitution than they are provided by the federal Constitution. In <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 616 N.E.2d 163, we held that Ohio\u2019s Constitution has force independent of the United States Constitution. We explained that our state Constitution is not limited to the protections offered by its federal counterpart, and Ohio could \u201caccord[ ] greater civil liberties and protections to individuals and groups.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">{\u00b6 41} We have never directly held that the standard for a method-of-execution challenge under the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>announced in <em>Baze v. Rees </em>is the same as that required under Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, which prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 42} In a case that predates <em>Baze v. Rees, </em>we addressed a method-of-death challenge to lethal injection: \u201c[Appellant] argues that the death penalty is unconstitutional under the federal and Ohio Constitutions because the methods used to carry out the sentence, electrocution or lethal injection, are cruel and unusual punishment. * * * [Appellant] fails to cite any case in which lethal injection has been found to be cruel or unusual punishment. This proposition of law is overruled.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 608, 734 N.E.2d 345.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Carter </em>predated the holding in <em>Baze v. Rees </em>regarding the method by which a defendant may challenge the method of death for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, we have never determined whether the standard under our Constitution is the same as the standard announced in <em>Baze. </em>In <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 279, we cited <em>Carter </em>in summarily overruling a challenge to the lethal-injection method. We also cited <em>Baze, </em>noting that <em>Baze </em>upheld Kentucky\u2019s lethal-injection protocol, which is \u201csimilar\u201d to Ohio\u2019s. Id. However, we have never independently examined our protocol, nor have we expressly adopted the <em>Baze </em>analysis as the standard for Ohio\u2019s protections against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 44} Thus, nothing in our precedent forecloses a death-row convict from raising a new constitutional argument of independent force under the Ohio Constitution. Because this issue of purely state law is a novel one, federal courts should abstain from ruling on whether the lethal-injection protocol meets the protections afforded by Ohio\u2019s Constitution. See <em>Minnesota v. Natl. Tea Co. </em>(1940), 309 U.S. 551, 557, 60 S.Ct. 676, 84 L.Ed. 920 (\u201cIt is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions\u201d); S.Ct.Prac.R. 18.1 (providing that a federal court may certify questions of state law \u201cfor which there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this Supreme Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 45} Thus, by refusing to offer an Ohio forum for method-of-execution challenges, the majority has abandoned the core mission of Ohio courts of determining the scope and protections afforded by Ohio\u2019s Constitution. Worse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the result is that a death-row petitioner has no forum in which to seek protection from cruel and unusual punishment under the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 46} Ohio courts should consider a convict\u2019s rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well. In the context of death, a petitioner should be permitted to challenge methods of execution that carry an \u201c \u2018objectively intolerable risk of harm\u2019 \u201d or a \u201c \u2018substantial risk of serious harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baze, </em>553 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420, quoting <em>Famer, </em>511 U.S. at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811. It is, by now, well settled that Ohio courts are arbiters of questions raised under the United States Constitution and enjoy the inherent power to apply its provisions. Thus, when the issue is presented to them, Ohio courts should not shy away from the duty to hear and determine a condemned person\u2019s Eighth Amendment challenge to lethal injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 47} Given the range of laws governing the execution of human beings, it is unsurprising that there are, in fact, avenues in Ohio in which to raise such claims. Indeed, in this case, the federal court was faced with so many different options\u2014 venues that <em>had already been used or recommended </em>in Ohio, that it asked us to straighten them all out.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 48} As the federal court noted, challenges to the method of execution have been raised in different settings and at different stages and have met different fates. See, e.g., <em>State v. Scott, </em>5th Dist. No. 2005CA00028, 2006-Ohio-257, 2006 WL 173171, \u00b6 59-60 (issue first raised in court of appeals in postconviction-relief proceeding; rejected as waived); <em>State v. Jackson, </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-T-0089, 2006 Ohio 2651, 2006 WL 1459757, \u00b6 149 (issue raised and rejected in trial court in postconviction; appellate court held that \u201ca postconviction proceeding is not the proper legal context in which to litigate this issue; instead, this type of issue should be raised in a declaratory judgment or habeas corpus action\u201d); <em>State v. Rivera, </em>9th Dist. Nos. 08CA009426 and 08CA009427, 2009-Ohio-1428, 2009 WL 806819 (pretrial motion for dismissal of death-penalty specifications on ground that method of execution is unconstitutional granted by trial court; appeal by state dismissed as not involving final, appealable order); <em>Otte v. Strickland, </em>Franklin C.P. No. 08-CV-013337 (16 death-row inmates seek declaratory judgment in common pleas court; case is currently stayed).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 49} In my opinion, there are at least two good methods by which a death-row petitioner may challenge the method of execution in Ohio courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 50} First is declaratory judgment under R.C. Chapter 2721. A declaratory-judgment action would allow petitioners to raise all potential constitutional and statutory issues in one action. And it would provide a framework for the issuance of injunctive relief should an Ohio court determine that the lethal-injection procedure falls short of the requirements of law. A declaratory-judgment action permits evidentiary discovery and hearings, which would create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>a thorough record of facts regarding the pain and suffering involved in various methods of execution. And it is a vehicle that is already in use to adjudicate method-of-execution claims. In Ohio, there is the case of <em>Otte v. Strickland, </em>Franklin C.P. No. 08-CY-013337. <em>Baze v. Rees </em>was a declaratory-judgment action originating in Kentucky. Id., 553 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420. Many other states have approved, suggested, or used declaratory-judgment actions as a vehicle to litigate constitutional and statutory challenges to methods of execution. See <em>Brown v. Vail </em>(2010), 169 Wash.2d 318, 237 P.3d 263; <em>Ark. Dept. of Corr. v. Williams, </em>2009 Ark. 523, \u2014 S.W.3d \u2014, 2009 WL 4545103; <em>Ex parte Alba </em>(Tex.Crim.App.2008), 256 S.W.3d 682, 686; <em>Smith v. State </em>(Jan. 4, 2010), Mont.Dist. No. BDV-2008-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 51} Under the Ohio Declaratory Judgment Act, \u201ccourts of record may declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d R.C. 2721.02(A). The act \u201cprovides a means by which parties can eliminate uncertainty regarding their legal rights and obligations.\u201d <em>Mid-Am. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Heasley, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-1248, 863 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 8. The declaratory-judgment statutes are \u201cremedial and shall be liberally construed and administered.\u201d R.C. 2721.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 52} A declaratory-judgment action would allow the creation of a record on which a court may base its ruling. \u201cAn action for a declaratory judgment pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2721 is a civil action,\u201d <em>Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Wickham </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 16, 21, 17 O.O.3d 10, 406 N.E.2d 1363, and issues of fact \u201cmay be tried and determined in the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in which the action or proceeding is pending.\u201d R.C. 2721.10. See also Civ.R. 57 (\u201cThe procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment * * * shall be in accordance with these rules\u201d). In <em>Baze v. Rees, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the trial court hearing on Kentucky\u2019s lethal-injection protocol involved \u201ca 7-day bench trial during which the trial court received the testimony of approximately 20 witnesses, including numerous experts.\u201d Id., 553 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 53} For those reasons, I believe that a declaratory-judgment action is the proper avenue in Ohio for litigating Scott\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 54} Second, absent a declaratory-judgment action, a writ of mandamus may be available. A writ of mandamus would ensure that the warden fulfills his duty to carry out the death penalty quickly and painlessly under R.C. 2949.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">{\u00b6 55} In order to gain entitlement to the writ, the petitioner \u201cmust establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of respondents to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Gaylor, Inc. v. Goodenow, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 407, 2010-Ohio-1844, 928 N.E.2d 728, \u00b6 15. A petitioner should be granted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>forum in which to argue that all of those factors are met. R.C. 2949.22(A) provides that the drug protocol \u201cshall\u201d \u201cquickly and painlessly cause death\u201d and that the warden \u201cshall ensure that the death sentence is executed.\u201d Thus, the statute seems to place an affirmative legal duty upon the warden and to confer a right on the inmate to a quick and painless death. If a declaratory-judgment action is not available, mandamus could be appropriate, because petitioners would have no remedy available at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 56} My opinion today does not address the merit, or lack thereof, of Scott\u2019s substantive arguments concerning lethal injection as a means of carrying out his death sentence. But I would hold that a failure to provide a forum in which Scott\u2019s rights may be contested results in Scott being summarily deprived of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 57} For the foregoing reasons I would hold that Scott may challenge his method of execution in a declaratory-judgment action. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">. In her concurring opinion, Justice O\u2019Connor writes that while R.C. 2949.22(A) \u201cimposes a <em>duty </em>upon the individual administering the lethal-injection protocol * * *, it does not plainly create any <em>right </em>to a quick and painless death.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) \u00b6 20 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). I disagree. \u201cA duty is the invariable correlative of that legal relation which is most properly called a right or claim.\u201d Hohfeld, Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning (1913), 23 Yale L.J. 16, 33. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines duty as \u201c[a] legal obligation that is owed or due to another and that needs to be satisfied; <em>an obligation for which somebody else has a corresponding right.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 580. See also <em>Marion Cty. Bar Assn. Commt. v. Marion Cty. </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 345, 354, 55 O.O. 205, 123 N.E.2d 521, quoting <em>Province of Tarlac v. Gale, </em>26 Philippine 338, 351 (\u2018\u201cWherever there is a duty there is a corresponding right; and whenever a duty is laid upon an official there is another official or person who has the right to enforce the performance of the duty\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">I agree that there are legitimate .concerns as to the appropriate time that a challenge to the lethal-injection protocol might be ripe for adjudication. I do not find that issue relevant to the question asked of us by the federal court. The federal court did not ask us <em>when </em>a challenge based on R.C. 2949.22 to Ohio\u2019s lethal-injection protocol is ripe for adjudication in an Ohio court, but rather <em>whether </em>such a challenge may be made in an Ohio court. In my view, the issue before us concerns the manner, forum, and procedures in which Ohio\u2019s lethal-injection protocol may be challenged in an Ohio court as being inconsistent with the mandate enacted by the General Assembly. I cannot assent to the majority\u2019s determination that no forum or procedures exist in which an Ohio court may interpret the statutory \u201cquick and painless\u201d language included by the General Assembly in R.C. 2949.22, nor can I agree that this issue of interpretation should be left to the federal courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\">. R.C. 2949.22 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">\u201c(A) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, a death sentence shall be executed by causing the application <em>to the person, upon whom the sentence was imposed, </em>of a lethal injection of a drug or combination of drugs of sufficient dosage to <em>quickly and painlessly cause death. </em>The application of the drug or combination of drugs shall be continued until the person is dead. The warden of the correctional institution in which the sentence is to be executed or another person selected by the director of rehabilitation and correction shall ensure that the death sentence is executed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\">. I note that <em>Carter </em>has become the seminal opinion as to method-of-execution challenges. This is regrettable, because the sole reasoning in <em>Carter </em>was that the defendant had not cited any cases finding lethal injection to be cruel and unusual; therefore the method was permissible. Despite the lack of analysis in <em>Carter, </em>we have cited its holding, time and time again, to summarily rebuff constitutional challenges to the method of lethal injection. See, e.g., <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 131; <em>State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6 245; <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 279; <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, at \u00b6 126.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b466-7\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 58} It is correct, in response to the direct question we have been asked to answer, to state that Ohio does not have an established legal process for a capital defendant to challenge the precise method and drug protocol that will be used by the state to execute that defendant. We are, however, bound by Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution to ensure that cruel and unusual punishment is not inflicted. As a society, our comprehension of the meaning of those words has evolved. The understanding of the state officials responsible for carrying out the mandate of death has been, and continues to be, re-examined with respect to the exact drugs, procedures, and personnel needed to comply with statutory and constitutional mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 59} It is not our duty to lay out a roadmap for protracted challenges to Ohio\u2019s execution protocol by every capital defendant. Section 2, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, however, grants jurisdiction to this court over the five great writs, Section 2(B)(1)(a) through (e), and \u201c[i]n any cause on review as may be necessary to its complete determination.\u201d Section 2(B)(1)(f). I would deem Article IV to provide an avenue for a capital defendant to challenge an execution protocol. Is that a satisfactory remedy? That is the question we return to the federal courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
