Appellant, Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (\u201cDCI\u201d), provides dialysis services for patients who suffer from end-stage renal disease (\u201cESRD\u201d). DCI sought to obtain a charitable-use exemption for its West Chester facility in Butler County, but the tax commissioner denied the application. On appeal, the BTA affirmed the denial of the exemption, finding that DCI had not shown that it qualified as a charitable institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121 or that the use of the West Chester facility\u2019s real property was exclusively charitable, pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 2} Based on our review of the case law and the record of this case, and concluding that the BTA\u2019s decision is reasonable and lawful, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">{\u00b6 3} DCI was organized as a nonprofit corporation in Tennessee in 1971. DCI\u2019s charter specifically states that DCI\u2019s purpose is to operate dialysis clinics and to receive and apply funds to purposes recognized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; as amended, the charter explicitly prohibits operating for \u201cpecuniary gain or profit.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">{\u00b6 4} On December 22, 2003, DCI filed an application for a property-tax exemption for tax year 2004 for its West Chester facility, a 9,846-square-foot building located at 7650 University Drive in Butler County, at which DCI provides dialysis services to ESRD patients. In the application, DCI stated that fees for services \u201care billed to Medicare, Medicaid or insurance companies and patients with ability to pay. Patients unable to pay for services are not turned away.\u201d The application did not identify the statutory sections under which exemption was sought, but the commissioner reviewed the application as a claim for charitable-use exemption under R.C. 5709.12(B) and 5709.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">{\u00b6 5} DCI is certified by the IRS as a Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity. DCI\u2019s federal tax filings showed an excess of revenues over expenses of $6,306,492 in 2003 and $32,167,517 in 2004. As of October 2006, DCI operated 195 outpatient dialysis clinics in 26 states and devoted a good deal of its net income to promoting kidney research. In addition to the West Chester clinic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>DCI also has Ohio climes in the Walnut Hills, Western Hills, and Mt. Healthy areas in Cincinnati, in Portsmouth, and in East Liverpool. Although some DCI facilities generate net income (as does the company as a whole), the West Chester facility was not one of them: until the August 2008 BTA hearing, the West Chester facility had suffered an average net loss of $250,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 6} Medicare covers the cost of dialysis for persons with ESRD without regard to income. According to testimony at the BTA hearing, Medicare initially pays 80 percent of the cost of services, with 20 percent remaining the patient\u2019s responsibility. Patients who qualify for Medicare but who cannot pay the copayment may also qualify for Medicaid, which would then pay the copayment. Low-income patients who do not qualify for Medicare may qualify for Medicaid benefits. DCI accepts both Medicare and Medicaid patients. Medicare regulations prohibit a clinic from providing services at a lower fee to non-Medicare patients than to Medicare patients. As a result, DCI\u2019s clinics must seek payment from all patients and otherwise follow Medicare and Medicaid requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 7} DCI stated that 62 percent of its patients at the West Chester facility are Medicare patients, and nine percent are covered by Medicaid. For many Medicare and Medicaid patients, if the patient is indigent, DCI writes off the portion that the patient is obligated to pay. DCI stated that it did provide \u201ccharity care\u201d for persons who are ineligible for or are waiting to qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, but it did not quantify such aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 8} DCI\u2019s administrator for the Cincinnati area testified before the BTA that 65 to 75 percent of DCI patients in that area are Medicare patients. At the West Chester facility, 60 to 65 percent on any given day are Medicare patients, and 10 percent are Medicaid-only patients. Approximately 15 percent of DCFs patients in the area are privately insured. Medicare is DCFs primary revenue source.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 9} DCI applied half its excess revenue to support kidney research and half to subsidize its own services \u2014 which included covering unpaid costs of providing care, opening new clinics, and operating a children\u2019s summer camp free of charge to children who suffer from ESRD or who have received kidney transplants. DCFs donations to research at the University of Cincinnati from 2004 to the 2008 hearing exceeded $1.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 10} DCI developed a policy to comply with Medicare regulations regarding care to indigent patients. Medicare prohibits providers from charging favorable rates to non-Medicare patients (so as to prohibit a sliding scale of fees). But Medicare will reimburse a provider for unpaid deductibles or coinsurance under certain circumstances. Patients in financial need are asked to fill out the Financial Analysis Form (\u201cFAF\u201d) within ten days of admission to treatment. Even private-pay patients may submit the form, which allows DCI to ascertain whether to pursue collection of an unpaid bill or write off amounts as uncollectible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>pursuant to Medicare guidelines. At some Cincinnati-area facilities, DCI had patients who had no outside payment source (or who had failed to properly apply for government benefits), but there had never been any such patients at the West Chester facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 11} DCI receives its patients through hospital referrals. A social worker assists patients to assure that all sources of payment are tapped, but if a patient is referred \u201cwith no means to pay,\u201d DCI \u201cdo[es] not turn [him] away.\u201d In response to the question \u201cDo you provide service without regard to a patient\u2019s ability to pay at your facilities?\u201d the answer was \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d DCI\u2019s indigency policy, however, expressly states that the <em>\u201cindigence policy is not a charity or gift to patients. DCI retains all rights to refuse to admit and treat a patient who has no ability to pay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 12} In his final determination, the tax commissioner denied the exemption, stating that neither DCI\u2019s acceptance of reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid nor its write-off of bad debt constituted a charitable act.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 13} On appeal, the BTA determined that DCI\u2019s West Chester clinic did not qualify for exemption under R.C. 5709.12(B) because, \u201c[a]s DCI concedes, it provides no free or charitable service at the subject property.\u201d <em>Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Wilkins </em>(Nov. 24, 2009), BTA No. 2006-V-2389, 2009 WL 4100065, *6. The BTA also concluded that DCI could not qualify under R.C. 5709.121 because DCI was not a \u201ccharitable institution.\u201d Id. The BTA relied heavily on the indigency policy\u2019s statement that no gift of service is intended and that DCI reserves the right to refuse treatment based on inability to pay. Id. at *7. The BTA could discern no distinction between DCI and for-profit dialysis clinics apart from the DCI\u2019s use of its excess revenue. Id. As for DCI\u2019s contributions to kidney research, the BTA held that DCI could not claim charitable status vicariously based on the charitable nature of those to whom it contributed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 14} Finally, the BTA agreed with the commissioner that the record showed no unreimbursed free or charity care at the West Chester clinic. Because DCI did not present a charity-care figure, the BTA attempted to construe one from the record. As a nationwide charity-care figure for all DCI facilities, the BTA used the Medicare \u201cbad-debt charity write-off\u2019 figure for October 2006 through September 2007: that write-off amounted to under $6.7 million, which was 1.27 percent of $526,891,082 in charges generated for that period. Id. at *8. Although the BTA also gave reasons for not regarding the write-off as charitable care, the BTA stated that if the percentage that was written off were viewed as charity care, it would be \u201cinsufficient to meet the charitable service standards required for exemption.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 15} DCI has appealed, and we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 16} This appeal questions the BTA\u2019s interpretation of the charitable-purpose exemption. Under R.C. 5709.12(B), \u201c[r]eal and tangible personal property belonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes shall be exempt from taxation.\u201d Furthermore, under R.C. 5709.121(A), \u201c[r]eal property and tangible personal property belonging to a charitable or educational institution * * * shall be considered as used exclusively for charitable * * * purposes by such institution * * * if it meets\u201d one of the specified requirements under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 17} DCI seeks exemption primarily under R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). \u201cTo fall within the terms of R.C. 5709.121, property must (1) be under the direction or control of a charitable institution * * *, (2) be otherwise made available \u2018for use in furtherance of or incidental to\u2019 the institution\u2019s \u2018charitable * * * purposes,\u2019 and (3) not be made available with a view to profit.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Nature Ctr. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 122, 125, 2 O.O.3d 275, 357 N.E.2d 381, quoting R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). We hold that the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully in determining that DCI does not qualify as a \u201ccharitable institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>A. Property does not qualify for exemption under R.C. 5709.121 simply because it is owned by, and used to further purposes of, an entity that enjoys exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 18} When a BTA decision is appealed, this court looks to see if the decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14. This means that \u201c \u2018[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u2019 \u201d we will affirm. Id., quoting <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. On the other hand, we \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School List. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 19} DCI contends that because \u201cthe provision of nonprofit medical care is charitable,\u201d it should be recognized as a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d for purposes of R.C. 5709.121. Amicus curiae Ohio Hospital Association (\u201cOHA\u201d) further explains DCI\u2019s legal argument. OHA refers to R.C. 5709.12(B) and 5709.121 as \u201ctwo independent property-tax exemptions for charitable property.\u201d According to OHA, R.C. 5709.12(B) \u201cfocuses on the specific use of the property,\u201d while R.C. 5709.121 conditions exemption \u201cnot [on] the uses of the property, but [on] the general activities and purposes of the owner.\u201d OHA argues that R.C. 5709.121 affords an exemption \u201c[s]o long as an institution is charitable or educational,\u201d and to qualify for that exemption, \u201cits property only need be <em>used incidentally </em>to charitable or educational purposes.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>{\u00b6 20} But this interpretation significantly expands the scope of the property-tax exemption for facilities that provide healthcare services. DCI focuses on the \u201chigh bar\u201d set by the IRS in qualifying institutions for tax-exempt status pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, arguing that the federal status by itself \u201cmilitates heavily in favor of finding it to be a \u2018charitable institution.\u2019 \u201d OHA is more explicit: \u201cIf an institution with a charitable or educational purpose qualifies as a Section 501(c)(3) entity (exempt from taxation under Section 501(a)), it likewise should qualify as charitable or educational under R.C. 5709.121(A).\u201d In other words, a Section 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation should also be characterized as a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 21} This expansive construction of R.C. 5709.121 is inconsistent with the legislative purpose behind its enactment and with ordinary principles of statutory construction for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 22} First, R.C. 5709.121 constitutes a refinement of R.C. 5709.12(B). R.C. 5709.121 does not declare any property to be exempt but links certain property uses to R.C. 5709.12(B)\u2019s exclusive-charitable-use exemption. Special treatment under R.C. 5709.121 depends on the owner\u2019s qualifying as a \u201ccharitable or educational\u201d institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 23} Second, R.C. 5709.121 was enacted to address a restriction on the availability of exemption under R.C. 5709.12(B). Historically, the exemption for charitable use had not been permitted when the owner had leased the property to another, even if that lessee was using the property for charitable purposes. <em>First Baptist Church of Milford v. Wilkins, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 496, 2006-Ohio-4966, 854 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Zangerle v. State ex rel. Gallagher </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 139, 145, 165 N.E. 709 (Day, J., concurring) (\u201c \u2018ownership and use for charitable purposes must coincide\u2019 \u201d); <em>Lincoln Mem. Hosp., Inc. v. Warren </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 109, 110, 42 O.O.2d 327, 235 N.E.2d 129 (exemption was unavailable because the use of the property as a hospital was not the owner\u2019s use); <em>Northeast Ohio Psych. Inst. v. Levin, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 292, 2009-Ohio-583, 903 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 11 (under R.C. 5709.12(B), \u201cit is the owner\u2019s use of the property, not a lessee\u2019s use, that determines whether the property should be exempted.\u201d [Emphasis omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 24} Under R.C. 5709.121, when the owner qualifies as a charitable institution, property used exclusively for charitable purposes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is exempt if the property is (i) leased to another charitable institution and used for charitable purposes, R.C. 5709.121(A)(1)(b), or (ii) made available under the control of the owner for use in furtherance of the owner\u2019s charitable purposes, R.C. 5709.121(A)(2). This limited expansion of the charitable-use exemption granted by R.C. 5709.12(B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>constitutes the central purpose behind R.C. 5709.121\u2019s enactment. See <em>First Baptist Church of Milford </em>at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 199, 203, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862 (Stern, J., concurring) (\u201c \u2018the overall purpose of R.C. 5709.121 is to declare that the ownership and use of property need not coincide for that property to be tax exempt\u2019 \u201d). Although R.C. 5709.121 does expand the scope of the charitable-use exemption, this expansion has a narrower purpose than that which DCI and OHA advance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have stated that \u201cR.C. 5709.121 does not itself grant any exemption. It merely sets forth certain situations in which real and personal property belonging to charitable or educational institutions * * * may be considered as used exclusively for charitable * * * purposes.\u201d <em>First Baptist Church of Milford </em>at \u00b6 16; Am.Sub.H.B. No. 817, 133 Ohio Laws, Part III, 2646 (title of the bill enacting R.C. 5709.121 states that its purpose is to <em>\u201cclarify </em>the exemption from taxation of property belonging to a charitable institution.\u201d [Emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 25} Third, DCI\u2019s argument would conflate Ohio\u2019s property-tax exemption with standards under federal law for tax-exempt charities. We have already rejected that contention, stating that \u201ctying charitable use so tightly to Congress\u2019s policy goals is wrong because Congress does not define the scope of charitable use under Ohio law.\u201d <em>NBC-USA Hous., Inc.-Five v. Levin, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 394, 2010-Ohio-1553, 928 N.E.2d 715, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 26} Our case law has predicated entitlement to the charitable-use exemption on services being provided \u201con a nonprofit basis to those in need, <em>without regard to race, creed, or ability to pay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Church of God in N.

Found. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 30, 31 O.O.2d 16, 206 N.E.2d 2, paragraph two of the syllabus. In contrast, federal tax law affords a charitable exemption on a less restrictive basis.

Activities have been deemed charitable if they accord with the standard of charity that we have developed when determining the charitable use of property directly under R.C. 5709.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Northeast Ohio Psych. Inst., </em>a nonprofit entity leased property to another entity that furnished allegedly charitable psychiatric services to the general public. The property\u2019s owner and lessor sought a tax exemption, claiming that it could qualify as a charitable institution under R.C. 5709.121. Although the property owner qualified as a charitable entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, we did not view that status as determinative. Instead, we reviewed the evidence to determine whether the character of the owner\u2019s activities was charitable. We noted that in addition to leasing part of the building in question to the psychiatric-services provider, the owner leased the remainder of the building to other tenants, thereby generating significant revenue. <em>Northeast Ohio Psych. Inst, </em>at \u00b6 8, 9. The owner also furnished psychiatric-staffing services at other locations, which constituted another source of substantial revenue. Id. at \u00b6 15. The exemption was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">(\u00b6 29} Similarly, in <em>OCLC, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 198, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572, we rejected a claim that a nonprofit corporation that furnished services to libraries for a fee that exceeded their cost could qualify as a charitable institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121. We noted that the owner was essentially advancing a claim of vicarious exemption: it sought to exempt its own property because it provided services to libraries, which in turn were charitable institutions. Id. at 200, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572. The owner\u2019s activities, however, \u201cmore closely resemble[d] those of a publisher of library materials or a data base firm specializing in information retrieval.\u201d Id. at 201, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572.

The BTA echoed the commissioner\u2019s position that the provision of free, unreimbursed care constitutes an essential part of a tax-exemption claim for a healthcare-services provider. But to the extent that the BTA thought that DCI had to provide some threshold level of unreimbursed care, we disagree, as will be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 33} Second, the BTA found that DCI could not base its claim on the donation of surplus revenue to kidney research, because such a claim would constitute the type of \u201cvicarious exemption\u201d that we rejected in <em>OCLC, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 198, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572. The BTA is correct. DCI may not establish its own core activity as charitable by pointing to a benefit that it confers upon another entity whose activity is charitable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIt is only the use of property in charitable pursuits that qualifies for tax exemption, not the utilization of receipts or proceeds that does so.\u201d <em>Hubbard Press v. Tracy </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 564, 566, 621 N.E.2d 396; <em>Wehrle Found, v. Evatt </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 467, 26 O.O. 29, 49 N.E.2d 52, paragraph five of the syllabus (\u201cProperty held by a nonprofit corporation for the purpose of ultimate distribution to such selected organizations as are operated for religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes * * * is not exempt from taxation under Section 5353, General Code [the precursor to R.C. 5709.12(B)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 34} Third, the BTA emphasized that DCI\u2019s indigency policy explicitly stated that it was \u201cnot a charity or gift to patients [and that] DCI retains all rights to refuse to admit and treat a patient who has no ability to pay.\u201d This statement contradicts the assertion that DCI is committed to providing services on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>nondiscriminatory basis, which is an essential prerequisite for a healthcare provider to qualify property for exemption. DCI argues that its articles of incorporation set forth its charitable purpose and that other evidence demonstrates that in actuality persons are not turned away for inability to pay. We are not persuaded, however, that this evidence required the BTA to find that DCI satisfied the nondiscrimination requirement, given that DCI\u2019s own policy statement explicitly reserved the right to refuse to treat indigent patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">{\u00b6 35} DCI contends that the legal constraints imposed on it as a Medicare provider excuse it from complying with Ohio\u2019s prerequisites for obtaining a charitable-use exemption. This is unpersuasive. First of all, the Medicare statutes and regulations cited stop short of requiring DCI to adopt the disclaimer of charity set forth in its indigency policy. Second, even if Medicare regulations constrain DCI so that it cannot act as a charity according to Ohio\u2019s definition, it is still barred from obtaining a charitable-use tax exemption. For just as federal law does not <em>establish </em>the elements of Ohio\u2019s tax exemption, federal law <em>cannot excuse </em>an entity\u2019s noncompliance with those elements. The General Assembly, rather than the courts, must determine whether Medicare providers should enjoy a property-tax exemption, and if so, the scope of such an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>D. The operation of the West Chester facility does not qualify as an exclusively charitable use of property under R.C. 5709.12(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 36} In addition to finding that DCI had not proved that it qualified as a charitable institution under R.C. 5709.121, the BTA also made a separate finding that \u201cDCI does not qualify for exemption under R.C. 5709.12(B) as an institution that uses the property exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d <em>Dialysis Clinic, Inc., </em>BTA No. 2006-V-2389, at 12. It is well established that even if it does not qualify as a charitable institution, DCI would be entitled to exemption from tax if it showed that the operations at a particular facility constitute an exclusively charitable use of that particular parcel of real property. See <em>Highland Park Owners, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 405, 644 N.E.2d 284 (although homeowner\u2019s association that owned real property was not a charitable institution, its use of property as a public park did constitute an exclusively charitable use that was entitled to exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 37} Under the circumstances of this case, however, the determination of DCI\u2019s exemption claim under R.C. 5709.12(B) does not significantly differ from the evaluation of the claim under R.C. 5709.121. Nothing about the operation of the clinic in West Chester differs from the core activities of DCI that were reasonably and lawfully found not to qualify DCI as a charitable institution. The West Chester facility itself does not qualify for exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\n<em>E. An institution need not show a particular percentage of care that is unreimbursed if it proves its commitment to providing care on a nondiscriminatory basis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 38} The Tax Commissioner argues that for a property-tax exemption, case law imposes the requirement that \u201ca healthcare provider furnish[] sufficient services to those that lack the financial means to pay for such services,\u201d meaning those who lack sufficient assets or insurance. The record here shows that a person at the West Chester facility who lacks financial means to pay is usually entitled to benefits under Medicare or Medicaid, or both. DCI\u2019s decision to serve these patients to some extent qualifies as the provision of care to persons who otherwise lack the means to afford it.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 39} But the commissioner\u2019s argument goes a step further. When asserting that a provider must furnish services to patients who \u201clack the financial means\u201d to pay for healthcare, the commissioner means that a provider must furnish services to those patients who do not qualify for benefits under Medicare or Medicaid \u2014 or at least those patients for whom benefits have not been obtained. In essence, the commissioner required DCI to show that it provided unreimbursed care \u2014 that is, care financed by DCI itself from funds derived either from charitable donations or operating surpluses. The denial of DCI\u2019s exemption claim rested in part on the fact that no unreimbursed care was quantified at the West Chester facility and that the amount of such care at all of DCI\u2019s Ohio clinics was small. In affirming the commissioner\u2019s determination, the BTA stated that if the 1.27 percent bad-debt write-off that related to Medicare patients at its clinics were viewed as charity care, the percentage would be \u201cinsufficient to meet the charitable service standards required for exemption.\u201d <em>Dialysis Clinic, Inc., </em>BTA No. 2006-V-1389, at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 40} DCI contends that contrary to the pronouncements of the commissioner and the BTA, case law does not require a threshold amount of unreimbursed care. We agree. Because of the existence of Medicare and Medicaid, which reimburse providers for the provision of dialysis services to the indigent, few patients actually receive free care that is wholly unreimbursed. A threshold amount of unreimbursed care is not required, and the commissioner\u2019s contrary assertion is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 41} The commissioner relies on <em>O\u2019Brien v. Physicians\u2019 Hosp. Assn. </em>(1917), 96 Ohio St. 1, 116 N.E. 975; <em>Cleveland Osteopathic Hosp. v. Zangerle </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 222, 41 O.O. 243, 91 N.E.2d 261; <em>Lincoln Mem. Hosp., Inc. v. Warren </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 109, 42 O.O.2d 327, 235 N.E.2d 129; and <em>Bethesda Healthcare, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 420, 2004-Ohio-1749, 806 N.E.2d 142. Comparing the first three cases, the commissioner seeks to extract a principle that some sizeable percentage of care must be unreimbursed. But this theory ignores the reasoning of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>{\u00b6 42} In <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the court affirmed the grant of a property-tax exemption but observed that in accepting private-pay patients, an institution must not take on so many paying patients that it cannot accommodate a \u201cusual and ordinary number of indigent patients applying for admission.\u201d Id., paragraph six of the syllabus. In the age of Medicare and Medicaid, the usual and ordinary indigent patient may have access to government benefits, and the modern healthcare provider is not required to forgo the pursuit of those benefits to qualify for charitable status.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 43} The property-tax exemption granted in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>was not granted to the owner in <em>Cleveland Osteopathic, </em>the court\u2019s primary concern in that case was private profit rather than degree of public service. The hospital had appeared to be a means by which the member physicians secured income and profits. Charges to the patient led to a profit in excess of the physician\u2019s salary, and the \u201c \u2018fixing of [each physician\u2019s] salary [was] merely a device for securing the profits of the institution and not merely compensation for services rendered.\u2019 \u201d 153 Ohio St. at 228, 41 O.O. 243, 91 N.E.2d 261, quoting 2 Restatement of the Law, Trusts (1935) 1167, Section 376, comment b.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 44} Likewise, the commissioner\u2019s reading of <em>Lincoln Mem. Hosp. </em>ignores the reason that this court denied the exemption. In <em>Lincoln, </em>a for-profit corporate owner\u2019s creation of a nonprofit corporation to lease the property was a sham created to pay the for-profit owner\u2019s financial obligations. 13 Ohio St.2d at 110, 42 O.O.2d 327, 235 N.E.2d 129. While the court noted the paucity of nonpaying patients, that was not the dispositive consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 45} Finally, <em>Bethesda </em>is inapplicable. In <em>Bethesda, </em>a nonprofit corporation sought an exemption for the portion of a building that it leased to itself for accounting purposes; the area housed a fitness facility that was open only to dues-paying members and their guests, with minimal access for the public. The exemption was denied, for although a small number of memberships were given away through scholarships, analogous to giving \u201cfree care,\u201d the facility itself was not open to the public at large. Id., 101 Ohio St.3d 420, 2004-Ohio-1749, 806 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 38. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 46} Although the commissioner\u2019s position is incorrect on the issue whether a minimum percentage of unreimbursed care is required for a charitable entity, the record contains sufficient support for the BTA\u2019s ultimate findings. Accordingly, the property-tax exemption for the West Chester facility was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">{\u00b6 47} For the foregoing reasons, the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it upheld the Tax Commissioner\u2019s denial of DCI\u2019s claim for a charitable-use exemption. We therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Brown, C.J., and O\u2019Connor and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b363-5\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-13\">.

That case is inapposite because it did not involve a claim of real-property exemption but rather of sales-and-use-tax exemption under former R.C. 5739.02(B)(12). Akron Golf Charities was an organization whose sole purpose was to raise funds for charity by staging golf tournaments. DCI is not such an institution, with the result that the earlier case does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b363-6\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Apu\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 48} While I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that no minimum percentage of unreimbursed care is required in order to qualify for a charitable-use exemption, I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (\u201cDCI\u201d) is not entitled to the exemption on the ground that it does not provide service in a nondiscriminatory manner because it <em>reserves the right </em>to refuse treatment to indigent patients in its effort to comply with Medicare regulations. The reservation of the right to refuse treatment is not proof that DCI denies services to indigents. To the contrary, the evidence shows that DCI provides services to all patients, irrespective of their ability to pay. Because providing service to indigent patients is a charitable act, in my view, DCI qualifies as a charitable institution and is tax exempt. Moreover, because DCI provides services at the West Chester clinic, the clinic is used exclusively for charitable purposes, and the property is exempt from tax. Accordingly, I assert that the determination by the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) denying DCI a charitable-use tax exemption was unreasonable and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 49} DCI is a nonprofit entity that is tax exempt under Section 501(C)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; it provides dialysis services to patients who suffer from end-stage renal disease, and it allocates half its excess revenue to support kidney research and the other half to subsidize its own services. DCI\u2019s charter<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> explicitly prohibits it from operating for \u201cpecuniary gain or profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">{\u00b6 50} Although many of DCI\u2019s patients are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, some patients remain responsible for 20 percent of the services rendered. However, when a patient is indigent and DCI is unable to collect a copayment or deductible, DCI writes off the portion that the patient is unable to pay as a bad-debt expense, eliminating the patient\u2019s responsibility to pay. In addition, DCI claimed that it would provide care without charge to patients who are ineligible for or are waiting to qualify for Medicare or Medicaid. In its efforts to comply with Medicare regulations that prohibit a clinic from providing services to non-Medicare patients at a fee lower than the one charged to Medicare patients, DCI established a policy reserving the right to refuse treatment to those who cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>pay. An administrator with DCI testified that DCI does not deny services to individuals \u201cwith no means to pay.\u201d The record does show that DCI provides services to indigent patients and adjusts the balance as a \u201cNon-contracted Write-off\u2019 if patients do not have insurance coverage. As DCI staff attorney William Horn testified before the BTA, \u201cif there are not payment sources, then [service] ends up being free to [patients] if they have no sources to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 51} Our standard of review for appeals from the BTA is whether its decisions are \u201c \u2018reasonable and lawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. Of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783. This court \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 52} In this case, DCI sought an Ohio charitable use tax exemption pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B) and 5709.121(A)(2). In <em>Bethesda Healthcare, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 420, 2004-Ohio-1749, 806 N.E.2d 142, \u00b6 27, we quoted approvingly from the concurring opinion of Justice Stern in <em>White Cross Hosp. Assn. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 199, 203, 67 O.O.2d 224, 311 N.E.2d 862, which stated that \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>institution, irrespective of its charitable or noncharitable character, may take advantage of a tax exemption [pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B)] if it is making exclusive charitable use of its property.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) On the other hand, \u201cR.C. 5709.121 does not itself grant any exemption. It merely sets forth certain situations in which real and personal property belonging to charitable or educational institutions * * * may be considered as used exclusively for charitable * * * purposes.\u201d <em>First Baptist Church of Milford v. Wilkins, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 496, 2006-Ohio-4966, 854 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 16. In evaluating an entity\u2019s charitable status, this court examines the charitable activities of the taxpayer; in evaluating a property\u2019s charitable use, this court examines the charitable activities that occur on the property. See <em>OCLC Online Computer Library Ctr., Inc. v. Kinney </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572 (activities of the taxpayer); <em>Highland Park Owners, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 405, 406-407, 644 N.E.2d 284 (activities undertaken at the property).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Church of God in N. Ohio, Inc. v. Levin, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 36, 2009-Ohio-5939, 918 N.E.2d 981, \u00b6 19, we explained that \u201cthe provision of medical or ancillary healthcare services qualifies as charitable if those services are provided on a nonprofit basis to those in need, without regard to race, creed, or ability to pay.\u201d Id., citing <em>Vick v. Cleveland Mem. Med. Found. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 30, 31 O.O.2d 16, 206 N.E.2d 2, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>{\u00b6 54} In denying DCI\u2019s application for a charitable use exemption, the BTA concluded that DCI does not conduct any charitable activity at its West Chester clinic because it \u201ccharges all patients for dialysis services, voluntarily enters contracts with government and private insurers to set charges for the provision of these services, and does not donate any of its services without charge or at a reduced charge.\u201d <em>Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Levin </em>(Nov. 24, 2009), BTA No. 2006-V-2389, at 13. After noting DCI\u2019s reservation of its right not to treat indigent patients, the BTA concluded that DCFs practice of writing off uncollectible debt does not constitute charity, noting that it could find \u201cno evidence of DCI acting as a donor at any time by relinquishing its legal right to payment from patients for services provided.\u201d Id. at 14. According to the BTA, \u201cDCI is not providing its services without an expectation that it will be compensated\u201d by Medicare, Medicaid, or a private insurer and has not shown that it provided a requisite amount of unreimbursed care to be deemed a charitable institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 55} While I agree with the majority that the BTA erroneously determined that a taxpayer must demonstrate a minimum threshold or percentage of unreimbursed care to qualify as a charitable institution, I would further maintain that DCI engages in charitable activities and qualifies as a tax-exempt charitable institution. DCI\u2019s reservation of the right to refuse treatment to indigent patients does not defeat its charitable status. The evidence shows that DCI does not exercise this right but instead treats any patient regardless of the ability to pay and writes off any charges that insurance does not cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 56} In my view, the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals that DCI does not engage in charitable activities because it reserves the right to refuse to treat indigent patients unduly restricts the definition of \u201ccharity\u201d in a manner inconsistent with our previous interpretation of the term. In accordance with our caselaw, DCI is charitable if it operates on a nonprofit basis and does not turn away individuals because of their inability to pay. Contrary to the BTA\u2019s conclusions, the charitable status of a nonprofit entity is not defeated because the entity reserves the right to refuse to treat an indigent individual when the institution treats all individuals regardless of ability to pay and does not collect payment from those who cannot pay. In other words, <em>reserving the right to deny </em>treatment is not the same as <em>denying </em>treatment or <em>collecting </em>payment from indigent individuals. See <em>Taylor v. Meridia Huron Hosp. of Cleveland Clinic Health Sys. </em>(2000), 142 Ohio App.3d 155, 157, 754 N.E.2d 810 (\u201creserving a right is not the same as actually exercising that right\u201d); <em>Barker v. Geotech Servs., Inc., </em>9th Dist. No. 22742, 2006-Ohio-3814, 2006 WL 2060556, \u00b6 8 (same); see generally <em>Gowdy v.

See, e.g., <em>Vick, </em>2 Ohio St.2d 30, 33, 31 O.O.2d 16, 206 N.E.2d 2 (the hospital did not lose its charitable status, because \u201c[n]o one ha[d] ever been refused admittance to the hospital on the basis of race, creed, color or inability to pay\u201d). Further, because the West Chester clinic provides the same services in the same manner as DCI, I believe that the clinic is used \u201cexclusively for charitable purposes\u201d pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 58} Because DCI qualifies as a charitable institution and the West Chester clinic is used exclusively for charitable purposes, it should qualify for a tax exemption pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B) and 5709.121(A). Thus, I maintain that the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully when it denied the request for exemption.
