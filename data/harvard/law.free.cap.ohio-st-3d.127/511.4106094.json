No. 192 (\u201cS.B. 192\u201d) and 2008 Sub.H.B. No. 544 (\u201cH.B. 544\u201d) are constitutional. We conclude that the sections are constitutional and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">{\u00b6 2} In November 1998, the Ohio attorney general entered into a master settlement agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) with the largest tobacco-product manufacturers in the United States that resolved litigation to recover health-care expenses incurred by the states as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. Pursuant to the MSA, Ohio was to receive $10.1 billion in payments through 2025; there was no restriction on how the money could be spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">{\u00b6 3} In 2000, the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.S.B. No. 192, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 10767, creating R.C. Chapter 183. The new law distributed proceeds from the MSA to eight different funds, including $235 million to the newly created Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Trust Fund. Money from the trust fund was to be appropriated to an endowment fund, which was to \u201cbe in the custody of the treasurer of state but * * * not be a part of the state treasury.\u201d Former R.C. 183.08, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10785. The endowment fund was to fund programs and research related to tobacco-use prevention and cessation. Former R.C. 183.07, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10784. Former R.C. 183.08 directed that a newly created Tobacco Use Prevention and Control Foundation (\u201cfoundation\u201d) would serve as trustee of the endowment fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On April 2, 2008, the governor and legislative leaders announced a bipartisan agreement to spend state funds to stimulate the economy. The agreement called for reallocating approximately $230 million then in the endowment fund to the stimulus package. On April 8, 2008, the General Assembly passed S.B. No. 192, which liquidated the endowment fund. On the same day, the executive director of the foundation, pursuant to a motion passed by the board of the foundation, executed a contract with American Legacy Foundation (\u201cALF\u201d) to transfer $190 million from the endowment fund to ALF. The following day, the foundation filed a complaint against the treasurer seeking to enjoin the enforcement of S.B. 192 and asking that the statute be declared unenforceable. The board then rescinded its resolution authorizing the $190 million transfer to ALF. ALF moved to intervene as a plaintiff in the lawsuit brought by the foundation and filed a complaint requesting a declaration that H.B. 192 be declared unconstitutional and an injunction to stop the state treasurer from transferring the money in the endowment fund to the jobs fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">{\u00b6 5} On May 6, 2008, the General Assembly enacted H.B. 544, which abolished the foundation and gave the Ohio Department of Health (\u201cODH\u201d) responsibility for any residual matters, including legal obligations. Section 4 of H.B. 544 directed the state treasurer to liquidate the endowment fund, deposit the lesser of $40 million or 14.8 percent of the proceeds into the state treasury to the credit of a tobacco-use-prevention fund, and deposit the remaining proceeds from the liquidation (approximately $190 million) into the state treasury to the credit of a jobs fund. On May 9, 2008, ALF amended its complaint to contest the constitutionality of H.B. 544 as well as S.B. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 6} On May 27, 2008, Robert G. Miller Jr. and David W. Weinmann, former smokers who had participated in the foundation\u2019s cessation programs, filed a complaint for declaratory relief, claiming that the enactment of R.C. Chapter 183 and the transfer of money into the endowment fund had created a trust that the General Assembly did not have the power to change. Miller and Weinmann claimed that they were beneficiaries of the trust because they were participants in programs funded by the foundation, and they sought a judgment declaring that (1) H.B. 544 is unconstitutional under the Contract Clauses of Section 10, Article I of the Constitution of the United States and Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and (2) H.B. 544 illegally attempts to appropriate nontreasury funds in breach of an irrevocable trust. Their action was consolidated with ALF\u2019s lawsuit in May 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 7} On August 11, 2009, the trial court entered judgment against ALF, finding that the contract between it and the foundation was invalid. The court also entered final judgment for Miller and Weinmann on their claims, finding that the endowment fund was an irrevocable trust and that the portions of H.B. 544 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>that transferred money from the endowment fund violated the Retroactivity Clause of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and the Contract Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Accordingly, the trial court permanently enjoined the state of Ohio, the treasurer, the attorney general, and ODH (\u201cappellees\u201d) from enforcing any provision of H.B. 544 and S.B. 192 that related to the endowment fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, the court of appeals held that the endowment fund was not an irrevocable charitable trust and that appellees had no vested rights that could be violated. <em>Tobacco Use Prevention &amp; Control Found. Bd. of Trustees v. Boyce, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 707, 2009-Ohio-6993, 925 N.E.2d 641, \u00b6 41-46. The court reasoned that the appellants offered no authority supporting the proposition that custodial funds, once created, cannot be abolished or transferred by the General Assembly. Id. at \u00b6 34 (a custodial account is an account that is in the custody of the treasurer of the state but that is not part of the state treasury. R.C. 113.05(B). For an example, see former R.C. 183.08(A)). The court also affirmed the decision of the trial court that the contract between ALP and the foundation was invalid, stating that the resolution approving the contract had been improperly discussed only in executive session, in violation of R.C. 121.22, Ohio\u2019s Open Meetings Act, and thus the executive director had no authority to enter into the contract with ALF. Id. at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted the discretionary appeal of Miller, Weinmann, and ALF (\u201cappellants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 10} The General Assembly has plenary power to enact legislation; it is limited only by the Ohio Constitution and the Constitution of the United States. Section 1, Article II, Ohio Constitution. See <em>Williams v. Scudder </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 305, 307, 131 N.E. 481. \u201c[Bjefore any legislative power, as expressed in a statute, can be held invalid, it must appear that such power is clearly denied by some constitutional provision.\u201d Id. See <em>Lehman v. McBride </em>(1863), 15 Ohio St. 573, 592 (when the power of the General Assembly to enact a law is questioned, the proper inquiry is whether the law is clearly prohibited by the Constitution). Our inquiry, then, is whether the portions of H.B. 544 and S.B. 192 liquidating the endowment fund and placing the money in the jobs fund are clearly prohibited by the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 11} The General Assembly\u2019s legislative power enables it to \u201cpass any law unless it is specifically prohibited by the state or federal Constitutions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jackman v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 159, 162, 38 O.O.2d 404, 224 N.E.2d 906. See <em>State ex rel. Poe v. Jones </em>(1894), 51 Ohio St. 492, 504, 37 N.E. 945 (\u201cwhatever limitation is placed upon the exercise of that plenary grant of [legislative] power must be found in a clear prohibition by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>constitution\u201d). No constitutional amendment was adopted in Ohio restricting the use of the tobacco settlement money. In the absence of a constitutional provision, the General Assembly had the power to change the use of the settlement money by enacting H.B. 544 and S.B. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>The Retroactivity Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 12} Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution states that \u201c[t]he general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws.\u201d In <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E.2d 489, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court stated, \u201cThe issue of whether a statute may constitutionally be applied retrospectively does not arise unless there has been a prior determination that the General Assembly specified that the statute so apply.\u201d See <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 285, 2006-Ohio-2419, 847 N.E.2d 414, at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Bielat v. Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 350, 353, 721 N.E.2d 28 (\u201cTo determine whether a law is unconstitutionally retroactive, we must first \u2018determine whether the General Assembly expressly intended the statute to apply retroactively\u2019 \u201d). Appellants argue that Section 4 of H.B. 544 clearly indicates that the act is retrospective in its application. However, the language of Section 4 does not indicate that the General Assembly expressly intended the act to apply retroactively. Instead, the language demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intention that the act be applied prospectively: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, on the effective date of this section, the Treasurer of State shall liquidate the Tobacco Use Prevention and Control Foundation Endowment Fund created by section 183.08 of the Revised Code in a prudent manner. The Treasurer of State shall deposit into the state treasury to the credit of the Tobacco Use Prevention Fund (Fund 5BX0), which is created in section 3701.841 of the Revised Code, the lesser of $40 million or 14.8 per cent of the proceeds from liquidation. The Treasurer of State shall deposit the remaining proceeds from liquidation into the state treasury to the credit of the Jobs Fund (Fund 5Z30), which is hereby created.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 13} On its face, the statute applies only from the date of its enactment, not to acts, events, or cases that predate its enactment. <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 105, 522 N.E.2d 489. In <em>E. Liverpool v. Columbiana Cty. Budget Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-3759, 870 N.E.2d 705, \u00b6 31, we stated that \u201cwhen the application of a statute to the case before us involves only a prospective operation, we will not entertain a retroactivity claim under Section 28, Article II. <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 311, 314, 720 N.E.2d 521. That doctrine bars East Liverpool\u2019s retroactivity claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 14} The doctrine bars appellants\u2019 claim in this case. We have also stated that the \u201cretroactivity clause nullifies those new laws that \u2018reach back and create new burdens, new duties, new obligations, or new liabilities not existing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>time [the statute becomes effective].\u2019 <em>Miller v. Hixson </em>(1901), 64 Ohio St. 39, 51, 59 N.E. 749, 752.\u201d <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 352-353, 721 N.E.2d 28. In <em>Van Fossen, </em>this court stated that the constitutional limitation against retroactive laws \u201c \u00a3include[s] a prohibition against laws which commenced on the date of enactment and which operated in futuro, but which, in doing so, divested rights, particularly property rights, which had been vested anterior to the time of enactment of the laws.\u2019 \u201d 36 Ohio St.3d at 105, 522 N.E.2d 489, quoting Smead, The Rule Against Retroactive Legislation: A Basic Principle of Jurisprudence (1936), 20 Minn.L.Rev. 775, 781-782. In <em>E. Liverpool, </em>after stating that the law operated prospectively, this court addressed East Liverpool\u2019s contention \u201cthat the statute \u2018permitted the retrospective extinguishment of East Liverpool\u2019s * * * preexisting legal right under former R.C. 5747.53 and 5747.63.\u2019 \u201d 114 Ohio St.3d 133, 2007-Ohio-3759, 870 N.E.2d 705, at \u00b6 33. Accordingly, we now address appellants\u2019 claim that H.B. 544 extinguished their preexisting property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">\n<em>Does H.B. 544 Affect Preexisting Property Rights?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 15} Appellants first argue that the funds held by the foundation do not belong to the state, citing former R.C. 183.08(A), which stated that the \u201cendowment fund * * * shall be in the custody of the treasurer of state but shall not be a part of the state treasury.\u201d According to appellants, the creation of a custodial account that was not part of the state treasury indicated that the General Assembly intended to create a trust setting the funds permanently outside the control of future legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 16} Although the General Assembly\u2019s plenary legislative power is expansive, it is not all-inclusive. It does not include the ability to bind future General Assemblies. \u201cNo general assembly can guarantee the continuity of its legislation or tie the hands of its successors.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pub. Institutional Bldg. Auth. v. Griffith </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 604, 619, 14 O.O 533, 22 N.E.2d 200. In <em>Griffith, </em>this court relied on <em>State ex rel. Fletcher v. Executive Council of the State of Iowa </em>(1929), 207 Iowa 923, 223 N.W. 737, 740, in which the Supreme Court of Iowa stated that \u201cno General Assembly has power to render its enactment irrevocable and unrepealable by a future General Assembly. No General Assembly can guarantee the span of life of its legislation beyond the period of its biennium. The power and responsibility of legislation is always upon the existing General Assembly. One General Assembly may not lay its mandate upon a future one. Only the Constitution can do that. * * * The power of a subsequent General Assembly either to acquiesce or to repeal is always existent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 17} In Section 17 of S.B. 192, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10802, the General Assembly acknowledged \u201cthe right of each General Assembly to evaluate independently the budgetary priorities of the state.\u201d Furthermore, the creation of custodial accounts is a rather routine business. R.C. 113.05(B). State appropria<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tions that are not spent by an agency must be returned to the funds from which the appropriations were made at the end of the appropriation period. R.C. 131.33. The General Assembly' uses custodial accounts to operate outside the strictures of R.C. 131.33. We consider the creation of a custodial account evidence that the General Assembly did not expect all the funds appropriated to the foundation to be spent within the biennium and that it did not want the unexpended funds to revert pursuant to R.C. 131.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">{\u00b6 18} Custodial accounts have been used in a variety of circumstances without violating the Constitution or removing the funds from the reach of the General Assembly. In <em>Griffith, </em>we stated that although payments made by patients in state-run hospitals might be used by the Department of Public Welfare to run the hospitals it operated, those payments were \u201cpublic funds, at all times subject to legislative control.\u201d 135 Ohio St. at 619, 14 O.O. 533, 22 N.E.2d 200. Even if the payments were earmarked by the Department of Public Welfare to pay off bonds issued to provide money for the repair or construction of state welfare institutions, the General Assembly could default on the bonds and \u201cdivert these funds to other purposes.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>State ex rel. Hoffman Candy &amp; Ice Cream Co. v. Defenbacher </em>(1951), 154 Ohio St. 429, 43 O.O. 351, 96 N.E.2d 295, we examined the rotary fund of the Department of Liquor Control, the funds of which were not in the state treasury but were in the custody of the state treasurer. We noted that pursuant to statute, funds in excess of those necessary for operating the department were to \u201cbe paid into the general revenue fund.\u201d Id. at 431. Appellants also argue that once the General Assembly appropriated the funds to the foundation fund, the funds were spent and thus were beyond the reach of subsequent legislation. This argument makes sense only if the foundation is a trust, which we conclude it is not. It is axiomatic than an appropriation to a state agency is not an expenditure; thus appropriation of money to the foundation does not place the money beyond the reach of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 20} Appellants also argue that by allowing the money in the endowment fund to be invested in corporate stocks, the General Assembly intended that the fund not be considered state money because the Constitution prohibits the investment of state funds in corporate stocks. Although this argument is plausible, the better explanation is that the General Assembly allowed unexpended funds to be invested in stocks because it knew that expenditures in the biennium would be significantly less than the appropriation. Generally, state funds must be spent within the biennium in which they are appropriated, and thus cannot be invested in corporate stocks, which are long-term investments. Investing the money in the endowment fund in corporate stocks allows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>foundation to augment the fund. Allowing the endowment fund to be invested in stocks is not evidence of the creation of a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">{\u00b6 21} Several states have passed constitutional amendments preventing the reallocation of funds that were allocated from the proceeds of the MSA to tobacco-use cessation and prevention. Section 27, Article X, Florida Constitution; Section 18, Article VII, Idaho Constitution; Section 10.8, Article VII, Louisiana Constitution; Section 4, Article XII, Montana Constitution; Section 40, Article X, Oklahoma Constitution. The Ohio Constitution, however, has not been amended to prevent the reallocation of tobacco-settlement proceeds, although it has been amended to ensure that lottery revenue is used solely for educational purposes, Section 6, Article XV, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 22} Appellants have compared the foundation with various state pension plans. They argue that the foundation and the pension plans are similar, but they are not. The endowment fund is not intended for the benefit of named beneficiaries; the pension plans allocate funds for the benefit of named beneficiaries. The retirement boards were given authority to establish separate legal entities to hold funds, see, e.g., R.C. 145.11, the foundation was not. We conclude that the foundation and the various pension plans are not equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 23} There is a long-standing principle in American law that \u201c[n]o person has a vested interest in any rule of law, entitling him to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit.\u201d <em>New York Cent RR. Co. v. White </em>(1917), 243 U.S. 188, 198, 37 S.Ct. 247, 61 L.Ed. 667. See Fuller, The Morality of Law (1964) 60 (if reliance on existing law made a person \u201csecure against any change in legal rules, the whole body of our law would be ossified forever\u201d). No irrevocable trust was created; indeed, no trust was created. Instead, we conclude that a state agency was created in 2000 and was abolished in 2008. We conclude that the law enacted in 2000 did not create a right that was terminated by H.B. 544 and, therefore, that H.B. 544 is not an unconstitutionally retroactive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\n<em>Contract Clauses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 24} Section 10, Article I, United States Constitution states, \u201cNo State shall * * * pass any * * * Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts * * *.\u201d Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution states, \u201cThe general assembly shall have no power to pass * * * laws impairing the obligation of contracts * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b625} Appellants make two contract-clause arguments. The first is that because the foundation is a trust, reallocating the funds appropriated to the endowment fund is a violation of a trust contract. We reject this argument based on our conclusion that the foundation is not a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 26} The second argument addresses the attempt by the foundation to place funds beyond the reach of the General Assembly by transferring approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>$190 million to ALF. Appellants contend that the foundation and ALF entered into a contract for the transfer of funds and therefore that H.B. 544 violates that contract by not allowing the transfer called for by the contract. For the following reasons, we conclude that there is no violation of the state and federal contract clauses because no contract was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 121.22(A) states, \u201cThis section shall be liberally construed to require public officials to take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business only in open meetings unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 121.22(H) states, \u201cA resolution, rule, or formal action of any kind is invalid unless adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule, or formal action adopted in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose specifically authorized in division (G) or (J) of this section and conducted at an executive session held in compliance with this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 29} The trial court and the court of appeals concluded that the board had violated R.C. 121.22 because the resolution to contract with ALF resulted from nonpublic deliberations. <em>Tobacco Use Prevention &amp; Control Found., </em>185 Ohio App.3d 707, 2009-Ohio-6993, 925 N.E.2d 641, \u00b6 77. Appellants do not dispute this conclusion; instead, they contend that the board\u2019s attempts to comply with R.C. 121.22 were sabotaged by the attorney general\u2019s office. They argue that the board would have been exempt pursuant to R.C. 121.229(G)(3) if the attorney general had not prevented the board\u2019s attorney from being present. Based on our review of the record, we conclude, as did the trial court and the court of appeals, that the board was not set up to violate the Open Meetings Act. Even if it had been, the board had at least one unassailable option available: it could have discussed all relevant matters openly. It did not. Accordingly, we agree with the court of appeals that \u201cthe board violated R.C. 121.22 by deliberating in executive session upon matters that it was required to discuss in open session.\u201d <em>Tobacco Use Prevention &amp; Control Found., </em>185 Ohio App.3d 707, 2009-Ohio-6993, 925 N.E.2d 641, \u00b6 74. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, which held that no contract was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Other Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 30} The question whether it is wise to enact legislation is not the same question as whether the legislation is constitutional. <em>Bd. of Health v. Greenville </em>(1912), 86 Ohio St. 1, 20, 98 N.E. 1019. Several amici curiae filed briefs in this case. Some of them argued that the funds at issue would be better used for the original intended purpose (tobacco cessation) than the current intended purpose (jobs stimulus), and several argued the converse. None of those arguments concerns a court of law. The General Assembly has plenary legislative power. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>In the exercise of that power, the General Assembly evaluated Ohio\u2019s budget priorities and enacted S.B. 192 and H.B. 544. It is not for us to judge the wisdom of the General Assembly but to determine whether the exercise of its power comports with or violates the Ohio Constitution. We conclude that S.B. 192 and H.B. 544 do not violate the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 31} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-8\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ah_H\">Gallagher and Harsha, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b655-9\">Sean C.

No. 544 and 2008 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 192. I write separately to more closely address the issues surrounding the actions of the General Assembly in creating the Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Trust Fund and whether such actions created a trust. In my view, the General Assembly arguably intended to create a trust and to irrevocably appropriate funds to that trust for antitobacco efforts. Though the purpose was noble, the efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">{\u00b6 33} Under the statutory scheme that was enacted, the Tobacco Use Prevention and Control Foundation was appointed as trustee of the endowment fund. Former R.C. 183.08, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 10767, 10785. The general management of the foundation was vested in a board of trustees. Former R.C. 183.04, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10785. The foundation was to establish and carry out a plan to reduce tobacco use by Ohioans. Former R.C. 183.07, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10784. Emphasis was to be given to Ohio\u2019s youth and groups disproportionately affected by the use of tobacco. Former R.C. 183.07, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10784. The endowment fund was in the custody of the treasurer of state, but it was set aside from the state treasury. Former R.C. 183.08(A), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10785. The foundation was to be self-sustaining. Former R.C. 183.08(B), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10786. However, even if the General Assembly had intended to permanently commit the funds to antitobacco efforts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the statutory scheme fell short of placing the funds beyond the reach of future legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 34} The endowment fund was created solely from state funds that were set aside to be administered for the purpose of reducing tobacco use by Ohioans, with an emphasis on certain populations. The funds were public and were to be used for a specified public purpose for the benefit of all Ohioans. Although appellants may have directly benefited from the programs that were created, the enabling statutes did not specify any person or entity as the beneficiary of the funds or create any private property interest. \u201cThis key element is lacking in many state funds that set aside money for a specific purpose and are \u2018trust funds\u2019 in name only. * * * The existence of named beneficiaries is what transforms the Fund from money set aside for a purpose into a formal trust.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Med. Soc., Inc. v. Morgan, </em>2010-WI-94, 787 N.W.2d 22, \u00b6 69-70. The funds were state funds, and because no protected third-party property interests were created, they were subject to the legislature\u2019s plenary power over state money. See <em>Arizona Farm Bur. Fedn. v. Brewer </em>(Nov. 12, 2010), Ariz.App. No. 1 09-0756, 2010 WL 4542393 at *7. Further, although the funds were placed outside the state treasury and were dedicated to a particular use, the nature of the funds as state money was not altered, and the funds were not removed from legislative control. See <em>A.B.A.T.E. of Illinois, Inc. v. Giannoulias </em>(2010), 401 Ill.App.3d 326, 341 Ill.Dec. 109, 929 N.E.2d 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 35} I believe that this is not a case where the General Assembly sought to encumber funds and bind future legislatures. Rather, the General Assembly failed to establish a proper trust to place the funds beyond the reach of subsequent legislation. Had a proper trust been created, no two-year encumbrance problem would exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 36} There is no doubt that many Ohioans stood to benefit from the antitobacco programs that were funded by the endowment fund. Though the result may seem unfair to some, the acts of the legislature were permissible and are not constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b656-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b656-9\">Harsha, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9pX\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">{\u00b6 37} Once the legislature initially placed the proceeds from the master settlement agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) between the state and the tobacco-product manufacturers into the state treasury, Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution prohibited the legislature from subsequently creating an irrevocable public trust with those funds. As a result, the unexpended money in the endowment fund was subject to reappropriation by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution states: \u201cNo money shall be drawn from the treasury, except in pursuance of a specific appropriation, made by law; and no appropriation shall be made for a longer period than two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 39} Under former R.C. 183.02, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 10767, 10777, the legislature directed that \u201c[a]ll payments received by the state pursuant to the tobacco master settlement agreement shall be deposited into the state treasury to the credit of the tobacco master settlement agreement fund, which is hereby created.\u201d The General Assembly provided that once the money was deposited into the MSA fund, the money was to be shifted into eight different funds, including the Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Trust Fund, see former R.C. 183.02(A) through (H), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10778-10789, which was \u201ccreated in the state treasury,\u201d former R.C. 183.03, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10782.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 40} The legislature then appropriated money from this fund into an endowment fund. See former R.C. 183.08(A), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10785. Under former R.C. 183.08(A), the endowment fund was to \u201cbe in the custody of the treasurer of state but shall not be a part of the state treasury.\u201d Based on this language, the majority opinion views the endowment fund as a \u201ccustodial fund\u201d removed from the biennial appropriation cycle, i.e., unexpended money in the endowment fund that did not automatically revert to the treasury after two years. However, this interpretation of former R.C. 183.08 overlooks the plain language of Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>State ex rel. Rothbacher v. Herbert </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 167, 27 O.O.2d 48, 198 N.E.2d 463, Katharina Rothbacher owned a savings deposit in a savings and loan company. The company dissolved, and all unclaimed deposits, including Rothbacher\u2019s deposit, were placed in a \u201cregular account,\u201d i.e., an account of funds held in trust by the state treasurer, subject to the order of the superintendent of building and loan associations. Id. at 167. Subsequently, the state auditor, pursuant to statute, had the funds transferred into the General Revenue Fund. Id. Rothbacher then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the state treasurer to return her money. Id. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 42} This court denied the writ, holding that Rothbacher\u2019s funds were initially held in the regular account, subject to the order of the superintendent, and required no prior appropriation by the General Assembly. Id. at 169. But once the funds were transferred and became part of the General Revenue Fund, they were no longer subject to the order of the superintendent and \u201ccould be expended only as provided by law.\u201d Id. Therefore, the funds could not be withdrawn unless the legislature made an appropriation under Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Id. at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">{\u00b6 43} In this case, the MSA funds were initially deposited into the state treasury under former R.C. 183.02, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, at 10777. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the legislature could not withdraw them except in accordance with Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, i.e., in pursuit of a specific appropriation, not to exceed two years. After the MSA funds had been deposited into the general fund, the legislature could not circumvent the constitutional limitation by appropriating them into a custodial account. <em>State ex rel. Rothbacher, </em>176 Ohio St. at 169-170, 27 O.O.2d 48, 198 N.E.2d 463. In other words, the General Assembly could not create a custodial account to indirectly do what Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution prohibits it from doing directly. See <em>Taylor v. Ross Cty. Commrs. </em>(1872), 23 Ohio St. 22, 34.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACp_\">Zeiger, Tigges <em>&amp; </em>Little, L.L.P., John W. Zeiger, and Stuart G. Parsed, for appellants Robert G. Miller Jr., David W. Weinmann, and American Legacy Foundation.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ami\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, Alexandra T. Schimmer, Chief Deputy Solicitor General, and Richard N. Coglianese, Michael J. Schuler, Damian Sikora, Aaron D. Epstein, and Katherine J. Bockbrader, Assistant Attorneys General, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>appellees the state of Ohio, Attorney General Richard Cordray, Treasurer Kevin L. Boyce, and the Ohio Department of Health and its director, Alvin D. Jackson.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Therefore, despite the fact that former R.C. 183.08(A) directed that the endowment fund was to \u201cbe in the custody of the treasurer of state but shall not be a part of the state treasury,\u201d any unexpended funds the legislature appropriated into the endowment fund should have reverted to the treasury after two years. And in light of Section 22, Article II of the Constitution, once funds are deposited into the state treasury, they cannot be used to create an irrevocable public trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 45} If the General Assembly intended to free the settlement funds from the dictates of Section 22, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, it had to place the MSA funds directly into a custodial account under R.C. 113.05(B), or the treasurer of state\u2019s contingent fund, created in R.C. 113.10, instead of first depositing the funds into the state treasury. Clearly the General Assembly knew how to create a custodial account \u2014 it used specific language to do so in former R.C. 183.08. See, e.g., R.C. 148.02, 149.305, and 3334.11. Just as clearly, the language in former R.C. 183.02 merely directing that all payments received under the MSA be \u201cdeposited into the state treasury to the credit of\u2019 a specific fund does not create a custodial account.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 46} Because the funds appropriated to the endowment fund were not placed in an irrevocable public trust, the General Assembly was free to reappropriate the money to any fund it desired. Far from being unconstitutional, 2008 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 192 and 2008 Sub.H.B. No. 544 are consistent with the constitutional mandate of Section 22, Article II of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 47} I agree with the analysis of the majority opinion on the other constitutional issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYo1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Mac Murray, Petersen <em>&amp; </em>Shuster and Helen Mac Murray, urging reversal for amici curiae former Attorney General Betty D.
