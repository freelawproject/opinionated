Cydrus, and to issue a new order finding her entitled to benefits, or in the alternative, to compel appellees to issue a new order adequately explaining the reasons for the termination of benefits. Because the retirement board did not abuse its discretion in terminating Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits, we affirm the judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 2} Patricia D. Cydrus was employed as an executive secretary by the Ohio Department of Youth Services. While employed with the department, Cydrus was a contributing member of appellee Ohio Public Employees Retirement System. In 1999, Cydrus was involved in an automobile accident and later experienced chronic headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 3} A December 2000 MRI of Cydrus\u2019s brain revealed a \u201cChiari I Malformation.\u201d \u201cArnold Chiari Malformation Type I\u201d is a \u201ccongenital abnormality * * * characterized by the underdevelopment of the bone at the base of the skull (posterior cranial fossa) and overcrowding of the normally developed hindbrain.\u201d <em>Lawson v. United States </em>(D.Md.2006), 454 F.Supp.2d 373, 378, citing Grossman &amp; Yousem, Neuroradiology: The Requisites (2003) 436. According to Cydrus\u2019s treating physician at that time, Lawrence P. Frick, M.D., this condition \u201callows a portion of the brain to herniate through the skull base which then applies pressure on that part of the brain as well as obstructs the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid.\u201d In January 2002, Cydrus underwent surgery to correct the problem, but she continued to experience severe headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 4} Almost a year later, Cydrus applied for disability-retirement benefits from the public employees retirement system. She stated that she was incapacitated from her duties as an executive secretary because of severe muscle spasms, headaches, and continuous symptoms, which required medications that did not help her and which resulted in daily pain, poor balance, and sensitivity to light. Cydrus supported her application with Dr. Frick\u2019s report, which stated that \u201cher condition is permanently disabling in that she has not responded to all therapy so far and it has been almost one year since her surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 5} The retirement board initially denied Cydrus\u2019s application based in part on an independent medical examination. On appeal and following a second examination, the board approved the application conditioned upon her reexamination in a year. In following years, after annual independent medical examinations and a record review, the retirement board approved the continuation of disability-retirement benefits conditioned upon Cydrus\u2019s annual reexamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>{\u00b6 6} In 2008, the retirement board ordered Cydrns to be examined by a psychiatrist and a neurologist to determine whether she remained permanently disabled. The psychiatrist, Richard H. Clary, M.D., examined her and concluded that \u201cher depression alone is not work prohibitive and does not cause long term disability.\u201d The neurologist, Gerald S. Steiman, M.D., examined her and observed that she had \u201ctenderness throughout the paraspinal, lateral neck and trapezius muscles but no evidence of muscle guarding\u201d and \u201cno evidence of a painful tender or trigger point in the occipital, low cervical, trapezius, or supraspinatus regions.\u201d Based on his examination and review of her medical records and history, Dr. Steiman concluded that Cydrus is not permanently disabled from the performance of her position as a public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 7} James R. Moore, M.D., reviewed the results of the examinations and recommended that the retirement board terminate Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits based on \u201cinsufficient objective evidence of permanent disability due to chronic daily headache.\u201d On November 13, 2008, the retirement board accepted the medical advisor\u2019s recommendation and terminated Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits. It concluded that \u201c[biased upon all the medical information and recommendations,\u201d Cydrus was \u201cno longer considered to be permanently disabled from the performance of duty as Executive Secretary,\u201d because \u201cthere is insufficient objective evidence of permanent disability due to chronic daily headache.\u201d The retirement board notified Cydrus by letter that she could appeal the board\u2019s determination by filing a written notice of intent to provide additional objective medical evidence within 30 days and submitting that evidence within 45 days from her written notice. See also Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 2\u201423(B)(3) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 8} Cydrus gave written notice of her intent to appeal the retirement board\u2019s decision terminating her disability-retirement benefits on December 3, 2008. Within 45 days, her primary-care physician, Jennifer E. Sylvester, M.D., submitted her report concluding that Cydrus \u201cis considered totally disabled due to her headaches and the associated symptoms related to her treatment measures for these headaches.\u201d Dr. Sylvester noted that \u201c[i]t has been shown on imaging studies that she still has a protrusion of the cerebellar tonsil that was initially documented at 9.7-mm, now has progressed to 14-mm through the foramen magnum. She was seen by a new neurosurgeon, Dr. Bonasso, who at this time, feels that she is stable, but could progress in the future.\u201d The imaging report cited by Dr. Sylvester is included in the board\u2019s files, but does not bear a time-stamp showing when the board received it and instead includes a facsimile notation that it was received by the board on March 9, 2009, after the deadline for submitting additional evidence had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 9} On January 20, 2009, Maurice C. Mast, M.D., a medical advisor for the board, recommended that the retirement board terminate Cydrus\u2019s disability-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>retirement benefits. Dr. Mast noted in his recommendation that he had \u201creviewed the results of the recent examination(s) performed on\u201d Cydrus, and that \u201c[biased on the findings presented there is insufficient objective evidence of permanent disability due to [n]o additional new information.\u201d On that same day, the retirement board upheld its previous decision to discontinue Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits. The board found that there was insufficient objective evidence of permanent disability and that Cydrus had provided no new information. The board stated that its decision was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 10} In June 2009, Cydrus filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement board and the retirement system to vacate the order terminating her disability-retirement benefits and to issue a new order finding her entitled to these benefits. In the alternative, Cydrus requested a writ of mandamus directing that the retirement board and the retirement system issue a new order adequately explaining its reasons for the decision. After appellees filed an answer and the parties submitted a copy of the administrative record and their briefs, the court of appeals magistrate issued a decision recommending that the court deny the writ of mandamus. Cydrus submitted objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On March 23, 2010, the court of appeals overruled her objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, and denied the writ. <em>State ex rel. Cydrus v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>Franklin App. No. 09AP-595, 2010-Ohio-1143, 2010 WL 1060624.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 11} This cause is now before us on Cydrus\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">A. <em>Mandamus </em>\u2014 General <em>Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 12} Cydrus requests extraordinary relief in mandamus, challenging the retirement board decision terminating her disability-retirement benefits. \u201c[MJandamus is an appropriate remedy where no statutory right of appeal is available to correct an abuse of discretion by an administrative body.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14. The determination of whether a retirement-system member is entitled to the continued receipt of disability-retirement benefits is within the exclusive authority of the retirement board, R.C. 145.362, and the board\u2019s denial of an appeal from the termination of these benefits is final and not subject to appeal. See Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 2\u201423(C)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 13} Because there is no right to appeal the retirement board\u2019s decision terminating disability-retirement benefits, mandamus is an appropriate remedy. <em>State ex rel. Pontillo v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys. Bd., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 500, 2003-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Ohio-2120, 787 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 23; <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 324, 2009-Ohio-591, 904 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">B. <em>Explanations of Terminations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 14} Cydrus first addresses her request for a writ of mandamus to compel the retirement board to issue a new decision explaining why it had terminated her disability-retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIt is axiomatic that in mandamus proceedings, the creation of the legal duty that a relator seeks to enforce is the distinct function of the legislative branch of government, and courts are not authorized to create the legal duty enforceable in mandamus.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>Pipoly, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 18. There is no statute imposing a duty on the retirement board to explain its decision terminating disability-retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 16} In addition, although former Ohio Adm.Code 145-11-02 specified that the retirement board must state \u201cits basis of denial\u201d of disability-retirement benefits, that administrative rule was repealed on January 1, 2003, and the new version of the rule has no such requirement. Ohio Adm.Code 145-2-23. See <em>Hamby v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>Franklin App. No. 08AP-298, 2008-Ohio-5068, 2008 WL 4416677, \u00b6 17; 2002-2003 Ohio Monthly Record 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, the retirement board had no duty under statute or administrative rule to specify the evidence it relied upon or to explain its reasons for terminating Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Marchiano v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 139, 2009-Ohio-307, 902 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 18} Nevertheless, Cydrus argues that the retirement board\u2019s duty to specify the evidence it relied upon and to explain its reasons for its decision arises from constitutional considerations of separation of powers and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 19} The retirement system and retirement board\u2019s claim that Cydrus failed to raise her separation-of-powers argument in the court of appeals is incorrect. She raised her separation-of-powers argument in her objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">{\u00b6 20} Appellees next argue that because both constitutional claims were not raised in any complaint or amended complaint and they did not consent to their consideration, Cydrus waived both claims. Although we \u201cneed not address\u201d the merits of a constitutional claim on appeal when it is not appropriate, we have not held that a court is <em>precluded </em>from considering the merits of such claims if the opposing parties have had the opportunity to fully respond. See <em>State ex rel. Van Dyke v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438, \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>{\u00b6 21} In contrast, the court of appeals in this case exercised its discretion by addressing the merits of some of Cydrus\u2019s constitutional claims, and the retirement system and retirement board have briefed them. Therefore, we likewise address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">1. Separation of Powers</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 22} Cydrus first claims that insofar as Ohio Adm.Code 145-2-23(0(3) permits the retirement board to terminate disability-retirement benefits without specifying its reasons, it violates the separation-of-powers doctrine by abrogating the plenary power of the judiciary to provide a meaningful review of the board\u2019s decisions. \u201cWhile Ohio, unlike other jurisdictions, does not have a constitutional provision specifying the concept of separation of powers, this doctrine is implicitly embedded in the entire framework of those sections of the Ohio Constitution that define the substance and scope of powers granted to the three branches of state government.\u201d <em>S. Euclid v. Jemison </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 157, 158-159, 28 OBR 250, 503 N.E.2d 136. \u201cThe administration of justice by the judicial branch of the government cannot be impeded by the other branches of the government in the exercise of them respective powers.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Johnston v. Taulbee </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 417, 20 O.O.3d 361, 423 N.E.2d 80, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 23} But administration of justice is not impeded by the lack of a statute or rule requiring the board to explain the reasons for its denial or termination of disability-retirement benefits. Reviewing an administrative record in a mandamus proceeding in such a case is \u201cnot any more burdensome than reviewing a summary judgment entered by a trial court without a detailed opinion. See Civ.R. 52.\u201d <em>Pipoly, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b621.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cAlthough it may be preferable from a policy standpoint that a retirement board explain its reasoning for its decision, the General Assembly is the final arbiter of public policy.\u201d <em>State ex rel. VanCleave v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-5377, 898 N.E.2d 33, \u00b627. As we recently observed in rejecting a separation-of-powers claim, \u201c[i]t is not the role of the courts \u2018to establish legislative policies or to second-guess the General Assembly\u2019s policy choices.\u2019\u201d <em>Stetter v. R.J. Coman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, \u00b6 35, quoting <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">2. Due process</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 25} Cydrus also claims that due process requires a more detailed retirement board decision. This court has already rejected a similar claim that the School Employees Retirement System had a duty based on procedural due process to identify the evidence it relied upon and to briefly explain its reasons for denying disability-retirement benefits. <em>VanCleave, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-5377, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>898 N.E.2d 33, \u00b6 23. We held that \u201c[e]ven if it were assumed that [the employee] has a property interest in a disability-retirement benefit, she has not demonstrated in this case that she did not receive due process regarding her claim for that benefit.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 31. We determined that the following factors established that she had received the requisite due process: (1) after her application for disability benefits was denied, she sought reconsideration of that decision and obtained a personal appearance before the board to present her position, (2) after the hearing, the retirement system medical advisory committee requested and received another medical evaluation, (3) after the board upheld its original decision to deny benefits, she had the opportunity to obtain the medical evaluations and the opinion of the medical advisory committee members and to argue in her subsequent mandamus action that the board had abused its discretion in relying on one of the medical reports. Id. at \u00b6 31, citing <em>State ex rel. Haylett v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 325, 332-333, 720 N.E.2d 901. See also <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 334-335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (in determining what process is due, factors include the value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 26} As in <em>VanCleave, </em>Cydrus received the requisite due process: (1) after the retirement board initially decided to terminate her disability-retirement benefits, the board notified her of its decision and the availability of appeal, (2) she was given the opportunity to submit to the board additional objective medical evidence in support of her appeal, and she did so by providing Dr. Sylvester\u2019s report, (3) after the retirement board denied her appeal and upheld its decision terminating her benefits, she was able to challenge the decision in this mandamus case, and (4) the medical advisors\u2019 recommendations and the board\u2019s decisions were available to her and indicated reliance on the examination reports by Dr. Steiman and Dr. Clary. Indeed, unlike the claimant in <em>VanCleave, </em>Cydrus did not have the opportunity for a personal appearance upon reconsideration, and the board did not request another medical evaluation for her appeal. But these are insignificant distinctions. Cydrus raised claims both in the court of appeals and in this appeal that the retirement board had abused its discretion by relying on Dr. Steiman\u2019s report and ignoring Dr. Sylvester\u2019s report. As in <em>VanCleave, </em>it is unclear here how Cydrus\u2019s mandamus claim has been prejudiced by the lack of a more descriptive retirement board decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 27} Therefore, neither the separation-of-powers doctrine nor due process requires that the retirement board support its decision terminating Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits by specifically identifying the evidence it relied upon and explaining the reasons for its decision. The retirement board does not have a clear legal duty in this regard, and Cydrus is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus to compel the board to provide a more detailed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>C. <em>Evidence Supporting Board\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 28} To be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus to compel the retirement board to vacate its decision terminating her disability-retirement benefits, Cydrus must establish that the board abused its discretion. See <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 386, 2008-Ohio-6254, 899 N.E.2d 975, \u00b6 25. To prove an abuse of discretion, she must show that the retirement board\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Id. In addition, the retirement board does not abuse its discretion if there is sufficient evidence to support its determination. <em>State ex rel. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>123 Ohio St.3d 146, 2009-Ohio-4694, 914 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 29} Cydrus asserts that the retirement board abused its discretion by relying on Dr. Steiman\u2019s report in its decision. She dismisses the report as irreconcilable with the ongoing medical reports of her treating physicians and a prior report of a retirement system medical advisor. She describes the report as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d for opining that her headaches were not work-prohibitive because they were subjective.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 30} These assertions lack merit. Nothing in R.C. 145.362 or Ohio Adm. Code 145-2-23 requires the retirement board to credit the findings of either Cydrus\u2019s treating physicians or one of the consultative physicians over the findings of a different independent medical examiner. See, e.g., <em>Pipoly, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 26 (construing an analogous retirement-disability provision). Notably, other doctors who had examined Cydrus in the past and whose reports are also part of the retirement board\u2019s records expressed opinions that were similar to those held by Dr. Steiman. And Dr. Steiman\u2019s emphasis on the lack of objective medical evidence to support Cydrus\u2019s medical claims is not fatal. \u201c[E]ven for medical conditions with symptoms that are often unsupported by objective medical evidence, \u2018subjective complaints are not conclusive of disability, and objective medical evidence is still relevant to a determination of the severity of the condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morgan, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 324, 2009-Ohio-591, 904 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>VanCleave, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-5377, 898 N.E.2d 33, \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 31} Therefore, the retirement board did not abuse its discretion by relying on Dr. Steiman\u2019s medical report in terminating Cydrus\u2019s disability-retirement benefits. The report constituted sufficient evidence to support the board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">D. <em>The Board\u2019s Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 32} Cydrus claims that the retirement board also abused its discretion by failing to consider the new additional medical evidence she submitted in support of her appeal of the board\u2019s termination of her disability-retirement benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>She asserts that the retirement board ignored the report of her treating' physician, Dr. Sylvester. Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 2\u201423(B)(3) requires that a recipient of disability-retirement benefits whose benefits have been terminated support an appeal of the decision with \u201cadditional objective medical evidence,\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 2\u201423(B)(3)(b), which is defined as \u201ccurrent medical evidence documented by a licensed physician specially trained in the field of medicine covering the illness or injury for which the disability is claimed [that] has not been considered previously by the retirement board.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 145-2-23(B)(3)(d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1nv\">Charles Zamora Co., L.P.A., and Charles Zamora, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 33} The board, however, specified that the decision was \u201c[b]ased upon all the medical information and recommendations.\u201d It was free to discount Dr. Sylvester\u2019s report because the imaging results she cited were not provided to the board until after the deadline for submission under Ohio Adm.Code 145-2-23(B)(3) had expired. As Dr. Sylvester noted, the neurosurgeon who issued the new imaging report concluded that Cydrus\u2019s medical condition was stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 34} Under these circumstances, the retirement board did not abuse its discretion by determining that Cydrus had not submitted sufficient objective evidence of permanent disability entitling her to the continuation of her disability-retirement benefits. She did not submit sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the retirement board acted properly by considering and rejecting Dr. Sylvester\u2019s recommendation. See <em>State ex rel.
