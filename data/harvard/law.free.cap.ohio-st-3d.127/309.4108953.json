Call v. Fragale, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 276, 2004-Ohio-6589, 819 N.E.2d 294, \u00b6 6. Even though the court of appeals did not rely on this ground to deny Dehler\u2019s request for statutory damages, \u201c \u2018[w]e will not reverse a correct judgment simply because some or all of a lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Galloway v. Cook, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 332, 2010-Ohio-3780, 933 N.E.2d 807, \u00b64, quoting <em>State ex rel. Swain v. Bartleson, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 125, 2009-Ohio-4690, 914 N.E.2d 403, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b63} Moreover, the prison officials established that permitting Dehler to inspect the requested records might have unreasonably interfered with the discharge of their duties. See <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Spatny, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 312, 2010-Ohio-5711, \u2014 N.E.2d \u2014, \u00b6 5, citing <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 79, 81, 526 N.E.2d 786, and <em>Briscoe v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1109, 2003-Ohio-3533, 2003 WL 21512808, \u00b6 16 (\u201cWith respect to penal institutions, prison administrators must be accorded deference in adopting * * * policies and practices to preserve internal order and to maintain institutional security\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, notwithstanding Dehler\u2019s contentions to the contrary, R.C. 149.43(C)(1) does not permit stacking of statutory damages based on what is essentially the same records request. No windfall is conferred by the statute. See R.C. 149.43(C)(1) (an \u201caward of statutory damages should not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation for injury arising from lost use of the requested information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, Dehler failed to establish his entitlement to an award of statutory damages in his public-records mandamus case, and we affirm the judgment denying the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-11\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b446-12\">Brown, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b446-13\">Brown, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">{\u00b6 6} I respectfully dissent from the judgment affirming the denial of an award of statutory damages to appellant, inmate Lambert Dehler, in his public-records mandamus case.</p>\n<p id=\"AX3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>{\u00b6 7} In this appeal, Dehler asserts that the court of appeals erred in refusing to award him statutory damages. The court of appeals granted a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to provide access to the requested prison library records, but it denied Dehler\u2019s request for statutory damages because unrelated records requests that were the subject of a separate mandamus action by Dehler had been held by the court to lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 8} For the following reasons, the court of appeals erred in refusing to award Dehler $1,000 in statutory damages in accordance with R.C. 149.43(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 9} First, the court of appeals <em>granted </em>a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to immediately satisfy Dehler\u2019s request for prison library records. As the court of appeals itself determined, Dehler \u201csubmitted a proper written request for public records,\u201d appellees \u201cfailed to perform their legal duties under R.C. 149.43(B) to provide access to those records,\u201d and appellees\u2019 \u201cimproper refusal to satisfy the \u2018library\u2019 request continued longer than a period of ten days.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Kelly, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2009-T-0084, 2010-Ohio-3053, 2010 WL 2636549, \u00b6 43. Appellees did not appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 judgment granting the writ. Thus, we cannot consider their claims insofar as they suggest that Dehler was not entitled to the requested records because, inter alia, Dehler did not proffer prepayment for copies. See <em>State ex rel. Worrell v. Ohio Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 116, 2006-Ohio-6513, 858 N.E.2d 380, \u00b6 9, fn. 1 (\u201cAppellees did not appeal the court\u2019s issuance of a limited writ, so we do not consider the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 holding that the board had a duty to issue a decision stating the basis for its denial\u201d). Instead, in the absence of a timely cross-appeal by appellees from the granting of the writ, we must necessarily presume the propriety of the issuance of the writ in our determination of whether the court of appeals erred in denying Dehler\u2019s request for statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 10} Second, \u201cR.C. 149.43(C)(1) provides for statutory damages of $100 for each business day during which the public office failed to comply with the public-records law, up to a maximum of $1,000,\u201d and because more than ten business days have elapsed from the date Dehler filed this mandamus action and he still has not been provided access to the requested records, the $1,000 maximum award is applicable. <em>State ex rel. Doe v. Smith, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 44, 2009-Ohio-4149, 914 N.E.2d 159, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 11} Third, nothing in R.C. 149.43(C)(1) authorizes a court to deny or reduce an award of statutory damages based on the court of appeals\u2019 stated basis of a lack of merit for a different public-records request that is the subject of a separate public-records mandamus case instituted by the same relator. Rather, the focus for denying or reducing an otherwise mandatory award of statutory damages to a prevailing party in a public-records mandamus case is on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>conduct of the public-records custodians that constitutes a failure to comply with R.C. 149.43(B) in that case and not in a separate public-records mandamus case. R.C. 149.43(C)(1)(a) and (b). The court of appeals thus erred in denying Dehler\u2019s request for statutory damages based on the purported impropriety of his records request in <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Spatny, </em>11th Dist. No. 2009-T-0075, 2010-Ohio-3052, 2010 WL 2636552, a separate mandamus case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ah9r\">Lambert Dehler, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AvX\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Ashley D. Rutherford, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 12} Fourth, the court of appeals also erred in relying on the supposed overbreadth of Dehler\u2019s records request in <em>Spatny </em>because, as I note in my separate opinion in Dehler\u2019s appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in that case, his request for prison quartermaster records at TCI was not overbroad. <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Spatny, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 312, 2010-Ohio-5711, \u2014 N.E.2d \u2014 (Brown, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, this interpretation of R.C. 149.43(C)(1) is supported by its plain language and our duties to \u201cconstrue the Public Records Act liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriffs Office, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 224, 2010-Ohio-3288, 932 N.E.2d 327, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 14} Therefore, because the court of appeals erred in not awarding Dehler $1,000 in statutory damages, reversal of the judgment is required. Thus, I dissent from the judgment affirming the court of appeals\u2019 denial of statutory damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
