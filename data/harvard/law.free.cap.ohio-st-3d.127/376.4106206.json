We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 4} Chappell was indicted on two counts of criminal simulation in violation of R.C. 2913.32, one count of receiving stolen property in violation of R.C. 2913.51, and one count of possessing criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24. The charges arose after police found in excess of 1,000 bootleg DVDs and CDs, other \u201csleeves,\u201d computers, a laptop computer, and other items in Chappell\u2019s vehicle while executing a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 5} The matter proceeded to trial, and after granting Chappell\u2019s motion for acquittal on the receiving-stolen-property count, the trial court declared a mistrial on the remaining counts after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Chappell subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment, and the trial court dismissed all of the charges with the exception of possessing criminal tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Chappell also moved for a supplemental bill of particulars, requesting that the state identify the specific statute that Chappell intended to violate with the criminal tools. The state supplemented its bill of particulars and advised that it intended to introduce evidence that the underlying felony was Chappell\u2019s purpose to violate federal copyright law under Section 506, Title 17, U.S.Code. Chappell moved to dismiss the criminal-tools count on the grounds that (1) the indictment did not charge him with violating the federal statute, (2) only a defendant\u2019s purpose to violate an offense defined in the Ohio Revised Code can support a charge of possessing criminal tools, and (3) federal copyright laws expressly preempt any state statutes on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion and rejected Chappell\u2019s arguments pertaining to the specificity of the indictment and preemption. The trial court, however, found Chappell\u2019s remaining argument to be persuasive and held that the purpose to use an item criminally must come from an intended violation of state law, not federal law. The trial court then granted Chappell\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of possessing criminal tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 8} The state appealed, and the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Chappell, </em>8th Dist. No. 92455, 2009-Ohio-5371, 2009 WL 3217907. Relying on R.C. 2901.03(A) and 2901.04(A), the appellate court found that \u201cprosecution under Ohio law must emanate from violations of offenses defined in the Revised Code.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9. Because violating federal copyright law is not defined as an offense in the Revised Code, the court of appeals held that the purpose to violate federal copyright law cannot be prosecuted by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 9} The case is now before us on our acceptance of a discretionary appeal to determine whether the state may use violations of federal criminal law to prove that a person possesses items to use the items criminally in violation of R.C. 2923.24. <em>State v. Chappell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1473, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2923.24 defines the offense of possessing criminal tools and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cNo person shall possess or have under the person\u2019s control any substance, device, instrument, or article, with purpose to use it criminally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of possessing criminal tools. Except as otherwise provided in this division, possessing criminal tools is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the circumstances indicate that the substance, device, instrument, or article involved in the offense was intended for use in the commission of a felony, possessing criminal tools is a felony of the fifth degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The inquiry herein turns on the construction of the term \u201ccriminally\u201d in the phrase \u201cwith purpose to use it criminally,\u201d as set forth in R.C. 2923.24(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 15} The state advances an expansive definition, contending that the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201ccriminally\u201d includes any social harm that the law makes punishable, which encompasses intended violations of federal as well as state law. Conversely, Chappell urges this court to adopt a more restrictive construction, limiting the term to violations of offenses defined in the Ohio Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 16} The primary goal in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. <em>State v. Hairston, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 308, 2004-Ohio-969, 804 N.E.2d 471, \u00b6 11. In interpreting a statute, this court has held that \u201cthe intent of the law-makers is to be sought first of all in the language employed, and if the words be free from ambiguity and doubt, and express plainly, clearly and distinctly, the sense of the law-making body, there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Slingluff v. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574, paragraph two of the syllabus. Where the meaning of the statute is clear and definite, it must be applied as written. <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 38, 40, 741 N.E.2d 121. However, where the words are ambiguous and are subject to varying interpretations, further interpretation is necessary. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 17} The term \u201ccriminally\u201d is not defined in the statute. Therefore, it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Anthony, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 173, 2002-Ohio-4008, 772 N.E.2d 1167, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Sharp v. Union Carbide Corp. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 69, 70, 525 N.E .2d 1386; R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 18} The term \u201ccriminally\u201d has varying definitions, including (1) according to criminal law, (2) in a criminal manner, i.e., in violation of law, and (3) reprehensively, disgracefully, or shamefully. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 537. The most relevant of the three definitions in today\u2019s case are \u201caccording to criminal law\u201d and \u201cin a criminal manner, i.e., in violation of law.\u201d WTien either definition of \u201ccriminally\u201d is used in the context of possessing criminal tools under R.C. 2923.24(A), the statutory language is susceptible of only one interpretation: the ordinary meaning of \u201ccriminally\u201d is not limited to violations of Ohio law and plainly encompasses violations of <em>any </em>law, including offenses defined under Ohio law and federal law. If the legislature had intended the narrow view advocated by Chappell, it could have so provided in R.C. 2923.24 by expressly stating that the tools must be possessed with the purpose to use them \u201cin violation of Ohio law\u201d or \u201ccriminally in violation of Ohio law\u201d or \u201cin violation of a criminal offense against the state.\u201d But the General Assembly did not do so. Because the language set forth by the General Assembly is clear and definite, we must apply it as written and hold that \u201ccriminally,\u201d as it is used in R.C. 2923.24, encompasses violations of all law, including federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>{\u00b6 19} This result is not inconsistent with R.C. 2901.03(A) and 2901.04(A) and (D), as Chappell contends and the court of appeals found. R.C. 2901.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axl\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(A) No conduct constitutes a criminal offense against the state unless it is defined as an offense in the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(B) An offense is defined when one or more sections of the Revised Code state a positive prohibition or enjoin a specific duty, and provide a penalty for violation of such prohibition or failure to meet such duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b622} The offense for which Chappell is being prosecuted is possessing criminal tools, which R.C. 2923.24 \u201cdefine[s] as an offense\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2901.03(A). R.C. 2923.24(B) also states \u201ca positive prohibition\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2901.03(B). Finally, R.C. 2923.24(C) provides a penalty for violating the prohibition by classifying the offense as either a misdemeanor of the first degree or a felony of the fifth degree, depending on the facts. The state is not prosecuting Chappell for violating federal copyright law, nor is the state seeking to have a penalty imposed against Chappell for violating federal copyright law. And the state is not required to prove that Chappell violated federal copyright law in order to obtain a conviction against him for possessing criminal tools. Rather, the state need only show that his purpose was to violate the law. Thus, the conduct for which Chappell is being prosecuted is a criminal offense under the Ohio Revised Code in accordance with R.C. 2901.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 23} Any reliance on R.C. 2901.04(A) is also misplaced. R.C. 2901.04(A) states that <em>\u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in division (C) or (D) of this section, </em>sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Division (D) states, \u201cAny provision of the Revised Code that refers to a section, or to a division of a section, of the Revised Code that defines or specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or former law of this state, another state, or the United States, to an existing or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined or specified, a substantially equivalent offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 24} Chappell\u2019s emphasis on the directive in division (A) that sections of the Revised Code defining offenses shall be strictly construed against the state discounts the entirety of the legislature\u2019s directives in R.C. 2901.04(A) and (D). R.C. 2901.04(A) is plainly modified by division (D), which was enacted as an exception to (A) and to provide a rule for interpreting statutory references that define or specify a criminal offense. See Am.Sub.S.B. No. 146, 150 Ohio Laws, Part V, 7787-7788 (modifying division (A) of R.C. 2901.04 by adding the phrase \u201cor (D)\u201d to the phrase \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in division (C) of this section\u201d and enacting new division (D)). R.C. 2901.03 is a provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Revised Code that refers to sections of the Revised Code that define or specify criminal offenses. Pursuant to R.C. 2901.04(D), a provision such as R.C. 2901.03 that defines a criminal offense shall be construed as referring to existing or former laws of this state, another state, the United States, or municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 2901.03 and 2901.04 are related and thus must be read in pari materia. <em>Maxfield v. Brooks </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 566, 144 N.E. 725, paragraph two of the syllabus. In reading statutes in pari materia, this court must give a reasonable construction that provides the proper effect to each statute. Id. All provisions of the Revised Code bearing upon the same subject matter should be construed harmoniously unless they are irreconcilable. <em>Couts v. Rose </em>(1950), 152 Ohio St. 458, 461, 40 O.O. 482, 90 N.E.2d 139. The only harmonious construction of the statutes is the one advanced by the state, i.e., that R.C. 2901.04(D) expands the definition of criminal offenses in certain circumstances. Therefore, neither R.C. 2901.03 nor 2901.04 contradicts our determination that the term \u201ccriminally\u201d in R.C. 2923.24 is not limited to violations of offenses defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Rather, these statutes lend further credence to our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 26} Chappell also argues that he was never indicted by the grand jury for intending to violate federal copyright law and that the state lacks jurisdiction to prosecute him under federal copyright laws that preempt any state-law action. The trial court rejected both of these arguments, and Chappell did not appeal those aspects of the trial court\u2019s decision. Nor were these issues addressed by the court of appeals, and Chappell did not seek this court\u2019s discretionary jurisdiction over these issues. Accordingly, Chappell\u2019s arguments are not properly before this court, and we will not consider them. <em>Niskanen v. Giant Eagle, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 486, 2009-Ohio-3626, 912 N.E.2d 595, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 27} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that, in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201ccriminally,\u201d as the term is used in R.C. 2923.24(A), the purpose to use an item criminally can arise from an intended violation of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-11\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b517-12\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">. With regal\u2019d to the state\u2019s assertion that the intent to use an item criminally under R.C. 2923.24 can arise from an intended violation of municipal law, the state did not raise this argument in the courts below. Moreover, this case involves an alleged intended violation of federal law only, not municipal law, and the Eighth District\u2019s holding addressed only violations of federal law. Thus, there is no actual controversy related to an intended violation of municipal law. Our duty is limited to determining whether the intent to use an item criminally under R.C. 2923.24 can arise from an intended violation of federal law. This conclusion is consistent with our duty not to issue advisory opinions as well as \u201c \u2018the cardinal principle of judicial restraint \u2014 if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. LetOhioVote.org v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 322, 2009-Ohio-4900, 916 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 51, quoting <em>PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drag Enforcement Adm. </em>(C.A.D.C.2004), 362 F.3d 786, 799 (Roberts, J., concurring in part and in judgment). We therefore decline to address this portion of the state\u2019s proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Brown, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AP_n\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 29} The majority concludes that the language of R.C. 2923.24(A) is unambiguous and that the ordinary meaning of \u201ccriminally\u201d is \u201cin a criminal manner, i.e., in violation of law.\u201d Based upon that broad definition of \u201ccriminally,\u201d the majority holds that a charge of possessing criminal tools may be based on the use of criminal tools with the intent to violate federal law. The term \u201ccriminally\u201d as used in R.C. 2923.24 is not defined explicitly in the Ohio Revised Code. I concede that the term could be defined as the majority suggests if the definition could be properly applied without reference to other relevant statutory provisions. But terms used in statutes cannot be defined in a vacuum, divorced from then-relevant statutory context.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 2901.03(A) abrogated all common-law offenses and established that only statutorily defined conduct may be found to be criminal in Ohio. R.C. 2901.03(A) provides, \u201cNo conduct constitutes a criminal offense against the state unless it is defined as an offense in the Revised Code.\u201d The majority\u2019s definition does not take into account that the General Assembly has expressed its intent as to what constitutes a crime under Ohio law. Rather than defining the adverb \u201ccriminally\u201d to correspond with the General Assembly\u2019s definition of \u201ccriminal offense,\u201d the majority unnecessarily expands the definition of \u201ccriminally\u201d to include violations of any law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 2923.24(C) provides further support for the conclusion that the General Assembly intended \u201ccriminally\u201d to be defined in accordance with R.C. 2901.03. R.C. 2923.24(C) provides, \u201cWhoever violates this section is guilty of possessing criminal tools. Except as otherwise provided in this division, possessing criminal tools is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the circumstances indicate that the substance, device, instrument, or article involved in the offense was intended for use in the commission of <em>a felony, </em>possessing criminal tools is a felony of the fifth degree.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 32} For the purposes of the Revised Code, R.C. 2901.02 classifies offenses into categories and limits the category of \u201cfelony\u201d to the following: (1) aggravated murder and murder as defined in the Revised Code, (2) any offense specifically classified as a felony in the Revised Code, and (3) any offense in the Revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Code not specifically classified as a felony if imprisonment for more than one year may be imposed as a penalty. R.C. 2901.02(C), (D), and (E). R.C. 2923.24(C) clearly frames the offense of possessing criminal tools in the context of criminal offenses as classified in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 33} Indeed, if R.C. 2923.24(A) is read so broadly as to include the violation of <em>any </em>law, as held by the majority, application of R.C. 2923.24(C) produces strange results. R.C. 2923.24(C) and the definition of \u201cfelony\u201d in R.C. 2901.02 mandate that only those criminal-tools convictions that are based upon the intent to use tools in the commission of a felony defined in the Revised Code may be classified as a felony of the fifth degree. All other criminal-tools offenses, presumably including those based upon the intent to use a criminal tool to violate the laws of any other jurisdiction, must then be classified as a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the General Assembly had intended for a criminal-tools charge to be based on the intent to violate the criminal laws of any jurisdiction, as the majority holds, why would the offense be treated differently based solely upon whether the underlying offense is an Ohio offense or an offense under the law of some other jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 34} Finally, general rules of statutory construction of criminal statutes weigh in favor of a narrower definition of \u201ccriminally.\u201d R.C. 2901.04(A) requires that sections of the Revised Code that define offenses be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused. In light of the other statutory provisions that support a definition of the term \u201ccriminally\u201d as the commission of a criminal offense defined in the Revised Code, application of R.C. 2901.04(A) requires that this court adopt the narrower definition of \u201ccriminally\u201d propounded by the trial court and the court of appeals. <em>State v. Chappell, </em>8th Dist. No. 93298, 2010-Ohio-2465, 2010 WL 2201783.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 35} The majority\u2019s reliance upon R.C. 2901.04(D) to justify its disregard for R.C. 2901.04(A) and its conclusion that a violation of any law may support a conviction of possessing criminal tools is unavailing. The majority is correct that R.C. 2901.04(D) sets forth an exception to the directive contained in R.C. 2901.04(A). But that exception is irrelevant to the issues before the court in this case. The plain language of R.C. 2901.04(D) demonstrates that the exception applies only when a provision of the Revised Code refers specifically to <em>\u201ca section, </em>or to <em>a division of a section, </em>of the Revised Code\u201d that defines or specifies a criminal offense. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2923.24 contains no specific reference to a section or division of a section of the Revised Code, and R.C. 2901.04(D) cannot be used in this case to negate the requirement that the definitions of criminal offenses be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 36} The majority\u2019s convoluted interpretation of R.C. 2901.04(D) also disregards the plain language of R.C. 2901.03(A). Despite the fact that R.C. 2901.03(A) unambiguously provides that \u201c[n]o conduct constitutes a criminal offense against the state unless it is defined as an offense in the Revised Code,\u201d the majority attempts to use R.C. 2901.04(D) to expand the definition of a crime to include violations of existing or former laws of this state, other states, the United States, and municipalities. Such an interpretation renders the actual language of R.C. 2901.03(A) meaningless and thwarts the clearly expressed intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 37} Perhaps more troubling than the majority\u2019s disregard for the plain language of the relevant statutory provisions is the majority\u2019s encroachment on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. It is undisputed that Ohio courts lack jurisdiction over federal criminal prosecutions and the enforcement of federal criminal laws. Yet the majority\u2019s holding poises Ohio courts to encroach upon the federal arena in cases involving Ohio defendants charged with possessing criminal tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 38} The facts of the case before us present just one example of how a state court prosecution for possessing criminal tools based upon an intended violation of federal law may include improper forays into issues of federal law. In order to prove that Chappell committed the offense of possessing criminal tools, the state must prove that his purpose in using the tools at issue was to violate federal copyright law. In few cases will the state be presented with a neat confession from such a defendant that it was his purpose to violate federal copyright law or that it was his purpose to violate Section 506, Title 17, U.S.Code. Instead, the state will be presented with direct or circumstantial evidence that a defendant, for example, intended to copy and sell a DVD or other copyrighted work, as in this case. It will then fall to the state to demonstrate to the trier of fact that those specific actions of the defendant constitute a crime under Section 506, Title 17, U.S.Code. In doing so, the state will be put in the position of presenting a federal criminal case to a state jury or judge, and when a jury is involved, the state court will be instructing the jury on federal criminal law, all in the pursuit of trying an Ohio defendant for an Ohio offense. In resolving inevitable disputes regarding whether the underlying actions of the defendant constitute a federal crime, state courts will be called upon to interpret and apply federal criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 39} This court and other Ohio courts have no authority or expertise in federal criminal law. Therefore, this court ought to avoid an interpretation of R.C. 2923.24 that entangles Ohio courts in matters intended for federal courts, particularly when the statutory language can clearly be interpreted to avoid such a result.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Thorin Freeman, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad7\">Joseph T.

Any other definition leads to absurd results that improperly expand the jurisdiction of Ohio\u2019s courts. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b521-5\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. Although the majority contends that its analysis addresses only the issue whether a criminal-tools charge can arise from an intended violation of federal law, nothing in its analysis supports such a limitation. See majority opinion at \u00b6 1, fn. 1. In fact, the majority holds, \u201c[T]he statutory language [of R.C. 2923.24(A)] is susceptible of only one interpretation: the ordinary meaning of \u2018criminally\u2019 is not limited to violations of Ohio law and plainly encompasses violation of <em>any </em>law, including offenses defined under Ohio law and federal law.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 18. Therefore, the majority\u2019s analysis and definition of \u201ccriminally\u201d are so broad as to include intended violations of municipal ordinances, the laws of other states, and the laws of foreign jurisdictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
