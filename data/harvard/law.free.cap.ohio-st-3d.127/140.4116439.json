Yet the trial judge\u2019s bias against and threats to defense counsel created the involuntary nature of defendant\u2019s choice. Counsel stated that they could no longer fully represent their client because the judge had made statements against them. This unusual conundrum had caused counsel to be apprehensive, anxious, and preoccupied over the judge\u2019s intentions. However, the judge refused to allow them to withdraw from the case. The defendant, seeing the drama between the judge and his counsel unfold, believed that adequate representation from these attorneys was impossible. Thus, he asked to represent himself. The judge refused the request because the defendant had stated that he was \u201cunder duress.\u201d But the judge himself had created that duress. This dilemma permeated the entire trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 2} This court has a responsibility to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system, which includes a duty to ensure that all defendants have received a fair trial from an impartial judge. Where the record demonstrates that that has not occurred, the remedy is a new trial. We are mindful of both the anguish suffered by the family and friends of the victims and the substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in a senseless murder. Yet based on the highly extraordinary facts of this case, we are required to reverse the convictions, vacate the death sentence imposed on defendant-appellant, Jason Dean, and remand this case for a new trial. To that end, our decision follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 3} Dean was accused of shooting at Yolanda Lyles and Andre Piersoll at a convenience store, shooting at the vehicle and home of Devon Williams, shooting at Shanta Chilton, Hassan Chilton, Shani Applin, and Applin\u2019s young child Jaida Bullock,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then fatally shooting and robbing Titus Arnold. Dean was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder. Count 12 charged Dean with the aggravated murder of Arnold with prior calculation and design. Count 13 charged him with the aggravated murder of Arnold while committing aggravated robbery. Both counts included death-penalty specifications because these crimes represented a course of conduct, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and because the murder occurred during the aggravated robbery, and although he was not the principal offender, Dean committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 4} Dean was also indicted on six counts of attempted murder: Count 1 charged Dean with the attempted murder of Piersoll, Count 2 charged the attempted murder of Lyles, Count 7 charged the attempted murder of Shanta Chilton, Count 8 charged the attempted murder of Hassan Chilton, Count 9 charged the attempted murder of Shani Applin, and Count 10 charged the attempted murder of Jaida.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 5} Dean was also indicted on eight additional counts. Counts 5 and 6 charged Dean with discharging a firearm into an occupied structure. Counts 3 and 14 charged him with aggravated robbery. Counts 4, 11, 15, and 16 charged Dean with having a weapon under a disability. Additionally, firearm specifications were included under 12 counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">{\u00b6 6} Dean pleaded not guilty to all charges. However, the jury found Dean guilty, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">{\u00b6 <em>7} </em>Dean now appeals to this court as a matter of right. In this appeal, Dean raises 23 propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Judicial Bias and Request for Self-representation</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 8} In proposition of law I, Dean argues that the trial court erred by overruling his request to waive counsel and represent himself. In proposition of law III, Dean argues that his rights to a fair trial and due process were violated because the trial judge was biased against him and his attorneys. Because these issues are intertwined, we will address them together. In addition, an understanding of the pretrial history is necessary to set the stage for the resulting conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 9} 1. Facts. Before trial, the state certified to the court that disclosure of the address or whereabouts of a witness, Crystal Kaboos, Dean\u2019s girlfriend, might subject her to physical harm or coercion. See Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e). Thereafter, defense counsel, Richard Mayhall and John Butz, requested a hearing on the state\u2019s certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 10} On April 24, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on the certification. No witnesses were called at the hearing, and the defense agreed to proceed on the basis of the state\u2019s averments. The state averred that threats had been made against Kaboos because she had testified against codefendant Wade. The trial court ruled that it \u201caccepted the State\u2019s certification that the disclosure of witness Kaboos\u2019 address may subject her to physical harm or coercion. Accordingly, pursuant to Criminal Rule 16(B)(1)(e), the State need not disclose to the defense witness Kaboos\u2019 address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">(\u00b6 11} On May 3, 2006, the defense moved for the trial judge to disqualify himself from presiding over Dean\u2019s trial because the judge had heard evidence on the Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) certification. The defense invoked <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 533 N.E.2d 272, paragraph one of the syllabus, which holds, \u201cWhen the state seeks to obtain relief from discovery or to perpetuate testimony under Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e), the judge who disposes of such a motion may not be the same judge who will conduct the trial.\u201d <em>Gillard, </em>which we overruled on other grounds, <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 402-403, 686 N.E.2d 1112, adopted this rule because \u201cwhen a judge hears information that a defendant has attempted to harm, coerce, or intimidate an opposing witness, there is an unnecessary risk that the judge will harbor a bias against that defendant.\u201d <em>Gillard </em>at 229. Nothing in the record establishes that the defense counsel, the trial judge, or the prosecutor was aware of, or remembered, the <em>Gillard </em>holding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">{\u00b6 12} On May 4, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on the motion to disqualify. On May 5, the trial court overruled the motion for two reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>First, the trial court anticipated \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt at trial, which would render any <em>Gillard </em>violation harmless. <em>Gillard, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 229, 533 N.E.2d 272. Second, the trial court stated that it \u201chas not heard any evidence about the defendant and whether or not he and/or alleged cohorts have threatened State\u2019s witnesses,\u201d as the certification hearing involved lawyer argument only.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 13} On May 8, 2006, jury selection began. On May 10, 2006, trial counsel filed an affidavit of disqualification against the judge. Trial counsel claimed in the affidavit that the judge had demonstrated bias and prejudice against the defendant by (1) overruling an unopposed defense motion to permit Dean to appear at trial without shackles, (2) presiding over the Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) certification hearing and then refusing to disqualify himself, and (3) prejudging the defendant\u2019s guilt by making the statement that the court anticipated the presentation of \u201coverwhelming evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Gillard, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 229, 533 N.E.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 14} In response to the defense motion for disqualification, the state claimed that the affidavit of disqualification was a calculated and deliberate attempt to have the judge removed from the case. The state argued that trial counsel had neither raised the issue that the certification matter should be heard by another judge nor objected to the presiding judge\u2019s participation. The state supported its claim by providing an excerpt of an April 30, 2006 recorded phone conversation between Dean and his brother. This conversation suggested the possibility that the trial judge might not be able to remain on his case because he had presided over the <em>Gillard </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 15} On May 11, 2006, Chief Justice Thomas Moyer denied the affidavit of disqualification. Chief Justice Moyer stated, \u201cAlthough on their face the judge\u2019s statements in his judgment entry may appear to suggest a predisposition in this case, * * * the tone and the content of [the judge\u2019s] response show that he is <em>neither biased nor prejudiced against the defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">{\u00b6 16} After the parties were notified of Chief Justice Moyer\u2019s decision, the relationship between the judge and the defense attorneys began to deteriorate. On May 12, 2006, the trial court and the parties discussed the denial of the affidavit of disqualification. The trial court informed trial counsel that it had \u201csome very serious concerns about the allegations that were set forth in the State\u2019s response,\u201d even though both the judge and the prosecutor had also overlooked <em>Gillard. </em>Richard Mayhall, the lead defense counsel, denied doing anything wrong. However, the trial court stated that the state\u2019s allegation, which makes \u201cserious accusations against defense counsel},] * * * on its face appears to be corroborated by several facts, and the Court maintains some very serious concerns about defense counsel and the manner in which they\u2019re operating in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>courtroom.\u201d The trial court further stated that \u201cin the interest of getting this case back on track, the Court will take that matter up at a later time; but I do assure the parties that that matter will be taken up * * *, preferably at the conclusion of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">{\u00b6 17} On May 15, 2006, John Butz, the assistant defense counsel, informed the trial court that defense counsel were concerned about possible disciplinary sanctions. Butz stated, \u201c[Q]uite honestly, we don\u2019t think we can effectively represent Mr. Dean from this point on until whatever the issue is is resolved.\u201d Mayhall also told the court, \u201c[A]fter your comments, I was intimidated; * * * if I did something wrong, I\u2019ll accept responsibility for it. But with this hanging over my head, * * * I don\u2019t think I\u2019m willing to risk further angering you, and I think that would affect my ability to represent Mr. Dean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 18} In response, the trial court repeated that he would \u201chandle the matter\u201d after trial and \u201cdidn\u2019t prejudge the situation.\u201d In response to a defense question about the allegations, the trial court stated, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re guilty of them, but it appears from the allegations that you were manipulating the Court and deceiving the Court in an effort to have this Judge removed from the case.\u201d The trial court also told counsel, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you guys got yourself into this situation; but we\u2019re going to proceed this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 19} Later on the morning of May 15, trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. The motion included Mayhall\u2019s and Butz\u2019s affidavits. Mayhall expressed concern about aggressively representing his client when doing so might further anger the judge and expose counsel to harsher punishment at the end of trial. Mayhall also stated that Dean was now potentially a witness against him regarding what he actually told Dean about the judge\u2019s disqualification. Butz stated that the trial court\u2019s threat of contempt had caused him to be \u201cphysically and emotionally sick\u201d and had had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on his ability to zealously represent Dean.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court denied the motion to withdraw. The trial court stated that he \u201ccertainly had no intention of causing a chilling effect on defense counsel when it comes to zealously representing their client.\u201d He added, \u201cMr. Mayhall, I certainly have no problem with aggressive cross-examination. * * * I have no problem with objections that are made during the course of trial, and I have no problems with motions for mistrials if you think such motions are warranted.\u201d The trial court added, \u201cI think that the events that happened last week \u2014 and, again, I\u2019m not going to get to whether or not the allegations are true \u2014 but I think behavior in that fashion is something that this Court frowns upon. * * * I don\u2019t like manipulation, and I don\u2019t like \u2014 I just don\u2019t like playing games.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">{\u00b6 21} On May 16, 2006, Dean informed the court that he did not feel he could receive a fair trial with current counsel. Dean said that he had \u201cthe impression\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that his counsel had offended the court and that the judge was taking the matter personally. Dean requested new counsel or wanted to defend himself, a request he immediately asked to have stricken from the record. The trial court told Dean, \u201cI\u2019m giving them free rein to defend you in an ethical manner * * * and so far I see them doing that. So, I appreciate your concern, and I\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">{\u00b6 22} Thereafter, Mayhall sought clarification about the term \u201cunethical.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cManipulating the Court, defrauding the Court, deceiving the Court. I think that\u2019s unethical behavior; and if it\u2019s established that you did that, you\u2019ll be held accountable.\u201d In reply, Mayhall said, \u201cIf we could get the issue settled one way or another, then I can come to work every day and think about this case, not think about what\u2019s going to happen to me three weeks from now when it\u2019s over. And * * * I\u2019ll tell you, Judge, that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d The trial court replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t put you in that situation. You put yourself there so I\u2019m not here to bail you out. You conduct yourself the way you think you should conduct yourself, and you deal with the consequences. It\u2019s not my responsibility to hold your hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 23} The next day, Dean informed the court that his counsels\u2019 representation had continued to \u201cdeteriorate.\u201d He said that his counsel had shown a \u201clack of enthusiasm in their cross-examination of the witnesses\u201d and mentioned \u201ctheir lack of objections.\u201d Dean implored the court to resolve the allegations against his attorneys before the trial continued. The trial court replied that earlier in the day, and with defense counsel\u2019s consent, it had explored with the prosecution options for resolving the allegations, including staying the trial. However, the trial court had decided to continue with the trial, saying, \u201cI stand behind the statement I made yesterday, that I did not put them in this situation. They\u2019ve put themselves in it. * * * Your attorneys are concerned that they might be held in contempt. I\u2019m here to tell them to suck it up, be a professional, do the best job you can do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 24} After the trial court denied counsels\u2019 motion to withdraw, Dean informed the court, \u201cI\u2019d like to relieve Mr. Mayhall and Mr. Butz in this case. I believe it\u2019s my right to defend myself, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court discussed the timeliness of the request and asked whether it was being made for purposes of delay. Dean told the court, \u201cI\u2019m willing to proceed immediately. * * * This is not designed to delay this trial in any way.\u201d The parties also discussed arranging a psychological evaluation to determine Dean\u2019s competency to waive counsel. Trial counsel told the court that Dean had been evaluated extensively by Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a psychologist, and Dr. Smalldon would be able to address this issue without conducting a further examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The trial court then questioned Dean to determine whether he fully understood and waived his right to counsel. During this colloquy, Dean informed the court that he was aware of the charges against him, that he understood that the death penalty was a possible sentence if he was found guilty of the capital specifications, and that he knew that he had the right to be represented by two capital-qualified attorneys throughout the proceedings. Dean also understood that he would be representing himself and would be responsible for cross-examining witnesses, making objections and arguments, and presenting his own witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court then questioned Dean regarding the voluntariness of his waiver. Dean stated that no one had made any promises or threats to get him to waive counsel. The trial court then conducted the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe Court: And is this something you want to do voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe Court: All right. Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe Defendant: I would just like the record to reflect that <em>I\u2019m doing this under duress </em>due to you continually not addressing that issue of Mr. Butz\u2019s and Mr. Mayhall\u2019s alleged unethical actions. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe Court: All right. Well, that\u2019s going to be a problem because I\u2019m not going to accept a waiver of counsel if you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s under duress. All right. Because you\u2019re essentially saying that the Court\u2019s forcing you to do this, and I\u2019m not going to put you or myself in that position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">{\u00b6 33} Following this exchange, the court recessed for the day to determine when Dr. Smalldon could testify about Dean\u2019s competence. The trial court added, \u201c[I]t\u2019s going to give you a night to sleep on this and think about it. Certainly you can change your mind. But if you feel that you\u2019re doing this under duress, then that\u2019s going to be a problem. * * * I\u2019m not going to let you do it because that\u2019s just not going to be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">{\u00b6 34} On the following day, the trial court asked Dean whether he still wanted to represent himself. Dean replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d The trial court and Dean then had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe Court: All right. Well, I\u2019ve had the evening to think about it; and as I told you yesterday when I was citing the case law, that you do have a constitutional right to represent yourself. The problem I foresee * * * as I indicated yesterday, is your statement that you were doing this under duress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">(\u00b6 36} \u201cThe Defendant: I just \u2014 I made that statement just so that would be made for the record on future reference for the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe Court: Well, I understand that. The problem is it\u2019s one of those things where * * * you\u2019ve said it; and now it\u2019s out there, and I have concerns about letting you waive your right to an attorney because the way it appears, at least by your statement, is that I\u2019m indirectly forcing you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Defendant: That\u2019s not the case at all. As I said, the only reason I did that was for that to be on the record for future reference for my appeal in the process of this. I fully understand what I did, why I made that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cI don\u2019t feel in any way that you\u2019re biased against me, prejudiced against me, have a vendetta against me. I feel completely confident to defend myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 40} Thereafter, the trial court overruled Dean\u2019s request to waive counsel because it was not \u201cvoluntary.\u201d The court stated, \u201cI cannot accept a waiver of trial counsel in a capital case if there\u2019s any hint that it\u2019s not being done voluntarily and that it\u2019s being done under duress, especially because he\u2019s claiming that the duress or the pressure or the coercion is coming from the Court, whether directly or indirectly.\u201d The trial court said nothing about calling Dr. Smalldon as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 41} Following the trial court\u2019s ruling, Dean asked to retract his statement about waiving counsel under duress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe Defendant: * * * <em>If necessary, I would like to retract any statements I made or any reference I made to being under duress </em>if that\u2019s the case. Strike that from the record. However you guys go about doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cI feel at this point it is impossible for Mr. Mayhall and Mr. Butz to defend me adequately in any way, shape, or form. And I \u2014 I need to defend myself because the truth needs to be [sic] come out here; and the way they\u2019re doing it, it can\u2019t happen. It just can\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cMy constitutional rights are being violated. * * * I can\u2019t understand this at all. <em>Do I have the right to defend myself? </em>* * * I would like to be granted that. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">{\u00b6 45} Thereafter, the trial court stated, \u201c[Y]our position has been made clear for the record\u201d and then ordered the trial to continue. Dean said nothing further about representing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">{\u00b6 46} On June 13, 2006, after the trial had concluded and Dean had been sentenced, the trial court filed an entry finding Mayhall and Butz in direct criminal contempt and fining them each $2,000. The trial court made findings that \u201cdefense counsel, in a calculated scheme to remove this Court from the Dean case, manipulated the Court into presiding over a Criminal Rule 16(B)(1)(e) hearing so that the Court would be disqualified from presiding over the Dean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>trial pursuant to <em>Gillard.\u201d </em>The trial court determined that one of counsels\u2019 motives stemmed from \u201ca longstanding personal revulsion of the Court, dating back to when this Judge was an assistant prosecuting attorney. Accordingly, the Court vehemently disagrees with Mr. Butz\u2019s statement that \u2018This is not a personal attack on the Court.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">{\u00b6 47} The court of appeals reversed the findings of criminal contempt. <em>State v. Dean, </em>Clark App. Nos. 2006CA61 and 2006CA63, 2007-Ohio-1031, 2007 WL 706799. The court held that Mayhall and Butz should have been afforded a hearing on the contempt allegations. Id. at \u00b6 28. The court also held that \u201cstatements from the trial court indicated that the court\u2019s impartiality was impaired\u201d and that a different judge should have conducted an evidentiary hearing. Id. at \u00b6 32-33. On remand, the judge cited Mayhall and Butz for indirect criminal contempt and transferred the matter to a different judge for a hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 48} 2. Discussion. The issues of judicial bias and the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation are inextricably entwined in this case. \u201cIt is well settled that a criminal trial before a biased judge is fundamentally unfair and denies a defendant due process of law.\u201d <em>State v. LaMar, 95 </em>Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 34, citing <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460. Judicial bias has been described as \u201ca hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Liteky v. United States </em>(1994), 510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474, the Supreme Court held that \u201copinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. Thus, judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.\u201d On the other hand, \u201c[tjhey <em>may </em>do so [support a bias challenge] if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they <em>will </em>do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 50} The record shows that the trial judge harbored a bias against defense counsel that was manifested through his comments and rulings during the trial. This bias first became apparent after counsel filed the affidavit of disqualification, and it continued throughout the rest of the proceedings. We will now review the trial judge\u2019s actions that lead us to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 51} As previously discussed, the trial judge suggested that counsel had manipulated, defrauded, and deceived the court in requesting him to preside over the certification hearing in order to disqualify him from sitting on the trial, even though the trial judge himself had a duty to be aware of <em>Gillard. </em>The trial judge threatened counsel with sanctions and warned them, \u201c[I]f it\u2019s established you did that, you\u2019ll be held accountable.\u201d After counsel moved to withdraw from the case, the trial judge expressed his belief that counsel were using their concern about being held in contempt as \u201cleverage to try to get this Court to come off of its stance to hold them accountable for anything they may have done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 52} The trial court\u2019s accusatory and threatening comments toward counsel were made during judicial rulings and other matters during trial. Normally, such remarks would not establish judicial bias. <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474; see also <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 278, 750 N.E.2d 90. However, the trial judge\u2019s comments provide evidence of judicial bias when they are considered in the context of the trial judge\u2019s other rulings and ill-tempered remarks during and after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 53} The trial court demonstrated this bias on other occasions by denying counsel reasonable opportunities to consult with Dean. In the first situation, Terry Smith, a jailhouse informant, testified during the state\u2019s case-in-chief about Dean\u2019s admissions to him describing his involvement in Arnold\u2019s murder. Smith also testified that Dean had admitted making disparaging remarks about Arnold\u2019s family in letters that he had sent to Jason Mans. Following Smith\u2019s testimony, trial counsel asked for a recess to talk to Dean, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cMr. Mayhall: And, you know, the only other person who knows anything about these statements would be my client. I would just like five or ten minutes to talk with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cMr. Schumaker [the prosecutor]: And <em>we have no objection to that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cMr. Mayhall. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cThe Court: All right. Hold on. This witness was disclosed on May 11 or May 12. That was \u2014 today\u2019s the 23rd. That was 12 days ago so we\u2019re not going to take trial time to do investigation so you can proceed with your cross-examination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>{\u00b6 58} The trial court\u2019s refusal to provide counsel with five or ten minutes to talk with Dean, particularly when the state did not object to the recess, displayed antagonism toward the defense and was unreasonable. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s rulings ran in one direction. The trial court allowed the state to recall seven witnesses during the trial. The trial court also granted the state a delay in presenting its case after a videotape malfunctioned. Thus, the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the defense a short recess was not justified by the need to avoid unnecessary delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 59} In another situation, the trial judge denied counsel a reasonable opportunity to consult with Dean after he informed counsel that he wanted to testify in his own behalf. After' the lone defense witness testified, trial counsel informed the judge that Dean had changed his mind and wanted to testify. Trial counsel requested a recess to prepare Dean\u2019s testimony because they had not planned for him to testify. The trial court denied this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 60} Trial counsel replied that they would be committing ineffective assistance of counsel if they were not allowed to prepare Dean\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor replied that he had no objection to \u201cabout a ten-minute recess.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to say a ten-minute recess is sufficient to prepare their client for testimony in a capital murder case.\u201d The trial court then said, \u201c[T]his is a unilateral decision of the defendant\u2019s * * *. And if he wants to get up here and tell his side of the story * * * I don\u2019t think it takes * <em>* </em>* much preparation for the defense attorneys just to say, \u2018What happened? What\u2019s your side of the story?\u2019 \u201d The trial court also told counsel, \u201cI understand your position. There\u2019s no question you\u2019re being put in a horrible position.\u201d In response, trial counsel stated, \u201cTen minutes is better than no time at all.\u201d The trial court then stated, \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll give you ten minutes.\u201d Thereafter, trial counsel informed the court that after consulting with Dean, \u201cIt is his wish not to testify and to allow us to rest and proceed to closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 61} Clearly, Dean\u2019s decision to testify in his own behalf was one of the crucial decisions of the defense case. The trial judge initially denied the defense a recess on the stated ground that the defense needed no additional time to prepare and present Dean\u2019s testimony. Trial counsel was ultimately given the ten minutes they requested to consult with Dean, their client on a death-penalty case. However, trial counsel requested ten minutes to consult with Dean only after the trial judge had initially denied counsel any additional time to talk with Dean. In this situation, the trial judge displayed annoyance and impatience with the accused and counsel. We also find that the trial judge\u2019s intemperate and one-sided comments manifested bias against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 62} Finally, the trial judge\u2019s finding of criminal contempt showed that his bias was based on feelings of ill will toward counsel that predated the trial. The trial judge found that one of counsels\u2019 motives for trying to remove him from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>case was their \u201clongstanding personal revulsion of the Court, dating back to when this Judge was an assistant prosecuting attorney.\u201d He also stated that \u201cdefense counsel was setting the Court up for the next move\u201d and characterized one of counsel\u2019s arguments as being cast \u201cin a suspiciously enthusiastic tone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 63} Unlike his other statements, the trial court\u2019s comments about counsel\u2019s \u201clongstanding personal revulsion\u201d were from an \u201cextrajudicial source.\u201d <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555-556, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474. These comments, representing an \u201cextrajudicial source,\u201d place the judge\u2019s other accusatory and threatening remarks into context. They show the likelihood that his earlier assurances that he would remain unbiased were untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 64} The state responds to Dean\u2019s claims by pointing out that Dean told the judge that he did not believe that the judge was biased against him. During questioning about self-representation, Dean told the court: \u201cI don\u2019t feel in any way that you\u2019re biased against me, prejudiced against me, have a vendetta against me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 65} Even assuming that Dean did not feel the judge was biased against him, we note that his claim that the judge was biased against his counsel remains. Judicial bias exists if it is directed toward counsel. Indeed, \u201cthe judge who is so hostile to a lawyer as to doom the client to defeat deprives the client of the right to an impartial tribunal.\u201d <em>Walberg v. Israel </em>(C.A.7, 1985), 766 F.2d 1071, 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 66} In sum, we find that the judge was biased against counsel to such a degree that fair judgment was impossible. <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555-556, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474. The judge\u2019s deep-seated bias against counsel also tainted his denial of Dean\u2019s request to represent himself at trial, creating the impossible conflict. We now address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cThe Sixth Amendment * * * guarantees that a defendant in a state criminal trial has an independent constitutional right of self-representation and that he may proceed to defend himself without counsel when he voluntarily, and knowingly and intelligently elects to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562. \u201cIn order to establish an effective waiver of right to counsel, the trial court must make sufficient inquiry to determine whether defendant fully understands and intelligently relinquishes that right.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus; see also Crim.R. 44(A). If a trial court denies the right to self-representation when properly invoked, the denial is per se reversible error. <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456, citing <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 168, 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122, fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">{\u00b6 68} The assertion of the right to self-representation must be clear and unequivocal. <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 38. A request for self-representation may be denied when circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>indicate that the request is made for purposes of delay or manipulation of the trial process. See <em>United States v. Frazier-El </em>(C.A.4, 2000), 204 F.3d 553, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 69} Dean\u2019s request to represent himself was clear and unequivocal. Furthermore, we do not find Dean to be manipulative when he stated, \u201cI\u2019m doing this under duress.\u201d Rather, Dean invoked his right to self-representation because he was caught in the middle of a dispute between the judge and his counsel in a case in which his very life was at stake. The trial judge had demonstrated animosity toward his counsel since they filed the affidavit of disqualification against him. The trial judge accused counsel of serious misconduct, threatened to sanction counsel if he confirmed his suspicions, and denied their repeated requests to withdraw from the case even though they informed the court that the allegations had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on their ability to zealously represent Dean. Dean was present and heard all these exchanges. Under these circumstances, Dean was legitimately concerned that the trial judge\u2019s animosity and bias against his counsel might interfere with his ability to receive a fair trial. Moreover, Dean\u2019s motives for seeking to represent himself should have been clear to the judge because of what had occurred with counsel up to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 70} Matters then worsened. When it was clear to Dean that the judge would not allow him to represent himself because of his statement about acting under duress, Dean attempted to retract the statement. The trial judge rejected Dean\u2019s attempt to retract his statement. Dean argued that his feelings of duress simply reflected his own doubts about his counsel\u2019s willingness to represent him effectively; Dean tried to assert that his request to waive counsel was truly voluntary. Dean\u2019s explanation was not persuasive; he was clearly backtracking to try to persuade the judge to allow him to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 71} <em>United States v. Garey </em>(C.A.11, 2008), 540 F.3d 1253, supports Dean\u2019s argument. In <em>Garey, </em>three days before trial, the defendant filed a motion to disqualify counsel, alleging conflicts of interest and irreconcilable differences with him. Id. at 1258-1259. The defendant requested substitute counsel. Finding no conflicts, the trial judge denied these requests. The judge then explained to the defendant his options and asked whether he wished to proceed to trial with his appointed counsel or wished to represent himself. The defendant replied, \u201cI am not going to let [appointed counsel] represent me,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to involuntarily represent myself * * Id. at 1259-1260. The trial court ruled that the defendant could represent himself because he had \u201cknowingly and voluntarily decided to proceed with representation of himself.\u201d Id. at 1260. The defendant appealed, claiming that the court denied him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel because he had never affirmatively asked to represent himself. Id. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 72} The trial court\u2019s ruling was upheld on appeal. The court stated that a defendant may \u201cintentionally and voluntarily waive his right to counsel and accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the consequent necessity of self-representation in more than one way.\u201d <em>Garey, </em>540 F.3d at 1265. The court stated, \u201cSo long as the trial court is assured the defendant (1) understands the choices before him, (2) knows the potential dangers of proceeding pro se, and (3) has rejected the lawyer to whom he is constitutionally entitled, the court may, in its exercise of its discretion, discharge counsel * * Id. at 1267. In finding the defendant\u2019s request voluntary, the court stated, \u201cNo less than four times, Garey rejected [his counsel\u2019s] representation outright, and several times more he expressed his intent to represent himself (albeit \u2018involuntarily\u2019). By rejecting appointed counsel, Garey voluntarily chose to proceed pro se as surely as if he had made an affirmative request to do so.\u201d Id. at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 73} In this case, the scenario was even more complicated. There is no evidence that Dean was dissatisfied with his attorneys until the dispute arose between counsel and the judge. Dean did not become concerned that his attorneys could not represent him until counsel began telling the judge that they could not do so. After the judge refused their request to withdraw, Dean saw self-representation as his only hope, a choice that the judge refused. This unique scenario may have no precedent, but it clearly resulted in a tainted trial, with the defendant caught in the middle.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 74} As in <em>Garey, </em>Dean understood the choices before him regarding representation, he was fully advised about the potential dangers of proceeding pro se, and he rejected repeatedly the attorneys assigned to represent him. Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion by finding that Dean\u2019s request for self-representation was involuntary and by refusing to allow him to proceed pro se, especially when the trial judge\u2019s own conduct resulted in the trial court\u2019s finding of involuntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 75} Based on the foregoing,, we find that propositions I and III have merit, and the convictions and the sentence must be vacated. We do not reach this decision lightly. However, we must ensure that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to self-representation is protected and that we maintain the integrity of our judicial system. Moreover, this case clearly went beyond the normal disputes that sometimes arise between counsel and the trial judge during trial. Here, the disputes directly infringed upon the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 76} Because of our disposition of this case, the remaining issues raised in the appellant\u2019s brief are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b289-10\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aji\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Stephen A.
