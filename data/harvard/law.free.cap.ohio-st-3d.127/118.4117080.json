Austin\u2019s petition was fatally defective and subject to dismissal because he failed to comply with the verification requirement of R.C. 2725.04. <em>Hughley v. Saunders, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 90, 2009-Ohio-4089, 914 N.E.2d 370, \u00b6 1. Although Austin\u2019s petition contains several notarizations, there is no notarized statement in which he expressly swears to the truth of the allegations in the eight \u201cgrounds\u201d listed in his petition. Id.; <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 327-328, 744 N.E.2d 763. Moreover, even if his petition were not fatally defective, he failed to state any meritorious claims that would warrant issuance of the requested extraordinary relief in habeas corpus. See, e.g., <em>Turner v. Brunsman, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 445, 2009-Ohio-5588, 917 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(claim of nonjurisdictional sentencing errors is not cognizable in habeas corpus); <em>State ex rel.
