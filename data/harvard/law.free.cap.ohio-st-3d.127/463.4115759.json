According to the most recent count of the Hamilton County Board of Elections, only 23 votes, out of nearly 230,000 votes cast, separate the totals for the two competing candidates. However, the votes of 849 Hamilton County electors who voted provisionally were not counted, based on the board\u2019s conclusion that these electors voted in the wrong precinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">{\u00b6 8} According to a statement submitted by two Hamilton County Board of Elections members, many of these 849 Hamilton County electors arrived at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>correct multiprecinct voting location but were erroneously directed by poll workers to vote a ballot formulated for the wrong precinct \u2014 that is, a precinct other than the precinct in which the voter resided. In many cases, voters were simply directed to the wrong table.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question presented is whether Ohio electors otherwise qualified to vote should be disenfranchised when errors by election officials result in their votes being cast in the wrong precinct. I believe the answer is no. An elector\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to participate in our democracy and cast a ballot must prevail over a technical application of the statutory law, particularly in the face of a poll worker\u2019s mistake. Nevertheless, I reluctantly concur in the court\u2019s grant of an expedited alternative writ that will allow presentation of evidence and briefs prior to this court\u2019s resolution of the merits of this case. I write separately to explain why my concurrence is reluctant.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">{\u00b6 9} In my view, relators\u2019 claims appear to lack merit. Additionally, respondents have presented highly convincing arguments that relators\u2019 claims for extraordinary relief should ultimately be dismissed. I am not prepared to conclude, however, that respondents have met the standard required for dismissal of an original action at this procedural stage, i.e., the S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.5 determination. That is, I do not find it beyond doubt, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations of relators\u2019 complaint and making all reasonable inferences in their favor, that relators are not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. See <em>State ex rel. Duke Energy Ohio, Inc. v. Hamilton Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 41, 2010-Ohio-2450, 930 N.E.2d 299, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 10} Elections are seldom perfectly administered. Relators argue that Ohio statutes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provide that votes cast in the wrong precinct are to be excluded. In my view, however, when a voter votes in the wrong precinct as a result of error by election officials, the fundamental constitutional rights of a qualified Ohio elector to have his or her vote counted in a race in which the elector was clearly qualified to vote must prevail. And those most fundamental constitutional rights under the Ohio and United States Constitutions should prevail over a technical violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>of R.C. 3599.12(A)(1), which prohibits a person from voting \u201cin a precinct in which that person is not a legally qualified elector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 11} The record before us clearly supports the inference that election officials in Hamilton County may have made mistakes in administering the election as to a subset of provisional voters. For example, there are allegations that some of the voters at issue had recently been reassigned to new precincts, some as a result of redrawn precinct lines, and some had been reassigned to new multiprecinct voting locations. Despite these challenges, these voters arrived to vote at the proper location where, through no fault of their own, they were directed by poll workers to the wrong table. As a result, these voters inadvertently voted in the wrong precinct. In these circumstances, the fundamental constitutional rights of the elector require that the votes be counted. A federal judge has issued an order to election officials to investigate and determine whether poll-worker error contributed to electors\u2019 voting in the wrong precinct. No one has suggested that Hamilton County poll workers intentionally misdirected voters who appeared at multiprecinct voting locations. But if an investigation discloses that poll workers did err, albeit innocently, the interests of affected Ohio electors in having their votes counted should, in my view, prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 12} My view is shared by two Ohio federal district court judges who believe that issues of equal protection and due process are implicated by the failure to count votes in these circumstances. These federal courts have recognized that the United States Constitution prohibits the exclusion of votes from the official election count when a vote was improperly cast in the wrong precinct because of poll-worker error. The federal constitution is the supreme law of the land, and no Ohio statute that, as applied, conflicts with a voter\u2019s constitutional rights can prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">(\u00b6 13} In <em>Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. Brunner, </em>S.D. Ohio (E.D.) No. C2-06-896, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, entered a consent decree in April 2010 in a case challenging Ohio\u2019s identification and provisional-ballot laws. The decree stated that its purpose included the following: ensuring that \u201cthe fundamental right to vote is fully protected for registered and qualified voters who lack the identification required by the Ohio Voted ID Laws\u201d and ensuring that \u201cvoters will not be deprived of their fundamental right to vote because of failures by poll workers to follow Ohio law.\u201d The decree further noted that the Supremacy Clause, Clause 2, Article VI of the United States Constitution, provides that the federal constitution constitutes \u201cthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Consistent with these purposes, the decree specified that boards of elections may not reject a provisional ballot cast by a voter who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>uses only the last four digits of his or her Social Security number as identification if the voter has cast a provisional ballot in the correct polling place but \u2014 for reasons attributable to poll-worker error \u2014 in the wrong precinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, in a case arising out of the same circumstances that underlie this case, i.e., the November 2, 2010 race for Hamilton County Juvenile Court judge, Chief Judge Susan J. Dlott of the federal district court issued a preliminary injunction in <em>Hunter v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>S.D.Ohio (W.D.) No. 1.TO-cv-820, 2010 WL 4878957. Judge Dlott granted a preliminary injunction \u201cinsofar as it seeks an order commanding [the board and its members] to investigate whether provisional ballots cast in the correct polling location but wrong precinct were improperly cast because of poll worker error.\u201d Judge Dlott reasoned that because the board of elections had previously counted 26 provisional ballots cast at the Hamilton County board office but in the wrong precinct due to \u201cclear poll worker error,\u201d its failure to apply similar scrutiny to other provisional ballots cast at the correct polling place but in the wrong precinct \u201craises equal protection concerns.\u201d To prevent irreparable harm, Judge Dlott ordered that the board of elections \u201cexamine all 849 faulty provisional ballots for poll worker error.\u201d Judge Dlott further ordered that the board \u201cimmediately begin an investigation into whether poll worker error contributed to the rejection of the 849 provisional ballots now in issue and include in the recount of the race for Hamilton County Juvenile Court Judge any provisional ballots improperly cast for reasons attributable to poll worker error.\u201d That order was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and that appeal remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 15} In my view, the filing of this action raises significant issues of comity and jurisdictional priority, which weigh heavily against the issuance of extraordinary relief in the form of a writ of mandamus. This court should not interfere with the litigation of these issues already underway in the federal courts. It is difficult to see the filing of this action as anything other than an attempt by relators to collaterally attack a federal court order issued in federal litigation. As argued by respondents, the requested writ would place the board and the secretary in \u201can untenable position of potential competing court orders.\u201d Moreover, the relators\u2019 filing of an original action in this court did not occur until <em>after </em>the Sixth Circuit dissolved a stay it had previously issued. That is, relators turned to this court to seek a stay and other relief only after being denied similar relief by the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 16} Relator John W. Painter, a Hamilton County elector who voted in the November 2, 2010 election, and whose vote has presumably already been included in the vote count, asserts that his vote is subject to dilution if any of the ballots at issue that were voted provisionally are counted. However, the relators do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>contend, nor is there any reason to suspect, that the provisional voters at issue were not qualified to vote for the <em>countywide </em>judge\u2019s race at issue. As to that race, whether a qualified Hamilton County voter cast his ballot in the wrong precinct is irrelevant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Apg\">Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., R.

McTigue, and Mark A.

I further concur in the court\u2019s order of a stay that will, until this original action is resolved, preclude respondents from opening the envelopes containing ballots cast provisionally by 849 Hamilton County electors. The secrecy of those votes must be protected. Finally, as discussed above, I reluctantly concur in the court\u2019s grant of an expedited alternative writ that will allow presentation of evidence and briefs prior to this court\u2019s resolution of the merits. I would, however, allow more time for the presentation of evidence and briefs than provided by the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\">. I suspect that some Hamilton County voters in multiprecinct locations may similarly have been mistakenly directed by poll workers to vote on voting machines programmed with ballots for precincts other than the one in which the voter resided. However, unlike votes cast provisionally on paper and segregated in provisional-ballot envelopes, any machine-east regular votes, even if east in incorrect precincts, were immediately commingled. Those votes have since been counted. I question whether the disparate treatment of voters who voted regular ballots in the wrong precinct and voters who voted provisionally in the wrong precinct raises equal protection concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\">.
