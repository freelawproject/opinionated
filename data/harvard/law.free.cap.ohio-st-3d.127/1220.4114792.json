Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Assistant Prosecutors Lisa Reitz Williamson and Matthew E. Meyer have filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking the disqualification of Judge Joan Synenberg from acting on any further proceedings in case No. CR-232189-B, the death-penalty case of defendant Joe D\u2019Ambrosio in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">{\u00b6 2} Affiants allege that Judge Synenberg has acted in a manner causing the state to reasonably question her impartiality and fairness. According to affiants, the judge (1) failed to disclose her role several years ago as a defense attorney for Thomas Keenan, D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s codefendant, (2) treated prosecutors with hostility and thereby deprived the state of a meaningful opportunity to participate in two hearings, and (3) inappropriately provided a journalist with a journal entry and other information that caused an inaccurate and inflammatory newspaper story, prejudicing the state\u2019s ability to obtain a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Synenberg has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavit. The judge expressly denies ever representing Keenan. She further maintains that the record in the underlying case reflects that she has been fair, impartial, and respectful to all participants. In regard to the third allegation, Judge Synenberg concedes that she provided an order to a newspaper columnist, but she denies any impropriety because that order had been rendered in open court and on the record one day earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">{\u00b6 4} Robert L. Tobik, counsel for D\u2019Ambrosio, has also filed an affidavit in response. Tobik maintains that Judge Synenberg has been consistently polite and fair to all counsel throughout these proceedings. Moreover, he disputes the state\u2019s assertion that the judge has treated prosecutors with hostility or disrespect. Rather, Tobik states that Judge Synenberg has shown great restraint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>despite the fact that prosecutors have acted at times in a confrontational and abrupt manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 5} In 1988, the state charged D\u2019Ambrosio, Keenan, and Edward Espinoza with the aggravated murder of Anthony Klann. Keenan and D\u2019Ambrosio were tried separately. Keenan was tried twice, convicted, and sentenced to death. See <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 689 N.E.2d 929. D\u2019Ambrosio was tried, convicted, and also sentenced to death. See <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 652 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 6} On March 24, 2006, the United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, found that the state had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence prior to trial and granted D\u2019Ambrosio a conditional writ of habeas corpus. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio v. Bagley </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 527 F.3d 489. Accordingly, on September 11, 2008, the district court issued an order instructing the state to set aside D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s aggravated-murder conviction and death sentence or retry him within 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 7} In September 2008, the state sought a retrial, which is the subject of the instant affidavit of disqualification. D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s retrial was assigned to Judge Synenberg, who set the matter for trial on March 2, 2009, eight days before the expiration of the federal court\u2019s conditional writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 8} On February 25, 2009, Judge Synenberg sanctioned the state for failing to comply with Crim.R. 16. Specifically, on February 20, the state discovered the existence of four items of physical evidence that had been recovered during the murder investigation but had not been provided to D\u2019Ambrosio. The judge accepted the state\u2019s proposal that she impose the least restrictive sanction available and continue the trial to allow for forensic testing of the newly discovered evidence. Judge Synenberg thereafter rescheduled D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s trial for May 4, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">{\u00b6 9} Because the judge\u2019s order extended the trial beyond the district court\u2019s 180-day deadline for retrying D\u2019Ambrosio, the state returned to federal district court on March 4, 2009, to request an extension of time within which it could retry its case. On March 26, 2009, the state filed the instant affidavit of disqualification against Judge Synenberg. The state filed a copy of the affidavit of disqualification with the district court as a \u201csupplemental authority.\u201d On April 24, 2009, the district court denied the state\u2019s motion to extend the deadline for retrying D\u2019Ambrosio. Instead, the district court ordered that D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s conviction and death sentence be expunged as a remedy for the state\u2019s failure to engage in a good-faith effort to comply with the 180-day mandate. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>court, however, did not bar the state from retrying D\u2019Ambrosio on the charges in the original indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Judge Synenberg\u2019s Alleged Representation of Keenan</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 10} Affiants first allege that Judge Synenberg previously acted as defense<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> counsel to Thomas Keenan, D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s codefendant in the murder of Klann. According to affiants, in 1993, then attorney Synenberg served as co-counsel to Keenan during his second trial. Because Keenan and D\u2019Ambrosio were both accused of murdering Klann, affiants argue that Judge Synenberg\u2019s representation of Keenan has given her personal knowledge of disputed facts in D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s case. Thus, affiants seek the judge\u2019s disqualification to avoid any conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 11} Affiants discovered this information on February 25, 2009, when a member of the public (who requested anonymity) alerted the lead prosecutor that Judge Synenberg was listed as an attorney of record for Keenan on the on-line docket of the Cuyahoga County clerk of courts. Prosecutors broached this subject with Judge Synenberg during a hearing on March 2, 2009, and asked the judge to formally disclose what role she had in Keenan\u2019s case and to recuse herself from D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s case. According to affiants, Judge Synenberg refused to acknowledge or otherwise disclose her prior representation of Keenan. Thus, affiants contend that Judge Synenberg\u2019s refusal to disclose her involvement in Keenan\u2019s trial \u2014 either before it came to the prosecutor\u2019s attention or after\u2014 constitutes a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 12} Affiants rely foremost on the clerk of courts\u2019 website, which contains online case and docketing information. Affiants cite specifically the attorney-information page in Keenan\u2019s case listing \u201cJoan C. Synenberg\u201d as an attorney of record in that case. See case No. CR-88-232189-A, 2007 WL 5581004. Affiants aver that the clerk\u2019s website \u201cis an official record relied on by the Court in the ordinary course of its business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">{\u00b6 13} Affiants have also submitted affidavits of Frank C. Gasper and Mark J. Mahoney, the assistant prosecutors in Keenan\u2019s second trial. According to Gasper\u2019s affidavit, in October 1993 Joan Synenberg \u2014 then known as Joan Lehmann \u2014 appeared as co-counsel for Keenan in place of attorney Rocco Russo. Gasper recalls that he attended pretrials with attorney Lehmann in the Keenan case and also provided her with discovery materials. As for Mahoney, he states that during Keenan\u2019s second trial, defense counsel James Kersey told him that \u201can attractive new female lawyer would be assisting [Kersey] with the trial, and [Kersey] mentioned the woman as being named \u2018Joanie.\u2019 \u201d Mahoney also recalls seeing Judge Synenberg on at least one occasion present in the courtroom of Judge Calabrese during pretrial proceedings in Keenan\u2019s case, \u201csitting in front of the bar and directly behind defense counsel\u2019s trial table.\u201d Mahoney, who is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>lead prosecutor in D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s case, explains that he did not recall until recently Judge Synenberg\u2019s involvement in Keenan\u2019s second trial due to the length of time that had elapsed since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">{\u00b6 14} Despite the judge\u2019s name appearing in Keenan\u2019s case on the clerk\u2019s website and the affidavits of Gasper and Mahoney, I cannot conclude on the record before me that Judge Synenberg acted as defense counsel in Keenan\u2019s retrial. First, the attorney-information page listing Judge Synenberg as counsel in Keenan\u2019s case contradicts affiants\u2019 assertion that the clerk\u2019s website is an official court record. The attorney page includes a disclaimer stating that \u201c[o]nly the official court record available from the Cuyahoga County Clerk of Courts, available in person, should be relied upon as accurate and current.\u201d Moreover, users of the clerk\u2019s website also \u201care cautioned to verify independently any information or data obtained from this Website with the official court record information maintained by the office of the Cuyahoga County Clerk of Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 15} Second, Judge Synenberg\u2019s name does not appear in any official court record. That is, there is no existing docket entry, hearing transcript, trial transcript, or any other court document that lists the judge as having represented Keenan. Indeed, affiants concede that they have thoroughly read through the transcript from Keenan\u2019s retrial and confirmed that Judge Synenberg is not named or mentioned as an attorney during any on-the-record hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 16} Third, according to Prosecutor Mason, neither Judge Anthony Calabrese, who presided over Keenan\u2019s retrial, nor his bailiff could recall whether Judge Synenberg appeared as counsel in Keenan\u2019s case. Likewise, Sandra McPherson, Keenan\u2019s mitigation specialist, could not recall whether Judge Synenberg appeared. Additionally, James Kersey, Keenan\u2019s co-counsel, submitted an affidavit stating that he has no recollection of Judge Synenberg appearing in Keenan\u2019s case as counsel or as a stand-in for attorney Russo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, Kersey specifically denies making the statements attributed to him in Mahoney\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 17} Fourth, Judge Synenberg has expressly denied that she represented Keenan or appeared at any proceeding during Keenan\u2019s retrial or otherwise. She further notes that she was not qualified for death-penalty cases at the time of Keenan\u2019s retrial in 1993 and 1994. Moreover, she maintains that she never shared discovery documents with Gasper or any other assistant prosecutor in Keenan\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 18} To prevail on an affidavit of disqualification, an affiant must demonstrate clearly the existence of bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying interest that requires a judge\u2019s removal. See <em>In re Disqualification of Crow </em>(2000), 91 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>St.3d 1209, 741 N.E.2d 137. Affiants, however, have not offered the type of compelling evidence necessary to order disqualification of a judge. Based on the evidence presented by affiants, no reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s ability to preside over the case in a fair and impartial manner. See <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8 (setting forth the proper test for disqualifying a judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Judge Synenberg\u2019s Treatment of Prosecutors</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 19} Affiants allege that Judge Synenberg\u2019s hostile treatment of the prosecutors handling this case demonstrates her inability to serve as a fair and impartial jurist. Affiants first claim that the judge denied them request for time to prepare a written response to defense counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss or for alternative sanctions stemming from the state\u2019s failure to provide discovery. Affiants complain because the judge ordered the hearing on the motion to go forward on February 24, 2009, despite knowing that Mahoney was already engaged in another capital murder trial before a different judge and had expected to appear only for a bond hearing rather than a hearing regarding the alleged discovery violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 20} An affidavit of disqualification addresses the narrow issue of possible bias or prejudice of a judge; it is not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law. <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. Judge Synenberg\u2019s alleged failure to grant the prosecutors time to respond to a motion is a matter within the judge\u2019s sound discretion and is not, by itself, evidence of bias or prejudice. See <em>In re Disqualification of Eyster, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1246, 2004-Ohio-7350, 826 N.E.2d 304, \u00b6 4. Indeed, trial judges are entitled to exercise their discretion in ruling on many matters, and it is not my role in deciding an affidavit of disqualification to second-guess each ruling. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, vague or unsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460. Contrary to affiants\u2019 assertions, Judge Synenberg informed all counsel on February 23 that she would hold a hearing the next day on the recently discovered evidence in the state\u2019s possession. Thus, affiants\u2019 claim that they had expected to appear only for a bond hearing is not supported by the record. There is also no evidence that the judge denied any request for time to respond to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. No written request for time was filed, and no objection was made to the judge\u2019s decision to go forward with the February 24 hearing. In fact, Mahoney urged Judge Synenberg to proceed immediately with the hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Affiants next maintain that the judge berated and screamed at prosecutors during an off-the-record meeting on March 2, 2009, after they had asked the judge to recuse herself. According to Assistant Prosecutors Zimmerman and Meyer, Judge Synenberg accused them of \u201csandbagging\u201d her and grandstanding for the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">{\u00b6 23} Defense counsel Tobik and J. Michael Goldberg, the judge\u2019s staff attorney, dispute affiants\u2019 version of events, and they indicate that the judge was respectful and fair at all times. As for Judge Synenberg, she admits to being surprised and upset that the state had chosen to request her recusal in open court without having investigated the matter or first discussing it with her in chambers. She denies, however, that she treated the state\u2019s attorneys disrespectfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 24} If a judge\u2019s words or actions convey the impression that the judge has developed a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u201d or reached a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d that will prevent the judge from presiding over the case with \u201can open state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, then the judge should not remain on the case. Judges are, however, entitled to express dissatisfaction about attorneys\u2019 conduct and tactics inside and outside the courtroom, as long as the judge\u2019s dissatisfaction is \u201cexpressed in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity, dignity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10. As Jud.Cond.R. 2.8(B) directs, judges should be \u201cpatient, dignified, and courteous\u201d to parties and their lawyers, even in the most difficult of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 25} Judge Synenberg was clearly taken aback by the manner in which the state sought her recusal. But those who were present during the March 2 meeting between the judge and counsel remember the conversation quite differently. On the record before me, I am unable to establish whether Judge Synenberg actually made the alleged comments, let alone determine whether the comments reflect bias or prejudice. Thus, in the wake of the conflicting stories presented here, I cannot conclude that the judge should be removed from presiding over further proceedings. See, e.g., <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 26} Affiants\u2019 third claim here is that during the March 2 hearing, the judge allowed defense counsel to make extended remarks about the state\u2019s alleged failure to disclose evidence and then consistently interrupted, cut off, and argued with prosecutors when they attempted to explain why defense counsel\u2019s arguments were factually and legally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>{\u00b6 27} I have rejected in other cases the type of concerns voiced by affiants in this case. <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4 (an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law\u201d). Moreover, after review of the March 2 hearing transcript, I am convinced that the judge conducted herself in a manner consistent with Jud.Cond.R. 2.8(B), which requires judges to be \u201cpatient, dignified, and courteous\u201d when speaking to litigants, lawyers, and others in an official capacity. The hearing was primarily devoted to resolving discovery issues arising out of the state\u2019s belated disclosure of additional evidence. Although the judge did prevent the state from making certain arguments, this was done only as to matters that the court had previously addressed. Certainly, judges have wide discretion in how they conduct courtroom proceedings, and nothing about Judge Synenberg\u2019s conduct raises serious questions for me about her ability to set aside any frustration with the state\u2019s attorneys and preside fairly over further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Cleveland Plain Dealer Article</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b628} Finally, affiants allege that Judge Synenberg was a source for an extremely inaccurate and scathing February 27, 2009 newspaper column that accused prosecutors of hiding evidence and called for ending the \u201ccharade called justice.\u201d According to affiants, the judge inappropriately provided a journal entry to a columnist for the Cleveland Plain Dealer before the entry was filed with the clerk of courts. In addition to the entry, affiants claim that Judge Synenberg made direct comments to the columnist about the substance of the case in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 29} Judge Synenberg admits that she provided a newspaper columnist with a journal entry before the entry was filed with the clerk. The subject of this entry was the judge\u2019s decision to continue the trial as a sanction for the state\u2019s discovery violations. The judge\u2019s decision to provide the media with a copy of her entry before counsel had received the entry was ill-advised. Nevertheless, I do not find that the judge\u2019s action requires her disqualification. Judge Synenberg informed both parties in open court on February 25, 2009, of her decision to continue the trial. Moreover, contrary to affiants\u2019 claims, there is no compelling evidence that the judge made any direct comment about the substance of the case to the columnist. Judge Synenberg avers that she referred the columnist to the transcripts, journal entries, and orders, but did not otherwise discuss the case, and I see nothing before me that would lead me to question the judge on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">{\u00b6 30} As I have stated, \u201c[a] judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b6 31} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Synenberg.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">. Attorney Russo is deceased.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
