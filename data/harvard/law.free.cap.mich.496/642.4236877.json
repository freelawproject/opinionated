FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">IBM is a corporation based in New York that provides information technology products and services worldwide. In December 2009, IBM filed its Michigan Business Tax annual return for the 2008 tax year. Line 10 of IBM\u2019s return, the \u201cApportionment Calculation\u201d line, read \u201cSEE ATTACHED ELECTION.\u201d IBM filed a sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>rate statement along with its return, entitled \u201cElection to use MTC Three Factor Apportionment,\u201d indicating that it elected to apportion its business income tax base and modified gross receipts tax base using the three-factor apportionment formula provided in the Compact. Under these calculations, IBM sought a refund of $5,955,218. The Department disagreed. It determined that IBM could not elect to use the Compact\u2019s formula and that IBM was entitled to a refund of only $1,253,609 when calculated under the BTA\u2019s sales-factor apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">IBM filed a complaint in the Court of Claims, challenging the Department\u2019s decision. Thereafter, IBM moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), and the Department moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(1)(2). After a hearing on the motions, the Court of Claims denied summary disposition to IBM and granted summary disposition in favor of the Department. The Court of Claims determined that the BTA mandated the use of the sales-factor apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Court of Claims order granting summary disposition in favor of the Department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals first determined that there was a facial conflict between the BTA and the Compact insofar as the BTA mandates use of the sales-factor formula while the Compact permits taxpayers to elect to use a three-factor apportionment formula.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the basis of this conflict, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Legislature had repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision by implica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tion when it enacted the BTA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals then stated that it did not need to decide whether the modified gross receipts tax was an \u201cincome tax\u201d under the Compact subject to the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula in light of its conclusion that the Compact\u2019s election provision had been repealed by implication.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">IBM sought leave to appeal in this Court.

HISTORY OF BUSINESS TAXATION IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Because we believe it important to our analysis in this case, we begin with a discussion of the history of business taxation in Michigan. Michigan\u2019s taxation of business income or activity began in 1953, when the Legislature enacted a business activities tax that taxed the adjusted receipts of a taxpayer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This tax remained in effect until Michigan adopted its first corporate income tax as part of the Income Tax Act of 1967 (ITA).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Against the backdrop of the ITA, Michigan joined the Multistate Tax Compact in 1970 when the Legislature enacted MCL 205.581.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Compact \u201csymbolized the recognition that, as applied to multistate businesses, traditional state tax administration was inefficient and costly to both State and taxpayer.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the goals of the Compact include facilitating and promoting equitable and uniform taxation of multistate taxpayers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To this end, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Compact operates in conjunction with Michigan\u2019s tax acts, containing several provisions designed to ensure uniform taxation of multistate taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In 1976, the Legislature replaced the corporate income tax with a single business tax.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Unlike its predecessor, the Single Business Tax Act (SBTA) taxed business activity, not income, and operated as \u201ca form of value added tax.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In enacting the SBTA, the Legislature expressly amended the ITA to the extent necessary to implement the SBTA and expressly repealed provisions of the ITA that would conflict with the SBTA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Legislature, however, did not expressly repeal the Compact.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The SBTA remained in effect until 2008, when the Legislature enacted the BTA, which is at issue in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Representing another shift in business taxation, the BTA imposed two main taxes: the business income tax and the modified gross receipts tax.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In enacting the BTA, the Legislature expressly repealed the SBTA, but again did not expressly repeal the Compact.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, the BTA was short-lived. Effective January 1, 2012, Michigan returned to a corporate income tax.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> At the same time, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Legislature stayed true to its past practice of repealing conflicting tax acts and expressly repealed the BTA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Throughout the evolution of our state\u2019s method of business taxation, the Compact has remained in effect. Another constant throughout this history is that the Legislature has always required a multistate taxpayer with business income or activity both within and without the state to apportion its tax base.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This process, known as formulary apportionment, has allowed Michigan to tax the portion of a taxpayer\u2019s multistate business carried on in Michigan without violating the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We now address whether a multistate taxpayer retained the privilege of electing the apportionment method provided by the Compact for the 2008 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">IV WHETHER IBM COULD ELECT TO USE THE COMPACT\u2019S APPORTIONMENT FORMULA FOR ITS 2008 TAXES</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">To determine whether IBM could elect to use the Compact\u2019s three-factor apportionment formula to calculate its 2008 Michigan taxes, we must decide if the Legislature repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>A. LEGAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We begin our analysis \u201cwith the axiom that repeals by implication are disfavored.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We will presume, \u201cin most circumstances, that if the Legislature had intended to repeal a statute or statutory provision, it would have done so explicitly.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201c[w]hen the intention of the legislature is clear, repeal by implication may be accomplished by the enactment of a subsequent act inconsistent with a former act\u201d or \u201cby the occupancy of the entire field by a subsequent enactment.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> However, \u201cwhere the intent of the Legislature is claimed to be unclear, it is our duty to proceed on the assumption that the Legislature desired both statutes to continue in effect unless it manifestly appears that such view is not reasonably plausible.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Repeals by implication will be allowed \u201conly when the inconsistency and repugnancy are plain and unavoidable.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We will \u201cconstrue statutes, claimed to be in conflict, harmoniously\u201d to find <em>\u201cany other </em>reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>construction\u201d than a repeal by implication.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Only when we determine that two statutes \u201care so incompatible that both cannot stand\u201d will we find a repeal by implication.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In attempting to find a harmonious construction of the statutes, we \u201cwill regard all statutes upon the same general subject-matter as part of one system . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Further, \u201c[sjtatutes <em>in pari materia, </em>although in apparent conflict, should, so far as reasonably possible, be construed in harmony with each other, so as to give force and effect to each . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">It is a well-established rule that in the construction of a particular statute, or in the interpretation of its provisions, all statutes relating to the same subject, or having the same general purpose, should be read in connection with it, as together constituting one law, although they were enacted at different times, and contain no reference to one another. The endeavor should be made, by tracing the history of legislation on the subject, to ascertain the uniform and consistent purpose of the legislature, or to discover how the policy of the legislature with reference to the subject-matter has been changed or modified from time to time. In other words, in determining the meaning of a particular statute, resort may be had to the established policy of the legislature as disclosed by a general course of legislation. With this purpose in view therefore it is proper to consider, not only acts passed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the same session of the legislature, but also acts passed at prior and subsequent sessions.[<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In this case, the Compact\u2019s election provision and \u00a7 301 of the BTA share the common purpose of setting forth the methods of apportionment of a taxpayer\u2019s multistate business income; therefore, we must construe them together as statutes <em>in pari materia.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">With the history of Michigan business taxation and applicable legal principles in mind, we turn to the specific statutes at issue. IBM sought to apportion its BTA tax base using the Compact\u2019s three-factor apportionment formula.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In so doing, IBM relied on the Compact\u2019s election provision, which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">(1) Any taxpayer subject to an income tax whose income is subject to apportionment and allocation for tax purposes pursuant to the laws of a party state or pursuant to the laws of subdivisions in 2 or more party states may elect to apportion and allocate his income in the manner provided by the laws of such state or by the laws of such states and subdivisions without reference to this compact, or may elect to apportion and allocate in accordance with article IV... .[<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">This provision allows a taxpayer subject to an income tax to elect to use a party state\u2019s apportionment formula or the Compact\u2019s three-factor apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>However, the Department rejected IBM\u2019s attempts to apportion its income through the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula. Instead, it required IBM to apportion its BTA tax base consistently with the BTA and its sales-factor formula. Section 301 of the BTA reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this act, each tax base established under this act shall be apportioned in accordance with this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">(2) Each tax base of a taxpayer whose business activities are confined solely to this state shall be allocated to this state. Each tax base of a taxpayer whose business activities are subject to tax both within and outside of this state shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying each tax base by the sales factor calculated under section 303.[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We recognize that the language of the BTA is mandatory in nature.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Under the statute, a taxpayer\u2019s BTA tax base must be apportioned through the BTA\u2019s sales-factor apportionment formula.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Department argues that this mandatory language precludes the use of any other apportionment formula and, reading it in isolation, we would agree. However, as stated previously, \u00a7 301 of the BTA is not the only provision of Michigan\u2019s tax laws pertaining to the apportionment of business income \u2014 the Compact\u2019s election provision shares the same purpose. Therefore, we cannot interpret \u00a7 301 of the BTA in a vacuum.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Rather, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>consider it along with the Compact \u201cby tracing the history of legislation on the subject, to ascertain the uniform and consistent purpose of the legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The BTA is not the first Michigan business tax act to contain a mandatory apportionment formula. All our past business tax acts mandated that a taxpayer with income or activity that was taxable within and without the state allocate and apportion its tax base consistently with each respective act.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> These acts further mandated that the tax base be apportioned through a specific apportionment formula.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The mandatory apportionment language of the BTA is nearly identical to the language of its predecessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The Department argues that the Legislature repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision when it enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the BTA because \u00a7 301 of the BTA is the first tax provision with apportionment language directly in conflict with the Compact\u2019s election provision. The import of this argument is that the Compact\u2019s election provision was a dead letter when it was enacted because both the ITA and the election provision required use of the same three-factor apportionment formula. However, the Department\u2019s argument overlooks that the Compact\u2019s election provision, by using the terms \u201cmay elect,\u201d contemplates a divergence between a party state\u2019s mandated apportionment formula and the Compact\u2019s own formula \u2014 either at the time of the Compact\u2019s adoption by a party state or at some point in the future.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Otherwise, there would be no point in giving taxpayers an election between the two. In fact, reading the Compact\u2019s election provision as forward-looking\u2014 i.e., contemplating the future enactment of a state income tax with a mandatory apportionment formula different from the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula \u2014 is the only way to give meaning to the provision when it was enacted in Michigan.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Viewed in this light, the BTA\u2019s mandatory apportionment language may plausibly be read as compatible with the Compact\u2019s election provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Moreover, our review of the statutes <em>in pari materia </em>indicates a uniform and consistent purpose of the Legislature for the Compact\u2019s election provision to operate alongside Michigan\u2019s tax acts.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Just as it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>when it enacted the ITA,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> the Legislature, in enacting the BTA, had full knowledge of the Compact and its provisions.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Even with such knowledge on both occasions, the Legislature left the Compact\u2019s election provision intact. By contrast, the Legislature expressly repealed or amended other inconsistent acts regarding the taxation of businesses.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Had the Legislature believed that the Compact\u2019s election provision no longer had a place in Michigan\u2019s tax system or conflicted with the purpose of the BTA, it could have taken the necessary action to eliminate the election provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Because the Legislature gave no clear indication that it intended to repeal the Compact\u2019s election provision, we proceed under the assumption that the Legislature intended for both to remain in effect.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> After reading the statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude that a reasonable construction exists other than a repeal by implication.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Under Article III(l) of the Compact, the Legislature provided a multistate taxpayer with a choice between the apportionment method contained in the Compact or the apportionment method required by Michigan\u2019s tax laws. If a taxpayer elects to apportion its income through the Compact, Article IV(9) mandates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>taxpayer do so using a three-factor apportionment formula. Alternatively, if the taxpayer does not make the Compact election, then the taxpayer must use the apportionment formula set forth in Michigan\u2019s governing tax laws. In this case, IBM\u2019s tax base arose under the BTA. Had it not elected to use the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula, IBM would have been required to apportion its tax base consistently with the mandatory language of the BTA \u2014 i.e., through the BTA\u2019s sales-factor apportionment formula.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, we believe the BTA and the Compact are compatible and can be read as a harmonious whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Subsequent action by the Legislature indicates that it did not impliedly repeal the Compact\u2019s election provision when it enacted the BTA.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> On May 25, 2011, the Legislature expressly amended the Compact\u2019s election provision by adding the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">[Ejxcept that <em>beginning January 1, 2011 </em>any taxpayer subject to the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1101 to 208.1601, or the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.697, shall, for purposes of that act, apportion and allocate in accordance with the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>sions of that act and shall not apportion or allocate in accordance with article IV[<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">There is no dispute that the Legislature specifically intended to retroactively repeal the Compact\u2019s election provision for taxpayers subject to the BTA beginning January 1, 2011. The Legislature could have \u2014 but did not \u2014 extend this retroactive repeal to the start date of the BTA. In addressing this legislation, the dissent suggests that \u201cthe 2011 Legislature may have simply been acting expressly to confirm what the 2007 Legislature believed it had already done implicitly.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We would agree with that conclusion if the Legislature had retroactively repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision beginning January 1, 2008, the effective date of the BTA. However, by only repealing the Compact\u2019s election provision starting January 1, 2011, the Legislature created a window in which it did not expressly preclude use of the Compact\u2019s election provision for BTA taxpayers. Further, we believe that the express repeal of the Compact\u2019s election provision effective January 1, 2011, is evidence that the Legislature had not impliedly repealed the provision when it enacted the BTA.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Therefore, a review of the 2011 amendments supports our conclusion that the Compact\u2019s election provision remained in effect for the 2008 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">C. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The dissent\u2019s analysis has a tantalizing simplicity to it. It homes in on the plain language and mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>nature of the BTA\u2019s apportionment provision. However, the dissent spends very little time considering the language of the Compact, its history, or the history of business taxation in Michigan. While this approach may be proper in construing the BTA in a typical case, it is incomplete when we are faced with the question of implied repeal. Under such circumstances, that the dissent has arrived at the better or even the best interpretation <em>of the BTA </em>does not end the inquiry. Rather, because there is a presumption <em>against </em>implied repeals,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> it is our task to determine if there is <em>any other reasonable construction </em>that would harmonize the two statutes and avoid a repeal by implication.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Repeals by implication are rare, and properly so, given that we will presume under most circumstances that \u201cif the Legislature had intended to repeal a statute or statutory provision, it would have done so explicitly.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> They are even more unlikely in the realm of our state\u2019s taxation laws.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> This certainly creates a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>high bar, but we disagree with the dissent that we have made it absolute. Rather, by using the applicable canons of construction and faithfully applying our precedents in this area, we have arrived at a reasonable construction that harmonizes the BTA and the Compact.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The dissent agrees that \u201cevery attempt\u201d must be made to construe the BTA and the Compact harmoniously. But, in the end, the dissent fails to heed this call. Instead, because of its rigid focus on the mandatory language of the BTA \u2014 to the exclusion of the language and history of the Compact, and its place in Michigan\u2019s taxation scheme \u2014 the dissent\u2019s analysis is at odds with our longstanding implied-repeal jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">D. CONCLUSION AS TO THE ISSUE OF IMPLIED REPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In sum, because we are able to harmonize the BTA and the Compact\u2019s election provision, we conclude that the statutes are not \u201c \u2018so incompatible that both cannot stand.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We believe that our interpretation allows the Compact\u2019s election provision to serve its purpose of providing uniformity to multistate taxpayers in light of Michigan\u2019s enactment of an apportionment formula different from the Compact\u2019s formula. Any conflict apparent from a first reading of these statutes is reconcilable when the statutes are read <em>in pari materia.</em><footnotemark><em>66</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, the Department has failed to overcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the presumption against repeals by implication. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by holding that the Legislature repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA. Instead, we hold that the Compact\u2019s election provision was available to IBM for the 2008 tax year.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">V WHETHER THE MODIFIED GROSS RECEIPTS TAX IS AN INCOME TAX UNDER THE COMPACT</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Having determined that IBM could elect to use the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula for the 2008 tax year, we must next consider whether IBM could apportion its entire BTA tax base through the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula. IBM\u2019s 2008 BTA tax base contained two components: the business income tax base and the modified gross receipts tax (MGRT) base. The parties quarrel over whether both components may be apportioned under the Compact. The Compact election is available to \u201c[a]ny taxpayer subject to an income tax.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> While it is undisputed that the business income tax is an income tax, the Department argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>MGRT is not an income tax, but rather a gross receipts tax not subject to the Compact\u2019s election provision. Therefore, we must determine whether the MGRT is an income tax under the Compact and, thus, apportionable under the Compact\u2019s three-factor apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Compact defines \u201cincome tax\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">[A] tax imposed on or measured by net income including any tax imposed on or measured by an amount arrived at by deducting expenses from gross income, 1 or more forms of which expenses are not specifically and directly related to particular transactions.[<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Under the Compact\u2019s broad definition, a tax is an income tax if the tax measures net income by subtracting expenses from gross income, with at least one of the expense deductions not being specifically and directly related to a particular transaction.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\u201cModified gross receipts tax\u201d is not defined by the BTA, but MCL 208.1203(2) states, \u201c[The MGRT] levied and imposed under this section is upon the privilege of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>doing business and not upon income or property.\u201d Although this statement indicates that the MGRT is not a tax upon income under the BTA, we must still determine whether the MGRT fits under the broad definition of \u201cincome tax\u201d under the Compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The MGRT base is \u201ca taxpayer\u2019s gross receipts . . . less purchases from other firms . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The BTA defines \u201cgross receipts\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">the entire amount received by the taxpayer as determined by using the taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting used for federal income tax purposes, less any amount deducted as bad debt for federal income tax purposes that corresponds to items of gross receipts . .., from any activity whether in intrastate, interstate, or foreign commerce carried on for direct or indirect gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to others . .. .[<footnotemark>72</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Not only is the gross receipts amount reduced by numerous exclusions, it is also subject to a deduction for the \u201camount deducted as bad debt for federal income tax purposes that corresponds to items of gross receipts included in the modified gross receipts tax base.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> This total \u2014 the entire amount received by the taxpayer from any activity minus the bad-debt deduction and the numerous exclusions under MCL 208.1111 \u2014 is the gross receipts base from which the MGRT liability originates.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">After the taxpayer determines its gross receipts through the above calculation, the taxpayer then reduces the gross receipts base by \u201cpurchases from other firms.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The \u201cpurchases from other firms\u201d deductions include, among other things, \u201cinventory acquired dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ing the tax year, including freight, shipping, delivery, or engineering charges included in the original contract price\u201d; \u201cassets . . . acquired during the tax year of a type that are, or under the internal revenue code will become, eligible for depreciation, amortization, or accelerated capital cost recovery for federal income tax purposes\u201d; and materials and supplies to the extent not included in inventory or depreciable property.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> There are also deductions for compensation paid in certain industries and for payments to independent contractors.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Once gross receipts is reduced by any applicable deductions, the taxpayer arrives at its MGRT base, which is then subject to the MGRT at a rate of .80 percent after allocation or apportionment to this state.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Having examined how a taxpayer\u2019s MGRT base is calculated, we now turn to the question whether the MGRT fits within the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cincome tax.\u201d For the MGRT to be an income tax under the Compact, a tax must measure net income by starting with gross income and subtracting expenses, with at least one of the expense deductions not specifically and directly related to a particular transaction.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The Compact and the BTA do not define \u201cgross income.\u201d Therefore, we look elsewhere to determine what normally constitutes gross income. The Internal Revenue Code defines \u201cgross income\u201d as \u201call income from whatever source derived\u201d and includes a nonexclusive list of items that includes things such as \u201cgross income de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>rived from business\u201d and \u201cgains derived from dealings in property.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> 26 CFR \u00a7 1.61-1 provides that \u201c[g]ross income includes income realized in any form, whether in money, property, or services.\u201d 26 CFR \u00a7 1.61-3 fiirther provides that gross income for manufacturing, merchandising, or mining businesses is \u201cthe total sales, less the cost of goods sold, plus any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources.\u201d Moreover, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>states that gross income means \u201c[t]otal income from all sources before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">These definitions of gross income are similar to the definition of gross receipts under the BTA \u2014 the entire amount received by the taxpayer as determined from any gainful activity. Like gross income under the Internal Revenue Code, gross receipts are subject to myriad exclusions and deductions. Notably, gross receipts are subject to a reduction for the purchase of inventory during the tax year, including freight, shipping, delivery, or engineering charges included in the original contract price. This is similar to the IRS\u2019s definition of \u201cgross income\u201d for manufacturing, merchandising, or mining businesses\u2014 total sales less the cost of goods sold.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> In addition, several of these exclusions or deductions are not specifically and directly related to particular transactions.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Depreciable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>assets can be assets used over a certain number of years and, thus, not related to a single transaction.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Materials and supplies purchased during a tax year can be used at any time for the operation of a business and for any amount of transactions. Finally, the purchase of inventory, which includes such things as goods held for resale or raw materials, some of which can stay in a taxpayer\u2019s warehouse for an indeterminate amount of time, can be an expense not specifically or directly related to a particular transaction.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">We hold that the MGRT fits within the broad definition of \u201cincome tax\u201d under the Compact by taxing a variation of net income \u2014 the entire amount received by the taxpayer as determined from any gainful activity minus inventory and certain other deductions that are expenses not specifically and directly related to a particular transaction. Therefore, IBM could elect to use the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula for that portion of its tax base subject to the MGRT for the 2008 tax year.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We conclude that Court of Appeals erred by holding that the BTA repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision by implication. Therefore, IBM could elect to use the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula during the 2008 tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>year. We further hold that IBM could use the Compact\u2019s apportionment formula to apportion its MGRT base under the BTA. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in favor of the Department, reverse the Court of Claims\u2019 order granting summary disposition in favor of the Department, and remand to the Court of Claims for entry of an order granting summary disposition in favor of IBM.</p>\n<judges id=\"b728-5\">CAVANAGH and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with VMANO, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\"> MCL 205.581 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\"> MCL 208.1101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> <em>IBM v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 20, 2012 (Docket No. 306618).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 3-4.

I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s holding that IBM was entitled to use the Compact\u2019s elective three-factor apportionment and allocation formula for its 2008 Michigan taxes. I also agree with both the lead opinion and the dissenting opinion that the tax bases at issue here are \u201cincome taxes\u201d within the meaning of the Compact. Whether the Legislature repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA is a very close question. I would not reach that question because the Legislature made clear that taxpayers are entitled to use the Compact\u2019s election provision for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Assuming that the Legislature impliedly repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision in 2008 by enacting the BTA, IBM could nonetheless avail itself of the Compact\u2019s election provision for tax years 2008 through 2010 because the Legislature, in 2011, clearly intended to provide multistate taxpayers the benefit of the Compact\u2019s election provision for these tax years. Specifically, on May 25, 2011, the Legislature necessarily <em>re-enacted </em>all the provisions of the Compact, and ordered that act to take immediate effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MCL 8.3u provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>[t]he provisions of any law or statute which is re-enacted, amended or revised, so far as they are the same as those of prior laws, shall be construed as a continuation of such laws and not as new enactments. If any provision of a law is repealed and in substance re-enacted, a reference in any other law to the repealed provision shall be deemed a reference to the re-enacted provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Pursuant to this provision, we must construe the Compact as though it had not been impliedly repealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">That said, the BTA\u2019s exclusive apportionment method remains in conflict with the election provision of the Compact. This conflict, in my view, is easily resolved because the Legislature in 2011 also expressly supplemented the Compact. This new provision is not \u201cthe same as those of prior laws\u201d and is a \u201cnew enactment,\u201d which expressly provides that a taxpayer could elect to apportion its income under article IV of the Compact</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">except that beginning January 1,2011 any taxpayer subject to the Michigan business tax act, 2007 PA 36, MCL 208.1101 to 208.1601,';br the income tax act of 1967, 1967 PA 281, MCL 206.1 to 206.697, shall, for purposes of that act, apportion and allocate in accordance with the provisions of that act and shall not apportion or allocate in accordance with article IY[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">There can be no dispute given this language that the Legislature specifically intended to retroactively repeal the Compact\u2019s election provision beginning January 1, 2011. Further, I conclude that this language contemplates that any taxpayer could avail itself of the Compact\u2019s election provision for tax years 2008 through 2010. This is because the Legislature, either under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>original enactment of the Compact<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (assuming the Legislature did not repeal the Compact\u2019s election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA) or under the above re-enactment and supplementation of the Compact<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (assuming the Legislature repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA), chose to commence its express repeal of the Compact\u2019s election provision on January 1, 2011, even though the conflict between the BTA and the Compact had existed from the 2008 tax year. Simply put, the contrapositive of the Compact\u2019s supplemental provision must mean that before January 1, 2011, a taxpayer could, \u201cfor purposes of that act [the ITA or the BTA], apportion and allocate in accordance with the provisions of [the ITA or the BTA] and [may] apportion or allocate in accordance with article IV\u201d of the Compact. This is, in my opinion, the most reasonable understanding of this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">In sum, the Legislature in 2011 <em>created </em>a window in which it intended the Compact\u2019s election provision to apply. In this case, IBM sought to \u201capportion and allocate\u201d its taxes under the BTA well before January 1, 2011, and therefore may apportion or allocate its taxes in accordance with article IV of the Compact. For this reason, I concur in the result reached in the lead opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> 2011 PA 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\"> See also 1A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (7th ed), Repeal and Reenactment, \u00a7 23:29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\"> 2011 PA 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\"> 1969 PA 343.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> 2011 PA 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b730-5\">McCORMACK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">odissenting). I respectfully dissent because I conclude that the Michigan Business Tax Act (BTA), MCL 208.1101 <em>et seq., </em>requires taxpayers to apportion their multistate income in accordance with the BTA\u2019s sales-only apportionment formula and without resort to the Multistate Tax Compact\u2019s election provision. I reach this result because the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>command \u2014 \u201ceach tax base established under this act <em>shall be apportioned in accordance with this chapter,\u201d </em>MCL 208.1301(1) (emphasis added) \u2014 is plain, unambiguous, and permits only one interpretation. Further, there is no constitutional barrier that prevents the Legislature from making the Compact\u2019s alternative election provision unavailable to taxpayers. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">I. AN IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT OF STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The threshold issue is, at its core, one of statutory interpretation. When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we give effect to its plain meaning. <em>Ter Beek v City of Wyoming, </em>495 Mich 1, 8; 846 NW2d 531 (2014). It is hard to imagine a more unambiguous command than the mandatory directive found in \u00a7 301 of the BTA: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this act, each tax base established under this act shall be apportioned in accordance with this chapter.\u201d MCL 208.1301(1). There is no \u201cotherwise provided\u201d exception in the BTA that would aid IBM in its attempt to avoid the statute\u2019s sales-only apportionment requirement. And, within Chapter 208 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, it is the BTA alone that provides the formula by which taxpayers are to apportion their multistate income. See MCL 208.1301(2); MCL 208.1303(1). Neither the Compact nor its apportionment provisions are referred to anywhere in the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">I share the lead opinion\u2019s view that we must make every attempt \u201cto construe statutes, claimed to be in conflict, harmoniously[.]\u201d <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>451 Mich 569, 577; 548 NW2d 900 (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When later enacted legislation irreconcilably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>conflicts with a prior act, however, \u201cthe last expression of the legislative will must control.\u201d <em>Jackson v Mich Corrections Comm, </em>313 Mich 352, 356; 21 NW2d 159 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Section 301(1) of the BTA directs that taxes established under the BTA be apportioned \u201cin accordance with this chapter.\u201d \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d requires taxpayers to use a sales-only apportionment formula.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3The Compact, however, provides that \u201c[a]ny taxpayer subject to an income tax[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]. . . may elect to apportion\u201d its income in accordance with the Compact\u2019s three-factor apportionment formula. MCL 205.581, Art III(l). Reading these provisions side by side, I see two, and only two, possible results: either taxes established under the BTA need not be apportioned \u201cin accordance with this chapter,\u201d as \u00a7 301 demands, or taxpayers may not elect to use the Compact formula to apportion tax bases established under the BTA. While I agree with the lead opinion that statutes that appear to be conflict should be read together and reconciled, if reasonably possible, <em>Rathbun v State of Michigan, </em>284 Mich 521, 544; 280 NW 35 (1938), I disagree that this is a case where reconciliation is possible. The differing opinions offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>by this Court here make the underlying conflict undeniably plain. The Compact and the BTA are irreconcilably in conflict; one statute \u2014 either the Compact or the BTA \u2014 must prevail over the other. And neither alternative is easily dismissed. Traditional rules of construction lead me to resolve the conflict in favor of the later enacted and more specific legislation. See <em>Kalamazoo v KTS Indus, Inc, </em>263 Mich App 23, 38-39; 687 NW2d 319 (2004) (resolving a direct conflict between two statutes in favor of the subsequently enacted legislation).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The lead opinion agrees that the plain language of \u00a7 301 is mandatory. But it asserts that \u00a7 301 can nevertheless be interpreted as permitting taxpayers to make the Compact election. I do not see how this interpretation of the BTA is reasonable. If a taxpayer can elect an alternative apportionment formula, then \u00a7 301 is in no sense <em>mandatory. </em>Quite the opposite: \u00a7 301\u2019s mandatory apportionment \u201cin accordance with this chapter\u201d becomes <em>optional. </em>By interpreting \u00a7 301 as permitting taxpayers to make the Compact election, the lead opinion has not, as it claims, settled on a harmonious construction of the BTA and the Compact. Rather, it has resolved the conflict in favor of the Compact, the <em>earlier </em>enacted statute. But our precedent is clear: when an irreconcilable conflict exists, as in this case, the later enacted legislation controls. <em>Jackson, </em>313 Mich at 356; see also <em>Washtenaw Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Pub Serv Comm, </em>349 Mich 663, 680; 85 NW2d 134 (1957). Because I am not convinced that the two statutes can be read harmoniously, I believe that, for tax years 2008 through 2010, the enactment of the BTA impliedly repealed the Compact\u2019s election provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The lead opinion tries to give some effect to \u00a7 301 by stating that a taxpayer \u201cmust use the apportionment formula set forth in\u201d the BTA if it does not make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Compact election. <em>Ante </em>at 658. This construction does not make \u00a7 301\u2019s mandatory directive \u201cmandatory\u201d at all. When a taxpayer is given a choice as to whether they will apportion their income in accordance with the BTA\u2019s sales-only formula, the number of alternative options \u2014 a single one, or more \u2014 is irrelevant. As long as an alternative option exists, the taxpayer may, not must, use the apportionment formula set forth in the BTA. And once the lead opinion\u2019s \u201cmandatory\u201d construction is revealed to be anything but that, I do not believe that the lead opinion has persuasively explained <em>why </em>the BTA did not impliedly amend or repeal the Compact\u2019s election provision. Rather, the lead opinion, relying on the fact that the Legislature has expressly repealed and amended tax statutes in the past, simply states that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature believed that the Compact\u2019s election provision no longer had a place in Michigan\u2019s tax system..., it could have taken the necessary action to eliminate the election provision.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 657. Because it did not, the lead opinion \u201cproceed[s] under the assumption that the Legislature intended for [the Compact\u2019s election provision] to remain in effect.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 657. This, of course, simply assumes the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that there was no repeal. Yes, repeals by implication are disfavored, and that the Legislature knows how to effect an express repeal is irrefutable. But by demanding that the Legislature take \u201cthe necessary action\u201d \u2014 i.e., <em>expressly </em>amend or repeal the Compact \u2014 the lead opinion has elevated the presumption against implied repeals into an absolute bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Having failed to adequately explain why the statutory language itself permits the result it reaches, the lead opinion anchors its analysis in a historical overview of business taxation in Michigan. While informative, I find this approach ultimately unpersuasive. The lead opinion argues that because the Compact was enacted at a time when Michigan law applied the same three-factor appor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>tionment formula as that provided in the Compact, the Legislature, in enacting it, must have anticipated the future enactment of a tax act requiring a different apportionment formula and intended for the Compact to prevail should a conflict arise. But even assuming that the lead opinion is correct, that interpretation reads into the Compact a policy choice by the <em>1970 </em>Legislature that the <em>2008 </em>Legislature was free to disagree with, either by enacting an income tax with a different, mandatory apportionment formula, as it did in 2008, or by repealing the election provision outright, as it did in 2011. See <em>Studier v Mich Pub Sch Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>472 Mich 642, 661; 698 NW2d 350 (2005) (\u201c[A] fundamental principle of the jurisprudence of both the United States and this state is that one legislature cannot bind the power of a successive legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The lead opinion underscores its error by attaching particular significance to 2011 PA 40, which expressly amended the Compact to make the election unavailable to BTA taxpayers beginning January 1, 2011. The effect of this amendment on tax years 2011 and beyond is plain to see, but whether the amendment lends force to IBM\u2019s position in <em>this </em>dispute is not. In enacting this amendment, the 2011 Legislature may have simply been acting expressly to confirm what the 2007 Legislature believed it had already done implicitly. And even if the 2011 Legislature was expressing its view that the BTA did not, in fact, repeal the election provision, this Court is not bound by the prior Legislature\u2019s construction of the earlier enactment. See <em>Robertson v Baxter, </em>57 Mich 127, 132; 23 NW 711 (1885) (\u201cLegislative construction of past legislation has no judicial force except for the future. But it is always entitled to be considered with some care, so far as it throws light on doubtful language, and for future cases it has authority.\u201d); <em>Frey v Mitchie, </em>68 Mich 323, 327; 36 NW 184 (1888) (\u201cIt is unnecessary to say more than that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>legislative interpretation of old laws has no judicial force. Whether right or wrong must be determined by the statutes themselves.\u201d). The question we must answer in this case concerns what the Legislature intended when it enacted the BTA \u2014 not what it intended when it enacted the Compact forty years earlier or amended it three years later. While in answering this question the 2011 amendment may be considered \u201cwith some care, so far as it throws light on doubtful language,\u201d <em>Baxter, </em>57 Mich at 132, that light does not shine on the lead opinion\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In my view the BTA made the Compact election unavailable. Because the statutes are irreconcilably in conflict, the latter, as the more specific and later enacted statute, must be given effect over the former. For this reason, I disagree with the lead opinion that the BTA\u2019s mandatory directive can be interpreted so as to allow BTA taxpayers to make the Compact election instead. As a result, I find it necessary to address IBM\u2019s argument that the Legislature was not constitutionally permitted to make the BTA\u2019s sales-only apportionment formula exclusive and mandatory without first repealing the Compact in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">II. THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT BARRED FROM UNILATERALLY AMENDING THE COMPACT</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">IBM asks this Court to invoke the authority of \u201ccompact law\u201d and hold that the Legislature, even had it intended to alter the Compact\u2019s election provision when it enacted the BTA, was prohibited from doing so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I would decline that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o State shall, without the Consent of Congress . . . enter into any Agreement of Compact with another State[.]\u201d US Const, art I, \u00a7 10, cl 3. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>US Steel Corp v Multistate Tax Comm, </em>434 US 452; 98 S Ct 799; 54 L Ed 2d 682 (1978), the clause is not to be read strictly, but only as requiring congressional consent for compacts that tend to increase the political power of the states in a way that \u201cmay encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Those compacts that receive congressional authorization <em>and </em>fall within the scope of the Compact Clause are treated as federal law. <em>Cuyler v Adams, </em>449 US 433, 440; 101 S Ct 703; 66 L Ed 2d 641 (1981). Compacts without congressional approval, however, are not transformed into federal law; thus their construction is a matter of state statutory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Notwithstanding the fact that the Multistate Tax Compact, as a compact without congressional approval, does not carry the supreme force of federal law, IBM believes that the Legislature could not impose an exclusive apportionment formula because the Compact supersedes conflicting state law in any event. This is contrary to our well-established rule that a statute can be amended, repealed, or superseded, in whole or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>part, expressly or impliedly, by a subsequently enacted statute. <em>LeRoux v Secretary of State, </em>465 Mich 594, 615; 640 NW2d 849 (2002) (\u201cAbsent the creation of contract rights, the later Legislature is free to amend or repeal existing statutory provisions.\u201d). The essence of IBM\u2019s argument is that because a compact is an agreement between Michigan and the other member states, it is not like any other state law subject to traditional principles of statutory construction, but rather it has some greater force and authority. As a result, any variation from the Compact\u2019s terms is strictly prohibited. In support of this proposition, IBM cites as persuasive authority <em>McComb v Wambaugh, </em>934 F2d 474, 479 (CA 3, 1991), and <em>CT Hellmuth &amp; Assoc, Inc v Washington Metro Area Transit Auth, </em>414 F Supp 408, 409 (D Md, 1976). Neither case, in my view, supports such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In <em>McComb, </em>the plaintiff, as guardian ad litem for a minor child, brought a suit against the city of Philadelphia and its employees under 42 USC 1983. The suit sought damages for injuries the child suffered as a result of parental abuse. Before he was injured the child was under the protective custody of a Virginia court. The Virginia court ordered that the child be returned to his parental home in Philadelphia, where the abuse occurred. Plaintiff argued that the Virginia court order, in conjunction with the Interstate Compact for Placement of Children (ICPC), a compact to which Pennsylvania and Virginia are parties that had not been congressionally approved, extended the jurisdiction of the Virginia court into Pennsylvania and thereby imposed a legal duty on the Philadelphia social workers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected this argument, ultimately concluding that the ICPC did not apply when a child is returned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>sending state to a natural parent residing in another state. <em>McComb, </em>934 F2d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">IBM cites the Third Circuit\u2019s discussion of the scope of the ICPC for its argument here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">Because Congressional consent was neither given nor required, the [ICPC] does not express federal law. Consequently, this Compact must be construed as state law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">Nevertheless, uniformity of interpretation is important in the construction of a Compact because in some contexts it is a contract between the participating states. <em>Having entered into a contract, a participant state may not unilaterally change its terms. A Compact also takes precedence over statutory law in member states. [McComb, </em>934 F2d at 479 (citations omitted; emphasis added).] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>when enacted, a compact constitutes not only law, but a contract which may not be amended, modified, or otherwise altered without the consent of all parties. It, therefore, appears settled that one party may not enact legislation which would impose burdens upon the compact absent the concurrence of the other signatories. <em>[CT Hellmuth, </em>414 F Supp at 409.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The <em>McComb </em>court did not cite any authority for the above emphasized rule \u2014 that compacts without congressional approval cannot be unilaterally amended and must take precedent over conflicting state law \u2014 and I have found none. Moreover, the unsupported statement contradicts the one that precedes it. Either the compact must be construed as state law or it must be construed as something with greater authority than state law, but the <em>McComb </em>court said both. Finally, this statement was dictum, because the court did not identify any potential conflict between the ICPC and Pennsylvania law and the court ultimately determined that the ICPC did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">In <em>CT Hellmuth, </em>the plaintiff sought to compel disclosure of documents under Maryland law. The defendant, an interstate agency formed by an interstate compact between Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, argued that its status as an interstate agency exempted it from the Maryland law. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court remarked that</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>CT Hellmuth </em>and the cases it relied upon, however, involved congressionally approved compacts, which, as explained, supersede subsequent state law by virtue of the Supremacy Clause. <em>Cuyler, </em>449 US at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">IBM\u2019s claim that the Compact trumps the BTA simply because of its status as a compact relies on the faulty premise that the distinction between compacts that have congressional approval and those that do not is unimportant, and that <em>all </em>compacts are immune to unilateral modification by their member states because \u201c[a] Compact. . . takes precedence over statutory law in member states.\u201d <em>McComb, </em>934 F2d at 479. This assumes too much. Any immunity, if it exists, is a result of a compact\u2019s dual nature as both state law and a contract among its member states. See <em>Green v Biddle, </em>21 US (8 Wheat) 1; 5 L Ed 547 (1832) (recognizing that an interstate compact can be a contract). As a result the Legislature is free to amend or repeal an existing statutory provision <em>as long as it does not impair a contractual obligation. LeRoux, </em>465 Mich at 615; see US Const, art I, \u00a7 10, cl 1; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10. In other words, the Legislature is prohibited from unilaterally amending the Compact only if that amendment impairs contractual obligations created by the Compact itself. When viewed as a matter of <em>contract </em>law, I believe that it was within the Legislature\u2019s power to require BTA taxpayers to apportion their multistate income solely in accordance with \u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>HI. UNILATERAL AMENDMENT OF MCL 205.581, ART 111(2) DOES NOT VIOLATE THE STATE OR FEDERAL CONTRACTS CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In evaluating whether \u00a7 301 of the BTA unconstitutionally impairs a contract, the threshold question is whether the Compact did, in fact, create a contractual relationship in the first instance. I do not believe that it did. Two factors weigh heavily in this conclusion. First, the member states\u2019 courses of conduct indicate that there is no contractual obligation to strictly adhere to Articles III and IV of the Compact. Second, the Compact is silent regarding a member state\u2019s authority to enact exclusive apportionment formulas that differ from the Compact\u2019s formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Starting with the obvious: taxpayers like IBM were <em>not </em>parties to the Compact. To the extent that the Compact can be viewed as a contract, it is an agreement between its member states, not between taxpayers and the states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Compact member states\u2019 courses of performance are critical to understanding the nature of the agreement. As the Supreme Court recently explained, a party\u2019s course of performance is \u201chighly significant\u201d evidence of the party\u2019s understanding of the Compact\u2019s terms. <em>Tarrant Regional Water Dist v Hermann, </em>569 US_; 133 S Ct 2120, 2135; 186 L Ed 2d 153 (2013) (citation and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, it is plain that the member states did <em>not </em>view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>strict adherence to Articles III and IV as a binding contractual obligation, as Compact members have deviated from the Compact\u2019s election provision and apportionment formula without objection from other members. Arkansas, for example, has retained the Compact\u2019s election provision but changed the Compact formula to place additional emphasis on the sales factor. Ark Code 26-5-101, Art IV(9). Nondeviating members have not pursued actions against those states that have deviated, and no member state has intervened on IBM\u2019s behalf in this case. Further, the Multistate Tax Commission \u2014 the organization charged with administering the Compact \u2014 has urged us to reject IBM\u2019s rigid interpretation of the Compact. These facts weigh heavily in favor of rejecting IBM\u2019s argument that the Compact creates a binding contractual obligation on its member states to refrain from amending the election provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Deference to principles of state sovereignty leads me to the same conclusion. As this Court explained in <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 661, there is a \u201cstrong presumption that statutes do not create contractual rights.\u201d This presumption is grounded in the principle that \u201csurrenders of legislative power are subject to strict limitations that have developed in order to protect the sovereign prerogatives of state governments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>IBM has not overcome this presumption here. The Compact\u2019s silence on the effect of a member state\u2019s ability to elect an exclusive apportionment formula indicates that Michigan did not contract away its right to do exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>that. <em>Id. </em>at 662. While it is true that the Compact does not expressly allow Michigan to adopt a different apportionment formula, neither does the Compact surrender the state\u2019s right to do so. When the state\u2019s sovereign power of taxation is implicated, as it is here, any uncertainty should be resolved in favor of concluding that the state did <em>not </em>cede that power. See <em>Tarrant, </em>133 S Ct at 2132 (recognizing that states \u201cdo not easily cede their sovereign powers\u201d). Admittedly, any sovereignty concerns are abated by the fact that a member state may withdraw from the Compact, unilaterally and without repercussion, at any time. MCL 205.581, Art X(2). But this withdrawal provision is equally strong evidence that the member states did not intend to be contractually bound, as it demonstrates the member states\u2019 desire to retain control over their sovereignty with respect to taxation. Moreover, if continued participation in the Compact is, essentially, completely voluntary, I fail to see how its terms can be construed as creating binding contractual obligations, especially in light of the presumption against such an interpretation. <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 661.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because the Legislature expressly provided that taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>established under the BTA \u201cshall be in accordance with\u201d the BTA\u2019s sales-only apportionment formula. Allowing taxpayers to apportion their multistate income in accordance with the Compact\u2019s formula violates this unambiguous directive. And because the state was not contractually obligated to allow taxpayers to make the Compact election, the BTA does not offend the state or federal constitutions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b744-6\">J. Young, C.J., and Kelly, J., concurred with McCormack,</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\"> The lead opinion implies that if the Compact is found to irreconcilably conflict with the BTA, the Compact, as the earlier enacted statute, will necessarily have been repealed by implication. Our caselaw does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>demand such a result. See <em>Metro Life Ins Co v Stoll, </em>276 Mich 637, 641; 268 NW 763 (1936) (\u201cIt is the rule that where two laws <em>in pari materia </em>are in irreconcilable conflict, the one last enacted will control or be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the prior statute.\u201d) In any event, regardless of whether the BTA impliedly repealed the Compact beginning January 1, 2008, the issue remains the same \u2014 whether the Compact election was available for tax years 2008 through 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\"> Taxpayers may petition the Treasury to use an alternative apportionment method if the apportionment provisions of the BTA \u201cdo not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this state!.]\u201d MCL 208.1309(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\"> I agree with the lead opinion that the tax bases at issue here are \u201cincome taxes\u201d within the meaning of the Compact.

The <em>Gillette </em>Court held that \u201cunder established compact law, the [Multistate Tax] Compact superseded subsequent conflicting state law. . . [and] the federal and state Constitutions prohibit states from passing laws that impair the obligations of contracts.\u201d <em>Gillette, </em>147 Cal Rptr 3d at 615. For the reasons stated herein, I believe that <em>Gillette </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\"> While the Treasury has not made the argument in its brief on appeal, it is not entirely clear to me why IBM has standing to enforce the Compact <em>as a contract, </em>given that IBM is neither a party to the Compact nor is it clear that they were intended as a third-party beneficiary. See <em>Schmalfeldt v North Pointe Ins Co, </em>469 Mich 422; 670 NW2d 651 (2003); MCL 600.1405. In any event, because I conclude that no such contractual relationship was formed, I find it unnecessary to address this issue <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\"> Michigan law recognizes a similar principle.

While I conclude that the Compact did not create a contractual obligation that precluded Michigan from unilaterally amending its election provision, it is important to note that the Supreme Court has since retreated from the \u201cany deviation\u201d standard it applied in <em>Green. </em>See <em>US Trust Co v New Jersey, </em>431 US 1, 21; 97 S Ct 1505; 52 L Ed 2d 92 (1977). Because IBM does not engage these post-Green developments, it has failed to explain how a constitutional violation arises under a modern analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
