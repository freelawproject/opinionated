Morrow (respondent) be suspended from office for 90 days without pay. Respondent has filed a petition requesting that this Court reject or modify that recommendation. After review of the entire record and due consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we agree with the JTC\u2019s conclusion that respondent committed judicial misconduct, but we are not persuaded that the recommended sanction is appropriate in this case. Instead, we hold that a 60-day suspension without pay is proportionate to the body of judicial misconduct established by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Respondent is a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court in Wayne County, Michigan. He is therefore subject to all the duties and responsibilities imposed on him by the canons of judicial conduct and the standards for discipline set forth in MCR 9.104 and MCR 9.205.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Before the formal complaint was filed in this case, respondent and the examiner entered into a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>agreement whereby the parties stipulated to a set of facts involving respondent\u2019s conduct in four criminal cases in which respondent was the presiding judge. As part of the agreement, respondent consented to be publicly censured. The JTC agreed that the stipulated facts established judicial misconduct and, over a two-member dissent, recommended that this Court impose the agreed-upon public censure. The dissenting JTC members would have recommended a 60- to 90-day suspension. This Court rejected the proposed public censure as too lenient in light of the facts presented and remanded for further proceedings while retaining jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the JTC reported that the parties were unable to reach a new settlement agreement. In response, this Court entered a confidential order stating that a 90-day suspension was an appropriate order of discipline and that such a sanction would enter unless respondent objected by withdrawing his consent to be disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Respondent withdrew his consent, and on March 7, 2013, the JTC filed Formal Complaint No. 92 against respondent. The complaint alleges 10 counts of judicial misconduct, all arising out of criminal cases in which respondent was the presiding judge. The facts of each count can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Count 1: In <em>People v Orlewicz, </em>Case No. 07-23972, respondent closed the courtroom to the public and the victim\u2019s family during a postconviction hearing without specifically stating the reasons for the closure or entering a written order as required by MCR 8.116(D). Respondent subsequently ordered his court reporter not to prepare transcripts of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">Count 2: In <em>People v Fletcher, </em>Case No. 08-10018, respondent failed to sentence a defendant convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, third offense, MCL 257.625, in accordance with the mandatory minimum of 30 days in jail as prescribed by MCL 257.625(9)(c)(\u00bf\u00bf), despite the prosecutor\u2019s bringing the relevant statute to his attention. Respondent later discharged the defendant from probation without the defendant\u2019s having served the mandatory 30 days in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">Count 3: In <em>People v Slone, </em>Case No. 09-29628, respondent sentenced the defendant to a prison term 18 months below the sentencing guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Count 4: In <em>People v McGee, </em>Case No. 05-8641, respondent refused the prosecutor\u2019s request to remand the defendant convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person under the age of 13 to jail awaiting sentencing as required by MCL 770.9b(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">Count 5: In <em>People v Wilder, </em>Case No. 09-3577, following the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, respondent dismissed the case <em>sua sponte </em>on the basis that a previous dismissal order was with prejudice. When the prosecutor informed him that his justification was contradicted by the record \u2014 in fact, the prior dismissal was without prejudice \u2014 respondent stated that the dismissal was \u201cconditional with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">Count 6: In <em>People v Jones, </em>Case No. 08-13361, respondent <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the case on the basis of unreliable information in a search warrant affidavit after directing the prosecution to produce all its search warrant records involving a particular confidential informant and was subsequently disqualified from the case by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">Count 7: In <em>People v Boismier, </em>Case No. 08-12562, respondent failed to place a sidebar conference on the record, failed to rule on the defendant\u2019s request for a curative instruction, and failed to follow instructions from the Court of Appeals to hold an evidentiary hearing on a contested legal issue, and his ruling on remand was not supported by the trial record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">Count 8: In <em>People v Redding, </em>Case No. 07-3989, at the beginning of a trial over which he was to preside, respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>dent left the bench, shook hands with the defendant, and gave a package of documents to defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">Count 9: In <em>People v Moore, </em>Case No. 06-3221, respondent <em>sua sponte </em>subpoenaed medical records of the defendant without the parties\u2019 knowledge or consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Count 10: In <em>People v Hill, </em>Case No. 09-18342-02, respondent personally retrieved an inmate from lockup, escorted him to his courtroom, and sentenced him without restraints or courtroom security personnel present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On March 15, 2013, this Court appointed the Honorable Edward Sosnik as master. In his report, the master found that a preponderance of the evidence established the factual basis for each of the allegations in the formal complaint. However, the master concluded that the facts constituted judicial misconduct in only two counts\u2014 Count 4 and Count 10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing argument on objections to the master\u2019s report, the JTC issued its decision and recommendation on December 9, 2013. A majority of the JTC disagreed in large part with the master\u2019s conclusions of law, concluding that the evidence established judicial misconduct in eight of the ten allegations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the basis of the disciplinary factors established in <em>In re </em>Brown,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the JTC recommended that respondent be suspended for 90 days without pay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Judicial tenure cases come to this Court on recommendation of the JTC, but the authority to discipline judicial officers rests solely in the Michigan Supreme Court.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review de novo the JTC\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation for discipline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The examiner has the burden to prove allegations of judicial misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">B. FACTUAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">After careful review of the factual record in this case, we agree with the master and the JTC that a preponderance of the evidence establishes the factual basis of the allegations in the formal complaint. We further agree that the record establishes that respondent committed the acts of judicial misconduct as set forth by the JTC majority, and we formally adopt its conclusions of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In our view, the totality of the evidence in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>paints a portrait of a judicial officer who was unable to \u201cseparate the authority of the judicial office he holds from his personal convictions[.]\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>Orlewicz, </em>respondent\u2019s perfunctory ruling closing the courtroom to the public and the victim\u2019s family without complying with the governing court rule impeded the proper administration of justice. And, in <em>Fletcher </em>and <em>McGee, </em>respondent\u2019s refusal to follow mandatory statutory language after the controlling authority was brought to his attention evinced a willful failure to observe the law, eroding the public\u2019s confidence in a fair and impartial judiciary. Similarly corrosive of the public\u2019s faith in our judicial system was respondent\u2019s disregard of a superior court order directing him to hold a hearing in <em>Boismier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In <em>Wilder, </em>respondent\u2019s recasting of a previous order dismissing a case without prejudice to somehow justify his <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of the case after it was reissued, despite the defendant\u2019s intention to plead guilty, degraded the integrity of the judicial process and the judiciary itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In <em>Moore, </em>respondent failed to recognize the limits of his adjudicative role when he subpoenaed the defendant\u2019s medical records without the parties\u2019 knowledge or consent at a point when the case could have gone to trial with him possibly as the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In <em>Hill, </em>respondent recklessly placed himself and others in his courtroom at risk of serious harm by personally bringing a defendant convicted of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>violent crimes from lockup and sentencing him without restraints or courtroom security present.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Finally, in <em>Redding, </em>respondent showed poor judgment by coming down from the bench at the start of trial to shake hands with a criminal defendant and deliver papers to his counsel. At a minimum, respondent\u2019s unexplained delivery of documents and peculiar greeting of a litigant under these circumstances created the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In sum, we agree with the JTC that respondent failed to adhere to the high standards of professional conduct that our Constitution, court rules, and canons of judicial conduct require of judicial officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Respondent claims his conduct should be immune from action by the JTC because he acted \u201cin good faith and with due diligence!.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Respondent misapprehends the meaning of \u201cgood faith.\u201d Acting in disregard of the law and the established limits of the judicial role to pursue a perceived notion of the higher good, as respondent did in this case, is not \u201cgood faith.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We do not share respondent\u2019s concern that our decision today spells the end of judicial independence. Rather, it reinforces the principle that, although judicial officers should strive to do justice, they must do so <em>under the law </em>and within the confines of their adjudicative role.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">C. PROPORTIONALITY OF RECOMMENDED SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The JTC recommends that this Court suspend respondent for 90 days without pay. The JTC arrived at this recommendation after finding that six of the seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Brown </em>factors militated in favor of a more serious sanction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to the JTC, the evidence revealed \u201ca pattern of willfully disregarding the law and proper legal procedures in the handling of cases.\u201d Not only did the conduct occur on the bench, but \u201c[m]uch of Respondent\u2019s misconduct was prejudicial to the actual administration of justice.\u201d When his conduct did not implicate the actual administration of justice, respondent at least created the appearance of impropriety. The JTC further determined that respondent\u2019s conduct was deliberate, rather than spontaneous, and that \u201c[a] judge [who] fails to follow the law necessarily undermines the ability of the justice system to reach just results.\u201d However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>JTC concluded that none of respondent\u2019s conduct involved the unequal application of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">This Court gives considerable deference to the JTC\u2019s recommendations for sanctions, but our deference is not \u201ca matter of blind faith[.]\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, it \u201cis a function of the JTC adequately articulating the bases for its findings and demonstrating that there is a reasonable relationship between such findings and the recommended discipline.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Several considerations in this case persuade us to deviate downward from the JTC\u2019s recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">This Court\u2019s overriding duty in the area of judicial discipline proceedings is to treat \u201cequivalent cases in an equivalent manner and . . . unequivalent cases in a proportionate manner.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This duty necessarily requires this Court to make qualitative assessments of the nature of the misconduct at issue. In an attempt to fulfill our duty to treat JTC respondents equitably while maintaining predictability and consistency in our judicial discipline decisions, this Court articulated a set of disciplinary factors in <em>In re Brown.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But the <em>Brown </em>factors are intentionally nonexhaustive.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, other relevant considerations not expressly accounted for by the <em>Brown </em>factors may properly inform the disciplinary analysis.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> One principle that has guided this Court\u2019s disciplinary analysis, but which is not expressly ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>counted for by the <em>Brown </em>factors, is the principle that dishonest or selfish conduct warrants greater discipline than conduct lacking such characteristics. Generally speaking, we have imposed greater discipline for conduct involving exploitation of judicial office for personal gain.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This principle has also been long recognized in the related area of attorney discipline proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As established above, respondent\u2019s actions in the eight cases constitutes judicial misconduct subject to discipline by this Court, regardless of whether, as the master put it, \u201chis heart [was] in the right place.\u201d However, the fact that he did not seek to personally benefit from his misconduct is a relevant mitigating factor in determining the appropriate discipline.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>this respect, this case contrasts with two cases involving 90-day suspensions in which the respondents\u2019 misconduct included, among other things, use of their judicial office for personal gain.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In a disciplinary scheme that seeks to treat equivalent conduct equivalently and dissimilar conduct proportionately, the fact that we have imposed 90-day suspensions in cases involving conduct that typically warrants greater discipline is a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate sanction in this case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">A second consideration persuading us to deviate from the recommended 90-day suspension is our assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of the JTC\u2019s analysis of the first <em>Brown </em>factor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under the first <em>Brown </em>factor, the JTC determined that respondent engaged in \u201ca pattern of willfully disregarding the law and proper legal procedures in the handling of cases.\u201d Although we agree that some of the counts show a pattern of willful disregard of controlling legal authority, we believe the JTC overstated the pattern in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Our review of the record reveals a pattern in <em>Orlewicz, Fletcher, McGee, </em>and <em>Boismier </em>\u2014 disregard of controlling authority, be it mandatory statutes or a superior court order. In each of these cases, respondent\u2019s decisions were controlled by unambiguous mandatory language, and in each case respondent defied the controlling authority. The rest of the cases, however, do not fit this pattern. Insofar as the remaining counts showed a \u201cdisregard[ for]. . . proper legal procedures,\u201d this \u201cpattern\u201d is so general that it could conceivably describe every instance of judicial misconduct on the bench, in which case the first <em>Brown </em>factor would be rendered meaningless. In cases like this, when the examiner alleges a collection of isolated incidents of misconduct, a more nuanced analysis is necessary to ensure that we treat \u201cequivalent cases in an equivalent manner and . .. unequivalent cases in a proportionate manner.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The remaining counts of <em>misconduct </em>\u2014 Wilder, <em>Red-ding, Moore, </em>and <em>Hill </em>\u2014 share nothing in common except for the fact that they constitute judicial misconduct. Although the number of instances of misconduct is an important consideration in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the appropriate sanction in judicial discipline cases, the first <em>Brown </em>factor focuses specifically on whether the respondent continued to engage in the same type of judicial misconduct, thereby signifying judicial conduct more harmful to the integrity of the judicial system. In none of the remaining counts did respondent repeat the same type of misconduct. The remaining counts are too unrelated \u2014 occurring in separate cases and involving different types of misconduct \u2014 to constitute a meaningful pattern for purposes of the first <em>Brown </em>factor. In sum, the JTC overstated the extent to which the first <em>Brown </em>factor weighed in favor of a harsher sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In determining the appropriate sanction in this case, we recognize that respondent\u2019s case is unlike any other case we have dealt with in recent years, which naturally makes it harder to identify an appropriate baseline on which to apply the <em>Brown </em>factors.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Many of respondent\u2019s acts of misconduct, taken alone, would probably warrant no more than a public censure. The other more serious instances of misconduct, taken alone, would likely merit a short suspension. However, when the allegations are aggregated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>and the body of misconduct is considered as a whole, a greater sanction is necessary to protect the integrity of the judiciary as an institution.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Mindful that the <em>Brown </em>factors weigh in favor of a more serious sanction \u2014 though not as heavily as the JTC\u2019s analysis implies \u2014 we conclude that a 60-day suspension is proper. In concluding that a deviation is warranted in this case, we acknowledge that at a prior stage in these proceedings, this Court stated that a 90-day suspension was appropriate on the facts presented at the time. However, after careful study of the record subsequently developed in this case, and in light of our previous judicial discipline decisions, we conclude that when a judge commits a series of legal errors for which there can be no colorable good-faith excuse, a 60-day suspension is a sufficiently severe sanction to protect the integrity of the judiciary while also maintaining fidelity to the overarching principle that equivalent conduct be treated equivalently.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>hi. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Respondent\u2019s judicial misconduct requires that he be suspended in order to restore the public\u2019s faith and confidence in the judiciary. However, for the reasons stated above, we find that the recommended 90-day suspension is disproportionate to the judicial misconduct established on this record. We therefore modify the JTC\u2019s recommendation and order that Honorable Bruce U. Morrow, Judge of the 3rd Circuit Court, be suspended without pay from the performance of his judicial duties for a period of 60 days, effective 21 days from the issuance of this opinion. Pursuant to MCR 7.317(C)(3), the Clerk is directed to issue the judgment order forthwith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-6\">Markman, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"><em> In re Morrow, </em>493 Mich 878 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> According to the master, \u201c[Tjhere is a pattern in ... these cases, but not necessarily as described by the Examiner.

See <em>In re Ferrara, </em>458 Mich 350, 362; 582 NW2d 817 (1998). However, when determining the appropriate sanction for particular misconduct, the JTC (and this Court) may properly consider a respondent\u2019s subjective intent along with other mitigating and aggravating factors. See, e.g., <em>In re Tschirhart, </em>422 Mich 1207, 1209-1210 (1985) (recognizing that the respondent\u2019s subjective intent \u201cproperly receive[s] consideration\u201d); see also <em>Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1293 (stating that \u201cmisconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic background, gender, or religion\u201d warrants a more severe sanction).

Because the JTC provided no meaningful explanation for why a 90-day suspension is proportionate to respondent\u2019s misconduct, it is incumbent upon this Court to independently assess the misconduct in the context of our prior decisions and legal principles to determine a sanction proportionate to respondent\u2019s misconduct.

We caution, however, that our decision today should not be read as setting the upper limit for this type of misconduct should future cases present additional aggravating circumstances or lack the mitigating circumstance presented here. In the absence of predetermined sanction guidelines, this Court must qualitatively assess respondent\u2019s misconduct in the context of prior JTC cases to determine where the misconduct falls on the spectrum. Although the dissent would equate respondent\u2019s misconduct to criminal behavior like indecent exposure, this Court is persuaded that violation of the criminal law and using one\u2019s judicial office for personal gain are qualitatively more serious than the set of disparate incidents of misconduct in this case, many of which, taken alone, would probably warrant no more than a public censure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b368-7\">YOUNG, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASG\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>It is apparent that the majority believes the 90-day suspension recommended by the Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) is too harsh. The question I believe the majority opinion does not answer well is why the majority\u2019s 60-day suspension is <em>more </em>consistent with the nature of the judicial misconduct found in this case than the recommended sanction. More important, the majority opinion does not provide a sanctioning rationale that will aid the JTC and this Court to understand how this case can or should be applied in the next case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because I believe that the 90-day suspension recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>mended by the JTC most appropriately addresses the extent of Judge Morrow\u2019s documented misconduct, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The majority opinion correctly credits and accepts the factual findings of the JTC, and also correctly holds that respondent committed judicial misconduct in eight cases, consistent with the JTC\u2019s conclusions of law.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the majority unjustifiably, in my view, departs from the JTC\u2019s recommendation for a 90-day suspension, no doubt in part because both this Court and the JTC have not been as diligent as we should have been in setting forth a coherent theory of discipline. In the absence of such a theory, all involved \u2014 this Court, the JTC, and our judiciary \u2014 are left with no more guidance in any given case than some unarticulated sense of \u201crough justice\u201d by which to set a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In <em>In re </em>Brown,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court expressed concern that, in the absence of principles to evaluate the severity of judicial misconduct, our judicial disciplinary system was not adequately faithful to the rule of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To remedy this problem, we announced a series of standards to aid the JTC and this Court when evaluating judicial misconduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These principles have subsequently guided this Court\u2019s evaluation of judicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">While <em>Brown </em>provides a rubric for evaluating the misconduct itself, it does not provide the same guidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>for the <em>amount of discipline </em>warranted in individual cases. Since <em>Brown, </em>we simply have not done an adequate job of making transparent a coherent theory of how much sanction to apply in cases where judicial misconduct has been determined. Similarly, despite our clear direction that it do so, the JTC has not developed standards to supplement the <em>Brown </em>factors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Other than the line we have drawn in cases where a judge has lied under oath,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> principled consistency in our disciplinary decisions is hard to find. The consequences of these failures are apparent in the majority opinion in this case, which picks an alternate amount of sanctioning time than that recommended by the JTC but cannot explain why it has determined that 60 days <em>is </em>appropriate, while 90 days is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The JTC, as an expert agency, is accorded deference with respect to both \u201cits findings of fact and its recommendations of sanction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, as is justified by the record, the Court rightfully deferred to the JTC\u2019s findings of fact. However, I believe the Court has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>adequately justified its downward \u201cdeviation\u201d from the JTC\u2019s recommended sanction of a 90-day suspension. The opinion picks two out of the five post <em>-Brown </em>decisions involving 90-day suspensions to establish a paradigm from which this case supposedly departs. The majority opinion claims that a chosen distinguishing characteristic that exists in those two cases, but not this one, is that the misconduct was for personal gain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the misconduct in this case was not for personal gain, the majority opinion finds it appropriate to deviate downward to account for the lack of this aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The first problem with this approach is that the two cases from which the opinion extracts this claimed aggravating factor bear no factual resemblance whatsoever to this case; extracting from the ether general principles from disparate cases does not lend credence to our guiding principle that, under the rule of law, \u201cequivalent misconduct should be treated equivalently.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It may be that, when a judge acts for personal gain in his judicial capacity, a 90-day suspension is warranted. Such a principle does nothing to explain why other kinds of misconduct do not also warrant a 90-day suspension, as this Court has obviously previously concluded.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And this is the missing link in the majority\u2019s explanation of why it has chosen a 60-day suspension in preference to the recommended 90-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Another difficulty with the opinion is that it simply fails to explain the significance of the three other post <em>-Brown </em>cases in which this Court has issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>90-day suspension, two of which involved operating a motor vehicle while impaired,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a third that involved a judge exposing himself to an undercover police officer while in a public restroom.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While in each of these five cases the Court meted out a 90-day suspension, that is the only thing they share in common. Contrary to the majority\u2019s selective reliance on them, I submit there is no archetypal \u201c90-day suspension\u201d principle that can be extracted from any of these five prior disparate instances. Our prior 90-day suspensions simply have resulted from a wide array of judicial misconduct. The sanctions imposed in these cases are not linked by any unifying theory of sanctioning. Thus, looking at the sanctions imposed constitutes no more than examining a scatterplot. The majority errs in selectively picking among these disparate cases and providing a post hoc rationale to develop a unifying theme to justify its rejection of the JTC recommendation. In imposing a 60-day sanction, the majority says little more than: \u201cThis case is not like the others.\u201d This is surely an accurate observation but not one that explains why that difference dictates a particular sanction. In short, I cannot see even a loose pattern linking together <em>any </em>of our previous 90-day suspension cases from which it can be said with candor that the judicial misconduct in <em>this case </em>warrants a lesser sanction or a \u201cdeparture\u201d from our other 90-day cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Moreover, the majority does not justify why it picked a 30-day downward deviation, as opposed to some other departure from the recommended sanction. In doing so, the majority fails to explain why a 60-day suspension is a <em>justified </em>sanction for the misconduct it has found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Judge Morrow to have committed. Thus, this case will provide as much Delphic guidance on sanctioning standards in future cases as have our previous cases. To be candid, the majority has provided nothing of value that this Court and the JTC can look to in the future as sanction guidance. That is a significant failure in its opinion, but the majority has the candor to acknowledge that it is offering no more than a \u201cone-off\u201d decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">TOWARD A THEORY OF SANCTIONING APPLICABLE IN LATER CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The <em>Brown </em>factors generally indicate that <em>judicial </em>misconduct \u2014 that performed in one\u2019s official capacity as a judge rather than misconduct performed by one who happens to be a judge \u2014 is worthy of more significant sanction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, judicial acts that affect the administration of justice are deemed far more invidious.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, when such misconduct is part of a pattern, <em>Brown </em>counsels that greater sanctions are warranted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> All of these factors are implicated in Judge Morrow\u2019s misconduct here and weigh heavily in my calculation about the proper sanction that should be applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Master benignly characterized Judge Morrow\u2019s repeated refusal to follow the law, concluding that Morrow refused to follow what he knew to be the law but that his \u201cheart was in the right place.\u201d There is a simple name for this kind of conduct: lawlessness. When citizens break the law \u2014 even for good-hearted reasons \u2014 we still call them criminals. When judges do so \u2014 and do so repeatedly \u2014 they fundamentally under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>mine confidence in our judicial system and, most significantly, give lie to the oath of office they swore to uphold. What can be worse to say of a judge than: \u201cHe refuses to follow the law\u201d?<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">I believe that the majority opinion fails to give sufficient weight to the fact that Judge Morrow has emphatically demonstrated on <em>eight separate occasions </em>that he believed himself to be above the law and was unwilling to be constrained by the law when he disagreed with it. We do not permit our citizens to be lawless and we cannot tolerate a judge, who has taken an oath to <em>uphold </em>the law, to disrespect the law as he applies it to those who come before him. New things are less acceptable than a judicial system that tolerates legal rogues who wear black robes \u2014 even good-hearted ones. Such a thing is incompatible with any notion of the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Accordingly, unlike the majority, I am prepared to lay down a marker to guide future judicial sanctions in like cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">When the record reflects that a judge has demonstrated a pattern of lawlessness in the discharge of his judicial duties (not mere mistakes in the application of the law), the sanction should presumptively be <em>no less than </em>a 90-day suspension without pay-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">This period \u2014 three months \u2014 is, in my mind, sufficiently long to forcefully bring to the attention of a judge, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>has failed to appreciate the significance of his oath of office, why he holds the privilege of this high office <em>and </em>the import of his oath.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Three months without pay is unquestionably a <em>serious </em>sanction that cannot be ignored or rationalized by a misbehaving judge. A sanction of three months without pay also sends a <em>far stronger </em>signal to the misbehaving judge and to the public that their Supreme Court understands that judges of Michigan are not held to a lesser standard than the very citizens who appear before such judges. Consequently, I would reserve a lesser sanction for cases that do not involve a repetitive pattern of judicial misconduct in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">For these reasons, on this record, I believe that the JTC\u2019s 90-day sanction recommendation was entirely justified. I do not believe that the majority opinion has articulated a justification why eight separate acts of judicial lawlessness affecting the administration of justice warrant only a 60-day suspension. Obviously, to the majority, a \u201cmere\u201d eight acts of judicial lawlessness is not sufficient to justify a three-month suspension. One wonders how many acts of in-courtroom misconduct the majority would tolerate before considering a more exacting sanction. In the next case, we will be sure to hear the defense in support of an even lesser sanction than the majority metes out here: \u201cBut my client only willfully refused to apply the law five times!\u201d What will be our response then?</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">While the cases of misconduct are obviously dissimilar, our varied sanctioning responses reveal that even our use of the <em>Brown </em>factors has not led to principled and consistent results or results that can be made to appear congruent case to case. To further illustrate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>majority\u2019s problem with congruence, compare this case to <em>In re Halloran, </em>in which a judge exposed himself to an undercover police officer in a public restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Judge Halloran received a 90-day suspension.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In this case, Judge Morrow committed misconduct <em>on the bench </em>no less than eight times, each time adversely affecting litigants in his court. For this misconduct, Judge Morrow receives a 60-day suspension. As stated, <em>Brown </em>instructs us that misconduct that is part of a pattern is more serious than isolated incidents, that misconduct on the bench is more serious than similar misconduct off the bench, and that conduct implicating the actual administration of justice or an appearance of impropriety is more serious than that which does not.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Judge Halloran broke the law. His conduct, as reprehensible as it might be, did not involve his <em>judicial </em>duties.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Judge Morrow\u2019s conduct, however, affected <em>eight </em>sets of litigants in the cases over which he presided. No crime committed by a judge is acceptable, but when the judge\u2019s misconduct occurs <em>in the courtroom </em>and adversely affects litigants, <em>that </em>conduct undermines the very foundation of the judiciary. It is for that reason that I believe that Judge Morrow ought to be sanctioned at least equivalently to judges who break the law. I submit that I have provided a rationale, consistent with <em>Brown, </em>that will provide a clear rule for future cases in which there is a pattern of misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>affecting the administration of justice. The majority ought to provide a similar rationale for its preferred sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Finally, the majority\u2019s result is particularly odd because the JTC actually recommended what this Court <em>unanimously </em>determined in a prior order: that a 90-day suspension would be an <em>appropriate </em>sanction. The JTC initially recommended public censure on the basis of four instances of misconduct.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In a confidential order entered on February 8, 2013, this Court concluded that the proposed public censure was insufficient for those four counts and determined that a 90-day suspension <em>was </em>appropriate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thereafter, the JTC discovered <em>four more </em>instances of misconduct and issued a new recommendation of a 90-day suspension, which is exactly what this Court stated was appropriate and which the majority has now rejected.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">If I were a member of the JTC, I certainly would be at a loss as to how to recommend an appropriate level of discipline after this Court simply changed its mind without explaining its reasons for doing so. Not only did the JTC\u2019s new findings <em>double </em>the number of cases of misconduct, I would submit that the newly discovered misconduct is, on balance, <em>more </em>troubling than the initial four cases that were subject to the censure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>agreement we rejected in our confidential order.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The JTC should be mystified that this Court gave conflicting signs <em>in the same case. </em>I am.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">I fully recognize the numerous and various forms judicial misconduct can take, and that comparing them is a difficult task. But this is no reason to avoid striving to standardize our system of judicial discipline. Recognizing that the universe of possible misconduct is broad calls this Court to work to establish consistent and transparent standards for establishing levels of sanctions. Without such guidance, this Court has failed to provide light and the JTC must act in the dark. No one wants to be sanctioned by criteria not announced in advance; the rule of law requires more.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Because the majority opinion provides unsatisfactory reasons to depart from the JTC\u2019s recommendation\u2014 and this Court\u2019s prior conclusion that a 90-day suspension was appropriate for only half the misconduct now before us \u2014 I respectfully dissent from this portion of the opinion. However, I join the majority\u2019s demand that the JTC actually undertake the task to create standards by which to assess judicial discipline in a manner consistent with the rule of law.

My concern is not with the seriousness or the sincerity of that effort but with the absence of a universalizable rationale that permits one to apply the rationale of this case to the next. This, unfortunately, has become an increasingly obvious failing of our JTC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>sanctioning jurisprudence \u2014 a shortcoming the majority opinion does little to address other than to acknowledge that we must do better \u2014 in a future case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> I join the majority in accepting the JTC\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> <em>In </em>re <em>Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\"> See <em>id. </em>at 1292-1293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> See <em>id. </em>at 1292 (\u201c[I]t is the burden of the JTC to persuade this Court that it is responding to equivalent cases in an equivalent manner....

Why is not entirely clear to me. But where, as here, in the discharge of his official judicial duties, Judge Morrow repeatedly refused to apply what he <em>knew </em>to be the law, I think no euphemism is appropriate. That is the <em>definition </em>of lawlessness, and we should not sugarcoat this simple fact when it is a judge engaged in disobeying the law rather than when a \u201cmere\u201d citizen does so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> Note, by contrast, judges are permitted vacation time approaching that of the sanction the majority opinion imposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> <em>Halloran, </em>466 Mich at 1219.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\"> 461 Mich at 1292-1293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> The other two post <em>-Brown </em>90-day cases in which the judges broke the law outside the courtroom, <em>In re Nebel, </em>485 Mich 1049 (2010), and <em>In re Steenland, </em>482 Mich 1230 (2008), involved drunken driving. It\u2019s hard to understand why a 90-day sanction for these out of court crimes is more worthy of a larger sanction than Judge Morrow\u2019s <em>repeated </em>misconduct <em>in the courtroom. </em>I offer a theory to rationalize our misconduct cases so that they can be used in the future. The majority does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> The four cases involving misconduct at this stage were <em>People v Orlewicz, People v Fletcher, People v Moore, </em>and <em>People v Hill.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> We stated: \u201cGiven the facts stated in the stipulation, the proposed discipline is insufficient.

What exactly is the majority\u2019s justification for delinking judicial \u201claw violations\u201d in determining that those unrelated to judicial duties are more worthy of sanction than those committed in the courtroom? I think the unspoken answer is that the majority does not believe that a judge\u2019s repeated willful refusal to obey and apply the law is really \u201cbreaking the law\u201d. Such conduct may not be criminal but it is inimical to the rule of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> The subsequently-uncovered misconduct included a second instance of ignoring plain statutory language and allowing a person convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct to remain out on bail pending sentence, see <em>People v McGee; </em>failing to hold a hearing with the parties present contrary to a Court of Appeals order, see <em>People v Boismier; sua sponte </em>dismissing a case despite a defendant\u2019s intention to plead guilty, see <em>People v Wilder, </em>and handing then-unidentified documents to a defendant whose trial he was about to preside over, <em>People v Redding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b378-6\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHjH\">(dissenting). Today, we must decide the proper sanction for respondent\u2019s judicial misconduct. However, this is not the first time we have considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>this issue. In 2012, the Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) and respondent entered a settlement agreement, and the JTC recommended that public censure was an appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. Despite the fact that this Court typically affords \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d to the JTC\u2019s recommendation, <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291, 1293 (2000), a majority of this Court rejected the JTC\u2019s recommendation of public censure and remanded to the JTC, <em>In re Morrow, </em>493 Mich 878 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In contrast, after reviewing the JTC\u2019s first recommendation, the settlement agreement, the standards set forth in <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich at 1292-1293, and the JTC\u2019s findings and conclusions, I concluded that public censure was appropriate. Accordingly, consistent with the deference we generally afford to the JTC\u2019s recommendations, I would have previously entered an order of public censure. <em>In re Morrow, </em>493 Mich at 878 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). I continue to disagree with this Court\u2019s prior decision to reject the JTC\u2019s first recommendation and, consistent with my past position, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to suspend respondent. Instead, I would publicly censure respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
