We hold that it does not. Instead, we hold that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the authority to impose only those costs that the Legislature has separately authorized by statute. Therefore, the circuit court erred when it relied on MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) as independent authority to impose $1,000 in \u201ccourt costs,\u201d and the Court of Appeals erred as well by affirming the imposition of such costs. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, vacate the portion of the circuit court\u2019s order imposing $1,000 in court costs, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">In March of 2011, defendant acquired the prescription drug Norco by presenting a forged prescription to a pharmacy. Defendant pleaded guilty in the Allegan County Circuit Court to obtaining a controlled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>stance by fraud in violation of MCL 333.7407(l)(c) and was sentenced to 12 to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, defendant was ordered to pay $130 for the crime victim\u2019s rights assessment, $68 in minimum state costs, and $1,000 in unspecified \u201ccourt costs.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant filed a motion to correct what he viewed as an invalid sentence, arguing that the circuit court should reduce or vacate the amount of court costs imposed to reflect the amount of actual costs incurred by the circuit court in connection with defendant\u2019s case. The circuit court denied this motion and held that the court costs were permissible under the \u201cgeneral taxing authority of MCL 769.1k and MCL 769.34(6).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">In light of <em>People v Sanders, </em>296 Mich App 710; 825 NW2d 87 (2012), the Court of Appeals then remanded to the circuit court to \u201cfactually establish the reasonable costs figure for felony cases in Allegan County Circuit Court.\u201d <em>People v Cunningham, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, issued October 2, 2012 (Docket No. 309277).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the ensuing hearing, the Circuit Court Administrator testified that the average cost per criminal case in the circuit court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>$1,238.48.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court found that a reasonable relationship existed between the court costs imposed and the actual court costs incurred in connection with defendant\u2019s conviction. Relying on <em>Sanders, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s order. <em>People v Cunningham (After Remand), </em>301 Mich App 218; 836 NW2d 232 (2013). One judge dissented on the grounds that courts may not include the general costs of maintaining the judicial branch of government in calculating such court costs. <em>Id. </em>at 222-225 (SHAPIRO, J., dissenting).

STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law that are reviewed de novo. <em>Martin v Beldean, </em>469 Mich 541, 546; 677 NW2d 312 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cThe right of the court to impose costs in a criminal case is statutory.\u201d <em>People v Wallace, </em>245 Mich 310, 313; 222 NW 698 (1929). Thus, courts may impose costs in criminal cases only where such costs are authorized by statute. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In a variety of circumstances, the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ture has chosen to provide courts with the authority to impose costs. For instance, with regard to certain offenses, courts may require criminal defendants to pay the \u201ccosts of prosecution.\u201d* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With regard to other offenses, courts may require criminal defendants to \u201creimburse the state or a local unit of government for expenses incurred in relation to that incident including but not limited to expenses for an emergency response and expenses for prosecuting the person.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MCL 769.1f(l). Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>gardless of the offense committed, when a criminal defendant is placed on probation, courts may require the probationer to pay \u201cexpenses specifically incurred in prosecuting the defendant or providing legal assistance to the defendant and supervision of the probationer.\u201d MCL 771.3(5). Additionally, when a criminal defendant receives a conditional sentence, courts may \u201corder the person to pay a fine, with or without the costs of prosecution.\u201d MCL 769.3(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In 1994, when the Legislature laid the foundation for the criminal sentencing guidelines, it amended the Code of Criminal Procedure to add MCL 769.34, which provides in pertinent part that when a criminal defendant is sentenced for an offense subject to the guidelines, \u201c[a]s part of the sentence, the court may order the defendant to pay any combination of a fine, costs, or applicable assessments,\u201d and \u201c[t]he court shall order payment of restitution as provided by law.\u201d MCL 769.34(6), as added by 1994 PA 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In 2005, the Legislature further amended the Code of Criminal Procedure to add the statute immediately at issue, MCL 769.1k, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">(1) If a defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or if the court determines after a hearing or trial that the defendant is guilty, both of the following apply at the time of the sentencing or at the time entry of judgment of guilt is deferred pursuant to statute or sentencing is delayed pursuant to statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">(a) The court shall impose the minimum state costs as set forth in section lj of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">(b) The court may impose any or all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(1) Any fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>(ii) Any cost in addition to the minimum state cost set forth in subdivision (a).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\"><em>(Hi) </em>The expenses of providing legal assistance to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\"><em>(iv) </em>Any assessment authorized by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">(o) Reimbursement under section If of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">(2) In addition to any fine, cost, or assessment imposed under subsection (1), the court may order the defendant to pay any additional costs incurred in compelling the defendant\u2019s appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">(3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply even if the defendant is placed on probation, probation is revoked, or the defendant is discharged from probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">(4) The court may require the defendant to pay any fine, cost, or assessment ordered to be paid under this section by wage assignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">(5) The court may provide for the amounts imposed under this section to be collected at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">(6) Except as otherwise provided by law, the court may apply payments received on behalf of a defendant that exceed the total of any fine, cost, fee, or other assessment imposed in the case to any fine, cost, fee, or assessment that the same defendant owes in any other case. [2005 PA 316, as amended by 2006 PA 655 (emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Thus, under MCL 769.1k(l), when a criminal defendant pleads guilty or <em>nolo contendere, </em>or is otherwise found guilty, courts may impose certain financial obligations at the time of sentencing, or earlier if sentencing is delayed or entry of judgment of guilt is deferred. Courts may impose these obligations even if the defendant is placed on probation, probation is revoked, or the defendant is discharged from probation. MCL 769.1k(3). Moreover, the amounts imposed under MCL 769.1k may be collected at any time. MCL 769.1k(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In this case, the statute under which defendant was convicted, MCL 333.7407, does not provide courts with the authority to impose costs.* 123***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the prosecutor argues that the $1,000 in court costs imposed by the circuit court were proper under MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii). In the prosecutor\u2019s view, MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost,\u201d <em>to wit, </em>any kind of cost that a court might incur. In defendant\u2019s view, however, MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) does not provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost,\u201d but merely allows courts to impose those costs that the Legislature has separately authorized by statute. Thus, the pertinent issue in this case concerns the extent to which MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) authorizes courts to impose costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In giving meaning to MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii), we examine the provision within the overall context of the statute \u201cso as to produce, if possible, a harmonious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>consistent enactment as a whole.\u201d <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182-183; 189 NW 221 (1922). This Court \u201cmust give effect to every word, phrase, and clause and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002). We also consider the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018placement and purpose in the statutory scheme,\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (citation omitted), and in interpreting related statutes, those <em>in pari materia, </em>we construe the statutes together \u201cso as to give the fullest effect to each provision,\u201d <em>Glover v Parole Bd, </em>460 Mich 511, 527; 596 NW2d 598 (1999), citing <em>Parks v DAIIE, </em>426 Mich 191, 199; 393 NW2d 833 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Although MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) allows courts to impose \u201cany cost in addition to the minimum state cost,\u201d this provision cannot be read in isolation, but instead must be read reasonably and in context. <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236-237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). When read \u201creasonably and in context,\u201d it is evident to us that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) does not provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d Rather, MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the authority to impose only those costs that the Legislature has separately authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">First, while MCL 769.1k allows courts to impose \u201cany cost in addition to the minimum state cost,\u201d it also authorizes courts to impose other costs, including \u201cthe expense of providing legal assistance to the defendant,\u201d MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(iii), and \u201cany additional costs incurred in compelling the defendant\u2019s appearance,\u201d MCL 769.1k(2). If, as the prosecutor argues, MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost,\u201d there would, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>have been no need for the Legislature to have particularly specified that courts may require individuals to pay for the latter costs. In other words, if MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost,\u201d the Legislature could simply have left it at that and conferred upon trial courts, as they saw fit to exercise it, broad discretion to require criminal defendants to pay costs. However, the fact that the Legislature proceeded beyond its reference to \u201cany cost\u201d to specify with particularity that courts may require criminal defendants to pay certain other costs suggests strongly that the Legislature did not intend MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) to provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Moreover, in addition to allowing courts to impose \u201cany cost in addition to the minimum state cost,\u201d MCL 769.1k also allows courts to order \u201creimbursement under [MCL 769.1f|.\u201d MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(u). Under MCL 769.If, courts may require defendants convicted of certain offenses \u201cto reimburse the state or a local unit of government for specific expenses incurred in relation to the incident including but not limited to expenses for an emergency response and expenses for prosecuting the person.\u201d MCL 769.1f(l) and (9). As detailed in MCL 769. If, the expenses for which reimbursement may be ordered include \u201cthe salaries, wages, or other compensation, including, but not limited to, overtime pay of prosecution personnel for time spent investigating and prosecuting the crime or crimes resulting in conviction.\u201d MCL 769.1f(2)(d). If MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provided courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost,\u201d there would have been no need for the Legislature to specify in MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(u) that a court may order \u201creimbursement under MCL 769.If,\u201d and thereby impose particular costs. That the Legislature included a specific provision authorizing reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>bursement under MCL 769.If further suggests that it did not intend MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) to provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">Second, at the time the Legislature enacted MCL 769.1k, numerous statutes provided courts with the authority to impose specific costs for certain offenses. See, e.g., footnote 5 of this opinion. Interpreting MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) as providing courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost\u201d would essentially render the cost provisions within those statutes nugatory, as courts could nonetheless impose \u201cany cost,\u201d regardless of whether the Legislature had particularly provided courts with the authority to impose specific costs for the relevant offense. In determining the proper meaning of MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii), it is our duty to harmonize and reconcile related statutes,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we decline to adopt an interpretation of MCL 769. lk( 1) (b) (\u00bf\u00bf) that would leave the cost provisions of other statutes without any practical or effective meaning. See <em>Koenig v South Haven, </em>460 Mich 667, 677, 597 NW2d 99 (1999) (\u201c[A] court\u2019s duty is to give meaning to all sections of a statute and to avoid, if at all possible, nullifying one by an overly broad interpretation of another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Moreover, after the Legislature enacted MCL 769.1k, it has <em>continued </em>to enact provisions providing courts with the authority to impose particular costs for certain offenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because we presume that the Legislature acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cwith a full knowledge of existing statutes,\u201d <em>In re Reynolds\u2019 Estate, </em>274 Mich 354, 362; 264 NW 399 (1936), we presume that the Legislature enacted these provisions with full knowledge of MCL 769.1k. The Legislature\u2019s decision to continue to enact provisions providing courts with authority to impose specific costs for certain offenses again suggests strongly that it did not intend MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) to provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d We again operate on the presumption that the Legislature did not intend to do a useless thing. <em>Klopfenstein v Rohlfing, </em>356 Mich 197, 202; 96 NW2d 782 (1959) (\u201c[I]t will not be presumed that the legislature intended to do a useless thing. . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">Third, if this Court were to hold that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost,\u201d a logical outgrowth of that holding would be that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(i) provides courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany fine.\u201d However, at the time the Legislature enacted MCL 769.1k, numerous statutes provided that certain offenses are punishable by a fine up to a specific amount, with such amounts widely differing. Interpreting MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(i) as providing courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany fine\u201d would also nullify the provisions within those statutes that expressly fix the amount of fines that courts may impose for certain offenses, as courts could impose \u201cany fine,\u201d presumably in any amount, and presumably without reference to the limitations that the Legislature has set forth in other statutes. Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>again, we do not believe that by enacting MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(i) the Legislature intended to leave the fine provisions of numerous statutes without practical meaning or effect. <em>Koenig, </em>460 Mich at 677.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, our belief that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(i) does not provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany fine\u201d suggests further that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) does not provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In light of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that MCL 769.1k (l)(b)(ii) does not provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d Instead, we hold that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) provides courts with the authority to impose only those costs that the Legislature has separately authorized by statute.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In other words, we find that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) seeks comprehensively to incorporate by reference the full realm of statutory costs available to Michigan courts in sentencing defendants, so that the Legislature need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>compendiously list each such cost in MCL 769.1k.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our understanding of MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii), we believe, accords respect to its language, to the language of other cost provisions within MCL 769.1k, and to the language of other statutes enacted by the Legislature conferring upon courts the authority to impose specific costs for certain offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s order imposing $1,000 in court costs, the Court of Appeals relied on <em>People v Sanders, </em>296 Mich App 710; 825 NW2d 87 (2012), and <em>People v Sanders (After Remand), </em>298 Mich App 105; 825 NW2d 376 (2012). However, in <em>Sanders, </em>the Court of Appeals assumed that MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) \u201cauthorizes the imposition of costs without any explicit limitation ____\u201d 296 Mich App at 712. As set forth in this opinion, we do not believe that the Legislature intended MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) to provide courts with the independent authority to impose \u201cany cost.\u201d Accordingly, we overrule <em>Sanders </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The circuit court erred when it relied on MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) as independent authority to impose $1,000 in court costs,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the Court of Appeals erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>as well by affirming the circuit court\u2019s imposition of such costs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, vacate the portion of the circuit court\u2019s order imposing $1,000 in court costs, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-3\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and VIVIANO, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-4\"> As more fully explained in this opinion, in imposing $1000 in what it deemed to he \u201ccourt costs,\u201d the circuit court relied on MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(zz), which speaks generally of <em>\u201cany cost </em>in addition to the minimum state cost.\u201d Thus, while the circuit court labeled the $1000 in costs that it imposed as \u201ccourt costs,\u201d this case more broadly concerns the meaning of the phrase \u201cany cost\u201d as it appears in MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(iz).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-5\"> In <em>Sanders, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \u201ca trial court may impose a <em>generally reasonable amount </em>of court costs under MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(zz) without the necessity of separately calculating the costs involved in the particular case . ...\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>296 Mich App at 715 (emphasis added).

Several statutes also provide that courts may require individuals \u201cto reimburse this state or a local unit of government of this state for expenses incurred in relation to the violation in the same manner that expenses may be ordered to be reimbursed under section If of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.1f.\u201d See MCL 750.145d (using the Internet or a computer in a prohibited manner); MCL 750.411s (posting a message through an electronic medium without consent); MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>750.462j (providing or obtaining the labor or services of another by force, fraud, or coercion); MCL 750.543x (violating the Michigan Anti-Terrorism Act); MCL 752.797 (accessing a computer with an intent to defraud); MCL 752.1084 (organized retail crime).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\"> MCL 333.7407 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">(1) A person shall not knowingly or intentionally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">(c) Acquire or obtain possession of a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">(2) A person shall not refuse or knowingly fail to make, keep, or furnish any record, notification, order form, statement, invoice, or other information required under this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">(3) A person who violates this section is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years, or a fine of not more than $30,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Thus, while MCL 333.7407 contemplates a sentence that may include imprisonment and/or a fine, it does not anywhere provide courts with the authority to impose costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\"> The purpose of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to \u201ccodify the laws relating to criminal procedure,\u201d Title, MCL 760.1 <em>et seq., </em>and we find it proper to read MCL 769.1k together with the substantive statutes that the Legislature has enacted that define crimes and prescribe fines and costs.

Rather, as with MCL 769.1k, MCL 769.34(6) allows courts to impose only those costs or fines that the Legislature has separately authorized by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> Given the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>cost,\u201d we believe that the Legislature intended MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) to incorporate by reference not only existing statutory provisions that provide courts with the authority to impose specific costs, but also <em>future </em>provisions that the Legislature might enact providing courts with the same authority, unless the Legislature states to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\"> Moreover, to the extent that other decisions of the Court of Appeals are consistent with <em>Sanders, </em>and inconsistent with this opinion, we overrule those decisions as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\"> Our holding today defines the extent to which MCL 769.1k(l)(b)(ii) <em>authorizes </em>courts to impose costs.
