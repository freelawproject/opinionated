We hold that the plain language of \u00a7 489 does not afford a claimant a right to a jury trial and, instead, expresses a legislative intent to have shareholder-oppression claims heard by a court of equity. We further hold that there is no constitutional right to a jury trial for claims brought under \u00a7 489. Finally, we hold that violations of a shareholder agreement may constitute evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>shareholder oppression pursuant to \u00a7 489(3). Because the trial court erred by submitting plaintiffs \u00a7 489 claim to the jury and allowing it to award an equitable remedy, the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of plaintiff. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, reverse the judgment of the trial court in favor of plaintiff, and remand the case to the trial court to determine whether, on the present record, sitting as a court of equity, it can make the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law under MCR 2.517(A) or whether a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Defendant Benjamin A. Taub founded Dataspace, Incorporated, in 1994. Dataspace is a technology consulting firm that focuses on constructing business intelligence and data warehouse systems. In 2002, Taub hired plaintiff, Rama Madugula, as vice president of sales and business development for Dataspace. Around this time, Dataspace also hired an individual named Andrew Flower.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taub was Dataspace\u2019s sole shareholder until 2004, when Madugula and Flower became part owners, with Madugula purchasing 29% of the outstanding shares and Flower purchasing 20%. The three shareholders entered into a stockholders\u2019 agreement on January 1, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to the agreement, Taub became president, secretary, and treasurer of Dataspace, while Madugula and Flower became vice presidents. The stockholders\u2019 agreement established a five-member board of directors and allowed Taub to elect three directors and Madugula and Flower to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>elect one director.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agreement also contained a supermajority provision, requiring approval by the holders of 70% of the outstanding corporate stock for material changes in the nature of the business, compensation for the shareholders, or methods of determining compensation for the shareholders.3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">After becoming a shareholder, Madugula continued to work for Dataspace, drawing a salary of about $150,000 a year. In 2007, Flower exercised his right under the buy-sell agreement and voluntarily withdrew from Dataspace. Taub and Madugula purchased Flower\u2019s shares, increasing Madugula\u2019s interest to about 36% of the shares. Around this time, with Dataspace allegedly struggling, Taub switched the focus of Dataspace to marketing a new product that it developed called JPAS, a software platform for jails. Madugula claims that the JPAS software was a major departure and a material change from Dataspace\u2019s prior software focus. Taub claims that it was simply an attempt to market the firm\u2019s existing jail consulting products to other counties. At the time, Madugula did not object to the new focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Thereafter, in August 2007, Taub terminated Madugula\u2019s employment with Dataspace. Because of his termination, Madugula no longer received a salary from Dataspace, but he maintained his board position and his interest in the company. As a shareholder, he continued to receive dividends from the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Madugula sued Taub and Dataspace, asserting the following six counts in the complaint: (1) shareholder oppression under \u00a7 489, (2) breach of the duty of good faith under MCL 450.1541a, (3) common-law fraud and misrepresentation, (4) exemplary damages, (5) an appointment of a receiver, and (6) an accounting of Dataspace. Madugula sought damages, the removal of Taub as a director of Dataspace, the appointment of a receiver to protect the value of his stock in Dataspace, an accounting of Dataspace, and all other relief that he was entitled to in equity or law. The circuit court granted summary disposition in favor of Taub and Dataspace, dismissing all counts against them except Madugula\u2019s claim of shareholder oppression under \u00a7 489 against Taub.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">In February 2010, Taub filed a motion in limine arguing, among other things, that Madugula did not have a right to a jury trial for his \u00a7 489 claim. In support of the motion, Taub relied on the language of \u00a7 489 and an unpublished Court of Appeals opinion, <em>Forsberg v Forsberg Flowers, Inc </em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After a hearing, the circuit court rejected Taub\u2019s reliance on <em>Forsberg </em>and denied his motion to have the \u00a7 489 claim heard in equity. The court also determined that Madugula could present evidence regarding breaches of the stockholders\u2019 agreement to establish his claim of oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">At trial, Madugula argued that Taub had terminated his employment with Dataspace and changed the material nature of the company without obtaining the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>quired 70 percent supermajority vote. Taub argued that his actions were in the best interests of the company and that Madugula could not establish any oppressive conduct by Taub. The jury determined that Taub had engaged in willfully unfair and oppressive conduct that substantially interfered with Madugula\u2019s interests as a shareholder. The jury awarded economic damages of $191,675 in favor of Madugula, and it further concluded that Taub had to buy Madugula\u2019s stock in Dataspace for $1.2 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court entered a judgment in Madugula\u2019s favor for these amounts, plus interest. Thereafter, Taub moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial or remittitur. In this motion, he argued that the case should have never gone before a jury because a \u00a7 489 claim is equitable in nature. The court denied Taub\u2019s motions, again determining that it was not bound by <em>Forsberg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Taub appealed to the Court of Appeals. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, the Court of Appeals considered whether Madugula had established shareholder oppression. After reviewing \u00a7 489, the lead opinion concluded that Taub\u2019s behavior was willfully unfair and oppressive because Madugula did not have an opportunity to vote on material changes to Dataspace or examine the corporate books.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also determined that there was further evidence of oppression because Taub had violated the supermajority provision in the stockholders\u2019 agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Noting that termination of employment might give rise to oppression under \u00a7 489(3), the lead opinion concluded that the termination of Madugula\u2019s services was evidence of oppression. It reasoned that Madugula\u2019s \u201ctermination disproportionately affected Madugula\u2019s interest as a shareholder because Madugula\u2019s compensation was reduced to zero and he was no longer involved in decisions on material issues such as the development of JPAS.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the lead opinion determined that the trial court had not abused its discretion by denying Taub\u2019s motion for a new trial based on his argument that he was entitled to a bench trial. It reasoned that Taub had failed \u201cto cite any binding precedent suggesting that the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue or its failure to follow an unpublished opinion constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Judge BORRELLO concurred. He agreed that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by trying the matter before a jury, but he would have adopted the reasoning of the partial concurrence/dissent in <em>Fors</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>berg.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Judge RONAYNE KRAUSE concurred in part and dissented in part. She concurred with the lead opinion\u2019s analysis of minority shareholder oppression and affirmance of the damages award. However, she would have remanded for a new trial on the equitable remedies, including the forced share buyout, because she believed that the equitable remedies should be determined by a bench trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\">Taub then sought leave to appeal in this Court. We granted Taub\u2019s application and asked the parties to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">(1) whether claims brought under MCL 450.1489 are equitable claims to be decided by a court of equity; (2) whether the provisions of a stockholders\u2019 agreement can create shareholder interests protected by MCL 450.1489; and (3) whether the plaintiffs interests as a shareholder were interfered with disproportionately by the actions of the defendant-appellant, where the plaintiff retained his corporate shares and his corporate directorship.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">This case involves questions of constitutional law, statutory interpretation, and contract interpretation, all of which are legal questions that we review de novo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">A. RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL FOR CLAIMS UNDER MCL 450.1489</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Whether \u00a7 489 claims are to be decided by a court of equity depends on whether a \u00a7 489 claimant has a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>to a jury trial. A right to a jury trial can exist either statutorily or constitutionally.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We must first review the plain language of the statute to determine whether the Legislature intended to provide a statutory right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If not, we must next consider whether a \u00a7 489 claimant nonetheless has a constitutional right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">1. STATUTORY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We first turn to the question of whether the Legislature intended to provide a statutory right to a jury trial in \u00a7 489. As with any statutory interpretation, our goal \u201c \u2018is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent, focusing first on the statute\u2019s plain language.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In so doing, we examine the statute as a whole, reading individual words and phrases in the context of the entire legislative scheme.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> When a statute\u2019s language is unambiguous, \u201cthe Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written. No further judicial construction is required or permitted.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Section 489, commonly known as the shareholder-oppression statute, allows for actions by minority shareholders in closely held corporations against directors or those in control of the corporation for acts that are illegal, fraudulent, or willfully unfair and oppressive to the corporation or the shareholder. Section 489 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">(1) A shareholder may bring an action in the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business or registered office of the corporation is located to establish that the acts of the directors or those in control of the corporation are illegal, fraudulent, or willfully unfair and oppressive to the corporation or to the shareholder. If the shareholder establishes grounds for relief, the circuit court may make an order or grant relief as it considers appropriate, including, without limitation, an order providing for any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">(a) The dissolution and liquidation of the assets and business of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">(b) The cancellation or alteration of a provision contained in the articles of incorporation, an amendment of the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">(c) The cancellation, alteration, or injunction against a resolution or other act of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">(d) The direction or prohibition of an act of the corporation or of shareholders, directors, officers, or other persons party to the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">(e) The purchase at fair value of the shares of a shareholder, either by the corporation or by the officers, directors, or other shareholders responsible for the wrongful acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-11\">(f) An award of damages to the corporation or a shareholder. An action seeking an award of damages must be commenced within 3 years after the cause of action under this section has accrued, or within 2 years after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>shareholder discovers or reasonably should have discovered the cause of action under this section, whichever occurs first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-3\">(3) As used in this section, \u201cwillfully unfair and oppressive conduct\u201d means a continuing course of conduct or a significant action or series of actions that substantially interferes with the interests of the shareholder as a shareholder. Willfully unfair and oppressive conduct may include the termination of employment or limitations on employment benefits to the extent that the actions interfere with distributions or other shareholder interests disproportionately as to the affected shareholder. The term does not include conduct or actions that are permitted by an agreement, the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or a consistently applied written corporate policy or procedure.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Section 489 contains no express language granting the right to a jury trial and makes no mention of juries, which is a relevant consideration regarding the issue at hand. However, the Legislature\u2019s failure to explicitly refer to a \u201cjury\u201d is not, in itself, dispositive. Rather, the statutory language must be examined as a whole to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Madugula argues that the Legislature intended to provide a statutory right to a jury trial for a claim under \u00a7 489, citing <em>Anzaldua v Band.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At issue in <em>Anzaldua </em>was whether there was a right to a jury trial in an action under the Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act (WPA), MCL 15.361 <em>et seq. </em>Like \u00a7 489, the WPA is silent about juries or any right thereto. The WPA provides in part, \u201cA person who alleges a violation of this act may bring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>civil action for appropriate injunctive relief, or actual damages, or both . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The WPA further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">A court, in rendering a judgment in an action brought pursuant to this act, shall order, as the court considers appropriate, reinstatement of the employee, the payment of back wages, full reinstatement of fringe benefits and seniority rights, actual damages, or any combination of these remedies. A court may also award the complainant all or a portion of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees and witness fees, if the court determines that the award is appropriate.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Focusing on whether a WPA claimant had a statutory right to a jury trial for a claim of actual damages, the <em>Anzaldua </em>Court first noted that the WPA\u2019s mere reference to a \u201ccourt\u201d rather than a \u201cjury\u201d was not controlling because it was necessary to examine what the WPA \u201cprovided that the \u2018court\u2019 should do\u201d with respect to that relief.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In undertaking this inquiry, the <em>Anzaldua </em>Court noted that the WPA expressly couched the court\u2019s authority to order relief in the \u201cprocedural step\u201d of \u201crendering a judgment,\u201d which is done on the basis of \u201cpreviously decided issues of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It explained that, while the language \u201crendering a judgment\u201d did not foreclose the court from determining an award of damages, it plainly contemplated that a jury, upon proper demand, could do the same.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The <em>Anzaldua </em>Court then recognized that damages are \u201ca legal, rather than an equitable, remedy, and legal issues are traditionally tried to a jury.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, when the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>expressly provides for that relief, it may intend that relief to carry with it a right to a jury trial as well.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Viewing the statutory language as a whole, the Court held that the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of an actual damages remedy in the statute was an indication that the Legislature intended not only to provide a damages remedy under that statute, but to attach a jury right to it as well.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The <em>Anzaldua </em>Court found further support for this conclusion in the history of the WPA and its language \u2014 namely, the fact that the Legislature imported the WPA\u2019s language directly from the Civil Rights Act, which had been recognized as providing a right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, the statutory right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>jury trial discussed in <em>Anzaldua </em>did not extend to claims for equitable relief under the WPA because, unlike the legal remedy of damages, a claimant seeking equitable relief has no traditional right to a jury trial on those issues.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">At issue in this case is whether the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the phrase \u201c[a]n award of damages\u201d indicates that it intended to provide a \u00a7 489 claimant seeking damages the right to a jury trial when the language of \u00a7 489 is read as a whole. We agree with <em>Anzaldua </em>that \u201cactual damages\u201d is a term of art and is generally considered a legal remedy that is traditionally tried by a jury.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, we recognize that the inclusion of a damages remedy in a statute, given the peculiar meaning it has acquired in our law, may be an indication that the Legislature intended to provide a right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, when we consider the damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>remedy under \u00a7 489(1) (f) as part of the statute as a whole,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to attach a statutory right to a jury trial to a claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Under \u00a7 489, once a shareholder establishes \u201cgrounds for relief\u201d \u2014 i.e., that oppression occurred\u2014 \u201cthe circuit court may make an order or grant relief as it considers appropriate,\u201d including an award of money damages.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In contrast to the WPA\u2019s focus on \u201crendering a judgment,\u201d this language emphasizes the court\u2019s affirmative authority to award relief and does not inherently contemplate another fact-finder whose determinations the court may be effectuating. Indeed, through the use of the word \u201cmay,\u201d the phrase \u201cas it considers appropriate,\u201d and, significantly, the statement that the court is \u201cwithout limitation\u201d with respect to determining the appropriate relief available,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the Legislature provided the circuit court wide discretion in deciding what relief, if any, should be awarded after shareholder oppression is established. As discussed at length below, such wide latitude to fashion relief is consistent with an action in equity.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> So too is the presence of damages within the nonexhaustive list of remedies enumerated in \u00a7 489, for while damages are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>generally considered legal relief awarded by a jury, a court of equity is likewise capable of awarding that relief.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In addition, while the <em>Anzaldua </em>Court concluded that the history of the WPA and its language supported the conclusion that the Legislature intended to provide a statutory right to a jury trial under the WPA,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> a review of the history of \u00a7 489 compels a different result. Section 489 is nearly identical in form to its predecessor, former MCL 450.1825 (\u00a7 825),<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> which was considered equitable in nature and was correspondingly tried to a court.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Like \u00a7 489, \u00a7 825 enumerated a nonexhaustive list of various forms of equitable relief that a court could award. Section 825, however, made no mention of damages. When, in 1989, the Legislature replaced \u00a7 825 with \u00a7 489, damages were added to the nonexhaustive list of relief specified in the statute. The Legislature, however, left intact the statutory language describing the court\u2019s authority to grant relief and provided no textual indication that, by choosing to clarify damages as being included among that relief, it intended to introduce a right to a jury into the statute as well. These circumstances fall well outside those present in <em>Anzaldua </em>and suggest the opposite result. Thus, unlike <em>Anzaldua, </em>a historical analysis of \u00a7 489 does not lead us to conclude that the Legislature intended to provide a right to a jury trial under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to provide a jury right for claims of share<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>holder oppression under \u00a7 489. The only indication comes from the mention in \u00a7 489(l)(f) of a damages remedy; proper scrutiny, however, does not bear out that suggestion and instead signals an intent to leave all claims of relief under \u00a7 489 with a court and not a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\">2. CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ATX\">a. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Having determined that the Legislature did not intend to create a right to a jury trial, we must next determine whether a constitutional right to a jury trial exists for claims under \u00a7 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Michigan\u2019s Constitution provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe right of trial by jury shall remain, but shall be waived in all civil cases unless demanded by one of the parties in the manner prescribed by law.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The intention of this provision is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">to preserve to parties the right to have their controversies tried by jury, in all cases where the right then existed ... and suitors can not constitutionally be deprived of this right except where, in civil cases, they voluntarily waive it by failing to demand it in some mode which the legislature shall prescribe.[<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Not only is the right to a jury trial \u201cpreserved in all cases where it existed prior to adoption of the Constitution,\u201d the constitutional guarantee also applies \u201cto cases arising under statutes enacted subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>adoption of the Constitution which are similar in character to cases in which the right to jury trial existed before the Constitution was adopted.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> However, we have also recognized in certain cases the right to trial by court. This Court has stated, \u201c \u2018[T]he distinctions between law and equity must continue to be recognized for the purpose of preserving constitutional rights to trial by jury in legal matters and <em>trial by court in equity matters\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Long ago, we recognized that \u201c[t]he right to have equity controversies dealt with by equitable methods is as sacred as the right of trial by jury.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> That is, \u201c[t]he cognizance of equitable questions belongs to the judiciary as a part of the judicial power, and under our Constitution must remain vested where it always has been vested heretofore.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\">To determine whether a constitutional right to a jury trial attaches to a claim brought under \u00a7 489, which was enacted after the 1963 Constitution, we must consider whether a \u00a7 489 claim is similar in character to a claim that afforded the right to a jury trial at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We focus on \u201cthe nature of the controversy between the parties . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> If the nature of the controversy would have been consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ered legal at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted, the right to a jury trial is preserved.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> However, if the nature of the controversy would have been considered equitable, then it must be heard before a court of equity.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In making this determination, we consider not only the nature of the underlying claim, but also the relief that the claimant seeks. Indeed, equity will not take \u201cjurisdiction of cases where a suitor has a full, complete, and adequate remedy at law, unless it is shown that there is some feature of the case peculiarly within the province of a court of equity.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must consider the relief sought as part of the nature of the claim to determine whether the claim would have been denominated equitable or legal at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In sum, our inquiry in this case is whether a claim similar to one under \u00a7 489 would have been considered legal or equitable in nature at the time that the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>b. THE UNDERLYING CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">A \u00a7 489 claim has similarities to two types of claims that existed before the adoption of the 1963 Constitution: shareholder derivative claims against the directors or those in control of the corporation and claims for corporate dissolution. We will discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">A \u00a7 489 claim allows a shareholder to bring suit against the directors or those in control of the corporation for fraud, illegality, or oppressive conduct. Shareholders have long been able to bring a similar claim for fraud, illegality, abuses of trust, and other oppressive conduct on the part of those in control of the corporation through a shareholder derivative action. Whereas a shareholder in a derivative action sues on behalf of the corporation, a shareholder bringing a \u00a7 489 claim may sue the directors directly or derivatively \u2014 i.e., on his or her own behalf or on behalf of the corporation. However, even when a shareholder brings a claim on his or her own behalf under \u00a7 489, the claim is often derivative in nature because the remedies sought affect the corporation.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Accordingly, a \u00a7 489 claim is similar in nature to a shareholder derivative claim, and we must determine whether such a claim would be denominated equitable or legal in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In <em>Miner v Belle Isle Ice Co, </em>this Court, considering a minority stockholder\u2019s action against the majority stockholder and the corporation, addressed the power of a court of equity to remedy the oppression of a minority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>shareholder.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> After concluding that the majority stockholder\u2019s actions harmed the minority stockholder, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">It cannot be denied that minority stockholders are bound hand and foot to the majority in all matters of legitimate administration of the corporate affairs; and the courts are powerless to redress many forms of oppression, practiced upon the minority under a guise of legal sanction, which fall short of actual fraud.[<footnotemark>59</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">However, because the majority shareholder\u2019s actions were a breach of trust, the Court recognized that the \u201c \u2018jurisdiction of a court of equity reaches such a case, to give such a remedy as its circumstances may require.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The <em>Miner </em>Court concluded, \u201c[A] court of equity will not so far tolerate such a manifest violation of the rules of natural justice as to deny him the relief to which his situation entitles him.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> It continued, \u201c[A] court of equity, under the circumstances of this case, in the exercise of its general equity jurisdiction, has the power to grant to this complainant ample relief, even to the dissolution of the trust relations.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Indeed, courts of equity have long heard shareholders\u2019 direct or derivative claims against the majority shareholders or directors for fraud, illegality, or other oppressive conduct.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Since <em>Miner, </em>this Court has continued to recognize a court of equity\u2019s power \u201cin case of fraud, abuse of trust, or misappropriation of corporate funds, at the instance of a single stockholder, to grant relief and compel a restitution.. . .\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Accordingly, a \u00a7 489 claim, insofar as it is similar to a shareholder derivative claim, would have been considered equitable in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">In addition, a \u00a7 489 claim is similar to a common-law claim for dissolution. At the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted, shareholders could bring a claim for dissolution of a corporation based on instances of fraud, illegality, or abuse of trust by other shareholders, or even deadlock between shareholders.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Historically, \u201c \u2018[t]he general rule . . . [was] that courts of equity have no power to wind up a corporation, in the absence of statutory authority.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> However, by 1963, Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cha[d] squarely aligned itself with those jurisdictions holding that a court of equity has inherent power to decree the dissolution of a corporation when a case for equitable relief is made out upon traditional equitable principles.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Thus, the nature of a \u00a7 489 claim\u2014 allowing a shareholder to seek dissolution if he or she can establish fraud, illegality, or oppressive conduct \u2014 is consistent with a common-law claim for dissolution, which was considered equitable in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Finally, claims similar to those under \u00a7 489, which may ultimately affect the shareholders and the corporation itself, typically involve difficult determinations of adequate relief. At the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted, it was recognized that \u201c[a] suit in equity ... is proper ... if there are circumstances of great complication or difficulty in the way of adequate relief at law.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> This is because \u201c[jjuries cannot devise specific remedies, or safely deal with complicated interests, or with relief given in successive stages, or adjusted to varying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> In this regard, this Court has recognized that \u201c[c]ourts of law are inadequate to protect the rights and interests of creditors and stockholders.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\">In sum, we conclude that a \u00a7 489 claim, given its similarities to equitable shareholder derivative claims and claims for dissolution, would have been denominated equitable in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">c. THE RELIEF SOUGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Having determined that the underlying claim of shareholder oppression would have been denominated equitable in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted, we must next consider the remedy sought by Madugula. From Madugula\u2019s complaint, it is unclear what remedies he sought specifically for his \u00a7 489 claim. However, by the time the trial began, Madugula was seeking a forced buyout of his stock and money damages under \u00a7 489(1) (e) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Despite Madugula\u2019s request for specific relief, the court was free under the language of the statute to grant relief as it considered appropriate, or none at all, even if he were to establish his claim of oppression.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The fact that the relief sought did not bind the court is consistent in nature with a claim before a court of equity because the remedies sought by a claimant do not bind a court of equity. That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">[t]he premises of a bill in equity \u2014 not its prayer \u2014 are determinative of the substance thereof, and this is but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>another way of saying that relief within scope of the bill is the final responsibility of the chancellor and that the prayer aids rather than dictates equity\u2019s decretal beneficence.[<footnotemark>73</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-3\">Furthermore, a claim for which the court has broad power to fashion relief as the circumstances require is consistent with an action in equity.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that a claim, like one under \u00a7 489, that allows the court to shape the remedy regardless of what a claimant seeks would have been considered equitable in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Moreover, the enumerated remedies available to the court in its discretion under \u00a7 489(1) (a) to (f) and, more specifically, those sought by Madugula in this case do not change our determination. As discussed previously, dissolution of the sort contemplated under \u00a7 489(1) (a) was awarded by courts of equity at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Moreover, \u00a7 489(l)(b) and (c) allow a court to cancel or alter corporate documents or resolutions; that relief is equitable in nature because \u201c[ejquity has jurisdiction where complete protection and relief requires the cancellation of written instruments, the rescission of a transaction, or other specific relief of equitable character.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Section 489(l)(d) allows a court to direct or prohibit an act of the corporation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>relevant persons. Section 489(l)(e) allows a court to compel the purchase at fair value of the shares of the shareholder. Although the final result of a forced buyout under \u00a7 489(1) (e) is a payment of money, the relief sought requires the court to compel a party to purchase shares.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Relief requiring a court to compel another to act, like that of \u00a7 489(l)(d) and (e), has long been considered equitable in nature.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Accordingly, the relief enumerated in \u00a7 489(1)(a) to (e) was within the province of a court of equity, not a court of law, at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Finally, the fact that \u00a7 489(l)(f) allows a court to award money damages, or the fact that Madugula sought damages in this action, does not change our conclusion regarding the equitable nature of a \u00a7 489 claim. We recognize that claims for money damages were generally considered legal in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> However, as noted above, these money damages are only one remedy available to a court in granting the relief it deems appropriate after a shareholder establishes a claim of oppression. This is consistent with actions that are equitable in nature because \u201c[a] court of equity may adapt its relief to the exigencies of the case, and, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>nothing more is required, may order a sum of money to be paid to the plaintiff, or give him a personal judgment therefor, to be enforced by execution.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Indeed, we have long recognized that a court sitting in equity could award damages when necessary.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Therefore, although we recognize that damages are generally a legal remedy, we conclude that the availability of money damages does not change the overall equitable nature of a \u00a7 489 claim. As previously discussed, our jurisprudence requires that the entire nature of the claim be considered, not just the relief sought, when determining whether there is a constitutional right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Giving the court the discretion to award money damages after a shareholder establishes a claim of oppression is wholly consistent with a court of equity\u2019s ability to adapt its relief to the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In sum, we hold that a \u00a7 489 claim would have been denominated equitable at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted. Therefore, no constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>a jury trial exists under \u00a7 489. Instead, a \u00a7 489 claim, in its entirety, must be tried before a court of equity.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">3. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In his complaint, Madugula demanded a jury trial. Through a motion in limine before trial, Taub argued that there was no right to a jury trial for Madugula\u2019s sole remaining claim under \u00a7 489 and requested that the claim be decided at a bench trial. The trial court denied Taub\u2019s motion. Thereafter, a jury heard Madugula\u2019s shareholder-oppression claim, and the trial court allowed the jury to consider whether damages or the equitable remedy of a forced stock buyout under \u00a7 489(l)(e) was proper. After the jury awarded both in favor of Madugula, the trial court entered a judgment reflecting the jury\u2019s verdict. After trial, Taub renewed his objection to the jury trial through a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The trial court abused its discretion by not granting Taub\u2019s motion for a new trial because Madugula did not have a right to a jury trial for his \u00a7 489 claim; instead, Taub had a right to have the controversy heard by a court of equity.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Because of the equitable nature of Madugula\u2019s claim, the case should have been tried at a bench trial. In addition, the trial court erred by allowing the jury to consider the purely equitable remedy of a forced buyout of stock. As we noted previously, \u201c|j]uries cannot devise specific remedies . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> That is, after Madugula established his claim for shareholder oppression, it was the job of the court sitting in equity to fashion an appropriate remedy under \u00a7 489, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>jury. Therefore, the trial court erred by allowing a jury trial on Madugula\u2019s \u00a7 489 claim.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We recognize that MCR 2.509(D) allows a court to use an advisory jury to determine issues of fact.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In fact, this Court has long recognized the use of advisory juries in equity settings.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> However, even when a court of equity uses an advisory jury to decide issues of fact, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>court must still state its own findings of the facts and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> That did not occur in this case. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court to determine whether, on the present record, it can make the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law under MCR 2.517(A) or whether a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">B. USE OF A SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT TO ESTABLISH SHAREHOLDER OPPRESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We are also asked to determine whether evidence of a breach of a shareholder agreement can be used to establish shareholder oppression under \u00a7 489. That is, we must determine whether a private contractual agreement (the stockholders\u2019 agreement in this case) can give rise to shareholder interests that are actionable under \u00a7 489 if violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Section 489(3) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">\u201c[Wlillfully unfair and oppressive conduct\u201d means a continuing course of conduct or a significant action or series of actions that substantially interferes with the interests of the shareholder as a shareholder. Willfully unfair and oppressive conduct may include the termination of employment or limitations on employment benefits to the extent that the actions interfere with distributions or other shareholder interests disproportionately as to the affected shareholder. The term does not include conduct or actions that are permitted by an agreement, the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or a consistently applied written corporate policy or procedure.[<footnotemark>90</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Vb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Notably, \u201cwillfully unfair and oppressive conduct\u201d occurs when the conduct \u201csubstantially interferes with the interests of the shareholder as a shareholder.\u201d The parties quarrel over what a shareholder\u2019s interests as a shareholder actually entail.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">This Court has never exhaustively listed the interests or rights that shareholders have as shareholders of a corporation. However, we have recognized that \u201c[t]he relation between a corporation and its stockholders is contractual in its nature\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> and that \u201c[t]he charter of a corporation is its constitution. It prescribes the duties of stockholders and directors within the limits of the charter in the exercise of the power conferred upon them.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Beyond a corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation, we may also consider a corporation\u2019s bylaws and the governing statutes to determine a shareholder\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Under the BCA, a shareholder is \u201ca person that holds units of proprietary interest in a corporation. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Through this interest in the corporation, a shareholder retains certain statutory rights that allow the shareholder to protect and gain from his or her interest as a shareholder, including, but not limited to, the right to vote, inspect the books, and receive distributions.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The BCA also allows shareholders to enter into voting agreements and shareholder agreements. Through a voting agreement, shareholders may agree to modify how the shares held by them are voted.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>shareholder agreement, shareholders are able to modify several of the statutory rights and interests.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> A shareholder agreement, if it complies with the requirements of MCL 450.1488, \u201cis effective among the shareholders and the corporation. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Thus, although the BCA provides specific rights and interests to a shareholder as a shareholder, shareholders are entitled to modify these rights and interests through shareholder agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In this case, Taub argues that the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that a breach of the contractual rights set forth in the stockholders\u2019 agreement could give rise to a statutory shareholder-oppression claim under \u00a7 489. However, Taub fails to recognize that several of the rights modified in the stockholders\u2019 agreement were Madugula\u2019s rights as a shareholder. Under the stockholders\u2019 agreement, the shareholders agreed to elect each other as the directors of the corporation, which is normally a right reserved to shareholders. The stockholders\u2019 agreement provided the shareholders with preemptive rights. It also modified the voting rights by instituting a 70 percent super-majority for certain corporate actions. Accordingly, as permitted under MCL 450.1461 and 450.1488, the shareholders entered into a stockholders\u2019 agreement that modified the shareholders\u2019 statutory rights and interests as shareholders. Because these modified rights and interests are statutorily effective among shareholders and the corporation, evidence of a breach of those rights or interests may be evidence of shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>oppression.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Thus, we agree with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it determined that a breach of the rights and interests contained in the stockholders\u2019 agreement could be evidence of shareholder oppression. However, it remains to the trial court to determine on remand whether and to what extent any breach of the stockholders\u2019 agreement evidences such oppression in this case.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">We hold that the language of MCL 450.1489 does not afford a claimant a right to a jury trial. Instead, the language indicates a legislative intent to have a \u00a7 489 claim heard by a court sitting in equity. We further hold that the Michigan Constitution does not afford a right to a jury trial for claims brought under \u00a7 489 because those claims would have been considered equitable in nature at the time the 1963 Constitution was adopted. Finally, we hold that violations of a shareholder agreement may constitute evidence of shareholder oppression pursuant to \u00a7 489(3). Because the trial court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>by submitting Madugula\u2019s \u00a7 489 claim to the jury and allowing it to award an equitable remedy, the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, reverse the judgment of the trial court in favor of Madugula, and remand the case to the trial court to determine whether, on the present record, sitting as a court of equity, it can make the requisite findings of fact and conclusions of law under MCR 2.517(A) or whether a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-5\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Kelly, Zahra, and MCCORMACK, JJ., concurred with VMANO, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Dataspace and Flower are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"> The shareholders also entered into a buy-sell agreement, which sets forth the procedures to be followed upon the death or permanent disability of a shareholder or the voluntary withdrawal by a shareholder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> Madugula elected himself as a member of the board of directors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\"> A supermajority was also necessary for the adoption of certain benefit or stock plans, a sale of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, the establishment of annual capital expense budgets or actual capital expenses exceeding $100,000 a year, and any other corporate action that would have a material adverse impact on the shareholders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\"> The court also granted Taub\u2019s motion for summary disposition as cross-plaintiff against Madugula on a claim that Madugula owed Taub money from a loan for the initial stock purchase. The court determined that Madugula owed Taub $107,892.34, but it denied Taub\u2019s request for the immediate release of those funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\"> <em>Forsberg v Forsberg Flowers, Inc, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 5, 2006 (Docket No. 263762).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\"> Although neither party raised the issue, there is a discrepancy in the jury\u2019s verdict with regard to the stock buyout. The verdict form required the jury to first answer whether there was willfully unfair and oppressive conduct by Taub against Madugula (Question No. 1) and then whether that conduct substantially interfered with Madugula\u2019s interest as a shareholder (Question No. 2). The jury answered yes to both questions. Because it answered yes to both, it was then required to answer Question No. 3: \u201cIs Plaintiff Rama Madugula entitled to economic damages?\u201d The jury answered yes and then awarded him damages totaling $191,675 (Question No. 4). At this point, the jury should have stopped because Question No. 5 read, \u201cIf your answer to Question No. 3 was \u2018NO\u2019, is Mr. Madugula entitled to have his stock purchased by Defendant Benjamin Taub?\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that the jury answered yes to Question No. 3, the jury continued on to award Madugula $1.2 million for the fair-value buyout of his stock (Question No. 6). Thus, by the terms of the verdict form, having already awarded economic damages under Question No. 3 and No. 4, the jury should not have considered Question No. 5 or No. 6.
