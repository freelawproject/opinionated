Upon remand, the matter is to be assigned to a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On February 10, 2011, defendant was a passenger in an automobile that was stopped by the police for a traffic violation. As defendant exited the vehicle, officers observed defendant drop a silver automatic handgun into the map pocket of the car door and quickly close the door.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After establishing that defendant did not possess a permit to carry a concealed weapon, he was arrested and subsequently charged with the crime of carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) in violation of MCL 750.227. Defendant, age 21 at the time, was a college student with no prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The prosecutor permitted defendant to plead guilty to the reduced charge of attempted CCW<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and recommended a probationary sentence. Defendant tendered his guilty plea on May 12, 2011. At sentencing, defense counsel urged the court to delay sentencing for one year, at which time defendant would be \u201cvery close to graduating from college\u201d and the prosecutor\u2019s office might change its mind and either dismiss the case entirely or permit defendant to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. The prosecutor objected to a delayed sentence and asked that defendant be sentenced to probation. The trial court expressed concern that defendant would \u201cend up with a felony,\u201d thus limiting his employment opportunities. The court asked the parties to file sentencing memoranda and return to court to discuss whether delayed sentencing would be appropriate. Expressing its unhappiness with the prosecutor\u2019s position, the court stated that it would consider \u201cthe delayed sentence with one day over a year; then [the court] would have lost jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The parties returned to court on June 17, 2011. Defense counsel requested that sentencing be delayed for one year under MCL 771.1 to give defendant the opportunity to show that he deserved \u201csignificant leniency\u201d from the court. The prosecutor continued to object to delayed sentencing, stating that the prosecutor\u2019s office did not intend to reduce the criminal charge any further. The trial court stated that it found it \u201cdisturbing]\u201d that the prosecutor opposed letting defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cgo a day over 365 days,\u201d which would allow defendant to \u201cend[] up with no record\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>because the court would \u201close jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court announced that it would exercise its discretion and delayed the imposition of defendant\u2019s sentence for one year. On the record, the trial court scheduled defendant\u2019s sentencing for June 15, 2012, which would have occurred within the one-year statutory period. However, consistent with statements the trial judge had made on the record that she desired to \u201close\u201d jurisdiction in the case, the order signed that day, as well as the entry in the Register of Actions, reflect that the court scheduled defendant\u2019s sentencing for June 18, 2012\u2014 precisely one year <em>and one day later.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">At sentencing, defense counsel reminded the judge that delayed sentencing was sought so that defendant could prove \u201che was worthy of a dismissal.\u201d Counsel noted that defendant had complied with all court conditions, paid all fines and costs, and would graduate from college. Abruptly interrupting defense counsel\u2019s colloquy, the trial court stated that defendant\u2019s sentencing was \u201cpast a year,\u201d meaning that the court had \u201clost jurisdiction.\u201d Over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, the trial court not only refused to sentence the defendant, it dismissed the case entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The prosecutor filed a delayed application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court had no legal authority to dismiss the case over the prosecution\u2019s objections, because MCL 771.1 did not permit dismissal of the case. The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>issued an order denying the delayed application for leave to appeal for lack of merit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The consequences, if any, for a trial court\u2019s failure to sentence a defendant within one year pursuant to MCL 771.1 is a question of statutory interpretation that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Court\u2019s primary responsibility in statutory interpretation is to determine and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The words of a statute are the most reliable indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent and should be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning and the context within which they are used in the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Once the Legislature\u2019s intent has been discerned, no further judicial construction is required or permitted, as the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning it plainly expressed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The statutory provision at issue in this case, MCL 771.1(2), is contained in Chapter XI of the Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Criminal Procedure, which concerns probation. The statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(2) In an action in which the court may place the defendant on probation, the court <em>may delay sentencing the defendant for not more than 1 year </em>to give the defendant an opportunity to prove to the court his or her eligibility for probation or other leniency compatible with the ends of justice and the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, such as participation in a drug treatment court.... When sentencing is delayed, the court shall enter an order stating the reason for the delay upon the court\u2019s records. <em>The delay in passing sentence does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to sentence the defendant at any time during the period of delay </em>[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The plain language of the statute permits a trial court to delay sentencing for up to one year for those defendants who are eligible for placement on probation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The purpose of delaying a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to this statutory provision is entirely for the benefit of the convicted defendant \u2014 it is to \u201cgive the defendant an opportunity to prove to the court\u201d that he is worthy of \u201cprobation or other leniency compatible with the ends of justice\u201d and rehabilitation. Read in its entirety, the statute provides a simple and straightforward time limit, indicating the maximum amount of time the court may delay sentencing in order to give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>defendant a chance to prove himself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statute also indicates that the imposition of a delayed sentence is not irrevocably binding upon the trial court, in that it does not \u201cdeprive the court of jurisdiction to sentence the defendant at any time during the period of delay.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In urging this Court to uphold the actions of the trial court, defendant relies on a series of Court of Appeals cases holding that an unexcused violation of the one-year limit contained in MCL 771.1(2) results in the trial court losing jurisdiction to <em>sentence </em>a defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, the action taken by the trial court in this case was not simply limited to abstaining from sentencing defendant Smith. There is simply no basis in our law for the trial court to do as it did in this case. Without citing a scintilla of legal authority, the trial court <em>dismissed </em>the case over the objection of the prosecutor. Aside from flagrantly ignoring contrary Court of Appeals precedent in entirely dismissing the case,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the trial court usurped the prosecutor\u2019s role in violation of the separation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>powers principles contained in our constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that the power to determine whether to charge a defendant and what charge should be brought is an executive power, which vests <em>exclusively </em>in the prosecutor.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The trial court had no legal basis to trump the prosecutor\u2019s charging decision, much less dismiss the case <em>after </em>the defendant had pleaded to the charge and had never sought to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Furthermore, in so far as the Court of Appeals cases relied upon by defendant have construed MCL 771.1(2) to preclude sentencing when there is a failure to impose a sentence within 365 days of the imposition of a delayed sentence, those cases have incorrectly interpreted the statute. Nothing in the language of the statute requires this, and the Legislature is certainly capable of explicitly divesting a court of jurisdiction had such a remedy been intended.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, the only mention of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the entire statutory provision simply clarifies that a court <em>retains </em>its ability to sentence a defendant at any time during the period of delay. The fact that the Legislature explicitly permits a court to sentence defendant at any time during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>period of delay simply does not create the affirmative pregnant underlying the rationale of the cases cited by defendant \u2014 namely, that the court is not permitted to sentence a defendant outside the period of delay. Thus, in the absence of a clear and unambiguous indication that the Legislature intended that a defendant avoid all punishment as a remedy for not being sentenced within one year when his sentence is delayed under MCL 771.1(2), we decline to impose such a remedy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> After the one-year statutory limitation elapses, sentencing may no longer be delayed for the purpose of permitting a defendant the opportunity to prove that he is worthy of leniency, and the judge is required to sentence defendant as provided by law. We overrule <em>People v McLott, People v Turner, People v Dubis, </em>and <em>People v Boynton </em>to the extent they hold that a court loses jurisdiction to sentence a defendant as a remedy for a violation of MCL 771.1(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">This is not to say, however, that there are no limitations on a trial court\u2019s ability to delay the imposition of a defendant\u2019s sentence. Longstanding Michigan law requires that a defendant be sentenced within a reasonably prompt time as part of defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated, a four-part balancing test is used that considers (1) the length of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and (4) prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Applying those factors to the facts of this case does not indicate that defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights were violated. Regarding the first factor, the length of the delay was a mere <em>one day </em>past the one-year limitation contained in MCL 771.1(2). Second, the reason for the delay, as can be inferred from the record before us, was a calculated effort by the trial court to circumvent the law<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and avoid the charging decision of the prosecutor in order to spare defendant the consequences of acquiring a criminal record. Third, defendant makes no claim, and the record does not reveal, any indication that defendant ever asserted his desire to be sentenced before the one-year period of delay had elapsed. Indeed, such an assertion would have been antithetical to defense counsel\u2019s stated goal of having the case dismissed. Lastly, defendant makes no claim that he has been prejudiced by the one-day delay in sentencing. In short, application of the relevant factors militates against the conclusion that defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Because the plain language of MCL 771.1(2) does not deprive a sentencing judge of jurisdiction if a defendant is not sentenced within one year after the imposition of a delayed sentence, we overrule the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>People v McLott, People v Turner, People v Dubis, </em>and <em>People v Boynton </em>to the extent they hold otherwise. We reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>case, reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction, and remand to the Wayne County Circuit Court for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Because the trial judge in this case demonstrated overt hostility to the prosecution of this case by manipulating the scheduling of sentencing in order to thwart the prosecutor\u2019s charging decision and by entirely dismissing the case, thereby exceeding even the scope of incorrectly decided Court of Appeals precedent, we remand for sentencing before a different judge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-6\">Markman, Kelly, Zahra, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ. concurred with YOU\u00d1G, C.J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b204-7\">CAVANAGH, J.
