If the officers fail to do so, any statements made by the suspect, including voluntary statements given by the suspect with full knowledge of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are rendered inadmissible. Because there is nothing in this state\u2019s Constitution to support that rule, we respectfully conclude that <em>Bender </em>was wrongly decided and that it must be overruled. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s suppression of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>incriminating statements made by defendant, which suppression was justified solely on the grounds of Bender, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Defendant George Tanner was arrested for murder and taken to jail on October 17, 2011. He was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and when police officers attempted to interview defendant at the jail, he invoked his right to counsel. As a result, the officers informed defendant that he would have to reinitiate contact if he subsequently changed his mind and wished to speak to them. The next day, while a psychologist employed by the jail to interview inmates was speaking with defendant, he said that he wanted to \u201cget something off his chest.\u201d The psychologist told defendant that he should not further discuss the case with her, that he might wish to speak to an attorney, and that she could make arrangements for him to speak to the police officers. Defendant again stated that he wanted to \u201cget things off his chest,\u201d so the psychologist told defendant that she would inform jail staff of his request. She then contacted the jail administrator and informed him that defendant wished to speak to police officers about his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The administrator spoke with defendant, told him that the psychologist had indicated that he wanted to \u201cget something off his chest,\u201d and inquired whether he still wished to speak to someone about his case. Defendant replied \u201cyes\u201d and asked if the administrator could obtain an attorney for him. The administrator responded that he could not, because this was not his role, but explained that he could contact the police officers who were handling the case. Defendant replied that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>would be fine, and the administrator contacted the officers. The administrator also called the prosecutor, who advised him that the court would appoint an attorney for defendant should he request one. The prosecutor apparently informed the court of defendant\u2019s request, as a result of which an attorney was sent to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">One of the police officers testified that he was contacted by the administrator and apprised that defendant might now be amenable to speaking with the officers. The police officer further testified that he confirmed with the administrator that defendant had not requested that an attorney be present during the interview, and that the administrator believed an attorney had been appointed merely as a contingency in the event defendant sought an attorney during the interview. Subsequently, both the police officers and an attorney appeared at the jail. Apparently unsure of his role, the attorney asked the officers and the administrator if they knew why he was there. The administrator responded and told him to wait in the jail lobby while he took the officers back to speak with defendant and determine his intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Defendant was again read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which he waived this time without requesting an attorney and without being made aware of the attorney\u2019s presence. The administrator then instructed the attorney that he could leave. Defendant shortly thereafter made incriminating statements concerning his involvement in the murder. He was eventually charged with open murder, MCL 750.316, and mutilation of a dead body, MCL 750.160. Defendant was bound over to circuit court following a preliminary examination. During this process, defense counsel filed a motion to suppress defendant\u2019s statement to the police, alleging that because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>had not been informed that an attorney had been appointed for him before his interrogation, his <em>Miranda </em>waiver was invalid under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bender. </em>A hearing was held on October 12, 2011, after which the trial court suppressed defendant\u2019s statement. The court determined that defendant had requested an attorney at his October 17, 2011 interrogation, but that he had affirmatively reinitiated contact with police officers on October 18, 2011, without reasserting his right to counsel. However, it also determined that defendant\u2019s statement required suppression under <em>Bender, </em>because the police officers had failed to inform him that an attorney was present at the jail and had established contact with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The prosecutor filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, which was denied for lack of merit, and he then filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court, requesting that <em>Bender </em>be reconsidered. We granted this application, <em>People v Tanner, </em>493 Mich 958 (2013), and heard oral argument on this case on November 6, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">This court \u201creview[s] a trial court\u2019s factual findings in a ruling on a motion to suppress for clear error. To the extent that a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress involves an interpretation of the law or the application of a constitutional standard to uncontested facts, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>People v Attebury, </em>463 Mich 662, 668; 624 NW2d 912 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">III. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d US Const, Am V See also Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17 (containing an identical Self-Incrimination Clause). This federal constitutional guarantee was made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Malloy v Hogan, </em>378 US 1, 3; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964). Prior to 1966, a suspect\u2019s confession was constitutionally admissible if a court determined that it was made \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite the apparent textual emphasis on the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s confession (\u201cno person shall be compelled\u201d), the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 444-445, 477-479; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), that the accused must be given a series of warnings before being subjected to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d in order to protect his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation is, in the words of the United States Supreme Court, a corollary of the right against compelled self-incrimination, because the presence of counsel at this stage affords a way to \u201cinsure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. See also <em>id. </em>at 470. If a suspect is not afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Miranda </em>warnings before custodial interrogation, \u201cno evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Once a suspect invokes his right to remain silent or requests counsel, police questioning must cease unless the suspect affirmatively reinitiates contact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 473-474. In <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477, 484-485; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981) (citations omitted), the United States Supreme Court created \u201cadditional safeguards\u201d for when the accused invokes his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. ... [H]aving expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, [an accused] is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">However, when a suspect has been afforded <em>Miranda </em>warnings and affirmatively waives his <em>Miranda </em>rights, subsequent incriminating statements may be used against him. <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 444, 479. A suspect\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights must be made \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444. The United States Supreme Court has articulated a two-part inquiry to determine whether a waiver is valid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">First, the relinquishment of the right must have been \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived. <em>[Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 421; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), citing <em>Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Under the Fifth Amendment construct set forth by the United States Supreme Court, the defendant in the instant case was afforded his <em>Miranda </em>rights by the police and invoked his right to counsel on October 17, 2011. Defendant then reinitiated contact with the police the next day when he indicated that he wanted to \u201cget something off his chest\u201d and speak with the officers. He was then afforded his <em>Miranda </em>rights a second time, and on this occasion waived those rights and chose not to reassert his right to counsel. During the following custodial interrogation by the police officers, defendant made an incriminating statement concerning his involvement in a murder. The only pertinent question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>then is whether defendant\u2019s lack of awareness of the appointed attorney\u2019s presence at the jail at the time of his <em>Miranda </em>waiver following his reinitiation of contact with the police calls into question the validity of that waiver, including the waiver of his right to counsel\u2014 rendering it something other than \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent\u201d \u2014 and thus requires suppression of any subsequent incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">A. <em>MORAN v BURBINE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The United States Supreme Court has addressed this question for purposes of the federal criminal justice system in <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), in which it held that the failure of police to inform a suspect of the efforts of an attorney to reach that suspect does <em>not </em>deprive the suspect of his right to counsel or otherwise invalidate the waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In <em>Moran, </em>the defendant confessed to the murder of a young woman after he had been informed of, and waived, his <em>Miranda </em>rights. While the defendant was in custody, his sister retained an attorney to represent him. The attorney then contacted the police and was assured that all questioning would cease until the next day. However, less than an hour later, the police resumed interrogation of the defendant, and he confessed soon thereafter. At no point during the interrogation did the defendant request an attorney, and at no point did the police inform him that an attorney had contacted them. Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress his confession on the basis that \u201cthe police\u2019s failure to inform him of the attorney\u2019s telephone call deprived him of information essential to his ability to knowingly waive his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421. However, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that he had received <em>Miranda </em>warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ings, and had \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his privilege against self-incrimination [and] his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. The defendant was subsequently convicted of murder. The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, and the federal district court denied his habeas corpus petition. The federal appellate court, however, reversed the conviction. On further appeal, the United States Supreme Court reinstated the defendant\u2019s conviction, asserting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">Events occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right. Under the analysis of the Court of Appeals, the same defendant, armed with the same information and confronted with precisely the same police conduct, would have knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights had a lawyer not telephoned the police station to inquire about his status. Nothing in any of our waiver decisions or in our understanding of the essential components of a valid waiver requires so incongruous a result. No doubt the additional information would have been useful to respondent; perhaps even it might have affected his decision to confess. But we have never read the Constitution to require that the police supply a suspect with a flow of information to help him calibrate his self-interest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights. Once it is determined that a suspect\u2019s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\u2019s intentions to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law. <em>[Id. </em>at 422-423 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Any culpability on the part of the police inherent in their failing to inform the defendant of the attorney\u2019s availability had no bearing on the validity of his <em>Miranda </em>waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>[Wjhether intentional or inadvertent, the state of mind of the police is irrelevant to the question of the intelligence and voluntariness of [the defendant\u2019s] election to abandon his rights. Although highly inappropriate, even deliberate deception of an attorney could not possibly affect a suspect\u2019s decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights unless he were at least aware of the incident. ... Granting that the \u201cdeliberate or reckless\u201d withholding of information is objectionable as a matter of ethics, such conduct is only relevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them. Because respondent\u2019s voluntary decision to speak was made with full awareness and comprehension of all the information <em>Miranda </em>requires the police to convey, the waivers were valid. <em>[Id. </em>at 423-424 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">A rule requiring a suspect to be kept apprised of an attorney\u2019s presence in order for his <em>Miranda </em>waiver to be valid would unsettle <em>Miranda's </em>balance between protection of a suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights and the maintenance of effective and legitimate law enforcement practices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">Because, as <em>Miranda </em>holds, full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process, a rule requiring the police to inform the suspect of an attorney\u2019s efforts to contact him contribute to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege only incidentally, if at all. This minimal benefit, however, would come at a substantial cost to society\u2019s legitimate and substantial interest in securing admissions of guilt. <em>[Id. </em>at 427.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\"><em>Moran </em>concluded that \u201cnothing disables the States from adopting different requirements of the conduct of its employees and officials as a matter of state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>B. <em>PEOPLE v BENDER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">This Court reached a different conclusion from that of <em>Moran </em>in <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich 594 (1996), holding that for a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver to be made \u201cknowingly and intelligently,\u201d police officers must promptly inform a suspect that an attorney is available when that attorney has made contact with them. In <em>Bender, </em>two defendants, Jamieson Bender and Scott Zeigler, were arrested for a series of thefts and taken into custody. An officer informed Bender\u2019s mother of his arrest. Subsequently, Bender\u2019s father called an attorney, who agreed to represent his son. When the attorney called the police and sought to speak with Bender, she was not permitted to do so. Defendant Ziegler\u2019s mother called an attorney, who instructed her go to the police station and tell her son not to speak with anyone before speaking with the attorney. Police also did not allow Ziegler\u2019s mother to see her son and communicate the attorney\u2019s message. Without informing the defendants of their attorneys\u2019 efforts to contact them, police read the defendants their <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendants waived these rights, and each offered incriminating statements concerning their involvement in the thefts. At no point did the defendants request an attorney or assert their rights either to remain silent or to have counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">This Court adopted a per se rule that a suspect who has an attorney waiting in the wings does not make a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights when the police have failed to inform him that an attorney has been made available to him and is at his disposal. <em>Id. </em>at 620 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). See also <em>id. </em>at 621 (opinion by BRICKLEY, C.J.). Although Justices LEVIN and MALLETT concurred with Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s lead opinion grounding the rule in Michigan\u2019s 1963 Constitution, the Court\u2019s holding was not ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>grounded upon constitutional principles. Rather, Chief Justice BRICKLEY concurred with the result reached in the lead opinion, but declined to rely upon its interpretation of the Constitution, instead declaring that the requirement that an accused must be informed of an attorney\u2019s efforts to contact him constituted, as did <em>Miranda </em>itself at the time, a \u201cprophylactic,\u201d or precautionary, rule. <em>Id. </em>at 620-621 (opinion by BRICKLEY, C.J.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Justices CAVANAGH, LEVIN, and MALLETT also joined Chief Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s concurrence, making it the operative opinion in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Justice BOYLE, joined by Justices Riley and Weaver, dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Although it did not provide the operative holding, the lead opinion grounded its reasoning upon independent state constitutional grounds, concluding, \u201cwe hold that, on the basis of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, neither defendant Bender nor defendant Zeigler made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights to remain silent and to counsel, because the police failed to so inform them [that attorneys had been retained and sought to contact them] before they confessed.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 614 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). Holding otherwise would \u201cencourage the police to do everything possible, short of a due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>violation, to prevent an attorney from contacting his client before or during interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615. To further sustain its conclusion, the lead opinion also noted that this Court has held that \u201cthe Michigan Constitution imposes a stricter requirement for a valid waiver of the rights to remain silent and to counsel than those imposed by the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, citing <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140, 147; 490 NW2d 351 (1992). The lead opinion declined to adopt a \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances test,\u201d because the \u201cinherently coercive nature of incommunicado interrogation requires a <em>per se </em>rule that can be implemented with ease and practicality to protect a suspect\u2019s rights to remain silent and to counsel.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 617 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In Chief Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s \u201cmajority opinion,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">[t]his case rather clearly implicated both the right to counsel (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20) and the right against self-incrimination (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17). I conclude that rather than interpreting these provisions, it would be more appropriate to approach the law enforcement practices that are at the core of this case in the same manner as the United States Supreme Court approached the constitutional interpretation task in <em>Miranda v Arizona; </em>namely, by announcing a prophylactic rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">The right to counsel and the right to be free of compulsory self-incrimination are part of the bedrock of constitutional civil liberties that have been zealously protected and in some cases expanded over the years. Given the focus and protection that these particular constitutional provisions have received, it is difficult to accept and constitutionally justify a rule of law that accepts that law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>investigators, as part of a custodial interrogation, can conceal from suspects that counsel has been made available to them and is at their disposal. If it is deemed to be important that the accused be informed that he is entitled to counsel, it is certainly important that he be informed that he has counsel. <em>[Id. </em>at 620-621 (opinion by BRICKLEY, C.J.) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Thus, the majority opinion, although referring to Michigan\u2019s Constitution for its \u201cimplications,\u201d declined nonetheless to interpret its provisions. Rather, it concluded that \u201cwe invite much mischief if we afford police officers \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\u2019 the discretion to decide when a suspect can and cannot see an attorney who has been retained for a suspect\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622, quoting <em>Girodenello v United States, </em>357 US 480, 486; 78 S Ct 1245; 2 L Ed 2d 1503 (1958). Instead, according to Chief Justice BRICKLEY, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>rule would ensure that the criminal justice system remained accusatorial and not inquisitorial in nature, because the \u201cgood will of state agents is often insufficient to guarantee a suspect\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 623 (opinion by BRICKLEY, C.J.).</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-5\">Justice BOYLE, joined by Justices RILEY and WEAVER, dissented:</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">[W]ithout a single foundation in the language, historical context, or the jurisprudence of this Court, a majority of the Court engrafts its own \u201cenlightened\u201d view of the Constitution of 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, on the citizens of the State of Michigan. With nothing more substantial than a disagreement with the United States Supreme Court as the basis for its conclusion, a majority of the Court ignores our obligation to \u00f1nd a principled basis for the creation of new rights and imposes a benefit on suspects that will eliminate voluntary and knowledgeable confessions from the arsenal of society\u2019s weapons against crime. <em>[Id. </em>at 624 (Boyle, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>According to the dissent in <em>Bender, </em>the guarantee against compelled self-incrimination found in Article 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution provides no greater protection than the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and there is no justification for an interpretation of Michigan\u2019s Constitution that affords protections differently than the federal Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 628-629. The <em>Bender </em>dissent concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">[i]n its haste to create a novel \u201cMiranda-like rightf],\u201d a majority of the Court blurs the distinction between the constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination and the <em>safeguards </em>\u2014 Miranda warnings \u2014 created to protect that right. In effect, a majority of the Court creates prophylactic rules to protect prophylactic rights. The argument seems to be that it is necessary to inform a suspect that an attorney is attempting to contact him, which, in turn, effectuates the suspect\u2019s right to counsel, which, in turn, effectuates a suspect\u2019s right to remain silent, which, in turn, effectuates a suspect\u2019s right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. Safeguards for safeguards is absurd and is not required by the Michigan Constitution, the federal constitution, or <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Given... that neither the Michigan nor the federal constitution require extension of the <em>Miranda </em>litany, the majority\u2019s only possible justification for requiring the police to inform a suspect that an attorney wishes to speak with him must be grounded on policy concerns, not constitutional mandates. But policy concerns also fail under proper analysis. <em>[Id. </em>at 644.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In sum, while <em>Bender </em>concluded that the failure of police officers to inform a suspect of an attorney\u2019s attempts to communicate with the suspect invalidates his <em>Miranda </em>waiver, there was no agreement as to whether Michigan\u2019s Constitution required that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The question presently before this Court is whether the rule of <em>Bender </em>should be maintained.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The first and most consequential inquiry in resolving this question must, of course, pertain to whether <em>Bender </em>was correctly decided. We conclude that it was not, concurring with the <em>Bender </em>dissent that the lead and majority opinions in that case engaged in an unfounded creation of \u201cconstitutional rights,\u201d given that the lead opinion failed to undertake a constitutional analysis sufficient to ground rights in our \u201corganic instrument of state government,\u201d <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744, 760; 506 NW2d 209 (1993), and the majority opinion failed even to consider that same \u201corganic instrument,\u201d instead relying on policy concerns and fears of law enforcement \u201cmischief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>A. THE <em>BENDER </em>RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The <em>Bender </em>majority cited no Michigan law to justify its creation of a state constitutional rule different from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s federal constitutional rule in <em>Moran, </em>ironically citing only several United States Supreme Court decisions at variance with <em>Moran. </em>Nonetheless, <em>Moran </em>rightly acknowledged, as it must, that its decision did not \u201cdisableG the States from adopting different requirements for the conduct of its employees and officials as a matter of state law.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 428.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the <em>Bender </em>majority neither analyzed nor compared and contrasted to its federal counterpart the text of Article 1, \u00a7 17; cited no Michigan caselaw contrary to <em>Moran-, </em>and most notably declined to ground its decision upon any interpretation of state constitutional provisions. At the same time nonetheless, the majority clearly sought to characterize its rule as being one of constitutional provenance.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Indeed, two years after <em>Bender, </em>in <em>People v Sexton, </em>458 Mich 43, 70-72; 580 NW2d 404 (1998), then Justice BRICKLEY explained in his dissenting statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">[w]hile the <em>Bender </em>rule is prophylactic in nature like <em>Miranda, </em>that fact does not detract from its constitutional underpinnings. Its very purpose is to protect a suspect\u2019s right to counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination. To deny the constitutional import of this rule is to ignore the plain language set forth in <em>Bender. </em>[Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Thus, the majority purported to articulate a state constitutional rule in <em>Bender, </em>prophylactic or otherwise, distinct from the federal constitutional rule in Moran,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> while apparently disclaiming all reliance on state constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">B. THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">To determine whether Michigan\u2019s Constitution supports <em>Bender, </em>we must construe our Constitution. It is \u201ca fundamental principle of constitutional construction that we determine the intent of the framers of the Constitution and of the people adopting it,\u201d <em>Holland v Heavlin, </em>299 Mich 465, 470; 300 NW 777 (1941), and we do this principally by examining its language. <em>Bond v Ann Arbor Sch Dist, </em>383 Mich 693, 699-700; 178 NW2d 484 (1970). And we must do this even in the face of existing decisions of this Court pertaining to the same subject because there is no other judicial body, state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>federal, that possesses the authority to correct misinterpretations of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201cIn interpreting our Constitution, we are not bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Constitution, even where the language is identical.\u201d <em>People v Goldston, </em>470 Mich 523, 534; 682 NW2d 479 (2004) (citation omitted). Rather, \u201c[this Court] must determine what law \u2018the people have made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c[W]e may not disregard the guarantees that our constitution confers on Michigan citizens merely because the United States Supreme Court has withdrawn or not extended such protection\u201d under the federal Constitution. <em>Sitz, </em>443 Mich at 759. As explained in <em>Sitz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">[T]he courts of this state should reject unprincipled creation of state constitutional rights that exceed their federal counterparts. On the other hand, our courts are not obligated to accept what we deem to be a major contraction of citizen protections under our constitution simply because the United States Supreme Court has chosen to do so. We are obligated to interpret our own organic instrument of government. <em>[Id. </em>at 763.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">While members of this Court take an oath to uphold the United States Constitution, we also take an oath to uphold the Michigan Constitution,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which is the enduring expression of the will of \u201cwe, the people\u201d of this state.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of these separate oaths of office, we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>not, and cannot, defer to the United States Supreme Court in giving meaning to the latter charter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, it is this Court\u2019s obligation to independently examine our state\u2019s Constitution to ascertain the intentions of those in whose name our Constitution was \u201cordain[ed] and established].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>text and history of Article 1, \u00a7 17, as well as this Court\u2019s precedents pertaining to this provision, in order to ascertain both whether <em>Bender </em>was correctly decided and whether there is persuasive force in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moran.* 1***5*****</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">1. CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u201cThe primary objective in interpreting a constitutional provision is to determine the text\u2019s original meaning to the ratifiers, the people, at the time of ratification.\u201d <em>Wayne Co v Hathcock, </em>471 Mich 445, 468; 684 NW2d 765 (2004). \u201cThe first rule a court should follow in ascertaining the meaning of words in a constitution is to give effect to the plain meaning of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>words as understood by the people who adopted it.\u201d <em>Bond, </em>383 Mich at 699. \u201cIn applying this principle of construction, the people are understood to have accepted the words employed in a constitutional provision in the sense most obvious to the common understanding and to have \u2018ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Nutt, </em>469 Mich 565, 573-574; 677 NW2d 1 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The text of Article 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution does not, in our judgment, provide for the rights articulated in <em>Bender, </em>when it states in the same words as the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution that \u201cno person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ascertaining the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of \u201ccompelled\u201d is of critical importance to our textual analysis, as we must determine precisely what type of protection the ratifiers intended to confer. The 1828 edition of <em>Webster\u2019s American Dictionary of the English Language </em>defined \u201ccompel\u201d as \u201c[t]o drive or urge with force, or irresistibly\u201d; \u201cto constrain\u201d; \u201cto oblige\u201d; or \u201cto necessitate, either by physical or moral force.\u201d At the time that our 1963 Constitution was ratified, the term \u201ccompel\u201d was commonly defined as \u201cto force by physical necessity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>evidential fact\u201d; \u201cto urge irresistibly by moral or social pressure\u201d; \u201cto domineer over so as to force compliance or submission\u201d; or \u201cto obtain by force, violence, or coercion.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1961). Thus, at the time of the ratification of Article 1, \u00a7 17, the word \u201ccompel\u201d referred to the use of coercion, violence, force, or pressure, all of which are relevant factors in assessing the genuine voluntariness of a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The remainder of the terms contained in Article 1, \u00a717 require no individual examination, as their plain meanings appear \u201cobvious to the common understanding.\u201d Accordingly, applying the definition of \u201ccompel\u201d to the remainder of the language of Article 1, \u00a7 17, we find that the compelled self-incrimination provision in its entirety can be understood to provide that \u201cno person shall be [coerced, forced, or pressured] in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d Given the provision\u2019s focus on a coercive custodial environment, Article 1, \u00a7 17 can be reasonably understood to protect a suspect from the use of his <em>involuntary </em>incriminating statements as evidence against him in a criminal case. Consequently, the text of Article 1, \u00a7 17 does not support <em>Bender, </em>which pertains not to the voluntariness of the confession itself, but to whether a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver has been made \u201cknowingly.\u201d That is, there was no dispute in <em>Bender </em>as to the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession, only as to whether his <em>Miranda </em>waiver could be made \u201cknowingly\u201d absent awareness of an attorney\u2019s efforts to contact him; the coercion or pressure contemplated by the text of Article 1, \u00a7 17, which relates to the <em>voluntariness </em>of a confession, was not implicated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>2. CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">When interpreting a constitutional provision, \u201cRegard must also be given to the circumstances leading to the adoption of the provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196, 209; 341 NW2d 439 (1983) (citation omitted). In determining the meaning of particular constitutional provisions to the ratifiers of the Constitution, this Court has noted that \u201cconstitutional convention debates and the address to the people, though not controlling, are relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The primary focus should be on \u201cany statements [the delegates] may have made that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>would have shed light on why they chose to employ the particular terms they used in drafting the provision to aid in discerning what the common understanding of those terms would have been when the provision was ratified by the people.\u201d <em>Studier v Mich Pub Sch Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>472 Mich 642, 656-657; 698 NW2d 350 (2005) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">However, the records pertaining to Article 1, \u00a7 17 provide few such clues. There appears to have been no debate on the provision when it was first incorporated. When the Constitution was ratified in 1908, the Self-Incrimination Clause remained unchanged from the 1850 version, and the accompanying Address to the People in 1908 stated simply, \u201c[n]o change from Sec. 32, Art. VI of the present constitution.\u201d Journal of the Constitutional Convention 1907-1908, p 1542. Although Article 1, \u00a7 17 was ratified in 1963, the only change was the addition of language that had no bearing on the Self-Incrimination Clause, and it was only the new language that was the subject of any convention debate or explication. 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 545-553; 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3364. We find nothing in the records of the constitutional conventions to suggest that Article 1, \u00a7 17 means anything different from what its text most reasonably expresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>3. CONSTITUTIONAL CASELAW</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Although the text of Article 1, \u00a7 17 has mirrored its federal counterpart since its incorporation, the conclusion does not follow that this Court has interpreted the provision identically to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fifth Amendment. Consequently, it is necessary to examine this Court\u2019s precedent to determine whether caselaw in any way supports or contradicts <em>Bender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Before <em>Bender, </em>this Court had previously addressed the effect of an attorney\u2019s attempts to contact a suspect on the admissibility of the suspect\u2019s confession in <em>People v Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich 680; 225 NW 501 (1929), and <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992), the latter cited in <em>Bender </em>and both cited by defendant in this case. However, neither opinion provides the foundation for <em>Bender\u2019s </em>proposition that Michigan courts have historically interpreted Michigan\u2019s compulsory self-incrimination provision to provide criminal suspects with greater protections than those afforded by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In <em>Cavanaugh, </em>the juvenile defendant was sentenced to prison for life for committing a rape in light of evidence that the victim identified his voice and given his alleged confession of guilt. The defendant testified at trial that the police had questioned him at night, that he had not been permitted to sleep, and that he asked for and was denied an attorney. An attorney who had been retained by the defendant\u2019s father came to the police station, but was refused access to the defendant until the attorney proceeded to the courthouse to obtain a writ of habeas corpus. It is unclear if the defendant was aware of the attorney\u2019s presence, but in any event, he admitted to committing the crime. At trial, the defendant repudiated this confession, claiming it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>been extorted by duress, brow-beating, intimidation, and by holding him incommunicado. The lower court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the defendant\u2019s proposed testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding his confession and did not permit the defendant to introduce evidence pertaining to his claim that police officers had held him incommunicado.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On appeal, this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the \u201c[djefendant had an undoubted right to lay before the jury his full claim of what the police said to him, and it was for the jury to say whether, under all the circumstances, the confession was voluntary.\u201d <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich at 686. This Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">[A] confession, extorted by mental disquietude, induced by unlawfully holding an accused incommunicable, is condemned by every principle of fairness, has all the evils of the old-time <em>letter de cachet, </em>is forbidden by the constitutional guaranty of due process of law, and inhibited by the right of an accused to have the assistance of counsel.... Holding an accused incommunicable to parents and counsel is a <em>subtle and insidious method of intimidating and cowing, </em>tends to render a prisoner plastic to police assertiveness and demands, and is a trial of mental endurance under unlawful pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">The defendant was held incommunicable. He could not send for or employ counsel. His father was refused right to see him. When an attorney, presumably employed by his father, appeared at the jail and asked to see defendant, he was refused the right to do so until the attorney started for the courthouse to get a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>In this State a parent may not be denied the right to see and have conversation with a child in jail and accused of crime. Neither may police, having custody of one accused of crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>deny an attorney, employed by or in behalf of a prisoner, the right to see and advise the accused. <em>[Id. </em>at 686, 688 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">This Court concluded that \u201c[w]hether defendant\u2019s call for father, mother, attorney, and priest did not make any difference upon the question of his alleged confession being voluntary was for the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-689. Consequently, defendant was entitled to a new trial, \u201cat which the most searching examination of all the circumstances surrounding his alleged confession will be permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Although <em>Cavanaugh, </em>like <em>Bender, </em>addressed the admissibility of a confession in a circumstance in which an attorney had been denied access to a person facing custodial interrogation, <em>Cavanaugh </em>is distinguishable from <em>Bender </em>in at least three significant ways, and cannot provide its foundation. First, whereas <em>Bender </em>pertained to whether the defendants\u2019 <em>waivers </em>of their <em>Miranda </em>rights were made \u201cknowingly,\u201d <em>Cavanaugh </em>pertained only to whether the defendant\u2019s <em>confession </em>was made voluntarily, as <em>Miranda </em>had not yet introduced into the Fifth Amendment analysis the rule that a defendant cannot be subject to custodial interrogation absent a \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent\u201d waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because there was no dispute in <em>Bender </em>regarding the voluntary nature of defendants\u2019 incriminating statements, <em>Cavanaugh\u2019s </em>analysis concerning voluntariness cannot provide support for <em>Bender. </em>Second, <em>Cavanaugh </em>appropriately considered multiple factors \u2014 only one of which was the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>officer\u2019s refusal to allow an attorney access to the defendant \u2014 in its \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis to assess whether the defendant\u2019s confession was made voluntarily, an analysis which at that time was the accepted mechanism for determining compliance with constitutional standards. However, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>rule, invalidating all \u201cunknowing\u201d <em>Miranda </em>waivers, is a per se rule that pertains to just a single factor. <em>Cavanaugh </em>cannot possibly support this per se rule, given that <em>Cavanaugh </em>provided no indication that this Court had ever determined that just one of its several factors \u2014 the police officer\u2019s refusal to allow the attorney to see the defendant \u2014 gave rise to an independent and per se constitutional right.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Third, in <em>Cavanaugh, </em>the juvenile defendant requested and was refused an attorney. This Court properly considered the defendant\u2019s rejected request for an attorney as one factor in its voluntariness analysis. In contrast, in <em>Bender, </em>the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>never requested an attorney before waiving their <em>Miranda </em>rights and providing incriminating statements.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendants perceived no rejected request that could act to create a coercive atmosphere and potentially call into question the voluntariness of their statements. Given these significant differences, <em>Cavanaugh </em>lends no support, we believe, to the notion that Michigan\u2019s Constitution supports the per se rule of <em>Bender</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In <em>Wright, </em>the defendant was arrested for murder, taken to the police station at around 5:00 a.m., and informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant ultimately offered an incriminating statement to police officers after being deprived of food, water, and a place to sleep for a total of eleven hours while awaiting questioning. Before the defendant made his statement, his family retained an attorney who made at least two trips to the police station, requesting to speak with the defendant. Police officers refused the attorney\u2019s request both times. The defendant ultimately gave a statement to the police without being informed of the attorney\u2019s efforts to reach him. Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress his statement. At the suppression hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the defendant had never expressly asked for an attorney. The trial court relied on <em>Moran, </em>reasoning that \u201calthough the police conduct was repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>hensible, the law did not require the suppression of defendant\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 145-146 (opinion by MALLETT, J.). The Court of Appeals affirmed, declining to impose more stringent standards on police conduct than the United States Supreme Court imposed in <em>Moran. </em>The defendant then appealed in this Court, and we granted leave to appeal to consider \u201cwhether a defendant has a right to know of his attorney\u2019s efforts to contact him\u201d and \u201cwhether the failure by police to provide a defendant with proper food, water, or opportunity to sleep, renders a defendant\u2019s statements involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In an opinion by Justice MALLETT, joined by Justice LEVIN, and separate opinions by Chief Justice CAVANAGH and Justice BRICKLEY, this Court suppressed the defendant\u2019s statements. The fragmented decision resulted in no binding precedent. In the lead opinion, Justice MALLET concluded that the confession had to be suppressed because a suspect must be informed of an attorney\u2019s in-person attempts to contact him, as Michigan\u2019s Constitution provides for such a right. <em>Id. </em>at 154-155. This opinion stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">[U]nder our state\u2019s laws, we conclude that [defendant] did not make a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights when the police, before he made a statement, refused to inform him that retained counsel tried or was currently trying to contact him. Without this knowledge, [the defendant] could not make a truly voluntary waiver of his essential rights. Given the opportunity to speak to a specific, retained and available attorney, [defendant\u2019s] decision may have been different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, a criminal suspect is given the right against self-incrimination, a right similar to that provided in the Fifth Amendment of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Constitution. This Court has held that the interpretation of our constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and that of the Fifth Amendment are the same. <em>In re Moser, </em>138 Mich 302, 305; 101 NW 588 (1904). However, as the United States Supreme Court concluded in <em>Moran, </em>states are free to adopt more protective standards under state law. Because we believe that it was necessary, in order to allow [defendant] to make a knowing and fully voluntary waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights, we extend the rights afforded under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, to include information of retained counsel\u2019s in-person efforts to contact a suspect. <em>[Id. </em>at 153-154 (citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In his separate concurrence, Chief Justice CAVANAGH agreed with Justice MALLETT\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statement had to be suppressed and with Justice MALLETT\u2019s analysis in interpreting Michigan\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination \u201cmore broadly\u201d than the Fifth Amendment. Chief Justice CAVANAGH wrote separately to emphasize that the \u201cconclusion is even more clearly supported on the ground that the police conduct in this case violated defendant\u2019s right to counsel under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155-156 (CAVANAGH, C.J., concurring). In a separate concurring opinion, Justice BRICKLEY agreed that suppression of the defendant\u2019s statement was necessary, but based his decision on his conclusion that the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was made involuntarily, citing the \u201celeven-hour incommunicado interrogation during which [the defendant] was deprived of food, sleep, and contact with friendly outsiders, combined with the fact that he was not informed of available retained counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172 (BRICKLEY, J., concurring). Justice RILEY dissented, joined by Justices BOYLE and GRIFFIN, concluding that defendant had knowingly waived his right to consult with an attorney before making his statement, and that the \u201cobjectionable\u201d police conduct did not amount to a constitutional viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tion. <em>Id. </em>at 179-180 (RILEY, J., dissenting). The dissent noted that \u201c[t]here is nothing conspicuous in the language of the Michigan Constitution that would distinguish it from the rights guaranteed by the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><em>Wright </em>cannot provide the foundation for <em>Bender, </em>because it produced no consensus that Article 1, \u00a7 17 of Michigan\u2019s Constitution imposes greater requirements for a valid waiver of the rights to remain silent and to counsel than those imposed by the federal Constitution,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and its lead opinion, much like <em>Bender\u2019s </em>majority opinion, suffered from scant analysis. The lack of analysis in both opinions is accounted for by the simple fact that there is no basis in the Michigan Constitution for the decisions reached in those opinions. That is, it is not the failure of analyses in these opinions that militates against their extension of <em>Miranda-, </em>it is the absence of any language in the Michigan Constitution that would sustain such an analysis, and that is why each of these opinions is so barren of constitutional exegesis. Only Justice MALLETT\u2019s lead opinion in <em>Wright </em>explicitly \u201cextend[ed] the rights afforded under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17\u201d to provide greater protection than those afforded by the Fifth Amendment. <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 154 (opinion by MALLETT, J.). Justice LEVIN concurred, and Justice CAVANAGH agreed with Justice MALLETT\u2019s analysis, but no other member of this Court accepted the lead opinion\u2019s proposition, and Justice RILEY, joined by Justices BOYLE and GRIFFIN, explicitly rejected such a conclusion in her dissent. In any event, the lead opinion cannot provide a foundation for <em>Bender, </em>as it peremp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>torily concluded that the \u201caccusatorial\u201d nature of our criminal justice system warranted an \u201cextension of] the rights afforded under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17,\u201d without anywhere confronting the language of this provision or assessing in any way the intentions of the ratifiers.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Instead, in opining that Article 1, \u00a7 17 requires police to inform suspects of an attorney\u2019s efforts to contact a suspect in order that a <em>Miranda </em>waiver be valid, the lead opinion acknowledged that it \u201cdisagree [d] \u201d with the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary in <em>Moran, </em>and noted that \u201cstates are free to afford their citizens greater protection than that granted by the federal government.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 148 (opinion by MALLETT, J.). Doubtless this is true, but such authority on our part does not relieve us from the obligation to ground our actions within our own Constitution. The lead opinion opined further, \u201c[o]ther states have considered [Moran\u2019s] question and have concluded that it is necessary for a suspect to be informed of an attorney\u2019s attempted contacts,\u201d and proceeded to summarize the decisions of the highest state courts of Connecticut, Delaware, and Oregon. <em>Id. </em>at 148-153. Such an observation, while also entirely appropriate as a prelude to extending <em>Miranda, </em>also does not relieve us of the obligation to \u201cdetermine what law \u2018the people [of Michigan] have made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sitz, </em>443 Mich at 759. This obligation is best accomplished by some effort to examine the language of our Constitution that purportedly supplies the basis for the newly discovered constitutional right, <em>Bond, </em>383 Mich at 699-700, in this instance, Article 1, \u00a7 17. However, without engaging in any such analysis, the lead opinion turned to the facts of <em>Wright, </em>and offered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>As Justice Stevens so eloquently stated, \u201c[t]he recognition that ours is an accusatorial, and not an inquisitorial system nevertheless requires that the government\u2019s actions, even in responding to this brutal crime, respect those liberties and rights that distinguish this society from most others.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>[475 US] at 436 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Accordingly, under our state\u2019s laws, we conclude that Mr. Wright did not make a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights when the police, before he made a statement, refused to inform him that retained counsel tried or was currently trying to contact him. Without this knowledge, Mr. Wright could not make a truly voluntary waiver of his essential rights. Given the opportunity to speak to a specific, retained and available attorney, Mr. Wright\u2019s decision may have been different. <em>[Wright, </em>441 Mich at 153 (opinion by MALLETT, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The lead opinion concluded that while \u201cthis Court has held that the interpretation of our constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and that of the Fifth Amendment are the same,\u201d it was nevertheless appropriate to \u201cextend the rights afforded by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, to include information of retained counsel\u2019s in-person efforts to contact a suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154. The opinion was correct that this Court may interpret our constitution to afford greater protections than those afforded by the Fifth Amendment. However, the opinion did not perform the constitutional analysis necessary to \u201cdetermine the intent of the framers and of the people adopting it,\u201d <em>Holland, </em>299 Mich at 470. Consequently, <em>Wright\u2019s </em>\u201cextension of] the rights afforded under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17,\u201d cannot provide <em>Bender\u2019s </em>foundation, because that extension was not supported by a majority of this Court, and it was not based on any semblance of the constitutional analysis necessary to ground new rights in the Michigan Constitution, an analysis that would seem to be of particular prudence in distinguishing an interpretation of a provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Michigan Constitution from a United States Supreme Court interpretation of the United States Constitution. Cf. <em>Nash, </em>418 Mich at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">While this analysis indicates that there is no precedent specifically undergirding <em>Bender,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is also relevant to examine this Court\u2019s caselaw pertaining to Article 1, \u00a7 17, as well as to the admissibility of confessions in general, to inquire whether there is any other historical support from this Court for <em>Bender. </em>Specifically, we examine whether there is any precedent that foreshadowed <em>Bender </em>by suggesting either that (a) this Court has interpreted the self-incrimination provision of Article 1, \u00a7 17 to extend beyond the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment; or (b) this Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>interpreted the self-incrimination provision of Article 1, \u00a7 17 as focused on something other than the voluntariness of a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Concerning the first matter of exploration, there is no precedent that serves as a precursor to <em>Bender </em>by-affording protections under Article 1, \u00a7 17 greater than those afforded under the Fifth Amendment. To the contrary, on at least two occasions, this Court had discussed the meaning of Michigan\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause in comparison to the Fifth Amendment and indicated that Michigan\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause is identical to its federal counterpart. In <em>In re Moser, </em>138 Mich 302, 305; 101 NW 588 (1904), we noted that \u201c[u]nder the Constitutions of Michigan and of the United States, no witness can be compelled to give testimony which might tend to criminate himself or expose him to a criminal prosecution. The provision in each Constitution is the same.\u201d Eighty years later, in <em>Paramount Pictures Corp v Miskinis, </em>418 Mich 708, 726; 344 NW2d 788 (1984), we cited <em>Moser </em>and stated that \u201c[h]aving examined prior decisions of this Court, we find nothing which requires an interpretation of our constitutional privilege against self-incrimination different from that of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Moser </em>and <em>Paramount </em>are instructive in that they provide insight concerning the legal environment at the time <em>Bender </em>was decided. Until that point, our interpretations of Article 1, \u00a7 17 provided no indication that this Court was prepared to extend the protections of Article 1, \u00a7 17 to exceed those of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Concerning the second matter of exploration, while <em>Bender </em>implicates the \u201cknowing\u201d prong of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, this Court\u2019s precedents indicate that Article 1, \u00a7 17 pertains solely to the <em>voluntariness </em>of a confession. \u201cUnder Michigan law, initially the admissibility of confessions was governed solely by common law, which adhered to the rule that involuntary confessions were inadmissible.\u201d <em>People v Conte, </em>421 Mich 704, 721; 365 NW2d 648 (1984) (citations omitted). Subsequently, this Court recognized a constitutional basis for this rule, acknowledging that both the Due Process Clause, <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich at 686, and the right against self-incrimination, <em>People v Louzon, </em>338 Mich 146; 61 NW2d 52 (1953), provide alternate bases for holding involuntary confessions inadmissible. Before <em>Miranda, </em>few cases analyzed the admissibility of a confession in light of the Self-Incrimination Clause, but this Court did so in <em>People v Louzon:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">We recognize the rule that confessions are inadmissible when secured by inflicting physical force or its equivalent by means of harsh or cruel treatment or false promises. The confession must be voluntary, but this does not mean that it must be volunteered. <em>No one may be forced to be a witness against himself. [Louzon, </em>338 Mich 153-154 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Thus, this Court\u2019s use of the Self-Incrimination Clause to analyze the admissibility of a confession focused entirely on the voluntariness of the confession, referring to the type of force or coercion that is contemplated in part by the text of Article 1, \u00a7 17. Sometime after <em>Louzon, Miranda </em>transformed the inquiry pertaining to the admissibility of confessions, introducing the concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of a \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent\u201d waiver of a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. Before <em>Miranda </em>under Michigan law, voluntariness constituted the sole criteria for a confession to be admissible, under either the Due Process Clause, or Michigan\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause, providing no support for <em>Bender\u2019s </em>proposition that Article 1, \u00a7 17 pertains in any way to whether a <em>Miranda </em>waiver is made \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In his dissent, Justice CAVANAGH disagrees with this conclusion, and instead asserts that <em>Cavanaugh </em>foreshadowed <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>\u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d requirement by holding that defendant\u2019s confession was obtained in violation of what is now Article 1, \u00a7 17, due to the \u201cincommunicable\u201d nature of the defendant\u2019s interrogation. According to the dissent, \u201cincommunicado interrogation was at the center of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 requirement in <em>Miranda,\u201d </em>and \u201c[because <em>Cavanaugh\u2019s </em>explanation of the impropriety of the incommunicado interrogation methods used to extract the defendant\u2019s confession is strikingly similar to the impermissible interrogation methods that <em>Miranda </em>discussed, <em>Cavanaugh </em>is . . . more properly classified as consistent with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>\u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">However, as previously noted, <em>Cavanaugh </em>explicitly pertained only to the voluntariness of a confession, and the \u201cincommunicable\u201d nature of defendant\u2019s interrogation was only one factor among many that persuaded this Court to remand for a determination whether defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although <em>Ca</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>vanaugh </em>in no way transformed this Court\u2019s traditional voluntariness analysis, even assuming arguendo that <em>Cavanaugh </em>recognized that more subtle forms of coercion might render a confession involuntary, there is simply no indication that <em>Cavanaugh </em>contemplated the \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d requirement set forth almost four decades later in <em>Miranda, </em>as <em>Cavanaugh </em>nowhere hinted that a defendant must have some idea of his or her \u201crights\u201d and the consequences of waiving those rights in order for his or her confession to be admissible. As <em>Miranda </em>had not yet introduced the concept of a waiver made \u201cknowingly and intelligently,\u201d it is highly unlikely that <em>Cavanaugh </em>contemplated such a requirement, or that the ratifiers of the 1963 Constitution perceived <em>Cavanaugh </em>as setting forth such a requirement, particularly in view of the fact that <em>Cavanaugh </em>performed the traditional totality of the circumstances voluntary analysis that was routinely undertaken in determining the admissibility of a confession at that time.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As even Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s dissent acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>edges, \u201cwhen interpreting the Michigan Constitution, we must recognize the law as it existed in Michigan <em>at the time </em>the relevant constitutional provision was adopted, and \u2018it must be presumed that a constitutional provision has been framed and adopted mindful of prior and existing law and with reference to them.\u2019 <em>People v Kirby, </em>440 Mich 485, 492; 487 NW2d 404 (1992).\u201d <em>Post </em>at 258-259 (emphasis added). The trajectory of our constitutional development under our equivalent of the Fifth Amendment, as well as this Court\u2019s consistent emphasis on the voluntariness of a confession, <em>including </em>in <em>Cavanaugh, </em>indicated no anticipation of <em>Miranda, </em>a notion as to which defense counsel himself agreed at oral argument.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Furthermore, <em>Cavanaugh </em>was decided under the Due Process Clause, and not the Self-Incrimination Clause, further suggesting that the ratifiers of the 1963 Constitution would not have perceived <em>Cavanaugh </em>as establishing that Michigan\u2019s provision against compulsory self-incrimination provided any greater protections than those afforded by the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, neither <em>Cavanaugh, </em>nor any other precedent of this Court, supports the dissent\u2019s assertion that Article 1, \u00a7 17 was ratified in contemplation of the \u201cknowing\u201d requirement later set forth in Miranda.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Moreover, this Court\u2019s precedent provides no support for the proposition that this Court has placed extra emphasis on the \u201cknowing\u201d prong of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver in the period since <em>Miranda. </em>Before and after <em>Miranda, </em>\u201c[wjhere conditions did not overbear a defendant\u2019s will, statements have been held admissible.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 167, citing <em>People v Brannan, </em>406 Mich 104; 276 NW2d 14 (1979); <em>People v Farmer, </em>380 Mich 198; 156 NW2d 504 (1968); <em>People v Boyce, </em>314 Mich 608; 23 NW2d 99 (1946). Even after <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Bender, </em>this Court has referred to <em>Moran </em>for the appropriate \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver standard, and stated that \u201c[t]o knowingly waive <em>Miranda </em>rights, a suspect need not understand the ramifications and consequences of choosing to waive or exercise the rights that the police have properly explained to him\u201d and \u201c[l]ack of foresight is insufficient to render an otherwise proper waiver invalid.\u201d <em>People v Cheatham, </em>453 Mich 1, 28-29; 551 NW2d 355 (1996) (citations omitted). Thus, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>heightened requirement for a <em>Miranda </em>waiver to be made \u201cknowingly\u201d is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s previous treatment of the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">This Court\u2019s precedents did not foreshadow, or otherwise provide support, for <em>Bender. </em>Nor do this Court\u2019s precedents support a finding that Article 1, \u00a7 17 requires a greater showing that a <em>Miranda </em>waiver was made \u201cknowingly\u201d than is required by the Fifth Amendment, given that this Court\u2019s interpretation of Article 1, \u00a717 has indicated that it pertains solely to the voluntariness of a confession itself, not to whether a confession is made with full knowledge of its consequences.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>4. <em>BENDER </em>vs. <em>MORAN</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">This Court\u2019s independent constitutional analysis of Article 1, \u00a7 17 leads us to the conclusion that <em>Moran, </em>not <em>Bender, </em>best analyzes the issue presented in this case. Our analysis indicates that Article 1, \u00a7 17 protects a suspect only from the use of confessions or incriminating statements obtained by coercion, violence, force, or pressure. However, Bender\u2019s rule renders confessions and incriminating statements inadmissible that were in no way influenced by the type of coercive or compelling atmosphere contemplated by the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\"><em>Miranda </em>was initially intended by the United States Supreme Court (at least until its later decision in <em>Dickerson)</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to serve as \u201cone possible formula\u201d by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>to dispel the coercive atmosphere implicit in custodial interrogation; its purpose was to alleviate what it viewed as the increasingly subtle and nuanced forms of coercion that sometimes typified the custodial interrogation process and undermined the genuine voluntariness of statements produced by this process. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has explained that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>protects defendants against government coercion leading them to surrender rights protected by the Fifth Amendment; it goes no further than that.\u201d <em>Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157, 170; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986). However, the situation in <em>Bender </em>falls considerably outside the scope of the custodial interrogation process that defined the constitutional rationale for <em>Miranda. </em>That is, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>rule renders inadmissible even statements and confessions made following an indisputably voluntary and informed <em>Miranda </em>waiver absent even the slightest hint of the subtle or nuanced forms of coercion that served as the justification for <em>Miranda. Miranda\u2019s </em>treatment of such forms of coercion at least sought to remain faithful to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s traditional voluntariness standard.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Our independent examination of Article 1, \u00a7 17 supports <em>Moran\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u201cfull comprehension of [the <em>Miranda </em>rights] are sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process,\u201d <em>Moran, </em>464 US at 427, because the warnings provide a suspect with the necessary information both to apprehend these rights and to make an intelligent and knowing waiver of the rights if he chooses. The waiver of rights cannot logically be affected by events that are unknown and unperceived, such as the fact that an attorney is somewhere present to offer assistance. As explained by one scholar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">If there is any police misconduct, the suspect is unaware of such events because it is directed toward the attorney. Facts and events unknown to the suspect cannot have a coercive effect on the suspect. Therefore, the attorney\u2019s efforts and/or presence is irrelevant to the suspect\u2019s ability to make a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Moreover, as the suspect is still read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, such events do not operate to deprive the suspect of the knowledge of his rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">To argue or conclude that a defendant, who by the good fortune of a family member hiring an attorney, must be told of the attorney\u2019s attempts to make contact in order to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is illogical and nonsensical. In fact, for the majority\u2019s reasoning to make sense, the majority would have to conclude that persons who are capable of retaining an attorney, or have family or friends who are capable of hiring a retained attorney, are not capable of making a knowing and intelli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>gent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights even when the attorney is not present. As is evident by the admissibility of a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver in the ordinary custodial interrogation situation, the majority would not so conclude. [Carroll, <em>A Look at People v Bender: What Happens when the Michigan Supreme Court Oversteps Its Power to Achieve A Results-Oriented </em>Decision, 74 U Det Mercy L Rev 211, 236-237 (1997) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We therefore agree with <em>Moran </em>that an outside and unperceived development, such as an attorney\u2019s presence and initiation of contact with police, \u201ccan have no bearing on [a suspect\u2019s] capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Moran, 475 </em>US at 422.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Instead, as noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 577; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987), \u201cthe additional information could affect only the wisdom of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, not its essentially voluntary and knowing nature.\u201d It might not be in a suspect\u2019s best interest to make a statement, but this Court need not concern itself with the wisdom of a suspect\u2019s confession. To the contrary, voluntary but \u201cfoolish\u201d confessions should be welcomed, as a suspect\u2019s perhaps unwise but purely voluntary urge to tell the truth is vital in assisting the fact-finder in ultimately ascertaining the truth of what occurred.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>In sum, independent examination of Article 1, \u00a7 17 persuades us that the United States Supreme Court correctly interpreted this issue in <em>Moran. </em>This examination further supports <em>Moran\u2019s </em>conclusions that \u201c[e]vents occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right,\u201d that the \u201c \u2018deliberate or reckless\u2019 withholding of information ... is only relevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them,\u201d and that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings alone \u201care sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 422-424, 427. Because our constitutional analysis demonstrates that Article 1, \u00a7 17 does not confer the protections set forth in <em>Bender, </em>but instead supports <em>Moran\u2019s </em>analysis and conclusion, we conclude that <em>Bender </em>was wrongly decided. We conclude, as did the United States Supreme Court in <em>Moran, </em>that the failure of police to inform a suspect of an attorney\u2019s efforts to contact him does not invalidate an otherwise \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent\u201d <em>Miranda </em>waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>C. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">When this Court determines that a case has been wrongly decided, as we do here with regard to <em>Bender, </em>it must next determine whether it should overrule that precedent, a decision that should never be undertaken lightly. The application of stare decisis is \u201cgenerally \u2018the preferred course, because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), quoting <em>Hohn v United States, 524 </em>US 236, 251; 118 S Ct 1969; 141 L Ed 2d 242 (1998). However, \u201cstare decisis is a \u2018principle of policy\u2019 rather than \u2018an inexorable command,\u2019 and... the Court is not constrained to follow precedent when governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464 (citations omitted). This Court has discussed the proper circumstances under which it will overrule prior case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">This Court has stated on many occasions that \u201c[u]nder the doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law deliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.\u201d ...[.] \u201cBefore this court overrules a decision deliberately made, it should be convinced not merely that the case was wrongly decided, but also that less injury will result from overruling than from following it.\u201d When it becomes apparent that the reasoning of an opinion is erroneous, and that less mischief will result from overruling the case rather than following it, it becomes the duty of the court to correct it. <em>[People v Graves, </em>458 Mich 476, 480-481; 581 NW2d 229 (1998) (citations omitted) (alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">When performing a stare decisis analysis, this Court should review <em>inter alia </em>\u201cwhether the decision at issue defies \u2018practical workability,\u2019 whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the law or facts no longer justify the questioned decision.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464 (citation omitted). As for the rebanee interest, \u201cthe Court must ask whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">When questions before this Court implicate the Constitution, this Court arguably has an even greater obligation to overrule erroneous precedent. \u201c[A] judicial tribunal is most strongly justified in reversal of its precedent when adherence to such precedent would perpetuate a plainly incorrect interpretation of the language of a constitutional provision or statute.\u201d <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, </em>463 Mich 143, 181; 615 NW2d 702 (2000), citing <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 463-468. This is because \u201cthe pobey of stare decisis \u2018is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution because our interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling our prior decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kyser v Kasson Twp, </em>486 Mich 514, 534, n 15; 786 NW2d 543 (2010), quoting <em>Agostini v Felton, </em>521 US 203, 235; 117 S Ct 1997; 138 L Ed 2d 391 (1997).

Although <em>Bender </em>disclaimed rebanee on Michigan\u2019s Constitution, it nonetheless vaguely referred to its provisions in enacting its \u201cprophylactic\u201d rule, suggesting that this Comb has a duty to review this decision under less deferential standards of stare decisis in bght of our role as the final judicial arbiter of this Constitution.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We conclude that overruling <em>Bender </em>would not produce \u201cpractical real-world dislocations,\u201d primarily because <em>Bender </em>obviously cannot be said to have caused suspects to \u201calter their conduct in any way.\u201d See <em>People v Petit, </em>466 Mich 624, 635; 648 NW2d 193 (2002). As <em>Moran </em>noted, \u201c[e]vents occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Moran, 475 </em>US at 422. It seems highly unlikely that a suspect being interrogated, after a day earlier having expressly refused to waive his right to counsel and then reconsidering that decision by affirmatively seeking to speak with police and then expressly waiving his right to counsel, would thereafter rely on <em>Bender </em>in determining that he need not ask for an attorney because the officers have a legal duty to inform him that an attorney has initiated contact with them. Although a suspect might later come to have second thoughts and prefer that he had not waived his right to counsel, \u201c[s]uch after-the-fact awareness does not rise to the level of a reliance interest because to have reliance the knowledge must be of the sort that causes a person or entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 466-467. Consequently, <em>Bender </em>has not become so \u201cfundamental to everyone\u2019s expectations\u201d that to overrule it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>would result in \u201creal-world dislocations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. Further, that <em>Bender </em>can fairly be considered to be \u201cworkable,\u201d in the sense that the police may clearly understand their legal obligations to a defendant and his attorney, does not render \u201cpractically unworkable\u201d a regime in which a defendant\u2019s rights are just as clearly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Contrary to <em>Bender, </em>we do not believe that increased \u201cmischief\u201d will result from this Court\u2019s failure to maintain the rule expounded in that case as the constitutional law of this state. As already noted, we agree with <em>Moran </em>that the constitutional \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of a confession or incriminating statement is not implicated by the failure of police to inform the defendant of the presence of an attorney before proceeding with a custodial interrogation after <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given and <em>Miranda </em>rights waived. Whether a defendant does or does not possess knowledge of an attorney\u2019s outside presence cannot affect whether that defendant understands the rights that he or she is waiving, and neither the United States Supreme Court nor this Court has ever accepted the proposition that an attorney must be present in order that a <em>Miranda </em>waiver be characterized as \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\"><em>Moran </em>accurately highlighted the competing policies informing both <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny, including <em>Moran </em>itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">Custodial interrogations implicate two competing concerns. On the one hand, \u201cthe need for police questioning as a tool for effective enforcement of criminal laws\u201d cannot be doubted. Admissions of guilt are more than merely \u201cdesirable,\u201d they are essential to society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law. On the other hand, the Court has recognized that the interrogation process is \u201cinherently coercive\u201d and that, as a consequence, there exists a substantial risk that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>police will inadvertently traverse the fine line between legitimate efforts to elicit admissions and constitutionally impermissible compulsion. <em>Miranda </em>attempted to reconcile these opposing concerns by giving the defendant the power to exert some control over the course of the interrogation. ... Police questioning, often an essential part of the investigatory process, could continue in its traditional form, the Court held, but only if the suspect clearly understood that, at any time, he could bring the proceeding to a halt or, short of that, call in an attorney to give advice and monitor the conduct of his interrogators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">The position urged by [defendant] would upset this carefully drawn approach in a manner that is both unnecessary for the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege and injurious to legitimate law enforcement. Because, as <em>Miranda </em>holds, full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process, a rule requiring the police to inform the suspect of an attorney\u2019s efforts to contact him would contribute to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege only incidentally, if at all. This minimal benefit, however, would come at a substantial cost to society\u2019s legitimate and substantial interest in securing admissions of guilt. <em>[Moran, </em>475 US at 426-427 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The <em>Moran </em>Court\u2019s concern that further protections against self-incrimination, such as those set forth in <em>Bender, </em>would impinge on the effectiveness of law enforcement are entirely valid, in our judgment. Neither the Fifth Amendment nor Article 1, \u00a7 17 is hostile to custodial interrogations \u2014 only to those in which there is some coercive environment. Similarly, neither the Fifth Amendment nor Article 1, \u00a7 17 is hostile to confessions and self-incrimination \u2014 only to those which are \u201ccompelled.\u201d Indeed, confessions and incriminating statements constitute perhaps the most compelling and important evidence available to fact-finders in the justice system\u2019s search for truth. Suppression of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>evidence as the result of a <em>Bender </em>violation deprives these fact-finders of evidence allowing them to distinguish truth from falsity and innocence from guilt, while avoiding the conviction of innocent persons and the exoneration of guilty persons, all in pursuit of a principle that has never since the founding of our republic or state been viewed as a constitutional violation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Although overruling <em>Bender </em>will undeniably result in some unknown number of confessions and incriminating statements that might otherwise not have been provided, such evidence will have been voluntarily offered and have been preceded by \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent\u201d waivers of <em>Miranda </em>rights. This evidence is to be welcomed, not repudiated, by any rational and effective criminal justice system. It is hard to comprehend a societal interest that is furthered by protecting persons who have engaged in serious criminal activities from the consequences of their own voluntary and intelligent decisions. While Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s dissent claims that \u201cthis statement entirely ignores the overriding principle of our criminal justice system: that a suspect is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>post </em>at 282, we are inclined instead to concur with Justice BOYLE who observed in her <em>Bender </em>dissent that, \u201c [i]f properly administered and validly waived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the <em>Miranda </em>warnings ensure protection of a defendant\u2019s right against compulsory self-incrimination, while at the same time allowing the police to fulfill their duty in a constitutionally permissible manner.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 626 (BOYLE, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Because we believe that less, not more, \u201cmischief\u201d will likely result from overruling the case, we are further persuaded of the need to overrule <em>Bender. </em>See <em>Graves, </em>458 Mich at 480-481, citing <em>McEvoy v Sault Ste Marie, </em>136 Mich 172, 178; 98 NW 1006 (1904) (stating that in reversing precedent, the Court \u201cshould be convinced not merely that the case was wrongly decided, but also that less injury will result from overruling than from following it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">An examination of Michigan\u2019s Constitution and a review of this Court\u2019s precedents compel the conclusion that <em>Bender </em>was wrongly decided and should now be overruled. In accordance with <em>Moran, </em>we hold that \u201c[o]nce it is determined that a suspect\u2019s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\u2019s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Moran </em>475 US at 422-423. Although this Court need not interpret a provision of our Constitution in the same manner as a similar or identical federal constitutional provision, we are persuaded in the present instance, on the basis of our examination of Article 1, \u00a7 17, that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment in <em>Moran </em>constitutes the proper interpretation of Article I, \u00a7 17 as well.

According to the dissent, the rule in <em>Bender </em>is \u201csufficient\u201d to sustain the suppression of defendant\u2019s statement, but is not \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to do so, because the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statement was implicated, or called into question, by defendant\u2019s failed attempts to invoke his right to counsel. However, in defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, he acknowledged that his statement to law enforcement was entirely voluntary, and argued only that his <em>Miranda </em>waiver had not been undertaken knowingly and intelligently pursuant to <em>Bender </em>and <em>Wright, </em>on the basis of the police\u2019s failure to inform him that an attorney had been appointed on his behalf and had sought to meet with him. Thus, whether defendant\u2019s statement was undertaken voluntarily is not an issue that has been raised in this Court. Furthermore, because defendant clearly and explicitly relied on <em>Bender </em>in his motion to suppress, and because the trial court also clearly and explicitly relied on <em>Bender </em>in granting this motion, the instant case does indeed afford an appropriate vehicle by which to assess the precedential value of <em>Bender. </em>Whether defendant\u2019s statement should be suppressed on other constitutional grounds can be considered on remand, provided both that such constitutional arguments have not been precluded by defendant\u2019s pursuit of the current motion and that counsel offers the appropriate pretrial motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> \u201cUnder the Supremacy Clause, the courts of this state are obliged to enforce the rights conferred by the United States Supreme Court even if the state constitution does not provide such rights.\u201d <em>Sitz, </em>443 Mich at 759 (citation omitted).

This Court has on occasion seemed to suggest that there is some specific burden on this Court to identify a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d or justification for interpreting the words of the Michigan Constitution differently than the words of the United States Constitution.

However, this cannot precisely describe this Court\u2019s relationship with the federal judiciary, even with the United States Supreme Court.

In other words, because this Court concluded that the jury should hear a host of factors to determine whether the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary, a single factor \u2014 that counsel\u2019s requests to speak to the defendant were refused \u2014 cannot he identified and cited for the proposition that <em>Cavanaugh </em>established as a matter of constitutional principle that a defendant must be informed of an attorney\u2019s attempts to contact him in order for his subsequent confession to be admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> Similarly, in the ease at hand, defendant failed to request an attorney after reinitiating contact with police and before waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights and making an incriminating statement, despite the fact that defendant knew he could request an attorney, as he had done so the day before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> It should be noted that, were the circumstances in <em>Cavanaugh </em>to arise today, the confession would be inadmissible, as the officers ignored the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to counsel and continued to interrogate him, contrary to <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 473-474.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\"> Despite this, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>lead opinion stated that \u201c[i]n <em>Wright, </em>this Court held that the Michigan Constitution imposes a stricter requirement for a valid waiver of the rights to remain silent and to counsel than imposed by the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 611 (opinion by Cavanagh, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"> Justice CAVANAGH\u2019s dissent alleges that <em>Cavanaugh </em>provided specific support for <em>Bender, </em>as the justices in support of <em>Bender </em>\u201cnecessarily relied on <em>Cavanaugh </em>(as evidenced by the <em>Bender </em>opinion\u2019s citations to the <em>Wright </em>opinions, which cited <em>Cavanaugh) </em>as the primary source for the broader interpretation of the right against self-incrimination under the Michigan Constitution.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 274.

INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The majority explains its decision by first stating that, in <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), the United States Supreme Court reached the opposite conclusion. However, as the majority acknowledges, the divergent results in <em>Moran </em>and <em>Bender </em>cannot support the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Bender </em>was wrongly decided. Indeed, according to the United States Supreme Court, \u201ca State is free as a matter of its own law to impose greater restrictions on police activity than those this Court holds to be necessary upon federal constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Oregon v Hass, </em>420 US 714, 719; 95 S Ct 1215; 43 L Ed 2d 570 (1975), citing <em>Cooper v California, </em>386 US 58, 62; 87 S Ct 788; 17 L Ed 2d 730 (1967), and <em>Sibron v New York, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>392 US 40, 60-61; 88 S Ct 1889; 20 L Ed 2d 917 (1968). Moreover, <em>Moran </em>extended this broad premise to the exact issue at hand, stating, \u201c[n]othing we say today disables the States from adopting different requirements for the conduct of its employees and officials as a matter of state law.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 428. Finally, we have consistently concluded that we are not bound in our understanding of the Michigan Constitution by any particular interpretation of the United States Constitution. See, e.g., <em>Harvey v Michigan, </em>469 Mich 1, 6 n 3; 664 NW2d 767 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Given that we are clearly free to interpret our Constitution more broadly than the United States Supreme Court has interpreted the federal Constitution, and the United States Supreme Court has permitted the creation of rules like the one from <em>Bender, </em>one must ask what is so wrong about <em>Bender </em>that it must be abandoned after nearly two decades of problem-free application in our state? According to the majority, Michigan\u2019s Constitution does not support <em>Bender\u2019s </em>rule. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Although the language of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is nearly identical to the language in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that does not necessarily indicate that we must interpret our Constitution in a manner consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal Constitution. Rather, when interpreting the Michigan Constitution, we must recognize the law as it existed in Michigan at the time the relevant constitutional provision was adopted, and \u201cit must be presumed that a constitutional provision has been framed and adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mindful of prior and existing law and with reference to them.\u201d <em>People v Kirby, </em>440 Mich 485, 492; 487 NW2d 404 (1992). Accordingly, I will begin with a review of an opinion decided long before the ratifiers adopted the 1963 Constitution and cited for support in <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992), and Bender: <em>People v Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich 680; 225 NW 501 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">II. <em>PEOPLE v </em>CAVANAUGH: THE ORIGIN OF <em>BENDER\u2019S </em>FOUNDATION IN THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In support of its conclusion that <em>Bender </em>is not rooted in the Michigan Constitution, the majority toils away for page after page of analysis arguing that the Michigan Constitution only protects a suspect from involuntary confessions. Moreover, the majority limits the scope of \u201cinvoluntary confessions\u201d to only those confessions that satisfy the dictionary definition of \u201ccompelled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The result is that in the majority\u2019s view, a confession is inadmissible under art 1, \u00a7 17 only if the confession is obtained through \u201cthe use of coercion, violence, force, or pressure. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 225. In fact, the majority concludes that our caselaw \u201cfocused entirely on the voluntariness of the confession,\u201d which only excludes confessions \u201c \u2018secured by <em>inflicting physical force </em>or its equivalent <em>by means of harsh or cruel </em>treatment....\u2019\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 240 quoting <em>People v Louzon, </em>338 Mich 146, 153-154; 61 NW2d 52 (1953) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The problem with the majority\u2019s view is twofold: first it is rooted in a hyper-textualist analysis of the word \u201ccompelled\u201d in art 1, \u00a7 17, an approach rejected in this area of law by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), and throughout <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>progeny. See, e.g., <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477, 484-485; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981) (explaining the protections applicable when an accused invokes the right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation). Second, the majority singularly focuses on pr <em>e-Miranda </em>caselaw. Not surprisingly, that <em>pre-Miranda </em>caselaw does not use the terminology adopted in <em>Miranda </em>to explain the \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d requirements. Thus, by focusing exclusively on the fact that pre<em>Miranda </em>caselaw used the \u201cvoluntary confession\u201d terminology, the majority determines that the pre<em>Miranda </em>caselaw only prohibited the use of confessions obtained by \u201cinflicting physical force\u201d or \u201ccruel treatment.\u201d However, simply because Michigan\u2019s pre<em>Miranda </em>caselaw did not use the terminology adopted in <em>Miranda </em>does not necessarily mean that our caselaw did not adopt an understanding of art 1, \u00a7 17 that is broader than the hyper-textualist meaning espoused by the majority. Rather, we must consider the actual interrogation circumstances in those pr <em>e-Miranda </em>opinions to determine whether we have historically interpreted our state Constitution to provide broader protection against self-incrimination than is provided in the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In 1929, long before adoption of the 1963 Michigan Constitution, we considered a case in which the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>denied counsel\u2019s request to speak with his client, whom the police were interrogating. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich at 687. In <em>Cavanaugh, </em>we found the police conduct impermissible, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\u201c[HJolding an accused incommunicable, is condemned by every principle of fairness,... is <em>forbidden by the constitutional guaranty of due process of law, </em>and inhibited by the right of an accused to have the assistance of counsel.... Holding an accused incommunicable to parents and counsel is a subtle and insidious method of intimidating and cowing ....\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 686 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><em>Cavanaugh </em>also provided, <em>\u201cIn this State . . . </em>police [may not], having custody of one accused of crime, deny an attorney, employed by or in behalf of a prisoner, the right to see and advise the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As I explained in <em>Wright, </em>\u201cit is clear that <em>Cavanaugh, </em>in view of its reference to the law <em>l[i\\n this </em>State,\u2019 . . . was not referring to any rights under the federal constitution; rather, it was referring to the rights existing <em>under our state constitution.\u201d Wright, </em>441 Mich at 158 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.) (emphasis added). Indeed, this Court later concluded that <em>Cavanaugh </em>relied on \u201cthe Michigan constitutional guarantee of due process,\u201d which was then contained in Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 16, and is now found in the constitutional provision at issue \u2014 Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. <em>People v Conte, </em>421 Mich 704, 722; 365 NW2d 648 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">After understanding that <em>Cavanaugh </em>interpreted the Michigan Constitution, the next question is whether <em>Cavanaugh </em>interpreted the state constitutional language more broadly than the language of its federal counterpart. As previously noted, <em>Cavanaugh </em>concluded that \u201cholding an accused <em>incommunicable </em>... is forbidden by the constitutional guaranty of due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of law, and inhibited by the right of an accused to have the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich at 686 (emphasis added). Holding a suspect \u201cincommunicable\u201d is substantially different from \u201cinflicting physical force\u201d or \u201ccruel treatment,\u201d which, according to the majority, is the only type of \u201ccompulsion\u201d that the Michigan Constitution prohibited <em>pre-Miranda. </em>Nevertheless, <em>Cavanaugh </em>concluded that the defendant\u2019s confession was obtained in violation of what is now art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution. Thus, the majority\u2019s claim \u2014 that we have not previously interpreted Michigan\u2019s Constitution to provide protection against self-incrimination except with respect to confessions obtained by \u201c \u2018inflicting physical force\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018by means of harsh or cruel treatment,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante </em>at 240 (citation omitted) \u2014 is inconsistent with <em>Cavanaugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In order to sidestep this inconsistency, the majority argues that <em>Cavanaugh </em>is distinguishable from <em>Bender </em>because <em>Cavanaugh </em>concluded that the defendant\u2019s <em>confession </em>was not <em>voluntary, </em>whereas <em>Bender </em>concluded that the defendant\u2019s <em>waiver </em>of rights was not made <em>knowingly. </em>The majority is correct that <em>Cavanaugh </em>did not mention whether the defendant\u2019s waiver of rights was made \u201cknowingly\u201d under the Michigan Constitution and instead referred to the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of the confession. However, as previously discussed, that is not surprising, given that <em>Cavanaugh </em>was decided 37 years before <em>Miranda </em>established the \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d terminology referred to in <em>Bender. </em>Yet, concluding that <em>Cavanaugh </em>did not create the foundation for <em>Bender </em>on these grounds is, in my opinion, an oversimplification of <em>Cavanaugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In my view, <em>Cavanaugh </em>foreshadowed <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>understanding of the nature of the right protected by the constitutional guarantee that a person will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u201ccompelled\u201d to be a witness against himself. Because <em>Cavanaugh </em>referred to the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of the defendant\u2019s confession, the majority insists that <em>Cavanaugh </em>is nothing more than a typical \u201cvoluntariness\u201d case. As a result, the majority assumes that <em>Cavanaugh </em>concluded that the confession was the product of impermissible \u201ccompulsion,\u201d which the majority defines as \u201cthe use of coercion, violence, force, or pressure . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 225. However, by focusing on only the terms used in <em>Cavanaugh, </em>the majority overlooks the context in which the terms were used as well as the fact that <em>Cavanaugh </em>never mentioned the types of \u201ccompulsion\u201d the majority discusses. In fact, a police officer whose testimony described the interrogation in <em>Cavanaugh </em>stated that the defendant \u201cwas not threatened in any manner by the officers nor was he offered any hope of reward nor any promises held to him for the signing of the statement.. . .\u201d <em>Cavanaugh, 246 </em>Mich at 686-687. Rather, <em>Cavanaugh </em>only referred to the impermissibility of \u201cholding an accused <em>incommunicable.\u201d Id. </em>at 686 (emphasis added). See, also, <em>id. </em>at 688 (noting that \u201c[t]he defendant was held incommunicable\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Critically, incommunicado interrogation was at the center of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d requirement in <em>Miranda: </em>\u201cThe current practice of <em>incommunicado interrogation </em>is at odds with one of our Nation\u2019s most cherished principles \u2014 that the individual may not be compelled to incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 457-458 (emphasis added). Moreover, <em>Miranda </em>expressly acknowledged that incommunicado interrogation is not like coercion, violence, force, or pressure that the majority in this case discusses. See <em>id. </em>at 457 (\u201cTo be sure, [incommunicado interrogation] is not physical intimidation . . . .\u201d). Nevertheless, <em>Miranda </em>concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that incommunicado interrogation \u201cis equally destructive of human dignity,\u201d <em>id., </em>and, therefore, violates a suspect\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Because <em>Cavanaugh\u2019s </em>explanation of the impropriety of the incommunicado interrogation methods used to extract the defendant\u2019s confession is strikingly similar to the impermissible interrogation methods that <em>Miranda </em>discussed, <em>Cavanaugh </em>is, in my view, more properly classified as consistent with Miranda\u2019s \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d standard. Stated differently, although <em>Cavanaugh </em>did not use the yet-to-be-created <em>Miranda </em>terminology, <em>Cavanaugh </em>nevertheless is consistent with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>analysis and conclusion concerning knowing and intelligent waivers because <em>Cavanaugh </em>did not address coercive police conduct that affected the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority rejects this view and instead concludes that <em>Cavanaugh </em>never \u201chinted that a defendant must have some idea of his or her \u2018rights\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 242. I disagree because, in my view, an obvious result of holding a suspect incommunicado is that the suspect will lack knowledge of his or her rights, a conclusion that is even truer when the suspect is unaware that counsel, who could educate the suspect on those rights, is actively seeking to communicate with the suspect. Thus, in my view, <em>Cavanaugh </em>evidences that this Court did not interpret the Michigan Constitution to prohibit <em>only </em>confessions obtained by \u201cinflicting physical force\u201d or \u201ccruel treatment.\u201d When viewed in this light, <em>Cavanaugh </em>supports <em>Bender\u2019s </em>conclusion that denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>counsel\u2019s request to communicate with a suspect amounts to impermissible incommunicado interrogation in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The majority also attempts to distinguish <em>Cavanaugh </em>from <em>Bender </em>by arguing that <em>Miranda </em>protects only against police <em>coercion </em>and <em>Bender </em>therefore \u201cfalls considerably outside the scope of the custodial interrogation process which defined the constitutional rationale for <em>Miranda.\u201d Ante </em>at 246, citing <em>Colorado v Connelly, </em>479 US 157, 170; 107 S Ct 515; 93 L Ed 2d 473 (1986). Accordingly, the majority appears to argue that there is no material difference between the pre<em>Miranda </em>test to determine whether a suspect\u2019s confession was <em>voluntary </em>and the post <em>-Miranda </em>test to determine whether a suspect\u2019s waiver was \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d However, that approach ignores that <em>Miranda </em>requires analysis of two distinct prongs \u2014 the voluntariness prong and the knowing and intelligent prong. Thus, the majority makes the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">fallacious assumption of a complete unity between the determinative factors of the <em>pre-Miranda </em>Fourteenth Amendment due process analysis (which was concerned solely with coercive police conduct that affected the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s confession) and the post <em>-Miranda </em>waiver analysis (which requires analysis of two distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>prongs, only one of which \u2014 i.e., voluntariness \u2014 is logically, or in any other respect, related to coercive police practices). <em>[People v Cheatham, </em>453 Mich 1, 52-53; 551 NW2d 355 (1996) (Cavanagh, J., concurring in part).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Connelly </em>does not, however, support the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Miranda </em>protects only against police <em>coercion. </em>Rather, <em>Connelly </em>simply held that \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not <em>\u2018voluntary </em>\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d and determined that \u201c[t]here is obviously no reason to require more in the way of a \u2018voluntariness\u2019 inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context than in the Fourteenth Amendment confession context.\u201d <em>Connelly, </em>479 US 167, at 169-170 (emphasis added). Thus, although it is unmistakable that coercive police conduct is as necessary to a finding of <em>involuntariness </em>under <em>Miranda </em>as it is under the substantive protection of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, \u201c [i]t is only with respect to the completely distinct \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 prong of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver analysis . . . that coercive police conduct is not required, either by logic or by law.\u201d <em>Cheatham, </em>453 Mich at 54 (CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">That is not to say that courts should ignore police conduct when applying the knowing-and-intelligent prong of a <em>Miranda </em>analysis. Police conduct may still be relevant to the knowing-and-intelligent prong because \u201cany police conduct that could have an effect on a suspect\u2019s requisite level of comprehension must be factored into the analysis [,]\u201d which was clear before <em>Connelly. Id. </em>at 55. In fact, <em>Moran, </em>the very opinion the majority follows today, recognized that \u201cthe \u2018deliberate or reckless\u2019 withholding of information is objectionable as a matter of ethics,\u201d but concluded that \u201csuch conduct is only relevant to the <em>constitutional validity of a waiver </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>if it deprives a defendant of knowledge </em>essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 423-424 (emphasis added). Accordingly, because <em>Miranda </em>protects suspects against more than just police coercion, <em>Bender </em>is not \u201coutside the scope\u201d <em>o\u00ed Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The majority also argues that <em>Cavanaugh </em>is irrelevant because, in <em>Cavanaugh, </em>the police denied the <em>suspect\u2019s </em>request for counsel, whereas <em>Bender </em>addressed denial <em>o\u00ed counsel\u2019s </em>request to communicate with a suspect. However, <em>Cavanaugh </em>clearly encompassed police refusal to honor <em>counsel\u2019s </em>requests to speak to the suspect. Specifically, <em>Cavanaugh </em>quoted police testimony establishing that the police denied a request by the suspect\u2019s father and a request by the suspect\u2019s counsel to speak to the suspect. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich at 686-687. Citing those facts, <em>Cavanaugh </em>condemned the police conduct, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">In this State a parent may not be denied the right to see and have conversation with a child in jail and accused of crime. <em>Neither may police, having custody of one accused of crime, deny an attorney, employed by or in behalf of a prisoner, the right to see and advise the accused. [Id. </em>at 688 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Thus, <em>Cavanaugh </em>is applicable not only to situations in which the suspect\u2019s request for an attorney is denied, but to situations in which counsel\u2019s request to speak to a suspect is denied, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Finally, the majority argues that <em>Cavanaugh </em>cannot support <em>Bender </em>because <em>Cavanaugh </em>employed a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d rule rather than the per se rule applied in <em>Bender. </em>The fact that <em>Cavanaugh </em>and <em>Bender </em>differed on what <em>test </em>should result from police interference with counsel\u2019s efforts to speak to a suspect does not lessen the fact that <em>Cavanaugh </em>and <em>Bender </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>agreed that such police conduct is <em>unconstitutional </em>under the Michigan Constitution. Indeed, the police also ignored the defendant\u2019s express request for counsel in <em>Cavanaugh, </em>but <em>Cavanaugh </em>nevertheless applied a totality of the circumstances rule. As the majority recognizes, were those circumstances to occur today, the subsequent confession would be per se inadmissible under <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 474. However, <em>Cavanaugh\u2019s </em>conclusion that ignoring the defendant\u2019s request for counsel was unconstitutional is no less correct today simply because <em>Cavanaugh </em>applied a totality of the circumstances rule rather than the <em>Miranda </em>per se rule. Similarly, <em>Cavanaugh\u2019s </em>conclusion that ignoring counsel\u2019s request to communicate with the suspect was unconstitutional is no less correct today simply because <em>Cavanaugh </em>applied a totality of the circumstances rule rather than the <em>Bender </em>per se rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Moreover, as I explained in <em>Bender, </em>\u201c \u2018a purported waiver [of Miranda] can never satisfy a totality of the circumstances analysis when police do not even inform a suspect that his attorney seeks to render legal advice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 616 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), quoting <em>Bryan v State, </em>571 A2d 170, 176 (Del, 1990) (emphasis omitted). \u201c \u2018When the opportunity to consult counsel is in fact frustrated, there is no room for speculation what defendant might or might not have chosen to do after he had that opportunity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 617 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), quoting <em>State v Haynes, </em>288 Or 59, 75; 602 P2d 272 (1979). In fact, \u201c \u2018police deception of a suspect through omission of information regarding attorney communications greatly exacerbates the inherent problems of incommunicado interrogation and requires a clear principle to safeguard the presumption against the waiver of constitutional rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 617 n23 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), quoting <em>Moran, </em>475 US at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>452 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I continue to believe that the nature of \u201cincommunicado interrogation requires a per se rule that can be implemented with ease and practicality to protect a suspect\u2019s rights to remain silent and to counsel.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 617 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Once it is understood that <em>Cavanaugh </em>prohibited police interference with counsel\u2019s efforts to communicate with a suspect based on the same state constitutional language that was applied in <em>Bender, </em>the next question is whether <em>Bender </em>merely continued to apply <em>Cavanaugh\u2019s </em>previously created rule or, as the majority argues, created a rule that did not exist before <em>Bender. </em>Therefore, I will review <em>Bender </em>and the plurality opinions from <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich 140, <em>Bender\u2019s </em>predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">III. <em>PEOPLE v WRIGHT </em>AND <em>PEOPLE v BENDER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">As the majority explains, <em>Bender </em>resulted in multiple opinions, and only Chief Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s opinion garnered four votes. In addition, as the majority states, Chief Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s opinion labeled the result of its holding a \u201cprophylactic rule.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 621 (opinion by BRICKLEY, C.J.). However, I disagree with the majority that the arguably \u201cprophylactic\u201d character of the <em>Bender </em>rule deprives the rule of constitutional status. Bather, considering Chief Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s opinion in its entirety, it is clear that he viewed <em>Bender\u2019s </em>\u201cprophylactic\u201d rule in the same mold as <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>\u201cprophylactic\u201d rule. See <em>id. </em>at 620-621 (expressing a preference to \u201capproach the law enforcement practices that are at the core of this case in the same manner as the United States Supreme Court approached the constitutional interpretation task in <em>[Miranda]; </em>namely, by announcing a prophylactic rule\u201d). And, notably, the United States Supreme Court has since explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>although <em>Miranda </em>is labeled a \u201cprophylactic\u201d rule, it is nevertheless a constitutional rule. See <em>Dickerson v United States, </em>530 US 428, 438-440, 444; 120 S Ct 2326; 147 L Ed 2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Moreover, Chief Justice BRlCKLEY\u2019s <em>Bender </em>opinion indisputably recognized the constitutional underpinnings of its analysis. For example, Chief Justice BRICKLEY noted that the case \u201crather clearly implicates both the right to counsel (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20) and the right against self-incrimination (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17),\u201d which are \u201cpart of the bedrock of <em>constitutional </em>civil liberties ....\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 620, 621 (opinion by BRICKLEY, C.J.) (emphasis added). Additionally, Chief Justice BRICKLEY determined that \u201cit is difficult to accept and <em>constitutionally justify </em>a rule of law that accepts that law enforcement investigators, as part of a custodial interrogation, can conceal from suspects that counsel has been made available to them and is at their disposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621 (emphasis added). Thus, Chief Justice BRICKLEY concluded that any other rule would be \u201cinsufficient to guarantee a suspect\u2019s <em>constitutional rights.\u201d Id. </em>at 623 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We also have the benefit of then Justice BRlCKLEY\u2019s further explanation of his <em>Bender </em>opinion by way of his dissent in <em>People v Sexton, </em>458 Mich 43; 580 NW2d 404 (1998). In <em>Sexton, </em>a majority of this Court concluded that <em>Bender </em>did not apply retroactively and implied that <em>Bender </em>lacks a constitutional basis, as the majority concludes today. However, Justice BRICKLEY explained that <em>Bender\u2019s </em>\u201cvery purpose is to protect a suspect\u2019s right to counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination\u201d; therefore, \u201c[t]o deny the <em>constitutional </em>import of <em>[Bender] </em>is to ignore the plain language\u201d of the <em>Bender </em>opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 70 (BRICKLEY, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Accordingly, Justice BRICKLEY flatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>concluded that \u201cthe majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Bender </em>does not implicate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights [is] wrong and without any viable legal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Regardless of whether Chief Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s <em>Bender </em>opinion definitively rooted its analysis in the Michigan Constitution, I nevertheless retain my belief that the <em>Bender </em>rule is a product of our Constitution, because art 1, \u00a7 17 \u201crequires the police to inform the suspect that a retained attorney is immediately available to consult with him, and failure to so inform him before he confesses per se precludes a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent and to counsel.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 597 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">As I did in <em>Bender, </em>I continue to recognize that \u201c[u]nder federal law, a waiver is knowingly and intentionally made where no police coercion was involved and where the defendant understands that he has the right to remain silent and that the state intends to use what he says to secure a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, citing <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 422-423. However, it is also my opinion that \u201cin Michigan, more is required before the trial court may find a knowing and intelligent waiver.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 612 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). Specifically, \u201cin order for a defendant to fully comprehend the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of his decision to abandon it, he must first be informed that counsel, who could explain the consequences of a waiver decision, has been retained to represent him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612-613. This is true because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201c[w]hen that information is withheld, the suspect\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel and to remain silent is more abstract than real, becoming, in effect, a waiver of a theoretical right that is uninformed by the material knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>retained counsel, present and available to assist the suspect in the full exercise of his or her rights, is just outside the door.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 612 n 16, quoting <em>State v Reed, </em>133 NJ 237, 274; 627 A2d 630 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Stated differently, I am</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cunwilling ... to dismiss counsel\u2019s effort to communicate as constitutionally insignificant to the capacity of the suspect to make a knowing and intelligent choice whether he or she will invoke the right to counsel. <em>Miranda </em>warnings refer only to an abstract right to counsel. That a suspect validly waives the presence of counsel only means that for the moment the suspect is foregoing the exercise of that conceptual privilege. Faced with a concrete offer of assistance, however, a suspect may well decide to reclaim his or her continuing right to legal assistance. To pass up an abstract offer to call some unknown lawyer is very different from refusing to talk with an identified attorney actually available to provide at least initial assistance and advice, whatever might be arranged in the long run. A suspect indifferent to the first offer may well react quite differently to the second. We cannot therefore conclude that a decision to forego the abstract offer contained in <em>Miranda </em>embodies an implied rejection of a specific opportunity to confer with a known lawyer.\u201d <em>[Bender, </em>452 Mich at 612 n 16 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), quoting <em>State v Stoddard, </em>206 Conn 157, 168; 537 A2d 446 (1988) (quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Finally, in response to today\u2019s majority, I reiterate my response to the <em>Bender </em>dissent\u2019s assertion that the Michigan Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination provides no greater protection than the Fifth Amendment: \u201cwhen interpreting art 1, \u00a7 17, there is an absence of a direct link to federal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment. Thus, it does not logically follow that in interpreting art 1, \u00a7 17, we must find compelling reasons to interpret our constitution more liberally than the federal constitution.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 613 n 17 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). Rather, this Court must conduct a searching examination to discover what law the people of this state have made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">I also note that Justice BRICKLEY\u2019s dissent in <em>Sexton, </em>458 Mich at 69-70 (BRICKLEY, J., dissenting), and my opinion in <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 611-612 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), cited the plurality opinions in <em>Wright. </em>Thus, although no opinion in <em>Wright </em>garnered majority support, <em>Wright </em>provides further insight into the constitutional basis for the <em>Bender </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In <em>Wright, </em>Justice MALLETT, joined by Justice LEVIN, explained that \u201c[ujnder Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, a criminal suspect is given the right against self-incrimination, a right <em>similar </em>to that provided in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 154 (opinion by MALLETT, J.) (emphasis added). Thus, Justice MALLETT recognized that the right against self-incrimination under the Michigan Constitution is not necessarily exactly the same as the \u201csimilar\u201d right under the federal Constitution merely because the language of the two Constitutions is nearly the same. Rather, the state right may be broader. Indeed, Justice MALLETT concluded just that when he explained that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconfession, made without [knowledge of his attorney\u2019s efforts to speak to him], violated the rights afforded <em>under the Michigan Constitution.\u201d Id. </em>at 155 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">I concurred with Justice MALLETT\u2019s conclusion that the privilege against self-incrimination under the Michigan Constitution is broader than the privilege under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 155-156 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.). I provided further support for that conclusion by noting that, as far back as 1929, this Court had determined that the privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>against self-incrimination under the state Constitution made it unlawful for police to deny an attorney access to his client. <em>Id. </em>at 157-158, citing <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich 680. Finally, Justice BRICKLEY also authored a concurring opinion in <em>Wright, </em>emphasizing the holding in <em>Cavanaugh </em>in support of the conclusion that the Michigan Constitution provides a broader privilege against self-incrimination than the federal Constitution. <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 168 (opinion by BRICKLEY, J.), citing <em>Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Therefore, after tracing the rule prohibiting the police from denying an attorney access to a client undergoing police interrogation from <em>Bender </em>back to <em>Wright, </em>it is clear that although there has not always been majority support for a single view, the justices in support of the <em>Bender </em>rule rooted their analysis in the Michigan Constitution. Moreover, those justices necessarily relied on <em>Cavanaugh </em>(as evidenced by the <em>Bender </em>opinions\u2019 citations of the <em>Wright </em>opinions, which cited Cavanaugh) as the primary source for the broader interpretation of the right against self-incrimination under the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">By rejecting <em>Bender </em>on the grounds that it lacks moorings in the Michigan Constitution, the majority erroneously adopts a \u201cliteral application\u201d of Const 1963 art 1, \u00a7 17, and \u201cignore[s] the jurisprudential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>history of this Court\u201d embodied in <em>Cavanaugh </em>and continued in <em>Wright </em>and <em>Bender </em>\u201cin favor of the analysis of the United States Supreme Court. . . <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744, 758; 506 NW2d 209 (1993).

(citing <em>Wright </em>for the conclusion that \u201cConst 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20 . . . supported suppression of the defendant\u2019s statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cThere is some overlap between the privilege against self-incrimination. . . and the right to counsel;\u201d however, \u201c \u2018the right to counsel cases are concerned with the integrity of the adversarial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 156 n 2 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.), quoting Loewy, <em>Police-Obtained Evidence and the Constitution: Distinguishing Unconstitutionally Obtained Evidence from Unconstitutionally Used Evidence, </em>87 Mich L Rev 907, 928 (1989). As I stated in <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 156 n 2 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.), I believe that permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>police to frustrate counsel\u2019s efforts to communicate with a suspect \u201cthreatens the adversarial system by allowing the police to manipulate the interrogation process,\u201d which is particularly problematic in Michigan, given that under the decision of a majority of this Court in <em>People v Cipriano, </em>431 Mich 315; 429 NW2d 781 (1988), police can purposely delay a suspect\u2019s arraignment. In my view, the majority today exacerbates the errors in <em>Cipriano </em>by sanctioning police efforts during that prearraignment period to obstruct a lawyer\u2019s attempts to contact and advise his client, and to keep the suspect in the dark about the lawyer\u2019s attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><em>Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682, 688; 92 S Ct 1877; 32 L Ed 2d 411 (1972), established the federal limitation on when the right to counsel attaches: the right attaches \u201conly at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.\u201d <em>Kirby </em>further stated that, as an example, the right attaches \u201cat the time of arraignment. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in Michigan, the federal limitation was at least partially rejected in <em>People v Anderson, </em>389 Mich 155; 205 NW2d 461 (1973), and <em>People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323, 338; 217 NW2d 22 (1974) (stating that \u201cindependent of any Federal constitutional mandate,. . . both before and after commencement of the judicial phase of a prosecution, a suspect is entitled to be represented by counsel at a corporeal identification or a photographic identification\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201c[although <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Anderson </em>were not explicitly premised on either the Sixth Amendment or Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20, they support the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>that prearraignment events can trigger our state constitutional right to counsel.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 159-160 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">I continue to believe that <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>and <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>rejection of the <em>Kirby </em>restriction is proper because the <em>Kirby </em>restriction is arbitrary. Specifically, as explained in <em>Patterson v Illinois, </em>487 US 285, 290 n 3; 108 S Ct 2389, 101 L Ed 2d 261 (1988), post-indictment <em>Miranda </em>waivers are sufficient only until an actual attorney-client relationship is established and nothing changes at the time of formal charging if there was no attorney-client relationship yet established. Thus, \u201c[t]he converse must also hold true: If an attorney-client relationship exists before arraignment, nothing will change at the time of arraignment to cause the right to counsel to suddenly blossom where none existed before.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 160 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.). Accordingly, <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Jackson </em>correctly recognized that there are \u201ccritical stages\u201d in prosecution that can occur before formal charging. I continue to believe that \u201ccustodial interrogation of an accused who is represented by counsel is just such a situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160-161. Moreover, in my view, \u201cthe police can be held accountable for knowing that the accused is represented by counsel \u2018to the extent that the attorney or the suspect informs the police of the representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, quoting <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 460 n 46 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Accordingly, because I believe that a suspect \u201cfaced with custodial interrogation has the <em>specific </em>right, as part of his overall right to counsel, to be informed of his attorney\u2019s attempts to contact him,\u201d I would hold that \u201ca waiver of that right cannot be valid when the police merely inform the suspect, in generalized terms, that he has the right to a lawyer if he wishes.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 161 n 5 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.). Simply stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201c[a] defendant cannot knowingly and intelligently waive his <em>specific </em>right to speak with an attorney who is immediately available and trying to contact him when he is unaware that the attorney <em>is </em>available and trying to contact him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, in my view, \u201cthe waiver can only be valid if the suspect is timely and accurately informed of his attorney\u2019s immediate availability and attempts to contact him, and <em>then </em>knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives the right to see the attorney.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In summary, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Bender </em>lacks any connection to the Michigan Constitution, our caselaw establishes that <em>Bender </em>is firmly rooted in art 1, \u00a7 17. Accordingly, <em>Bender </em>was properly decided and should not be overruled. Moreover, in my view, <em>Bender </em>is also supported by the right to counsel under art 1, \u00a7 20.a,</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">V STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In light of the preceding analysis, it is clear that <em>Bender </em>is founded on the Michigan Constitution and is consistent with this Court\u2019s prior precedent. <em>Bender </em>was correctly decided and no further stare decisis consideration is needed. However, even accepting the majority\u2019s faulty conclusion that <em>Bender </em>was wrongly decided, I do not agree that its decision to overrule <em>Bender </em>is supported by stare decisis principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The United States Supreme Court has explained that the doctrine of stare decisis \u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). Our longstanding doctrine of stare decisis provides that \u201cprinciples of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>deliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.\u201d <em>Brown v Manistee Co Rd Comm, </em>452 Mich 354, 365; 550 NW2d 215 (1996) (quotation marks and citations omitted), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </em>477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d 41 (2007). As a result, \u201ca stare decisis analysis should always begin with the presumption that upholding the precedent involved is the preferred course of action.\u201d <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 317; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by MARILYN KELLY, C.J.). Thus, \u201coverturning precedent requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided,\u201d <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180, 211; 795 NW2d 517 (2010), and the presumption in favor of upholding precedent \u201cshould be retained until effectively rebutted by the conclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn the precedent.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 317 (opinion by Marilyn Kelly, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Moreover, when our caselaw concludes that the Michigan Constitution provides greater protection to our citizens than that provided by the federal Constitution, I believe \u201cthis Court should be required to show a compelling reason to depart from [that] past precedent.\u201d <em>Goldston, </em>470 Mich at 559 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), citing <em>People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 50; 475 NW2d 684 (1991) (CAVANAGH, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Several of the criteria discussed in Petersen<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> weigh in favor of upholding <em>Bender </em>rather than overruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>it: (1) <em>Bender </em>provides a practical and workable rule; (2) facts and circumstances have not changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed <em>Bender </em>of significant application or justification; (3) other jurisdictions have adopted rules similar to <em>Bender </em>that are more protective of the privilege against self-incrimination than the federal rule; and (4) overruling <em>Bender </em>is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests. See <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320 (opinion by MARILYN KELLY, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><em>Bender\u2019s </em>per se rule prohibiting police interference with counsel\u2019s efforts to communicate with a suspect is easily understood by the police and creates little, if any, uncertainty regarding what is required: the police must inform a suspect that counsel has been retained for him and is attempting to contact him. <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 620 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). See, also, <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 163-164 (opinion by CAVANAGH, C.J.) (stating that \u201cif an attorney takes diligent steps to inform the police that he represents and wishes to contact a suspect held in custody, the police must take prompt and diligent steps to inform the suspect of that fact\u201d). Accordingly, as even the majority admits, <em>Bender </em>provides a practical and workable rule. See <em>ante </em>at 253. This factor therefore weighs heavily in favor of upholding <em>Bender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Nevertheless, the majority inexplicably applies an approach that merely pays lip service to the obvious practical workability of <em>Bender </em>while primarily considering whether a regime other than the <em>Bender </em>rule might be equally workable. A stare decisis analysis focuses on the <em>established rule\u2019s </em>workability; not whether some other rule may or may not be applied as easily as the established rule. See <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320 (opinion of MARILYN KELLY, C.J.) (considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u201cwhether <em>the rule </em>has proven to be intolerable because it defies practical workability\u201d) (emphasis added); and <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464 (considering \u201cwhether <em>the decision at issue </em>[i.e., the established rule] defies \u2018practical workability\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis added). That focus on the established rule is consistent with the understanding that upholding the precedent involved is \u201cthe preferred course, because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Hohn v United States, </em>524 US 236, 251; 118 S Ct 1969; 141 L Ed 2d 242 (1998) (citation and quotation marks omitted). See, also, <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 317 (opinion by MARILYN KELLY, C.J.). The majority\u2019s faulty stare decisis analysis features its attempt to manipulate this factor with an approach that lacks any support in caselaw and all but ignores the practical workability of the existing rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Further supporting the conclusion that <em>Bender </em>should not be overruled is the fact that circumstances have not come to be seen so differently as to have robbed <em>Bender </em>of significant justification. Indeed, protection of a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights within the custodial-interrogation setting remains as important today as it was when <em>Bender </em>was decided 18 years ago, as evidenced by this Court\u2019s and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s repeated consideration of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Moreover, many states have, as Michigan did in <em>Bender, </em>recognized that <em>Moran </em>merely establishes a minimum requirement and have determined that their citizens enjoy greater state constitutional protection than afforded by <em>Moran.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a result, <em>Bender </em>is far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>from unique in concluding that state law provides greater constitutional protections than the federal Constitution regarding the privilege against self-incrimination. Although I recognize that some states have adopted <em>Moran </em>as consistent with the protections provided by their state Constitutions, the fact that the states are divided on the issue at most renders this factor neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Finally, in my view, the most significant factor in favor of upholding <em>Bender </em>is that the majority\u2019s contrary decision is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests. The majority disagrees, claiming that \u201c[i]t is hard to comprehend a societal interest that is furthered by protecting persons who have engaged in serious criminal activities from the consequences of their own voluntary and intelligent decisions.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 255. To begin with, this statement entirely ignores the overriding principle of our criminal justice system: that a suspect is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, whether there is a \u201csocietal interest\u201d in protecting any particular conduct of a person who has \u201cengaged in serious criminal activities\u201d is entirely irrelevant. However, in my view, the \u201csocietal interest\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>protecting the ability of those <em>merely accused </em>of a crime to make a truly \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of their constitutional rights is of the highest order. Moreover, \u201cif law enforcement officers adhere to <em>[Bender], </em>there will be no reversal of convictions on the basis of failure by officers to inform the suspect that his counsel wished to speak with him before he made a confession.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 597 n 1 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). Therefore, if a <em>Bender </em>violation occurs, \u201cit will be a government agent, and not this Court, that is responsible for thwarting and hampering cases of urgent social concern....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Moreover, I disagree with the majority\u2019s subjective and unsupported conclusion that <em>Bender </em>\u201cimpinge[s] on the effectiveness of law enforcement....\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 254. For starters, it does not appear that Michigan\u2019s law enforcement has suffered from a serious inability to effectively enforce the law in the 18 years since <em>Bender </em>was decided.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Apparently, the many other states that have declined to follow <em>Moran </em>have likewise managed to avoid becoming lawless wastelands of crime, despite the majority\u2019s concern. See, also, <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 460 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (stating that an argument similar to the majority\u2019s \u201cis not supported by any reference to the experience in the states that have adopted\u201d a rule similar to <em>Bender), </em>and <em>Goldston, </em>470 Mich at 568-569 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (considering the similar concern of the majority in that case \u201cthat the high cost of the exclusionaiy rule exacts too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>great a toll on our justice system\u201d and noting that \u201cour state has managed to exist for decades with the exclusionary rule and our streets have yet to become teeming with criminals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Although I think that the majority\u2019s concern that <em>Bender </em>unduly interferes with law enforcement is exaggerated, I am nevertheless aware that the <em>Bender </em>rule \u201cmay decrease the likelihood that interrogating officers will secure a confession.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 618 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). However, that cost must be balanced against the result of the majority\u2019s favored rule. \u201c[PJolice deception of a suspect through omission of information regarding attorney communications greatly exacerbates the inherent problems of incommunicado interrogation. . . .\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 US at 452 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Accordingly, while confessions \u201care not only a valid, but also an essential part of law enforcement,\u201d <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich at 597 n 1 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.), \u201c \u2018[t]he quality of a nation\u2019s civilization can be largely measured by the methods it uses in the enforcement of its criminal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 480, quoting Schaefer, <em>Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, 70 </em>Harv L Rev 1, 26 (1956).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">No system worth preserving should have to fear that if an accused is permitted to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware of, and exercise, [his rights to remain silent and to counsel]. If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system. <em>[Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478, 490; 84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977 (1964).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\"><em>Bender </em>has stood undisturbed for nearly 20 years and has foundations as far back as 1929. See <em>Ca</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>vanaugh, </em>246 Mich 680. Moreover, <em>Bender </em>correctly determined that art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution provides Michigan\u2019s citizens greater protection than its federal counterpart. That conclusion, in my view, is further supported by the Court\u2019s interpretation of art 1, \u00a7 20 of our Constitution. Finally, the doctrine of stare decisis weighs against overruling <em>Bender. </em>Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> This Court also reached the same conclusion in an earlier plurality opinion.

However, by arguing that only \u201cinvoluntary confessions\u201d are prohibited under the Michigan Constitution and that the other limitations are only the product of Miranda\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>interpretation of the federal Constitution, the majority erroneously concludes that our state courts never adopted a broader interpretation of the Michigan Constitution pr <em>e-Miranda, </em>as will be explained later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b324-5\"> The fact that defense counsel did not adopt this view at oral argument is of no moment: \u201cthis Court is not bound by the [parties\u2019] interpretation of the case and may consider and analyze the facts and issues independent of such concession.\u201d <em>Camaj v S S Kresge Co, </em>426 Mich 281, 290 n 6; 393 NW2d 875 (1986), citing <em>Sibron v New York, </em>392 US 40, 58-59; 88 S Ct 1889; 20 L Ed 2d 917 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> The majority cites Ire <em>re Moser, </em>138 Mich 302; 101 NW 588 (1904), and <em>Paramount Pictures Corp v Miskinis, </em>418 Mich 708; 344 NW2d 788 (1984), in support of its conclusion that the Michigan Constitution has not been interpreted to provide more protection regarding self-incrimination than the federal Constitution. However, <em>Moser </em>pre-dates <em>Cavanaugh. </em>Because <em>Cavanaugh </em>granted the protection under the <em>state </em>Constitution, and the framers of the 1963 Michigan Constitution are presumed to have been aware of <em>Cavanaugh, </em>I do not believe that <em>Moser </em>supports the majority\u2019s conclusion.

See <em>Wright, </em>441 Mich at 157-158 (opinion by Cavanagh, C.J.). Moreover, <em>Bender </em>cited <em>Wright </em>for support.

I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to use this case as a vehicle for overruling <em>People v Bender, </em>452 Mich 594; 551 NW2d 71 (1996). While I agree with the majority that \u201cstare decisis is a principle of policy rather than an inexorable command,\u201d I do not find adequate reason to depart from the \u201cpreferred course\u201d of leaving <em>Bender\u2019s </em>settled precedent intact. <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 463-464; 613 NW2d 307 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). First, I do not share the majority\u2019s confidence that the rule recognized in <em>Bender </em>lacks a constitutional basis. Rather, I agree with Justice CAVANAGH that this rule is well moored in Article 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution, with its jurisprudential roots set in <em>People v Cavanaugh, </em>246 Mich 680; 225 NW 501 (1929). I appreciate and, in certain respects, share the majority\u2019s dissatisfaction with <em>Bender\u2019s </em>fractured treatment of this issue; none of the shortcomings I see in the opinion, however, are sufficient to undermine the substantive integrity of its conclusion or render it \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Nor, in my mind, would any other consideration favor disruption of that precedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Justice CAVANAGH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>aptly explains, in the nearly twenty years since <em>Bender </em>was decided, there has' been no indication that its straightforward rule has defied practical workability in any respect, or has produced the \u201cmischief\u201d and harm of which the prosecution and majority warn.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, by now removing this simple and settled rule, the majority works an undue detriment upon the constitutional protection long recognized by this Court and relied upon by the people of Michigan: that should they find themselves detained as suspects of a crime, they will not be held incommunicado from those who have been retained or appointed to advise them. And I see no changes in the law or facts that render <em>Bender\u2019s </em>recognition and implementation of this principle no longer justified. To the contrary, our current debate over the propriety of that rule simply echoes the one taken up by the <em>Bender </em>Court years ago; its contours have remained the same, as have the arguments and authority offered by each side in support. The Justices involved have changed (for the most part), but of course that does not warrant disturbance of our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>I do, however, see one meaningful difference between the instant case and <em>Bender, </em>and it too counsels against the majority\u2019s chosen course. As the majority stresses, there was no dispute in <em>Bender </em>that the defendants made their incriminating statements to the police without requesting or even expressing interest in securing the representation of counsel beforehand. Nonetheless, those statements were suppressed because the police did not inform the defendants of the counsel that their parents had unilaterally decided to retain for them. This fact animated the <em>Bender </em>dissent\u2019s chief objections to that decision\u2019s per se rule, shared by the majority here: that it permits suppression of confessions based strictly on circumstances beyond the cognizance and apparent concern of the suspect, the individual to whom the constitutional rights at issue belong. <em>See Bender, </em>452 Mich at 649-650, 656 (BOYLE, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The instant case, however, is not <em>Bender, </em>and these concerns are not implicated. For, unlike the defendants in <em>Bender, </em>the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements in this case only came after he repeatedly expressed his desire for counsel but to no avail. The first request came when the defendant was initially taken into custody on the morning of October 17, 2011. Upon being read his rights, the defendant indicated that he would not waive them and requested that counsel be provided to him. The interrogating detectives acknowledged the request but nonetheless continued to press him into talking; the defendant, however, again asserted his right to counsel, reiterating, \u201cI would like a lawyer for consultation.\u201d The defendant was then returned to lock-up, and heard nothing further regarding his requests. His next request came the following day, when the jail administrator came to see the defendant in response to his statement to a mental health worker that he \u201chad some things he wanted to get off of his chest.\u201d When the administrator asked if the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cwant[ed] to talk to somebody,\u201d the defendant said yes, and asked, \u201c[C]an you get me an attorney?\u201d After telling the defendant that procuring an attorney was not his job, the administrator offered to get the detectives instead\u2014 the same ones from whom the defendant had already requested counsel. The defendant acquiesced. The defendant\u2019s interest in the assistance of counsel was sufficiently clear at this time that the jail administrator and police contacted the county prosecutor, who arranged for counsel to be appointed and sent to the jail. Nonetheless, at no point during his custody was the defendant given any indication that his rightful requests for counsel would ever, in fact, be honored, regardless of whom or how often he asked \u2014 let alone that such counsel had been appointed and was readily available to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">It was under these circumstances that the defendant\u2019s waiver of rights and incriminating statements were made. The defendant stressed these circumstances in arguing for suppression,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and they, in turn, drove the trial court\u2019s determination to that effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Given these facts, the attorney was there, the police knew it, he was not permitted to go back and see his client.... [The defendant], who had once invoked his right to remain silent and had indicated at least on the 18th with knowledge to the police officials that he might possibly be interested in an attorney, was not told that one was there waiting for him. Based upon that, I will grant the motion of the Defendant to suppress [his] confession . .. . ***[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Both the defendant and the trial court focused on <em>Bender </em>as the legal basis for this conclusion, and fairly so, as its settled and straightforward rule plainly sweeps these circumstances within its scope. The defendant\u2019s frustrated attempts to invoke his right to counsel, however, just as plainly implicate <em>Cavanaugh, </em>which sits at the core of <em>Bender\u2019s </em>rule and persists wholly intact without it. Taking <em>Bender </em>off the books thus does little to resolve the actual evidentiary question at issue in this case: whether the defendant\u2019s statements should be suppressed on constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Bender\u2019s </em>rule, while certainly sufficient to sustain this relief, is not necessary to it. The majority may disapprove of that rule, but <em>Bender </em>is not the case before us, and I fail to see how the instant case invites or enables the majority to act on that disapproval as they have. Accordingly, I cannot join in the majority\u2019s decision to reach beyond the facts of this case to overrule <em>Bender\u2019s </em>settled and sound precedent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> Justice Cavanagh applies <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 317-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by Marilyn Kelly, C.J.), to reach this same conclusion. While I do not likewise rely on that case or framework, I find that much of the substance of his reasoning applies with equal force under the governing standard set forth in <em>Robinson. </em>See <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464 (explaining that, before this Court overrules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>a precedent it deems \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d it \u201cshould also review whether the decision at issue defies \u2018practical workability,\u2019 whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship, and whether changes in the law or facts no longer justify the questioned decision\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> Indeed, I, like Justice Cavanagh, have difficulty seeing how a rule requiring police to inform suspects of their counsel\u2019s availability might produce any sort of detriment with which our society should be duly concerned. I have even more difficulty with the majority\u2019s suggestion that such a rule might harm those suspects themselves, because \u201cpolice officers and prosecutors will almost certainly be more reluctant to facilitate counsel before one is legally required if the consequence is the suppression of evidence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 249 n 37. It is, of course, the deliberate concealment of counsel, not the facilitation of it, that merits suppression under <em>Bender. Bender\u2019s </em>rule would thus only discourage the police and prosecution from assisting in the procurement of counsel if they planned to withhold that counsel from the suspect \u2014 which would be a peculiar form of \u201cfacilitation\u201d from the suspect\u2019s perspective, to say the least, and one not likely to be missed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-5\"> The majority notes that defense counsel conceded before the trial court that the defendant\u2019s eventual waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was \u201cmade voluntarily.\u201d It is entirely clear, however, that counsel did not intend this concession to suggest that the defendant\u2019s unrequited requests for counsel bore no improper influence over his subsequent waiver and confession; rather, counsel consistently emphasized these requests and how they made suppression all the more warranted here than in <em>Bender </em>\u2014 a proposition, as discussed below, with which the trial court appeared to agree. See Defendant\u2019s Brief in Support of Motion to Suppress Statement (explaining that, unlike in <em>Bender, </em>the defendant here invoked his right to counsel, \u201cmak[ing] the police officers!\u2019] actions of not informing the Defendant that an attorney had been appointed to represent him and was present at the jail when they gave him <em>Miranda </em>rights, all the more curious\u201d); Evidentiary Hearing Closing Argument by Defense Counsel (stressing at the outset of his closing argument in favor of suppression that \u201conce [the defendant] invoked his right to an attorney he never really received a benefit from it\u201d; arguing further that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccase is even stronger than\u201d <em>Bender </em>because, <em>inter alia, </em>when the prosecutor was contacted, resulting in appointment of counsel, \u201cit\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>uncontested that there was a request for a lawyer\u201d; and questioning the prosecution\u2019s suggestion that appointed counsel \u201cwas only on standby,\u201d to be made available only \u201cif [the defendant] guessed after asking for a lawyer twice that somehow one would be there for him\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> Accordingly, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s characterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling as simply that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s statement required suppression under Bender, because the police officers had failed to inform him that an attorney was present at the jail and had established contact with the officers.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 206. While this failure was certainly enough in itself to warrant suppression under <em>Bender, </em>it is apparent that the trial court also found significant that this failure came in the face of the defendant\u2019s repeated requests for counsel. Similarly, the majority states that the trial court ruled that the defendant \u201caffirmatively reinitiated contact with police officers on October 18, 2011, without reasserting his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 206. While the majority may be comfortable with that conclusion, I see no determination by the trial court to that effect. Rather, the court recognized, as described above, that the jail administrator came to speak with the defendant upon hearing of his desire to \u201cget something off [his] chest\u201d; \u201cthe first thing that [the defendant] brings up is he asked if [he] could get an attorney\u201d; the administrator declined and offered to get the detectives instead; and the defendant \u201cseemed to understand that and was agreeable for him to get the detectives.\u201d Nor, given these circumstances, did the trial court put much stock in the prosecution\u2019s \u201cno good deed goes unpunished\u201d lament \u2014 echoed by the majority here \u2014 that counsel\u2019s appointment was simply a precautionary measure, voluntarily undertaken and wholly conditional upon whether the defendant (yet again) asked for it. Instead, the court stressed that, although the detective, \u201cand I\u2019m not picking on him, . . . talks about [the attorney] being there only if needed,\u201d there was no confusion among the detectives and the jail administrator that the attorney had been sent for the defendant, and the attorney, while perhaps unsure of the defendant\u2019s name at that time, \u201cknew he was there to talk to somebody and represent them regarding possible charges of murder or homicide that would be filed . . . against them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b350-4\"> Despite their prominence in both the defendant\u2019s arguments and the trial court\u2019s ruling, the majority pays little mind to the defendant\u2019s requests for counsel, summarily suggesting that they were constitutionally meaningless and left the defendant here no differently situated than the defendants in <em>Bender, </em>The majority even holds this case out as emblematic of \u201cthe problems with <em>Bender,\u201d </em>as \u201cthe prosecutor, on behalf of the people, was effectively sanctioned by the suppression of defendant\u2019s voluntary statements for having taken the precaution of seeking out counsel in the event that defendant requested counsel before or during his interrogation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 249 n 37.1, like the trial court, cannot so easily disregard the defendant\u2019s requests for counsel. The record here paints a substantially different and more complicated picture than the one now offered by the majority \u2014 one in which counsel was procured because, indeed, the defendant affirmatively desired and repeatedly asked for it, and in which the prosecution and police have been \u201csanctioned\u201d not for acknowledging those requests, hut for failing to duly honor them. The trial court saw significance in these complications; in light of its due reliance on <em>Bender, </em>however, it was not required to take up the full range of their constitutional import. With <em>Bender </em>now gone, I would leave that assessment to the trial court in the first instance, if and when the defendant again seeks suppression of his statements on a constitutional basis, state or federal, that demands it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
