We hold that in order to trigger the accrual of interest, the plain language of the statute requires a taxpayer to (1) pay the disputed tax, (2) make a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund, and (3) \u201cfile\u201d the claim or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>petition. Although a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d need not take any specific form, it must clearly demand, request, or assert a right to a refund of tax payments made to the Department of Treasury that the taxpayer asserts are not due. Additionally, in order to \u201cfile\u201d the claim or petition, a taxpayer must submit the claim to the Treasury in a manner sufficient to provide the Treasury with adequate notice of the taxpayer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">This case began as a dispute between the parties regarding whether plaintiff owed tax under the now repealed Single Business Tax Act (SBTA) related to plaintiffs contributions to its Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust fund for 1997 through 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On August 3, 2005, the Treasury sent an Audit Determination Letter informing plaintiff that the Treasury had determined that the VEBA contributions were taxable under the SBTA and, on the same day, plaintiff returned the letter to the Treasury after checking the box on the letter indicating that plaintiff \u201cdisagrees with this determination.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Audit Determination Letter incorporated the Audit Report of Findings pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>pared by the Treasury, which acknowledged that plaintiff \u201cdisagrees with the audit determination\u201d and \u201cwant[s] to request a hearing on the contested issue.\u201d During the audit process, plaintiff provided the Treasury with detailed summaries of the amount of disputed tax for each tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">On November 17, 2005, plaintiff requested an informal conference with the Treasury regarding the determination that the VEBA contributions were taxable, among other issues. On August 25, 2006, plaintiff sent a letter to the Treasury withdrawing plaintiffs request for an informal conference, informing the Treasury that plaintiff intended to file a complaint in the Court of Claims, and requesting that the Treasury verify that the disputed tax liability was satisfied with unassigned funds that plaintiff had on deposit with the Treasury. Plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter stated that application of plaintiffs funds on deposit with the Treasury should be viewed as a payment \u201cunder protest\u201d under MCL 205.22. On September 15, 2006, the Treasury sent plaintiff a Final Audit Determination letter assessing plaintiff a tax liability approximately $20 million greater than the single business tax plaintiff previously paid. The Treasury also stated that plaintiff owed approximately $2 million in tax deficiency interest. On September 19, 2006, plaintiff informed the informal conference division that it was withdrawing its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On December 13, 2006, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of Claims asserting that the VEBA contributions were not taxable under the SBTA. That court rejected plaintiffs claim and granted summary disposition to the Treasury. Plaintiff appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the VEBA contributions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>were not taxable under the SBTA. <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>288 Mich App 491; 794 NW2d 357 (2010), lv den 488 Mich 1026 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On August 29, 2011, plaintiff filed a motion in the Court of Claims to enforce the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. Before the motion was decided, the Treasury calculated that it owed plaintiff $15 million rather than the $17 million that plaintiff claimed was due and, on September 19, 2011, the Treasury remitted $15 million to plaintiff. The approximate $2 million difference resulted in part from the parties\u2019 disagreement regarding the date that plaintiff filed its claim for a refund, thus triggering interest accumulation on the refund under MCL 205.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">At a hearing, the parties agreed that overpayment interest began accruing 45 days after the date that plaintiff provided the Treasury with adequate notice of a claim for refund of tax overpayment. Regarding the difference between plaintiffs claim that it was entitled to a $17 million refund rather than the $15 million refund that the Treasury provided, plaintiff argued that September 17, 2005, was the correct date to calculate the amount of overpayment interest because it was 45 days after plaintiff responded to the Treasury\u2019s August 3, 2005 Audit Determination Letter, which plaintiff argued constituted adequate notice of a claim of refund. The Treasury argued that plaintiff did not provide adequate notice until December 13, 2006, when plaintiff filed its initial complaint in the Court of Claims and, therefore, the correct date for calculating the overpayment interest was 45 days after December 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Court of Claims held in plaintiffs favor, ordered the Treasury to pay additional overpayment interest, and directed the Treasury to pay costs and attorney fees to plaintiff. The Treasury appealed, and after reconsid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>eration, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the calculation of overpayment interest, vacated the award of attorney fees, and remanded to the trial court for further consideration of the attorney fees. <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 26, 2013 (Docket No. 306820). We granted leave to appeal, asking the parties to address issues related to the calculation of interest on the refund. <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>495 Mich 861 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND RULES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">This case requires interpretation of the Revenue Act. Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>Malpass v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>494 Mich 237,245; 833 NW2d 272 (2013). A trial court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Detroit v Ambassador Bridge Co, </em>481 Mich 29, 35; 748 NW2d 221 (2008). A factual finding is clearly erroneous \u201conly when the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">When interpreting statutes, \u201cour primary task... is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (citations omitted). To accomplish that task, we begin by examining the language of the statute itself. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIf the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Prior proceedings established that the Treasury erroneously assessed tax on plaintiffs contributions to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>VEBA trust fund; thus, the only issue we consider today is the actions a taxpayer must take to trigger the accumulation of interest on a refund. The Revenue Act, MCL 205.1 <em>et seq., </em>governs refunds of erroneously assessed taxes. Specifically, MCL 205.30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">(1) The department shall credit or refund ... taxes ... erroneously assessed and collected .. . with interest....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">(2) A taxpayer who <em>paid a tax </em>that the taxpayer claims is not due <em>may petition the department for refund of the amount paid </em>within the time period specified as the statute of limitations in [MCL 205.27a], If a tax return reflects an overpayment... the declaration of that fact on the return constitutes a claim for refund. If the department agrees the claim is valid, the amount of overpayment, penalties, and interest shall be first applied to any known liability as provided in [MCL 205.30a] and the excess, if any, shall be refunded to the taxpayer or credited, at the taxpayer\u2019s request, against any current or subsequent tax liability....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">(3) The department shall certify a refund to the state disbursing authority who shall pay the amount out of the proceeds of the tax in accordance with the accounting laws of the state. <em>Interest </em>. . . <em>shall be added to the refund commencing 45 days after the claim is filed </em>or 45 days after the date established by law for the filing of the return, whichever is later. Interest on refunds intercepted and applied as provided in [MCL 205.30a] shall cease as of the date of interception. ... [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Thus, the statutory language establishes that, before interest begins accumulating on a tax refund, a taxpayer must: (1) pay the disputed tax; (2) make a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition;\u201d and (3) \u201cfile\u201d the claim or petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>A. A TAXPAYER MUST PAY THE DISPUTED TAX</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\">The statutory language provides that the Treasury must credit or refund taxes \u201cerroneously . . . collected.\u201d MCL 205.30(1) (emphasis added). Additionally, MCL 205.30(2) establishes what a taxpayer <em>\u201cwhopaid a tax\u201d </em>must do to obtain a refund \u201cof the <em>amount paid.\u201d </em>Emphasis added. Therefore, the statute makes clear what is already obvious: in order to seek a tax refund, a taxpayer must first pay the tax at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">B. A TAXPAYER MUST \u201cPETITION\u201d FOR OR \u201cCLAIM\u201d A REFUND</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">If the taxpayer paid the tax, MCL 205.30(2) provides that a taxpayer may make a \u201cpetition\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d for refund. The Revenue Act does not define \u201cpetition\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d as used in MCL 205.30. Therefore, we presume that the Legislature intended for the words to have their ordinary meaning. MCL 8.3a. To assist in determining the ordinary meaning of the relevant words, we may consult a dictionary. <em>Klooster v City of Charlevoix, </em>488 Mich 289, 304; 795 NW2d 578 (2011) (citation omitted). Relevant definitions of \u201cclaim\u201d include: (1) \u201c[t]o demand as one\u2019s due; assert one\u2019s right to,\u201d (2) \u201c[a] demand for something as one\u2019s rightful due; affirmation of a right,\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: New College Edition, </em>(3) \u201cto ask for esp. as a right,\u201d and (4) \u201cto assert to be rightfully one\u2019s own,\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(11th ed). See, also, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(9th ed) (defining \u201cclaim\u201d in part as \u201c[t]he assertion of an existing right; any right to payment or to an equitable remedy, even if contingent or provisional the &lt;spouse\u2019s claim to half of the lottery winnings&gt;\u201d and \u201c[a] demand for money, property, or a legal remedy to which one asserts a right. . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Because the word \u201cpetition\u201d is used as a verb within MCL 205.30(2), see <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: New College Edition </em>(explaining that when \u201cpetition\u201d is used as a verb, it is \u201c[o]ften followed by <em>for\u201d),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the relevant definitions include: (1) \u201c[t]o ask for by petition; request formally,\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: New College Edition, </em>and (2) \u201cto make a request to: SOLICIT ... to make a request; <em>esp </em>: to make a formal written request,\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(11th ed). See, also, <em>Muldavin v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>184 Mich App 222, 226; 457 NW2d 50 (1990) (holding that under MCL 205.30(2) \u201ctax overpayment would have to be <em>requested </em>either on a... tax return or by separate petition....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Along with the relevant dictionary definitions, our order in <em>NSK Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>481 Mich 884 (2008), provides further insight regarding the proper interpretation of the terms \u201cpetition\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d in MCL 205.30. In <em>NSK Corp, </em>the Treasury conducted an audit and subsequently sent an Audit Determination Letter informing the taxpayer that the taxpayer had overpaid its taxes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The taxpayer responded to the letter by checking the box indicating that the taxpayer agreed with the Treasury\u2019s conclusion that a refund was owed in the amount the Treasury stated, but also checked the box on the letter indicating that the taxpayer disagreed with the Treasury\u2019s determination. Regarding that disagreement, the taxpayer included a written statement demanding interest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the refund under MCL 205.30. The Court of Appeals concluded that the taxpayer was entitled to interest, and that the triggering date for the 45-day waiting period under MCL 205.30(3) was the date that the Treasury sent the Audit Determination Letter to the taxpayer because that was when the Treasury \u201cwas aware that [the taxpayer] was entitled to a refund . . . .\u201d <em>NSK Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>277 Mich App 692, 698; 746 NW2d 886 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">We rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion with respect to the triggering date for accumulation of interest and instead held that MCL 205.30(2) \u201crequires that the claim be one made by the taxpayer seeking a refund <em>either in a tax return or by separate request.\u201d NSK Corp, </em>481 Mich at 884 (emphasis added). We concluded that the taxpayer in <em>NSK Corp </em>did not satisfy that requirement until it \u201cresponded... to the Treasury Department\u2019s Audit Determination Letter, agreeing with the amount of the refund, but demanding interest on the refund.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Today, we reaffirm our interpretation of the statute in <em>NSK Corp: </em>we conclude that under MCL 205.30 a taxpayer can make a claim for a refund in the form of a tax return, as specifically permitted in MCL 205.30(2), or \u201cby separate request.\u201d <em>NSK Corp, </em>481 Mich at 884. Additionally, considering the relevant definitions of \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cpetition,\u201d we further conclude that a taxpayer is not required to make the claim on a specific Treasury form or in any other specific manner in order to satisfy MCL 205.30. Rather, a taxpayer must only \u201cdemand\u201d or \u201crequest\u201d the refund or \u201cassert[] ... an existing right\u201d to the refund. For example, in <em>NSK Corp, </em>the taxpayer responded to the Treasury\u2019s Audit Determination Letter by adding information to the form and returning it to the Treasury. Because the form, combined with the additional information explic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>itly demanded a refund and interest on the refund, it constituted a \u201cclaim\u201d for a refund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Alternatively, a taxpayer could satisfy the statutory requirement by sending a separate letter to the Treasury, as long as the letter included the information necessary to constitute a definite demand for, request for, or assertion of a right to a refund. For example, the taxpayer in <em>Lindsay Anderson Sagar Trust v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>204 Mich App 128, 129; 514 NW2d 514 (1994), \u201cwrote a letter to . . . [the] Treasury <em>requesting a refund of $156,961, </em>which the [taxpayer] claimed had been erroneously paid.\u201d Emphasis added. In short, because a taxpayer can demand, request, or assert a right to a refund by a multitude of methods, we conclude that the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d need not take any specific form, so long as it clearly requests or demands that the Treasury return tax payments that the taxpayer asserts were not due.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">C. THE PETITION OB CLAIM MUST BE \u201cFILED\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Finally, under MCL 205.30(3), interest must only be \u201cadded to the refund commencing 45 days after the claim is <em>filed </em>. . . .\u201d Emphasis added. As with the terms \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cpetition,\u201d the Revenue Act does not define \u201cfiled.\u201d Therefore, we again consult the dictionary for guidance in determining the ordinary meaning of the word. The relevant definitions of \u201cfile\u201d include: (1) \u201cto initiate (as a legal action) through proper formal procedure,\u201d (2) \u201cto submit documents necessary to initiate a legal proceeding,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(11th ed), (3) \u201c[t]o enter (a legal document, for example) on public record or official record,\u201d and (4) \u201c[t]o apply: <em>file for a job,\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: New College Edition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Applying the definitions of \u201cfile\u201d to the statute, we conclude that, in order for a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d for refund to trigger the 45-day waiting period in MCL 205.30(3), the taxpayer must \u201csubmit\u201d the claim to the Treasury. The clear goal of \u201cfiling\u201d the claim is to inform the Treasury that the taxpayer believes that the taxpayer is entitled to a refund. Indeed, the relevant dictionary definitions of \u201cfile\u201d seem to imply that the purpose of the act of \u201cfihng\u201d is to inform or notify others of something, whether it is the filer\u2019s intent to initiate a legal action, apply for a job, or engage in some other activity. Accordingly, as the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Sagar Trust, </em>204 Mich App at 132, \u201ca claim [for a refund] is <em>filed </em>when [the Treasury] receives <em>adequate notice of the claim.\u201d </em>Emphasis added. Indeed, if a taxpayer desires to obtain a refund and seeks to achieve that goal by making a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for the refund, logic requires that the taxpayer must notify the Treasury of the taxpayer\u2019s belief that it is entitled to a refund. Otherwise, the only entity that can grant the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a refund \u2014 the Treasury \u2014 will remain unaware that the taxpayer seeks a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Likewise, interpreting the word \u201cfile\u201d in MCL 205.30(3) as requiring a taxpayer to provide the Treasury with adequate notice of the taxpayer\u2019s claim or petition for a refund is consistent with the purpose of the 45-day waiting period between submission of the claim or petition and the start of interest accumulation on the refund. Specifically, MCL 205.30(2) states that a refund shall be paid \u201c[i]f the [Treasury] department <em>agrees that the claim is valid </em>. . . .\u201d Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>phasis added. Therefore, MCL 205.30(3) creates a 45-day waiting period so that the Treasury can investigate the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a refund and determine its validity before interest begins accumulating. In order to give effect to the legislative intent regarding the 45-day waiting period, the Treasury must be permitted to investigate the claim, and, in order to investigate the claim, the Treasury must have adequate notice of the claim, as the Court of Appeals held in <em>Sagar Trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In summary, when the statute is read as a whole it is clear that, in order to trigger the 45-day waiting period before interest begins to accrue on a tax refund, a taxpayer must (1) have actually paid the tax at issue; (2) make a \u201cpetition . . . for\u201d a refund or \u201cclaim for refund\u201d by demanding, requesting, or asserting a right to a refund of tax payments that the taxpayer made to the Treasury return that the taxpayer asserts are not due; and (3) \u201cfile\u201d the claim or petition by submitting it to the Treasury, thereby providing the Treasury with adequate notice of the taxpayer\u2019s claim for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Applying the above framework to this case, we must first determine when plaintiff paid the disputed tax, because plaintiff could not \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund until after the disputed tax was paid. The record reflects that plaintiff kept unassigned funds on deposit with the Treasury and that plaintiff could assign those funds to its tax liabilities by directing the Treasury to apply the funds to specific tax liabilities. As relevant to this case, the record reflects that plaintiff had funds on deposit with the Treasury sufficient to pay the disputed tax liability no later than October 31,2002, and that the Treasury acknowledged that plaintiff directed the Trea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sury to apply those funds to the disputed tax liability. In addition, during an October 6, 2011 hearing, the trial court concluded that plaintiff had paid the disputed tax liability no later than October 31, 2002. Because the trial court\u2019s conclusion is supported by record evidence, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. Therefore, plaintiff satisfied the first requirement for obtaining a refund \u2014 paying the disputed tax \u2014 no later than October 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Next, we must determine whether plaintiff made a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund. Plaintiff argues that it made a claim or petition for refund on August 3, 2005, when it responded to the Treasury\u2019s Audit Determination Letter by checking the box indicating that plaintiff \u201cdisagrees with this determination.\u201d Specifically, plaintiff contends that its expression of disagreement on August 3, 2005, coupled with the other information known to the Treasury as a result of the audit process, constitutes a claim or petition for refund.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the question is whether, when considered in context with the information known to the Treasury, expressing disagreement with the Treasury\u2019s tax assessment is sufficient to constitute a claim or petition for refund of the money associated with that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">To begin with, there is no dispute that plaintiff made clear its <em>disagreement </em>with the Treasury\u2019s audit determination regarding the taxability of the VEBA contri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>butions and that subsequent court proceedings eventually proved plaintiff correct. Additionally, there may be some appeal to the seemingly logical conclusion that a taxpayer who expresses disagreement with a tax assessment is also likely to request a refund of funds paid to satisfy the disputed assessment. However logical that conclusion may appear, the statutory language nevertheless requires more of \u00e1 taxpayer: the taxpayer must make a claim or petition for a refund, which, as we previously established, requires the taxpayer to explicitly demand, request, or assert a right to a refund. Although expressing disagreement with a tax assessment may <em>imply </em>that the taxpayer may seek a refund, an expression of disagreement alone is not a demand for, request for, or assertion of a right to a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Indeed, although we approached the issue from the opposite direction in <em>NSK Corp </em>because in that case the Treasury determined that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund, we nevertheless reached the same conclusion. Specifically, we held that the 45-day waiting period before interest begins to accrue on a tax refund is not triggered merely because the Treasury is aware that the taxpayer is entitled to a refund. Although it is seemingly logical that a taxpayer entitled to a refund will indeed request that refund, we nevertheless concluded that the statutory language requires something more: the taxpayer must make a \u201cseparate request\u201d for the refund. <em>NSK Corp, </em>481 Mich at 884. Therefore, if the Treasury\u2019s actual knowledge that a taxpayer is entitled to a refund is not sufficient to trigger the 45-day waiting period under MCL 205.30(3), a taxpayer\u2019s mere expression of disagreement with a tax assessment cannot constitute a claim or petition for a refund sufficient to trigger the interest waiting period. Rather, the taxpayer must make a \u201cseparate request\u201d that clearly demands, requests, or asserts a right to a refund. Because plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tiffs August 3, 2005 response to the Audit Determination Letter did not make such a demand, request, or assertion, it was not a \u201cclaim\u201d for a refund under MCL 205.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We also asked the parties to address whether plaintiffs November 17, 2005 request for an informal conference with the Treasury constituted a claim or petition for refund under MCL 205.30. Although a request for an informal conference could potentially constitute a claim or petition for a refund under the statutory language if the request includes a demand or request for or an assertion of a right to a refund, we conclude that plaintiffs request for an informal conference in this case did not make such a demand, request, or assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">First, nowhere in the request for an informal conference did plaintiff expressly demand, request, or assert a right to a refund of the VEBA-contribution tax that plaintiff paid. Rather, the request for an informal conference only expressed plaintiffs disagreement with the result of the Treasury\u2019s audit. In fact, the request for an informal conference stated that plaintiff \u201cwill be working with the [Treasury\u2019s] audit team to narrow the issues in dispute.\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs request for an informal conference seems to indicate that plaintiff believed that the disagreement could be resolved by further negotiations between the parties rather than a claim or petition for refund. Second, plaintiff\u2019s request for an informal conference listed \u201cthe most material items\u201d with which plaintiff disagreed, which included issues that do not form the basis for plaintiff\u2019s refund associated with its VEBA contributions. Therefore, because the request for an informal conference addressed multiple issues, it did not indicate that plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>tiff sought a refund for the tax associated with the VEBA contribution. Rather, the request for an informal conference merely listed multiple points of disagreement. Accordingly, we conclude that the request for an informal conference was not a claim or petition for refund for purposes of MCL 205.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Next, we consider whether plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter to the Treasury constituted a claim or petition for refund under MCL 205.30. The August 25, 2006 letter withdrew plaintiffs request for an informal conference and informed the Treasury that plaintiff would file an action in the Court of Claims. The letter stated that plaintiffs prior payment of the tax assessment associated with plaintiffs VEBA contributions \u201cshould be viewed as a payment under protest within the meaning of MCL 205.22.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Although a taxpayer need not file a lawsuit under MCL 205.22 in order to make a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund, we conclude that the reference to this statute in plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter constituted a claim or petition for refund under MCL 205.30. By referring to MCL 205.22 in expressing plaintiffs decision to institute a formal legal action in a court of law, the August 25, 2006 letter indicated that plaintiff was at that time \u201cclaiming] a refund\u201d as distinctly contemplated by MCL 205.22.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, by notifying the Treasury that plaintiff would resolve the dispute in the Court of Claims pursuant to MCL 205.22, the August 25, 2006 letter asserted a right to a refund by affirmatively notifying the Treasury that plaintiff was making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>what MCL 205.22 itself terms a \u201cclaim\u201d for refund.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter satisfied the second requirement necessary to trigger the 45-day waiting period before interest begins to accrue under MCL 205.30: plaintiff made a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d by informing the Treasury that it intended to file suit in the Court of Claims pursuant to the procedures delineated in MCL 205.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Finally, we must determine whether plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter satisfied the requirement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>claim or petition for refund of the amount paid be \u201cfiled.\u201d As previously discussed, in order to \u201cfile\u201d the claim, a taxpayer must provide the Treasury with adequate notice by \u201csubmitting]\u201d the claim to the Treasury. The August 25, 2006 letter satisfied that requirement because plaintiff mailed the letter to the Treasury, and, as evidenced by the Treasury\u2019s responsive letter dated September 15, 2006, the Treasury received it. See <em>Sagar Trust, </em>204 Mich App at 132 (holding that the Treasury had adequate notice of the taxpayer\u2019s claim and the claim was therefore \u201cfiled\u201d on the date that the taxpayer submitted a letter requesting a refund). Accordingly, all the requirements of MCL 205.30 were satisfied on August 25, 2006, and pursuant to MCL 205.30(3), interest began accruing on the refund 45 days later, on October 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We hold that, in order to satisfy the requirements of MCL 205.30 and trigger the 45-day waiting period before interest begins to accrue on a tax return, a taxpayer must (1) pay the disputed tax, (2) make a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition,\u201d and (3) \u201cfile\u201d the claim or petition. Although a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d need not take any specific form, it must clearly demand, request, or assert a right to a refund. In order to \u201cfile\u201d the claim or petition, a taxpayer must submit the claim to the Treasury, thereby providing the Treasury with adequate notice of the taxpayer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Because the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of MCL 205.30 until it filed its complaint in the Court of Claims on December 13, 2006, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part and instead hold that plaintiff satisfied all of the statutory requirements on August 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>2006. We remand to the trial court for further consideration of the attorney-fee issue.

Plaintiff also notes that, in a September 19, 2005 letter, the Treasury acknowledged that it was aware of plaintiffs disagreement with the tax assessment and argument regarding the VEBA contributions and encouraged plaintiff to pursue legal remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> Specifically, under MCL 205.22(2), in order to pursue an appeal to the Court of Claims, plaintiff was required to \u201cfirst pay the tax, including any applicable penalties and interest, under protest and <em>claim, a refund </em>as part of the appeal.\u201d MCL 205.22(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> The dissent accurately concludes that MCL 205.22(2) imposes two requirements that a taxpayer must satisfy in order to appeal a tax assessment in the Court of Claims: a taxpayer must pay the disputed tax under protest and claim a refund as part of the appeal to the Court of Claims. The dissent also correctly concludes that a taxpayer may pay the disputed tax \u201cunder protest\u201d and \u201cclaim a refund as part of the appeal\u201d in a single action. In fact, the dissent expressly agrees that plaintiff could satisfy both the requirement to pay under protest and the requirement to claim a refund <em>in a single letter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Thus, our only disagreement with the dissent arises from our interpretation of plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter: we interpret plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter to do precisely what the dissent correctly recognizes is permissible. First, plaintiff informed the Treasury that it was paying the disputed VEBA contribution tax assessment \u201cunder protest,\u201d a conclusion with which the dissent agrees. Second, we conclude that by informing the Treasury that plaintiff would file an action in the Court of Claims and referring to MCL 205.22, plaintiff <em>asserted a right </em>to a refund, which, as previously discussed, constitutes a claim or petition for a refund under MCL 205.30. Accordingly, contrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, we do not merely treat plaintiff \u201cas if\u201d it made a claim or petition in its August 25,2006 letter \u2014 plaintiff actually did so by affirmatively notifying the Treasury that it was asserting its right to a refund by undertaking formal legal action. The fact that plaintiff <em>again </em>claimed a refund in its complaint does not preclude the August 25, 2006 letter from constituting a claim or petition for a refund as required by MCL 205.30. To conclude otherwise would require a taxpayer to use the magic words \u201crefund\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d in order to satisfy MCL 205.30, which would be inconsistent with our prior conclusion that a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d need not take any specific form, a conclusion with which the dissent agrees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b463-5\">MarkmAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aee\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur with the majority\u2019s analysis of the law in Part III of the opinion. However, I write separately because I do not believe the majority properly applies its own test in concluding that plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter to the Department of Treasury satisfied the statutory requirements of MCL 205.30. Specifically, I disagree with its conclusion that, by virtue of this letter, \u201cplaintiff made a \u2018claim\u2019 or \u2018petition\u2019 [for a tax refund] by informing the Treasury that it intended to file suit in the Court of Claims pursuant to the procedures delineated in MCL 205.22.\u201d Therefore, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion. I would instead affirm the result of the Court of Appeals and hold that plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of MCL 205.30 until it actually filed its complaint in the Court of Claims on December 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The instant appeal stems from an earlier dispute regarding whether plaintiff Ford Motor Company owed tax under the Single Business Tax Act (SBT) relating to its contributions to its Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust fund for the tax years 1997 through 2001. After auditing plaintiff, the Department of Treasury concluded that VEBA contributions were taxable and assessed taxes accordingly. Although plaintiff repeatedly disagreed with the department\u2019s conclusion that VEBA contributions were taxable, and therefore disagreed with the amount that the audit determined it owed, plaintiff eventually paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>amount assessed by the department \u201cunder protest\u201d with funds that were at that time being held on deposit by the department. Plaintiff subsequently challenged the taxability of VEBA contributions, and the Court of Appeals ultimately held that these were not taxable under the SBT, meaning that plaintiff was due a refund. <em>Ford Motor Co v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>288 Mich App 491; 794 NW2d 357 (2010), lv den 488 Mich 1026 (2011). The issue for purposes of this appeal concerns the proper amount of this refund, as the parties disagree about the date on which plaintiff filed its claim for a refund and thus triggered interest on the refund under MCL 205.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">MCL 205.30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">(1) The department shall credit or refund... taxes .. . erroneously assessed and collected . .. with interest....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">(2) A taxpayer who paid a tax that the taxpayer claims is not due may <em>petition </em>the department for refund of the amount paid within the time period specified as the statute of limitations in [MCL 205.27a]. If a tax return reflects an overpayment... the declaration of that fact on the return constitutes a claim for refund. If the department agrees the claim is valid, the amount of overpayment, penalties, and interest shall be first applied to any known liability as provided in [MCL 205.30a] and the excess, if any, shall be refunded to the taxpayer or credited, at the taxpayer\u2019s request, against any current or subsequent tax liability.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">(3) The department shall certify a refund to the state disbursing authority who shall pay the amount out of the proceeds of the tax in accordance with the accounting laws of the state. Interest.. . shall be added to the refund commencing 45 days after the <em>claim </em>is filed or 45 days after the date established by law for the filing of the return, whichever is later. Interest on refunds intercepted and applied as provided in [MCL 205.30a] shall cease as of the date of interception .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The majority appropriately concludes that, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>trigger the accrual of overpayment interest under this statute, a taxpayer must: \u201c(1) \u201cpay\u201d the disputed tax, (2) make a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund, and (3) \u201cfile\u201d the claim or petition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">To satisfy the second requirement of this test, the majority concludes that plaintiff made a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund in an August 25, 2006 letter sent to the department. That letter informed the department that plaintiff no longer wished to proceed with an informal conference that had previously been scheduled, that it would file an action in the Court of Claims asserting that VEBA contributions were not taxable, and that plaintiff was paying the assessed tax on its VEBA contributions \u201cunder protest within the meaning of MCL 205.22.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, this letter cannot be best understood as constituting a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund for purposes of MCL 205.30, quite simply because it nowhere \u201cclaims or petitions\u201d any right to a refund. That is, while the letter did request that the audit deficiency be satisfied with funds held \u201con deposit,\u201d and that this be viewed as a \u201cpayment under protest,\u201d plaintiff (a) nowhere asked for its money back; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>(b) nowhere made any apparent demand that the department return funds that rightfully belonged to plaintiff; (c) nowhere asserted that it believed it was entitled to a refund; and (d) nowhere even alluded to, or referred to, a refund. While the letter may well <em>imply </em>that plaintiff intended to seek a refund \u2014 as it might logically follow that any taxpayer who \u201cpays under protest\u201d desires the return of his or her payments \u2014 by the majority\u2019s own language, a mere \u201cimplication\u201d does not satisfy the requirement that the taxpayer \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund. <em>Ante </em>at 398 (\u201cAlthough expressing disagreement with a tax assessment may imply that the taxpayer may seek a refund, an expression of disagreement alone is not a demand for, request for, or assertion of a right to a refund.\u201d). The requirements set forth in MCL 205.30 are not complicated; a taxpayer either makes the \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund, or it does not. It is not up to the department to attempt to read the taxpayer\u2019s mind, or to parse the taxpayer\u2019s language and actions with a fine comb, or to assess the totality of surrounding circumstances in order to surmise what was within the taxpayer\u2019s contemplation. If there is a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d (a \u201cdemand, request, or assertion\u201d) for a refund, the taxpayer has satisfied the statute; if there is not, the taxpayer has not. The law could not be more clear or more straightforward. Given plaintiff\u2019s failure in any way to make a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund in its August 25, 2006 letter, I find the conclusion inescapable that it did not satisfy the second requirement of the statute on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">To support its contrary conclusion, the majority relies on plaintiffs invocation of MCL 205.22 in its letter. This provision specifies that, \u201c[i]n an appeal to the court of claims, the appellant shall first pay the tax, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>including any applicable penalties and interest, under protest <em>and </em>claim a refund as part of the appeal.\u201d [Emphasis added.] According to the majority, because MCL 205.22 itself requires a claim for a refund, plaintiffs reference to this statute satisfied the \u201cclaim or petition\u201d requirement of MCL 205.30, as such reference \u201caffirmatively notif[ied] the Treasury that plaintiff was making what MCL 205.22 itself terms a \u2018claim\u2019 for refund.\u201d However, even if a taxpayer <em>could </em>affirmatively assert a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund by referring to another statute, plaintiff did not do so by making a \u201cpayment under protest\u201d while invoking MCL 205.22. This is because MCL 205.22 clearly differentiates between a payment under protest and a claim for a refund. That is, the taxpayer must <em>first </em>\u201cpay the tax . .. under protest,\u201d and then, <em>secondly, </em>\u201cclaim a refund as part of the appeal.\u201d MCL 205.22(2). By concluding that the August 25, 2006 letter constituted a claim for a refund on the basis of the invocation of MCL 205.22, the majority conflates these two distinct statutory requirements. If plaintiffs payment under protest <em>itself </em>constituted the claim for a refund for purposes of MCL 205.30, the second requirement of MCL 205.22 \u2014 that there be a \u201cclaim [of] a refund\u201d \u2014 would be rendered utterly meaningless in contravention of the rule that \u201c [i]n interpreting a statute, we [must] avoid a construction that would render part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>People v McGrow, </em>484 Mich 120, 126; 771 NW2d 655 (2009). The majority also fails to recognize that because MCL 205.22(2) states that a claim must be made \u201cas part of the appeal\u201d following the payment under protest, when plaintiff stated that it was paying \u201cunder protest within the meaning of MCL 205.22,\u201d the department had every reason based on the language of the statute to believe that the August 25, 2006 letter was not a claim for a refund, but that the claim would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>be <em>forthcoming </em>as part of the appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, the majority treats plaintiff <em>as if </em>it had made a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund in its August 25, 2006 letter, when it did not actually do so, based exclusively on plaintiffs invocation of a statute that itself logically suggests that plaintiff had <em>yet </em>to make such a \u201cclaim or petition.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJM\">By concluding that the August 25, 2006 letter constituted a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund for purposes of MCL 205.30, the majority injects unnecessary uncertainty into its own test by suggesting to future taxpayers that they need not make an actual \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund to trigger the accrual of interest under MCL 205.30, but that some uncertain aggregation of other statements and actions might suffice if they come \u201cclose enough\u201d to constituting a \u201cclaim or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>petition.\u201d After all, if plaintiffs failure to actually \u201cclaim or petition\u201d is to be disregarded, its actions effectively will establish a new threshold for satisfying MCL 205.30, and it will not be at all surprising when the next taxpayer\u2019s actions which approximate, but fall slightly short of actual compliance with this <em>new </em>threshold, are also viewed as being \u201cclose enough\u201d to satisfy MCL 205.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Because I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis that in order to trigger the accrual of interest for purposes of MCL 205.30 a taxpayer must \u201cmake a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund,\u201d I concur in Part III of the majority opinion; however, because I disagree with the majority that plaintiff made such a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d in its August 25, 2006 letter, I dissent from that portion of Part IV of the majority opinion. I would instead hold that plaintiff satisfied the requirements of MCL 205.30 when it filed its complaint, which included a claim for a refund, in the Court of Claims on December 13,2006. In that document, plaintiff asked the court to \u201corder a refund in excess of $12,323,625 for the Single Business Taxes paid under protest by Ford. . . .\u201d Accord <em>NSK Corp v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>481 Mich 884 (2008) (taxpayer made a claim for a refund for purposes of MCL 205.30, not when department knew that taxpayer was entitled to a refund, but only when taxpayer made an affirmative request for such refund). Therefore, I would affirm the result of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated in Part III of the majority opinion and in this dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b469-5\">Young, C.J., and Viviano, J., concurred with Mark-man, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-5\"> The majority, not unreasonably, relies on dictionary definitions to conclude that to make a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d for a refund, a taxpayer must \u201cdemand, request, or assert\u201d such a right. While I do not quarrel with these definitions, as I agree it is useful in the course of interpretation to examine the ordinary meanings of terms used in a statute, I believe that the words actually chosen by the Legislature \u2014 \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cpetition\u201d \u2014 are sufficiently clear to render unnecessary repeated references to their synonyms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> Specifically, the letter stated \u201c[i]t is our intent to withdraw our case from Informal Conference and file an action with the Court of Claims on the unresolved issues.

Indeed, plaintiff could without difficulty have made a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund in the very same <em>sentence </em>as its payment under protest by including some type of a \u201cdemand, request, or assertion\u201d of a right to a refund. Nothing in the statute prohibits such a \u201cdual purpose\u201d letter. However, given the absence of such a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d in the letter, the department did not act unreasonably in its assumption that, consistent with MCL 205.22, plaintiffs claim would be <em>forthcoming. </em>Consequently, our conclusion that plaintiffs August 25, 2006 letter did not itself constitute a \u201cclaim or petition\u201d for a refund does not \u201crequire a taxpayer to use the magic words \u2018refund\u2019 and \u2018claim\u2019 or \u2018petition\u2019 in order to satisfy MCL 205.30,\u201d but only requires a taxpayer to make some form of the very \u201cpetition or claim\u201d (\u201cdemand, request, or assertion\u201d) required by the majority itself.
