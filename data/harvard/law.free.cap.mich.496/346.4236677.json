Applying the stepparent adoption statute to the instant case, the circuit court terminated respondent-father\u2019s parental rights to the minor child and also allowed petitioner-stepfather \u2014 who is married to petitioner-mother \u2014 to adopt the minor child. The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that because respondent and petitioner-mother shared joint legal custody of the child, petitioner-mother was not <em>\u201cthe </em>parent having legal custody of the child\u201d as required by the stepparent adoption statute. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because when the role of the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d within the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>scheme is considered, it is clear that the Legislature intended that phrase to refer to the parent with sole legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">We also reject petitioners\u2019 argument, made for the first time on appeal before this Court, that petitioner-mother is the sole parent having legal custody of the child because she is the parent with legally sanctioned physical custody of the child. Michigan has long recognized that the concepts of legal custody and physical custody are distinct and allocable between parents. This has been so since before the enactment of MCL 710.51(6). Petitioner-mother has always been free to seek modification of the custody arrangement under MCL 722.27. If on remand petitioner-mother secures sole legal custody of the child, then petitioners may proceed with stepparent adoption under MCL 710.51(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Respondent and petitioner-mother were married in 2003. The couple had one child during their marriage, AJR, but divorced in 2009. The divorce judgment awarded custody of AJR as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">The parties shall share joint legal custody and [petitioner-mother] shall have the physical custody of the minor child....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The divorce judgment also placed support obligations on respondent and provided that he would be given reasonable visitation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Petitioner-mother married petitioner-stepfather in June 2010. The couple lived together with AJR as a family. In May 2012, petitioners sought to terminate respondent\u2019s parental rights to allow petitioner-stepfather to adopt AJR. Petitioners filed a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>stepparent adoption consistent with MCL 710.51(6)(a) and (b), alleging that \u201c[t]he noncustodial parent has failed to provide support or comply with a support order and failed to visit or contact the adoptee for a period of 2 years or more.\u201d They also filed a supplemental petition and affidavit to terminate the parental rights of the noncustodial parent, alleging that \u201c[a] support order has been entered and the noncustodial parent has failed to substantially comply with the order for a period of two years or more before the petition for adoption was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Following a two-day evidentiary hearing, the circuit court issued an opinion and order granting the petition and terminating respondent\u2019s parental rights pursuant to MCL 710.51(6). The circuit court found that respondent had substantially failed to provide support for the child for the two years preceding the filing of the petition and that respondent had substantially failed to visit or communicate with the child during the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Respondent appealed by right in the Court of Appeals, which reversed the circuit court\u2019s order terminating his parental rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cbecause [respondent] and the mother had joint legal custody over the child and the statute only acts to terminate the rights of those parents who do not have legal custody, [respondent\u2019s] rights were improperly terminated.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that the language \u201cif <em>the </em>parent having legal custody of the child\u201d in the statute must \u201cbe construed as requiring the parent initiating termination proceedings to be <em>the only parent </em>having legal custody.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that \u201c[t]he rights of a parent who maintains joint legal custody are not properly terminated under MCL 710.51(6).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals observed that the articles \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d have different meanings and that the Legislature uses the term \u201cthe,\u201d rather than \u201ca\u201d or \u201can,\u201d to refer to something particular.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also reasoned that, when possible, every word and phrase in a statutory provision must be given effect and that a court \u201cshould not ignore the omission of a term from one section of a statute when that term is used in another section of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7The Court of Appeals applied this principle, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Notably, the preceding subsection in the statute, MCL 710.51(5), uses the phrase <em>\u201ca </em>parent having legal custody\u201d to refer to whom that particular subsection applies. Contrastingly, MCL 710.51(6) refers to <em>\u201cthe </em>parent having legal custody.\u201d We presume that the Legislature intended to use the more general phrase <em>\u201ca </em>parent\u201d to refer to either of the child\u2019s parents in MCL 710.51(5) and that the omission of a general article in MCL 710.51(6) was intentional.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">It being undisputed that the divorce judgment provided that respondent and petitioner-mother would maintain joint legal custody of AJR, the Court of Appeals concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>that MCL 710.51(6), which requires that the petitioning parent be <em>\u201cthe </em>parent having legal custody,\u201d was inapplicable in the instant case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal to determine whether MCL 710.51(6) necessarily refers to <em>\u201cthe\u201d </em>sole parent with legal custody and whether the term \u201clegal custody\u201d in the statute is synonymous with the concept of joint custody in \u00a7 6a(7)(b) of the Child Custody Act, MCL 722.26a(7)(b), under which the parents \u201cshare decision-making authority as to the important decisions affecting the welfare of the child,\u201d and also to explore the remedies, if any, available to the petitioners in this case if the Court of Appeals had not erred in interpreting MCL 710.5K6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Whether the application of the stepparent adoption provision is limited to situations in which one parent has sole legal custody of the child is a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">A. INTERPRETING MCL 710.51(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">As always, the objective of statutory interpretation \u201cis to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent,\u201d and \u201c[t]o ascertain that intent, this Court begins with the statute\u2019s language.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cWhen that language is unambiguous, no further judicial construction is required or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>permitted, because the Legislature is presumed to have intended the meaning it plainly expressed. \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[w]hen interpreting a statute, courts must ascertain the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute,\u201d which \u201crequires courts to consider the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">MCL 710.51(6) provides for the termination of parental rights in the context of stepparent adoption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">(6) If the parents of a child are divorced, or if the parents are unmarried but the father has acknowledged paternity or is a putative father who meets the conditions in [MCL 710.39], and if the parent having legal custody of the child subsequently marries and that parent\u2019s spouse petitions to adopt the child, the court upon notice and hearing may issue an order terminating the rights of the other parent if both of the following occur:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">(a) The other parent, having the ability to support, or assist in supporting, the child, has failed or neglected to provide regular and substantial support for the child or if a support order has been entered, has failed to substantially comply with the order, for a period of 2 years or more before the filing of the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">(b) The other parent, having the ability to visit, contact, or communicate with the child, has regularly and substantially failed or neglected to do so for a period of 2 years or more before the filing of the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Accordingly, a court may only terminate parental rights under the stepparent adoption statute after concluding that both Subdivision (a) and (b) are satisfied, and also that the conditions provided in the preceding paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>are satisfied.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody of the child\u201d in the preceding paragraph of the stepparent adoption statute is the focus of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Petitioners maintain that the Court of Appeals erred by interpreting the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody of the child\u201d as necessarily referring to the sole parent with legal custody. We disagree because when the role of the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d within the statutory scheme is considered, it is clear that the Legislature intended that phrase to refer to the parent with <em>sole </em>legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">When interpreting the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody,\u201d we may consider the role of this phrase within the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under the Michigan Adoption Code, two provisions are particularly relevant when considering the process by which a stepparent may adopt a child: MCL 710.51 and MCL 710.43. There are two possible avenues pursuant to MCL 710.51 for a petitioning stepparent to adopt a child: adoption by parental consent under MCL 710.51(1) and the procedure for stepparent adoption provided in MCL 710.51(6). MCL 710.43 provides the rules regarding the consent required under MCL 710.51(1) for adoption by parental consent, and MCL 710.43(7) specifically addresses the requirements for <em>stepparent </em>adoption by parental consent. MCL 710.43(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">If the petitioner for adoption is married to <em>the parent having legal custody </em>of the child and that parent has joined the petitioner in filing the petition for adoption, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>parent shall not execute a consent to the adoption. The consent of <em>the parent who does not have legal custody </em>of the child and whose parental rights have not been terminated shall be executed before the court may enter an order of adoption under [MCL 710.56], [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Thus, in order for a petitioning stepparent to adopt a child by parental consent, the parent without legal custody must consent. By directly contrasting the phrases \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d and \u201cthe parent who does <em>not </em>have legal custody,\u201d we conclude that the Legislature intended \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d to mean the parent with <em>sole </em>legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Conversely, when consent from a parent without legal custody has not or cannot be obtained, MCL 710.51(6) provides an alternative procedure that allows the spouse of \u201cthe parent having legal custody of the child\u201d to petition the court to involuntarily terminate the other parent\u2019s parental rights, if the statutory requirements have been satisfied, so that the child may then be adopted by the spouse of the parent with legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Importantly, the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d appears in both MCL 710.51(6) and MCL 710.43(7). Because the Legislature chose to use the same phrase in MCL 710.51(6), which like MCL 710.43(7) also addresses stepparent adoption, we conclude that the Legislature intended for that phrase to have the same meaning. In other words, because the Legislature expressly contrasted the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d with the phrase \u201cthe parent who does not have legal custody\u201d in MCL 710.43(7), the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d within MCL 710.51(6) also was intended to be contrasted with the parent not having legal custody.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cother parent\u201d in MCL 710.51(6) refers to the parent not having legal custody pursuant to the distinction made in MCL 710.43(7). Moreover, the plain language of the statute does not otherwise indicate that the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d should be interpreted differently in the context of MCL 710.51(6) than it is in MCL 710.43(7).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, when consent to stepparent adoption has not or cannot be obtained, petitioners must follow the statutory procedures to obtain sole legal custody before seeking termination of the respondent-parent\u2019s parental rights under MCL 710.51(6). For these reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d in MCL 710.51(6) is inapplicable to situations involving joint legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Petitioners also invite this Court to reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment by resorting to the absurd-results doctrine of statutory interpretation. Specifically, petitioners argue that the statutory construction of the Court of Appeals is absurd because, under that construction, stepparent adoptions will never be possible when the other parent has joint legal custody, even if that parent has failed to regularly support or maintain contact with the child for the period provided in MCL 710.51(6). But there is nothing absurd about limiting the application of MCL 710.51(6) exclusively to parents having sole legal custody. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>cern, a parent who shares joint legal custody is free to seek modification of that custody arrangement under MCL 722.27 and may proceed with stepparent adoption under MCL 710.51(6) after securing sole legal custody of the child.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This result is akin to the scheme provided in the juvenile code, which in MCL 712A.19b(l) requires that a court \u201cshall hold a hearing to determine if the parental rights to a child should be terminated and, if all parental rights to the child are terminated, the child placed in permanent custody of the court.\u201d The hearing required under MCL 712A.19b(l) is a separate proceeding from a review hearing under MCL 712A.19 or a permanency planning hearing under MCL 712A.19a. We do not question the Legislature\u2019s wisdom in enacting MCL 710.51(6). While it might be debatable whether the policy behind the statute is a good one, its plain application to the facts of this case does not produce an absurd result. Simply put, there is nothing absurd about requiring a separate proceeding for the sake of modifying a preexisting custodial arrangement falling outside the scope of the stepparent adoption statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">Having concluded that the stepparent adoption statute applies only to those situations involving a sole legal custodian, we address petitioners\u2019 alternative argument, which they raise for the first time on appeal before this Court, that petitioner-mother <em>is </em>the sole parent having legal custody of AJR because she is <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>parent with \u201clegally sanctioned physical custody of AJR.\u201d Petitioners premise this argument on the notion that when the stepparent adoption statute was added in 1980 the term \u201clegal custody\u201d in what ultimately became MCL 710.51(6)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> meant \u201ca legal right to physical custody.\u201d They argue that despite the fact that the divorce judgment granted joint legal custody to respondent and petitioner-mother, the divorce judgment also granted sole physical custody to petitioner-mother, and therefore, petitioner-mother is \u201cthe parent having legal custody\u201d of AJR.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The term \u201clegal custody\u201d is not defined in the Michigan Adoption Code. An undefined term must be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning, except when the term has acquired a unique legal meaning, in which case the term \u201c \u2018shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The term legal custody has acquired a unique legal meaning in Michigan law, and because of this, we interpret the term in accordance with its meaning in legal dictionaries and at common law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The ninth edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(published in 2009) defines the term \u201ccustody\u201d in the family-law context as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">[t]he care, control, and maintenance of a child awarded hy a court to a responsible adult. \u2022 Custody involves legal custody (decision-making authority) and physical custody (caregiving authority), and an award of custody [usually] grants both rights[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>This Court recently discussed the distinction between physical custody and legal custody, albeit under the Child Custody Act. In <em>Grange Ins Co of Mich v Lawrence </em>we noted that \u201c[p]hysical custody pertains to where the child shall physically \u2018reside,\u2019 whereas legal custody is understood to mean decision-making authority as to important decisions affecting the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Neither this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Grange </em>nor the ninth edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>supports petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the term \u201clegal custody.\u201d Nonetheless, petitioners\u2019 interpretation is not without support. Our inquiry is the intent of the Legislature that in 1980 added the provision that ultimately became the statute before us,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> MCL 710.51(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">To determine the Legislature\u2019s intent in 1980, we refer to a contemporaneous legal dictionary. The prominent legal dictionary in use in 1980 \u2014 the fifth edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(published in 1979) \u2014 did not expressly acknowledge the distinction between \u201clegal custody\u201d and \u201cphysical custody\u201d in the family-law context.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Rather, the fifth edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defined \u201ccustody of children\u201d as \u201c[t]he care, eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>trol and maintenance of a child which may be awarded by a court to one of the parents as in a divorce or separation proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This definition \u2014 and the lack of a definition of \u201cjoint custody\u201d in the fifth edition\u2014 reflect the reality that in 1980 it was not unusual for one parent to come away from a divorce with sole physical and legal custody of a child.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Although the legal dictionary contemporaneous with the statute arguably supports petitioners\u2019 premise that \u201clegal custody\u201d included a right to physical custody in 1980, other factors militate against petitioners\u2019 interpretation. While the term \u201ccustody\u201d was and is often used to refer to the complete bundle of custodial rights (i.e., both physical and legal custody), petitioners\u2019 theory relies on the meaning of <em>\u201clegal </em>custody.\u201d Insight into the meaning of the term \u201clegal custody\u201d can be found by review of a related statute \u2014 MCL 722.26a \u2014 which was added during the same legislative session in which MCL 710.51(6) was added.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> MCL 722.26a(7), a portion of the Child Custody Act concerning joint custody, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">(7) As used in this section, \u201cjoint custody\u201d means an order of the court in which 1 or both of the following is specified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">(a) That the child shall reside alternately for specific periods with each of the parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>(b) That the parents shall share decision-making authority as to the important decisions affecting the welfare of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Thus, the Legislature divided the concept of custody into two categories \u2014 custody in the sense of the child residing with a parent and custody in the sense of a parent having decision-making authority regarding the welfare of the child. Therefore, the joint-custody rules established by the Legislature in the same session in which the stepparent adoption statute was added directly contravene petitioners\u2019 assertion that custody is an indivisible concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A survey of Michigan caselaw further confirms that physical custody and legal custody were distinct concepts, allocable between parents, well before 1980. In <em>Burkhardt v Burkhardt, </em>a case decided by this Court in 1938, the circuit court modified its custody order to state that \u201c[the father] shall have the legal custody and control of said minor child . . . but that said child shall be in the actual care and custody of [third parties who had contracted to care for the child]. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In other words, the father in <em>Burkhardt </em>was awarded legal custody but not physical custody. Similarly, <em>Foxall v Foxall, </em>a 1947 decision of this Court, involved a 1946 custody order that also distinguished between legal custody and physical custody by providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">the legal custody of the children [would] remain in the friend of the court and their physical custody [would] remain with the father until the further order of the court, but upon the condition that the children remain at the home of their paternal grandmother under the present prevailing conditions.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Additionally, <em>Lustig v Lustig, </em>a case decided by the Court of Appeals in 1980, involved a 1979 custody order that distinguished between legal custody and physical custody, providing \u201cthat legal custody of the minor children ... be awarded jointly to the parents, plaintiff and defendant herein,\u201d and that \u201c[pjhysical custody of [one of the children] was to alternate between plaintiff and defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Finally, in <em>Wilcox v Wilcox, </em>a case decided by the Court of Appeals in 1980, the Court expressly recognized the distinction between legal custody and physical custody, stating, \u201cThere is a difference between joint legal custody, which is concerned with making decisions which significantly affect the life of a child, and joint physical custody, which is concerned with the child living with the parent.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Indeed, <em>Burkhardt, Foxall, Lustig, </em>and <em>Wilcox </em>illustrate that the concepts of legal custody and physical custody were divisible long before the enactment of MCL 710.51(6).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We also find persuasive that the subsequent edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(the sixth and centennial edition) published 11 years after the fifth edition and 9 years after the enactment of the stepparent adoption statute, defines \u201cjoint custody\u201d as involving</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">both parents sharing responsibility and authority with respect to the children; it may involve joint \u201clegal\u201d custody and joint \u201cphysical\u201d custody. Such includes physical sharing of child in addition to both parents participating in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>decisions affecting child\u2019s life, <em>e.g., </em>education, medical problems, recreation, etc .. . .[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The definition of \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d did not evolve into its contemporary understanding overnight, but it does seem quite clear, at least <em>a posteriori, </em>that many state courts during the 1980s either already recognized, as Michigan courts did, or increasingly began to embrace the above understanding of joint legal custody. Given that Michigan courts had acknowledged the concept of \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d well before the enactment of MCL 722.26a(7), we find it entirely plausible that the Michigan Legislature had likewise embraced this understanding of joint legal custody when it added MCL 710.51(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In sum, petitioners simply fail to demonstrate that \u201clegal custody\u201d ever meant a legal right to physical custody or that the concepts of physical custody and legal custody are or ever were inextricably merged. Rather, pre-1980 evidence demonstrates that legal custody and physical custody were separate concepts allocable between parents long before the enactment of the stepparent adoption statute. Even before 1980, a parent could have had legal custody without having the legal right to physical custody. In light of these conclusions, and because the divorce judgment clearly awarded joint legal custody to respondent and petitioner-mother, petitioner-mother was not \u201cthe parent having legal custody,\u201d and therefore, the stepparent adoption statute did not apply in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>B. REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In light of our holdings, we now address \u201cwhat, if any, remedy is available to the petitioners in this case that is consistent with the general purposes of the Adoption Code, MCL 710.21a.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Under the Child Custody Act, the court may \u201c[m]odify or amend its previous judgments or orders for proper cause shown or because of change of circumstances until the child reaches 18 years of age . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, petitioner-mother has always been free to seek modification of the custody arrangement so that she is the parent having sole legal custody of AJR. If she does so and her request is granted, petitioners may proceed with stepparent adoption under MCL 710.51(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Requiring such action is not unduly burdensome and is consistent with the general purposes of the Michigan Adoption Code, which exists not only to \u201csafeguard and promote the best interests of each adoptee,\u201d but also to \u201cprotect the rights of all parties concerned.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This approach is also consistent with the general presumption followed by Michigan courts that, when a third party such as petitioner-stepfather is involved, a child\u2019s best interests are served by awarding custody to the natural parent or parents.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Consequently, petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>have an avenue by which to pursue stepparent adoption, while at the same time respondent may defend his custodial rights to the extent provided by law.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This is the legal framework provided by the Legislature; to the extent that petitioners argue that this remedy is unrealistic or practically unavailable, we disagree. However, we note that to the extent that petitioners are dissatisfied with the remedy available to them in light of their circumstances, they may seek recourse from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Because the express language of MCL 750.51(6) provides that stepparent adoption under the statute is only available to the spouse of \u201cthe parent having legal custody of the child,\u201d meaning the parent with sole legal custody, the statute does not apply to situations like the instant case in which the parents share joint legal custody of the child. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Petitioners are free to seek modification of the custody arrangement under MCL 722.27. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-7\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Markman, Kelly, McCormack, and Viviano, JJ., concurred with Zahra, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> <em>In re AJR, </em>300 Mich App 597; 834 NW2d 904 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 602.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 602-603, citing <em>Paige v Sterling Hts, </em>476 Mich 495, 509-510; 720 NW2d 219 (2006) (holding that \u201cthe\u201d used in front of \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the statute before the Court referred to the <em>sole </em>proximate cause, thereby clarifying that the phrase \u201cthe proximate cause\u201d exclusively contemplates <em>one </em>cause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> <em>AJR, </em>300 Mich App at 603.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc., </em>442 Mich 201, 210; 501 NW2d 76 (1993), and <em>Robinson v City of Lansing, </em>486 Mich 1, 14 n 13; 782 NW2d 171 (2010) (stating that reviewing courts \u201cmust follow these distinctions between \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019 because the Legislature has directed that \u2018[a]U words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language\u2019 \u201d), quoting MCL 8.3a (alteration in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b412-11\"> <em>Id. </em>at 603-604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\"> <em>In re AJR, </em>495 Mich 875, 875-876 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b412-13\"> <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 413; 596 NW2d 164 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b412-14\"> <em>People v Stone, </em>463 Mich 558, 562; 621 NW2d 702 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\"> <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\"> <em>Fradco, Inc </em>v <em>Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>495 Mich 104, 112; 845 NW2d 81 (2014) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> <em>In re Hill, </em>221 Mich App 683, 692; 562 NW 2d 254 (1997); see also <em>ISB Sales Co v Dave\u2019s Cakes, </em>258 Mich App 520, 529; 672 NW2d 181 (2003) (reasoning that a proviso preceded by \u201cif\u201d \u201crestricts the operative effect of statutory language to less than what its scope of operation would be otherwise\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> <em>Fradco, </em>495 Mich at 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> See <em>Robinson, </em>486 Mich at 16 (stating that \u201cthe Legislature is not required to be overly repetitive in its choice of language\u201d).
