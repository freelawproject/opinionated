We conclude that it does not. The 2010 amendment of the MVDA contains no language suggesting retroactivity, and applying the amendment retroactively would alter the parties\u2019 existing contract rights. A manufacturer-dealer relationship, absent contrary language in the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>incorporates the relevant market area in effect at the time when the dealer agreement was entered. The six-mile relevant market area in effect in 2007, then, governs the 2007 manufacturer-dealer agreement at issue in this case. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Washtenaw Circuit Court for reinstatement of summary disposition in favor of defendants Chrysler Group (Chrysler) and IHS Automotive Group (IHS).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Chrysler and plaintiff LaFontaine Saline Inc. (LaFontaine), an authorized Chrysler automobile dealer, entered into a Dealer Agreement on September 24, 2007. The agreement granted LaFontaine the non-exclusive right to sell Dodge vehicles from its location in Saline, Michigan, and defined LaFontaine\u2019s Sales Locality as \u201cthe area designated in writing to [LaFontaine] by [Chrysler] from time to time as the territory of [LaFontaine\u2019s] responsibility for the sale of [Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge] vehicles, vehicle parts and accessories . . ..\u201d The agreement further provided that LaFontaine\u2019s \u201cSales Locality may be shared with other [Chrysler] dealers of the same line-make as [Chrysler] determines to be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The parties agree that the 2007 Dealer Agreement is subject to the MVDA, which regulates relationships among automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers. In particular, the MVDA\u2019s relevant market area provision limits Chrysler\u2019s right to establish dealerships of the same line of vehicles in the vicinity of LaFontaine\u2019s existing dealership. This section, MCL 445.1576(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">Before a manufacturer or distributor enters into a dealer agreement establishing or relocating a new motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>vehicle dealer within a relevant market area where the same line make is represented, the manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice to each new motor vehicle dealer of the same line make in the relevant market area of its intention to establish an additional dealer or to relocate an existing dealer within the relevant market area.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This notice requirement further entitles a recipient dealer to file a declaratory judgment action requiring the manufacturer to show good cause for establishing a new dealership within the relevant market area.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">At the time Chrysler and LaFontaine entered into their 2007 Dealer Agreement, MCL 445.1566(a) defined \u201crelevant market area\u201d as \u201cthe area within a radius of 6 miles of the intended site of the proposed or relocated dealer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Significantly, this same six-mile radius was in effect when, on February 2, 2010, Chrysler and IHS, another Dodge automobile dealer, entered into a \u201cLetter of Intent to Add Vehicle Line\u201d (LOI). The LOI provided that Chrysler \u201cwill accept [IHS\u2019s] offer to enter into an Agreement\u201d to sell Dodge vehicles upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>IHS\u2019s satisfaction of certain conditions enumerated in the LOI.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The LOI further provided Chrysler the discretionary right to terminate the LOI should \u201canyone file a protest or lawsuit, demand arbitration or otherwise challenge . . . the proposed establishment\u201d if the challenge is not withdrawn or dismissed within 90 days of filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\">After execution of the LOI, the Legislature expanded the statutory definition of relevant market area from the six-mile radius to \u201cthe area within a radius of 9 miles\u201d of the intended site of the proposed or relocated dealership.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the proposed location for IHS\u2019s Dodge facility is outside the pre-amendment six-mile radius of LaFontaine\u2019s existing dealership, it is within the post-amendment nine-mile radius of that location. On September 3, 2010, LaFontaine contacted Chrysler, indicating its protest of the proposed IHS Dodge dealership location in light of the nine-mile radius established by the 2010 Amendment. Chrysler responded on October 8, 2010, communicating its continuing intent to establish a Dodge dealership at IHS\u2019s Ann Arbor location.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>LaFontaine then filed a complaint for declaratory relief, challenging the proposed dealership under the MVDA. Chrysler and IHS responded with a motion for summary disposition, alleging that the 2010 Amendment did not apply to the proposed dealership because their LOI predated the Amendment, and LaFontaine therefore had no statutory right to challenge it. They further argued that applying the 2010 Amendment to the LOI and to the 2007 Chrysler-LaFontaine Dealer Agreement would be an impermissible retroactive application of the law. LaFontaine argued that its 2007 Dealer Agreement with Chrysler did not address or refer to LaFontaine\u2019s relevant market area, and therefore application of the 2010 Amendment could not interfere with that agreement. Even if the 2010 Amendment applied only prospectively, LaFontaine asserted that the LOI did not constitute a dealer agreement, but merely an agreement for certain improvements to IHS\u2019s facilities in anticipation of a dealer agreement. Any formal dealer agreement, LaFontaine argued, must follow the August 4, 2010 effective date of the amendment and be subject to the nine-mile relevant market area.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Washtenaw Circuit Court granted Chrysler\u2019s and IHS\u2019s motions for summary disposition, concluding that the 2010 Amendment did not overcome the presumption that statutory amendments generally operate prospectively only. The Legislature provided a specific effective date of August 4, 2010, and omitted any reference to retroactivity. The circuit court further found that the LOI between Chrysler and IHS constituted a dealer agreement under the MVDA, and thereby established the parties\u2019 rights upon execution. The court denied LaFontaine\u2019s motion for reconsideration, adding that LaFontaine\u2019s claim was not ripe because it \u201crests on contingent future events that may not occur,\u201d i.e., a formal Dealer Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court in a published opinion, concluding that the issue of retroactivity was immaterial because the LOI was not a dealer agreement because it did not establish the \u201clegal rights [or] obligations of [Chrysler or IHS] with regard to the purchase and sale or resale of new motor vehicles and accessories for motor vehicles.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that any dealer agreement could necessarily occur only after the effective date of the 2010 Amendment, and application of that amendment could not have retroactive effect on any dealer agreement between Chrysler and IHS.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, because the 2010 Amendment applied and the MVDA allows a dealer to bring a declaratory judgment action upon <em>notice </em>of a manufacturer\u2019s <em>intent </em>to establish a like-line dealership, the Court of Appeals held that LaFontaine had standing to sue to determine whether good cause existed for IHS\u2019s proposed dealership.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 10The Court of Appeals denied Chrysler\u2019s and IHS\u2019s motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">We granted Chrysler\u2019s and IHS\u2019s applications for leave to appeal, requesting that the parties address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the 2010 PA 139 definition of \u201crelevant market area,\u201d MCL 445.1566(l)(a), applied to enable the plaintiff to challenge the future dealer agreement between the defendants under MCL 445.1576(3). Compare <em>Kia Motors America, Inc v Glassman Oldsmobile Saab Hyundai, Inc, </em>706 F3d 733, 735 (CA 6, 2013).[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Chrysler and IHS moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10). Summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) is appropriate where the complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10) challenges the factual sufficiency of the complaint, with the trial court considering the entire record in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We also review questions of statutory interpretation de novo,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> including questions regarding retroactivity of amendments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">III. ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In establishing whether the 2010 Amendment applies on the facts of this case, we first examine the source, if any, of the parties\u2019 contractual rights that predates the 2010 Amendment. Only then can we determine whether retroactive application of the 2010 Amendment\u2019s expanded relevant market area would interfere with any such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">A. THE SOURCE OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The MVDA in effect at the time of both the 2007 Chrysler-LaFontaine Dealer Agreement and 2010 Chrysler-IHS LOI defined \u201cDealer agreement\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>an agreement or contract in writing between ... a manufacturer and a .. . new motor vehicle dealer ... which <em>purports to establish the legal rights and obligations of the parties </em>to the agreement or contract <em>with regard to the purchase and sale or resale of new and unaltered motor vehicles and accessories for motor vehicles.[</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">This provision of the MVDA specifies three key elements to a Dealer Agreement: (1) a writing (2) establishing the legal rights and obligations of the parties (3) with regard to the purchase and sale or resale of new motor vehicles and accessories for motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Applying these elements to the 2007 ChryslerLaFontaine Dealer Agreement compels the undisputed conclusion that that agreement constitutes a \u201cdealer agreement\u201d within the meaning of the MVDA. The agreement is in writing, purports to establish the parties\u2019 legal rights and obligations, and sets out specific \u201cProducts Covered\u201d in a \u201cMotor Vehicle Addendum.\u201d The agreement therefore complies with the requirements of then-effective MCL 445.1562(2), and establishes the parties\u2019 contractual rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And because MCL 445.1566(1) provided for a six-mile relevant market area at the time Chrysler and LaFontaine entered into their Dealer Agreement, the six-mile radius will govern that agreement <em>unless </em>the 2010 Amendment expanding the relevant market area is retroactively applicable to existing dealer agreements. Indeed, it is well settled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cthe obligation of a contract consisted in its binding force on the party who makes it. <em>This depends upon the laws in existence when it is made. </em>They are necessarily referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>in all contracts, and form a part of them, as the measure of obligation to perform them by the one party and right acquired by the other.\u201d The doctrine asserted in that case . .. applies to laws in reference to which the contract is made, and forming a part of the contract.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Before reaching the issue of retroactivity, however, we must also consider the 2010 LOI between Chrysler and IHS and whether that agreement similarly meets the MVDA\u2019s definition of \u201cdealer agreement.\u201d Like the 2007 Chrysler-LaFontaine Dealer Agreement, the LOI between Chrysler and IHS is a writing executed by both parties. However, while the language of this latter agreement speaks in terms of \u201crequirements\u201d and \u201cbreaches,\u201d and purports to constitute Chrysler and IHS\u2019s \u201centire agreement concerning the establishment of the Facility,\u201d the LOI is not a \u201cdealer agreement\u201d within the meaning of the MVDA because it does not establish their rights and obligations <em>with regard to the purchase and sale or resale of new motor vehicles and accessories for motor vehicles, </em>as the MVDA requires. Rather, the LOI speaks almost entirely to requirements IHS must meet <em>before </em>Chrysler will \u201caccept [IHS\u2019s] offer to enter into an Agreement in its then-customary form\u201d and likewise contemplates conditions IHS must satisfy \u201c[b]efore [Chrysler] enters into an Agreement with [IHS] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> At most, then, the LOI is akin to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>agreement to agree to a Dealer Agreement. While it is \u201c \u2018well recognized that it is possible for parties to make an enforceable contract binding them to prepare and execute a subsequent agreement,\u2019 \u201d an agreement to agree is not enforceable where \u201c \u2018the document or contract that the parties agree to make is to contain any material term that is not already agreed on. .. .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the LOI was not a Dealer Agreement pursuant to MCL 445.1562(2) as was in effect at the time Chrysler and IHS executed their LOI. Chrysler and IHS therefore had no contractual rights by way of the 2010 LOI with which retroactive application of the nine-mile relevant market area could interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">B. RETROACTIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Because the 2007 Dealer Agreement between Chrysler and LaFontaine established rights between the parties, we consider whether retroactive application of the 2010 Amendment\u2019s nine-mile relevant market area would impermissibly deprive Chrysler of any such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">To begin, we note that the 2007 Dealer Agreement between Chrysler and LaFontaine contains no language purporting to grant LaFontaine rights against encroachment by like-line dealers. Rather, the agreement explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>contemplates that LaFontaine\u2019s \u201cSales Locality may be shared with other [Chrysler] dealers of the same line-make as [Chrysler] determines to be appropriate.\u201d This language makes clear that, aside from any limits set out in the MVDA (i.e., the relevant market area provision), nothing in the 2007 Dealer Agreement prevents Chrysler from reaching like-line dealer agreements with other dealerships within LaFontaine\u2019s \u201cSales Locality.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, any right LaFontaine has against encroachment by like-line dealers is a creature of statute. We consequently must determine whether the creation of a statutory right against encroachment by the 2010 MVDA amendment, applied against Chrysler\u2019s preexisting 2007 Dealer Agreement with LaFontaine, would result in impermissible retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Retroactive application of legislation \u201c \u2018presents problems of unfairness ... because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We have therefore required that the Legislature make its intentions clear when it seeks to pass a law with retroactive effect.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In determining whether a law has retroactive effect, we keep four principles in mind. First, we consider whether there is specific language providing for retroactive application.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Second, in some situations,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>is not regarded as operating retroactively merely because it relates to an antecedent event.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Third, in determining retroactivity, we must keep in mind that retroactive laws impair vested rights acquired under existing laws or create new obligations or duties with respect to transactions or considerations already past.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Finally, a remedial or procedural act not affecting vested rights may be given retroactive effect where the injury or claim is antecedent to the enactment of the statute.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">MCL 445.1566(l)(a), as amended by 2010 PA 139, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">(1) \u201cRelevant market area\u201d means ... :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">(a) In a county that has a population of more than 150,000, the area within a radius of 9 miles of the site of the intended place of business of a proposed new vehicle dealer or the intended place of business of a new vehicle dealer that plans to relocate its place of business. For purposes of this section, the 9-mile distance is determined by measuring the distance between the nearest surveyed boundary of an existing new motor vehicle dealer\u2019s principal place of business and the nearest surveyed boundary line of the proposed or relocated new motor vehicle dealer\u2019s principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Nothing in the language of MCL 445.1566(l)(a) suggests the Legislature\u2019s intent that the law apply retroactively. The Legislature \u201c \u2018knows how to make clear its intention that a statute apply retroactively.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In fact, it has done so with other provisions of the MVDA, which explicitly provide that they apply to pre-existing con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tracts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Legislature has even used specific retroactivity language when amending the MVDA.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s silence regarding retroactivity in its amendment of the definition of \u201crelevant market area\u201d undermines any argument that MCL 445.1566 was intended to apply retroactively. That the Legislature provided for the law to take immediate effect <em>upon its filing date </em>\u2014 August 4, 2010 \u2014 only confirms its textual prospectivity.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The remaining factors in our retroactivity analysis require that we examine the amendment\u2019s effect on existing contract rights. A statute\u2019s relation to a prior event alone will not render the statute retroactive. Rather, we consider whether the statute \u201ctakes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation and imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability with respect to transactions or considerations already past.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> LaFontaine asserts that retroactivity is not at issue in this case merely because it invoked the anti-encroachment protection of the 2010 amendment after that amendment went into effect. However, this argument begs the retroactivity question, failing to recognize that retroactive application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>2010 Amendment would \u201ccreate a new liability in connection with a past transaction\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 namely, Chrysler\u2019s 2007 Dealer Agreement with LaFontaine. Applying the 2010 Amendment\u2019s nine-mile relevant market area to the parties\u2019 2007 agreement would impose on Chrysler the new obligation of meeting the rigorous \u201cgood cause\u201d standard in an action for declaratory relief under MCL 445.1576(3). Chrysler did not bargain for or contemplate this obligation at the time of its 2007 Dealer Agreement with LaFontaine, when the MVDA imposed only a relevant market area of six miles. Rather, Chrysler had the settled expectation at the time of its 2007 agreement that it could establish a like-line dealership anywhere outside a six-mile radius of LaFontaine\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">Because Chrysler explicitly reserved its right to establish such dealerships within LaFontaine\u2019s \u201cSales Locality\u201d as refered to in the 2007 Dealer Agreement, Chrysler\u2019s right is contractual in nature, limited only by LaFontaine\u2019s statutory anti-encroachment rights in the MVDA\u2019s relevant market area provision.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Accordingly, retroactive application of the 2010 Amendment would not merely \u201coperate in furtherance of a remedy or mode of procedure,\u201d and therefore cannot be characterized as remedial or procedural.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Rather, the expansion of the relevant market area creates substantive rights for dealers that had no prior existence in law or contract, and diminishes a manufacturer\u2019s existing rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>contracts executed before the 2010 Amendment. Application of the 2010 Amendment would give LaFontaine the substantive right to object where it previously could not \u2014 that is, the right to object to a proposed like-line dealership more than six, but less than nine miles away.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Because retroactive application of the 2010 Amendment would interfere with Chrysler\u2019s contractual right to establish dealerships outside of a six-mile radius of LaFontaine, such retroactive application is impermissible on these facts.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Accordingly, the relevant market area in effect when Chrysler reached its 2007 Dealer Agreement with LaFontaine governs that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">Our conclusion is consistent with the recent interpretation of this exact amendment of the MVDA by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In <em>Kia Motors,</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Sixth Circuit upheld a manufacturer\u2019s right, after the effective date of the 2010 Amendment, to establish a new like-line dealership approximately seven miles from an existing dealership.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In doing so, the Sixth Circuit relied on the Kia-Glassman Dealer Agreement, which, like the 2007 Chrysler-LaFontaine Dealer Agreement here, predated the 2010 Amendment<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Applying Michigan retroactivity law, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the 2010 Amendment did not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>retroactively.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The 2010 Amendment was silent as to retroactivity, and hence bore \u201cno clear legislative intent that the Amendment should be applied retroactively.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Moreover, Kia\u2019s rights under its preexisting Dealer Agreement with Glassman were vested rights, as they were contractual rather than statutory.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that the amendment \u201c[c]learly. .. imposes a new substantive duty and provides a new substantive right that did not previously exist,\u201d and therefore was not procedural or remedial.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The Sixth Circuit recognized the retroactivity issue presented by these circumstances, contrary to the Court of Appeals below, which undertook no retroactivity analysis whatsoever. We find the Sixth Circuit\u2019s analysis and application of Michigan law persuasive. Accordingly, we hold that the pre-amendment six-mile radius that was in effect at the time Chrysler and LaFontaine entered into their 2007 Dealer Agreement governs that agreement such that Chrysler need not show good cause for the establishment of IHS\u2019s proposed dealership location.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Court of Appeals erred by limiting its analysis to whether the 2010 Chrysler-IHS Letter of Intent constituted a Dealer Agreement within the meaning of the MVDA. While we agree with the Court of Appeals that the 2010 LOI created no substantive rights with which application of the 2010 Amendment could interfere, Chrysler\u2019s 2007 Dealer Agreement with LaFontaine did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>create such rights. Retroactive application of the 2010 Amendment would subject Chrysler to greater burdens than those in place when the 2007 Dealer Agreement went into effect because it would require Chrysler to show good cause for the establishment of a broader geographical range of dealerships. Likewise, retroactive application would grant LaFontaine greater substantive rights than the 2007 agreement, allowing LaFontaine to challenge the establishment of dealerships that it previously could not. Accordingly, retroactive application of the 2010 Amendment\u2019s nine-mile relevant market area would impinge upon Chrysler\u2019s rights under its 2007 agreement with LaFontaine.
