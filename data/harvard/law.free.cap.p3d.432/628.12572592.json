(mother) appeals the juvenile court's judgment of adjudication and disposition following a jury trial. To resolve mother's arguments on appeal, we must delve into the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA). ICWA establishes standards that must be followed when a state court places an Indian child in a foster care placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 However, we must decide an unanswered question in Colorado: whether a juvenile court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to enter adjudicatory and dispositional orders when it has not complied with ICWA. We must also determine whether ICWA's provisions regarding foster care placement apply to adjudicatory and dispositional orders. Ultimately, we conclude that (1) a lack of ICWA compliance does not deprive a juvenile court of subject matter jurisdiction and (2) ICWA's foster care placement provisions apply to a dispositional order, but not to an order adjudicating a child dependent and neglected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 We then examine mother's argument that the juvenile court erred in admitting video recordings of mother and the children at the adjudicatory trial. We agree that the court erred in admitting the recordings without proper authentication and further conclude that the error was not harmless. As a result, we reverse the adjudication and dispositional orders and remand the case to the juvenile court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In August 2017, the El Paso County Department of Human Services (the Department) initiated a dependency and neglect case regarding seven-month-old M.V., six-year-old Ma.M., and an older half-sibling who is not subject to the appeal. Later that month, the Department filed an amended petition adding mother's other two children who had been in the care of the maternal grandmother-nine-year-old P.M., also known as P.P., and thirteen-year-old Mo.M., also known as M.M-B. (collectively the children).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 In support of the petition, the Department asserted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 it had received videos showing mother using methamphetamine as well as manufacturing and selling a white powder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 mother had a history of substance use and was on probation for possession of a controlled substance; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 M.V. was present during domestic violence between mother and his father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mother denied the allegations and requested a jury trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found that mother had subjected the children to mistreatment or abuse, the children lacked proper parental care as a result of mother's acts or failures to act, and\n   the children's environment was injurious to their welfare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 Based on the jury's verdict, the juvenile court adjudicated the children dependent and neglected. Following another hearing, the juvenile court entered a dispositional order that adopted a treatment plan for mother. And, as part of the dispositional order, the juvenile court placed Ma.M. in the custody of her father, P.M. in a relative's custody, and M.V. and Mo.M. in the Department's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    II. ICWA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8 Mother contends that the record does not demonstrate compliance with ICWA's provisions and, as a result, the juvenile court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the children and enter a dispositional order. Specifically, mother asserts that (1) notice was not given to the applicable tribes; (2) the court failed to require qualified expert testimony of emotional or physical damage to the children; and (3) the court failed to consider whether the Department had made active efforts to rehabilitate mother. We reject mother's jurisdictional argument but agree that the dispositional order must be reversed to ensure ICWA compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A.

The Authentication of the Video Recordings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 53 Before the jury trial, mother filed a motion in limine to exclude eleven video recordings-ten that purported to show mother using, manufacturing, or distributing drugs in her home and one that showed the children in the same area at a different time. She asserted that the video recordings were not original and that it would be unfair to admit the duplicate copies because they appeared to have been altered based on some having time stamps that did not accurately reflect the length of the recordings and others having obvious scene jumps or skips. Mother also argued that the\n   video recordings had been anonymously provided and could not be authenticated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 54 At the start of the jury trial, mother renewed her objection. She reiterated that the Department would not be able to authenticate the video recordings and there were issues with the contents of the recordings. The juvenile court deferred ruling on the admissibility of the recordings until they were offered into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 55 Evidence presented at the trial established that the Department received the video recordings of mother and the children through two separate mechanisms. First, an intake caseworker testified that he had received an interoffice envelope that contained a DVD with four video clips. The intake caseworker explained that he did not know who had left the DVD for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 56 Second, M.V.'s paternal uncle testified that he had received three video files from an anonymous sender via email. He then sent the video recordings, also via email, to a different intake caseworker at the Department. The second intake caseworker testified that after receiving the email, she downloaded the video recordings onto a disc and deleted the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 57 Several witnesses testified that they recognized persons or furniture in the video recordings. For example, the initial intake caseworker recognized mother in the clips on the DVD. Likewise, the paternal uncle testified that he was able to recognize mother in two of the recordings as well as the computer room and an adjacent pool table and light in mother's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 58 The second caseworker also recognized mother in two of the video recordings as well as three of the children in another recording. The second caseworker further testified that she showed one of the video recordings to mother, who agreed that the recording showed her desk and the children at their then-current ages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 59 Based on this record, and over mother's objection, the juvenile court admitted six of the video recordings. A police officer subsequently testified that the video recordings appeared to show methamphetamine use and the selling of a substance that appeared to be methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 60 Still, the record is devoid of any testimony from a witness who could independently verify the accuracy of the scenes depicted in the video recordings-mother using and distributing methamphetamine and the children later having access to the same area. In fact, the paternal uncle admitted that he had never witnessed mother using or selling drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 61 In short, the record does not establish that the police officer, the caseworkers, or the paternal uncle was present when the scenes depicted in the video recordings occurred. Thus, they could not vouch for the accuracy of the recorded scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baca\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31 (concluding that a witness could not vouch for the accuracy of a recorded conversation since he did not hear the conversation as it occurred).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 62 Nor could any witness verify the reliability of the recording process. Indeed, the paternal uncle acknowledged that he had no idea how or when the video recordings were made. Likewise, the second intake caseworker acknowledged that she could not verify the accuracy of the time stamp seen in some of the recordings; when the recordings were created; or whether any of the recordings were altered, modified, or edited. The caseworker further agreed that the video recordings \"bounce[d]\" and persons in the recordings would suddenly jump from one position to another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 63 Given that the Department was unable to establish either the accuracy of the scenes depicted in the video recordings or the accuracy of the recording process, the juvenile court erred in admitting the video recordings of mother and the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 64 Relying on CRE 1002 and 1003, mother also argues that it was unfair for the juvenile court to admit the video recordings when she was unable to cross-examine the person who made the recording or view the original recordings. Because we have already determined that the juvenile court erred in admitting the recordings without proper authentication, we need not decide this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 65 But this conclusion does not end our analysis. We must also determine whether the admission of the video recordings requires reversal of the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Effect of the Admission of the Recordings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 66 Generally, an error in the admission of evidence in a civil case is harmless if it does not affect a substantial right of a party.

Harmless Error Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 71 To be sure, the video recordings were not the sole evidence presented at the trial to support the Department's assertion that the children were dependent and neglected. The Department also asserted that the children's welfare was at risk because of the chaotic environment and domestic violence that was occurring in the home that mother shared with M.V.'s father (father). Still, we cannot conclude that the admission\n   of the video recordings did not substantially influence the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 72 First, the record reveals that considerable emphasis was placed on the video recordings. In addition to playing the six recordings for the jury, the Department elicited expert testimony from a police officer to establish that five of the recordings appeared to show methamphetamine use and distribution. The Department also had three separate witnesses-the initial intake worker, the paternal uncle, and a second caseworker-identify mother in the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 73 Indeed, the second intake caseworker opined that by the end of July 2017, she was concerned by the video recordings but was not immediately concerned by domestic violence (as opposed to mother re-engaging in a violent relationship) because father had left the home and a protection order was in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 74 The record further reveals that the video recordings and their significance were discussed at length during closing argument by both the Department and the children's guardian ad litem. And the Department again referenced the recordings in its rebuttal argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 75 Second, the video recordings are not cumulative of or corroborated by other evidence. Some, but not all, of the recordings have time stamps showing that they were made in late June 2017. In other words, they purport to show recent methamphetamine use and distribution by mother. While mother admitted to using methamphetamine in the past (she estimated twenty times) and was on probation for drug possession, there was no other evidence showing that she used or distributed drugs during the summer of 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 76 Rather, a police officer testified that in April 2016-approximately seventeen months before the trial-he searched mother's car during a traffic stop and found a shard of methamphetamine on the driver's seat as well as a cosmetic mirror that contained methamphetamine mixed with water in the center console. Although mother denied that the methamphetamine belonged to her, she admitted that it had been found in her car and resulted in her receiving a felony drug conviction and probation sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 77 Third, the record contains other evidence that tends to contradict that mother had recently used or distributed methamphetamine. The initial intake caseworker acknowledged that he had not seen any sign that mother was under the influence of methamphetamine or other drugs when he met with her. The paternal uncle testified that he had not seen mother use or sell drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 78 The record further reveals that before the case was filed, mother provided a urinalysis. Although she did not take the test at a facility approved by the Department, the test was negative. Mother also provided a second negative urinalysis on the day the petition was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 79 Additionally, mother's probation officer testified that she had provided four urinalyses since mid-April 2017, which all tested negative, and had completed a substance abuse evaluation that showed she did not need treatment. Finally, mother testified that the last time that she used methamphetamine occurred before she learned that she was pregnant with M.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 80 Fourth, without the video recordings, the record shows a much closer case as to whether the children were dependent and neglected. While mother acknowledged past methamphetamine use, it occurred more than a year before the adjudicatory trial, and, as previously discussed, there was evidence that tended to show that the use was not continuing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 81 True, the record also shows that mother and father had a contentious relationship and police officers had responded to the home on multiple occasions. However, in the end, the officers determined that these were disputes between adults that required no further action. For example, a police officer testified that he responded to mother's home in January 2017 and observed mother barricaded in a bedroom with M.V., then a newborn, and a twelve-or thirteen-year-old child. Mother told the officer that father's ex-girlfriend had come over and challenged her to a physical confrontation. The officer determined that the incident, as described by\n   mother, did not constitute a crime. And, when no party was willing to take his suggestion to leave the home for the night, he left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 82 Another police officer testified that he responded to mother's home in June 2017 as a result of a domestic disturbance call from father. Father told the officer that mother had cut off the power to the basement and mother indicated that father \"yells at her and locks her out of the house.\" But, the officer concluded that there was no evidence of domestic violence and described the incident as a \"verbal argument between male and female.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 83 The next day, a different police officer responded to mother's home based on a call from father. The officer testified that it appeared that father and mother were having a verbal argument \"where nothing illegal was going on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 84 Additionally, it was undisputed that there was a violent episode of domestic violence between mother and father as well as a heated exchange of M.V. in early July 2017. On that day, M.V.'s paternal aunt and uncle witnessed a verbal altercation between mother and father. The aunt described mother and father as \"screaming back and forth at each other\" while father was in the garage holding M.V. in his arms and mother was parked halfway in the garage. Father had a bleeding gash on his face and mother had a torn shirt and blood under her arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 85 At some point, the aunt took M.V. inside of mother's home and mother left. About an hour later, mother returned to the home with Mo.M. and asked to take M.V. The aunt explained that she tried to hand M.V. to mother, but the aunt's son grabbed M.V. and then either mother or Mo.M. grabbed M.V. from the aunt's son. The aunt also testified that after grabbing the baby, mother said \"somebody is going to die tonight, somebody is going to get shot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 86 After the incident, a police officer met with mother at the hospital. Mother told the officer that the night before and throughout that morning, she and father had been arguing and, while M.V. was present, father \"had put his hands around her throat and strangled her.\" The officer observed that mother had scratches on her face, marks around her neck, and a \"good size\" laceration on the back of her arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 87 Despite the serious nature of this incident, mother explained that this was the first incident of physical violence between her and father and the first time that she had been the victim of domestic violence. She also testified that she had not threatened anyone that evening and that she was no longer living with father. Furthermore, the police officer determined that mother was the victim and had a warrant issued for father for domestic violence and child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 88 It may well be that, in the absence of the video recordings, this other evidence-mother's past methamphetamine use, the contentious relationship resulting in police calls, and the single incident of domestic violence-would have been sufficient to support the jury's verdict that mother had subjected the children to mistreatment or abuse, the children lacked proper parental care as a result of mother's acts or failures to act, and the children's environment was injurious to their welfare. But, this is not the question that we must decide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yusem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996530\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/210/458/#p469\">\n    210 P.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 89 Rather, we conclude that the erroneous admission of the video recordings substantially influenced the jury's verdict given the emphasis placed on the recordings, the lack of cumulative or corroborative evidence, the evidence that tended to contradict mother's recent use, and the closeness of the case (without the recordings). Accordingly, the error was not harmless, and we must reverse the adjudicatory order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 90 The adjudicatory and dispositional orders are reversed. The case is remanded to the juvenile court to hold a new adjudicatory trial. The court must also ensure, if it has not already done so, that notice of the proceeding is given to the federally recognized Sioux and Apache tribes as well as the BIA before the dispositional hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 91 Additionally, if the children are again adjudicated dependent and neglected, the juvenile court must treat the children as Indian\n   children unless and until it determines that they are not. Accordingly, if at the time of the dispositional hearing, the court has been unable to determine that the children are not Indian children, it must comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) and (e) for any of the children that remain out of a parent's care and determine whether\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \u2022 the Department has made active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the family and these efforts have proved unsuccessful; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   \u2022 clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, demonstrates that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   JUDGE LICHTENSTEIN and JUDGE ASHBY concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
