Three hotel associations challenge the initiative as a violation of the \"single subject\" rule of RCW 35A.12.130 and article IV, section 7 of the Seattle City Charter. We conclude the ordinance contains provisions not germane one to another and, therefore, violates the single subject rule. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 On November 8, 2016, Seattle voters approved I-124. The ballot title for this initiative read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Initiative 124 concerns health, safety and labor standards for Seattle hotel employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   If passed, this initiative would require certain sized hotel-employers to further protect employees against assault, sexual harassment, and injury by retaining lists of accused guests among other measures; improve access to healthcare; limit workloads; and provide limited job security for employees upon hotel ownership transfer. Requirements except assault protections are waivable through collective bargaining. The City may investigate violations. Persons claiming injury are protected from retaliation and may sue hotel-employers. Penalties go to City enforcement, affected employees, and the complainant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Should this measure be enacted into law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   No\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The initiative passed with 76.59 percent of the vote. The City certified the results on November 29, 2016, and the initiative went into effect the following day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 3 The initiative has seven parts. Part 1 is intended to protect hotel employees from violent assault and sexual\n   harassment by guests. SMC 14.25.020. If a hotel employee is assigned to work in a guest room without other employees present, the employer must provide that employee with a panic button to use in an emergency. SMC 14.25.030. Hotel employers must maintain a list of names of any guest accused of assaulting, sexually assaulting, or sexually harassing hotel employees. SMC 14.25.040(A). Any guest accused of such misconduct must remain on the list for five years, and hotel employers must notify other employees assigned to an accused guest's room and warn them to exercise caution when entering that room. SMC 14.25.040(A), (C). If an accusation is supported by a sworn statement \"or other evidence,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the hotel employer must bar the guest from the hotel for three years. SMC 14.25.040(B). Part 1 also requires hotel employers to post signs notifying guests of the protections afforded by I-124. SMC 14.25.050. Lastly, Part 1 provides that after an employee accuses a guest of sexual assault or harassment, a hotel employer must reassign the employee to a different work area upon request, provide paid time off to allow the employee to contact the police, a counselor, or an advisor, and, with the employee's consent, report any accusations of criminal conduct by guests to law enforcement. SMC 14.25.060.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 4 Part 2 seeks to protect hotel workers from on-the-job injury. SMC 14.25.070. SMC 14.25.080 requires hotel employers to provide and use safety devices and safeguards, as well as \"use work practices, methods, processes, and means\" that are \"reasonably adequate to make their workplaces safe.\" Under rules adopted by the Seattle Office of Labor Standards in July 2018, the workplace safety requirements of SMC 14.25.080 \"must at least meet those outlined by the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act\" (WISHA),\n   RCW\n   ch. 49.17 and its administrative regulations. SHRR 150-070.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 5 SMC 14.25.090 requires hotel employers to protect their employees from exposure to hazardous chemicals by controlling chemical agents, protecting employees from having contact with or being exposed to chemical agents, and providing employees with information on hazardous chemicals in their work areas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 SMC 14.25.100 prohibits \"large hotels,\" defined as hotels with 100 or more guest rooms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from requiring housekeepers to clean more than 5,000 square feet of floor space in an eight-hour workday unless the hotel pays the worker time and a half. Under administrative regulation, an employee has a right to refuse the employer's request to clean more than the maximum square footage allowed in the ordinance. SHRR 150-140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 7 Part 3 is intended to improve access to medical care for hotel employees. SMC 14.25.110. Under SMC 14.25.120, \"large hotel\" employers must provide healthcare subsidies to low-wage employees or provide health care coverage equal to at least a gold-level policy on the Washington Health Care Benefit Exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 8 Part 4 provides job security to hotel workers by requiring hotels undergoing a change in ownership or control to maintain a list of employees, based on seniority. SMC 14.25.130. The new hotel owner must hire its employees from this list for six months and retain employees hired from this list for at least 90 days, unless there is good cause for termination. SMC 14.25.140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 9 Part 5 is entitled \"Enforcement.\" SMC 14.25.150(A) makes it a violation for any hotel employer to interfere with\n   any right protected by the ordinance or to discharge any employee exercising rights under the ordinance. If an employer takes an adverse action within 90 days of that employee's exercise of rights under the ordinance, there is a rebuttable presumption of retaliation. SMC 14.25.150(A)(5). Part 5 also prohibits hotel employers from threatening to report an employee's suspected citizenship or immigration status. SMC 14.25.150(A)(4). SMC 14.25.150(B) mandates that hotel employers give written notification to each employee of their rights under the ordinance in each language spoken by 10 or more employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 SMC 14.25.150(C) creates a \"private enforcement action.\" It provides that \"any person claiming injury\" from a violation of any part of the ordinance is entitled to bring a lawsuit in King County Superior Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction to enforce its provisions. SMC 14.25.150(C)(1). The claimant \"shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity\" and may seek \"lost compensation and other damages, reinstatement, declaratory or injunctive relief, prejudgment interest, exemplary damages equal to the amount of wages wrongfully withheld or not paid\" and to collect penalties described elsewhere in the ordinance. SMC 14.25.150(C)(1). A prevailing claimant is also entitled to an award of attorney fees and expenses. SMC 14.25.150(C)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 SMC 14.25.150(D) empowers the City's Office of Civil Rights to investigate alleged violations of the ordinance. It also authorizes the Division Director of the Office of Labor Standards within the Office of Civil Rights to promulgate rules \"that protect the identity and privacy rights of employees who have made complaints\" under the ordinance. SMC 14.25.150(D)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 SMC 14.25.150(E) sets out penalties a court may impose for ordinance violations. For each workday during which the employer is in violation, a court may impose a penalty of between $100 and $1,000 per day. SMC 14.25.150(E)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   If civil penalties are imposed, they must be distributed per the following formula: 50 percent to the Office of Labor Standards, 25 percent to \"aggrieved employees,\" and 25 percent to the \"person bringing the case.\" SMC 14.25.150(E)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 Part 6 defines key terms used in the ordinance. It does not define sexual assault or sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 Part 7, entitled \"Miscellaneous,\" includes a severability provision, SMC 14.25.180, and a provision prohibiting the waiver by agreement of the rights set out in the ordinance, unless contained in a collective bargaining agreement, SMC 14.25.170. SMC 14.25.170(B) provides that the provisions protecting employees from assault and sexual harassment and mandating hotels maintain lists of accused guests are not waivable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 The American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, the Seattle Hotel Association, and the Washington Hospitality Association (the Associations) brought suit to challenge I-124. The City of Seattle, and two intervening organizations, UNITE HERE! Local 8 and Seattle Protects Women (the Intervenors), defended the validity of the initiative. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the superior court upheld the validity of I-124. The Associations appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Associations argue the initiative violates the single subject rule of RCW 35A.12.130, article IV, section 7 of the Seattle City Charter, and article II, section 19 of the Washington State Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City and Intervenors argue the provisions of I-124 encompass only one subject-employee health, safety, and welfare-and the initiative is thus valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Article II, section 19 of the Washington State Constitution provides that \"[n]o bill shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\" This constitutional provision does not apply to I-124 because article II, section 19, by its express terms, applies only to state legislation.\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

Part 5 also contains a provision prohibiting hotel employers from threatening to reveal the citizenship or immigration status of an employee or an employee's family member. SMC 14.25.150(A)(4)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 39 While Part 5 is arguably germane to the first four parts of the initiative, it does not make Parts 1 through 4 germane to each other. And Part 5 itself conflicts with key provisions of Washington's workers' compensation system by creating a private cause of action that does not now exist under Washington law. RCW 51.04.010 abolished all jurisdiction of the courts to hear worker injury cases. The Industrial Insurance Act represents a \"grand compromise\" between industry and labor to remove workplace injuries from the court system and to provide injured workers with a swift, no-fault compensation system for on-the-job injuries.\n   <em>\n    Birklid v. Boeing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433021\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/127/853/#p859\">\n    127 Wash.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 859,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=904%20P.2d%20278\">\n    904 P.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Even if the City can lawfully enact worker safety provisions that are stricter than those imposed by the Department of Labor &amp; Industries, the City does not explain how an ordinance can confer subject matter jurisdiction on a state court to resolve work-related injury claims when, by statute, the legislature abolished that very\n   jurisdiction over a century ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Laws of 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 1 (enacting RCW 51.04.010 ). The private cause of action provision appears to be a classic example of logrolling prohibited by RCW 35A.12.130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 40 Intervenors argue that I-124 should be affirmed because there is a long history in Washington of legislatively addressing labor conditions in a single piece of legislation. In\n   <em>\n    WASAVP\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court relied on a well-established history of legislative appropriations of revenue under the Liquor Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to demonstrate the relatedness of I-1183's liquor privatization provisions and the earmark for law enforcement funding.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022352\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/642/#p655\">\n    174 Wash.2d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20P.3d%20632\">\n    278 P.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Intervenors cite the Industrial Welfare Act (IWA) as proof of a similar history of legislating employee protections at the same time. This argument, however, does not pass scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 41 The IWA, originally passed in 1913, mandated the payment of minimum wages for women and made it unlawful to employ\n   women or minors in any job that was \"detrimental to their health or morals.\" Laws of 1913, ch. 174, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. The IWA is now codified in RCW ch. 49.12. But the IWA expressly excludes \"conditions of labor otherwise governed by statutes and rules and regulations relating to industrial safety and health\" administered by the Department of Labor &amp; Industries. RCW 49.12.005(5). Industrial safety and health has historically been addressed in separate legislation-the Industrial Insurance Act, Title 51 RCW-not in the IWA. Indeed, employees assaulted on the job may not generally sue their employers for injuries and are limited to filing a claim under the Industrial Insurance Act.\n   <em>\n    Brame v. W. State Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5580758\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/136/740/#p749\">\n    136 Wash.

Contrary to the Intervenors argument, the legislature has not combined minimum wage and worker safety requirements in the same legislation for decades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 42 Additionally, the legislature has enacted laws to protect employees from sexual harassment on the job under\n   the Washington Law Against Discrimination, RCW 49.60.180. But it has passed separate legislation to entitle an employee to overtime-the Washington Minimum Wage Act, RCW ch. 49.46. There is no history of legislatively combining sexual harassment protections with minimum wage requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 43 Unlike\n   <em>\n    WASAVP\n   </em>\n   , we find no history of the legislature treating sexual harassment protections, overtime provisions, protections from hazardous chemicals, and seniority list requirements together in the same legislation. In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    WASAVP\n   </em>\n   because it found \"no history that the legislature ha[d] treated sales tax reductions and constitutional amendments or supermajority requirements together.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456849\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/185/608/#p620\">\n    185 Wash.2d at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20P.3d%20157\">\n    374 P.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    WASAVP\n   </em>\n   is similarly distinguishable here. There is no legislatively recognized connection between protecting employees from sexual harassment and providing safeguards against unemployment or ensuring fair wages for fair work. Nor is there any such history of joining legislation to protect the confidentiality of an employee's and his or her family members' immigration status with other health, safety, and labor standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 44 Additionally, Part 1 regulates more than just the employee-employer relationship; it regulates the hotels' relationship with their guests by requiring hotels to ban certain guests for at least three years. There is no history of regulating an employer's relationships with its customers alongside labor standards for its employees. I-124's requirement in Part 1 to deny accommodation to guests accused of sexual harassment, and Part 2's wage requirements for housekeepers cleaning more than 5,000 square feet in a day, and Part 4's mandated seniority hiring list do not share the same rational relationship as the public safety earmark did to liquor regulation in\n   <em>\n    WASAVP\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 45 Nor does the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   save I-124. In that case, a consortium of wildlife management, outdoor recreation, and farming groups challenged\n   the constitutionality of I-713, a law making it a gross misdemeanor to capture or kill an animal with steel leg traps or certain poisons. 149 Wash.2d at 627,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20P.3d%20644\">\n    71 P.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The consortium argued that the provisions banning leg traps were not rationally related to the provisions banning the use of pesticides to kill wild animals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 637,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20P.3d%20644\">\n    71 P.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held these two provisions were germane to each other because they both addressed particular methods of trapping and killing animals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 639,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20P.3d%20644\">\n    71 P.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 46 The trial court in this case adopted a broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   in rejecting the Associations' single subject challenge to I-124. It concluded that the initiative expressed a single purpose and the provisions facilitated the accomplishment of this purpose and, for this reason, did not violate the single subject rule. I-124, however, is distinguishable from the initiative in\n   <em>\n    Citizens\n   </em>\n   because Parts 1, 2, and 4 are not just different methods of protecting employees from on-the-job injuries. Nor are these three parts just different methods of ensuring job security. The initiative mixes, on the one hand, protections from sexual assault and exposure to hazardous chemicals with, on the other hand, limits on how much a worker can clean without being entitled to overtime pay and the creation of a seniority list for hiring purposes if a hotel is sold. Part 1's requirement that\n   hotels maintain a list of guests accused of sexual harassment has no rational relation to Part 2's overtime pay requirements for hotel housekeepers or to Part 4's requirement that new hotel owners must hire from a current list of employees for six months and then retain them for 90 days. Although these subjects are all germane to the general title-health, safety, and labor standards-they are not germane to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 47 The key inquiry for the single subject rule is whether the subjects are so unrelated that \"it is impossible for the court to assess whether either subject would have received majority support if voted on separately.\"\n   <em>\n    Kiga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"970378\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/144/819/#p826\">\n    144 Wash.2d at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20P.3d%20659\">\n    31 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, it is impossible to determine whether any subject of I-124 standing alone would have received\n   majority support if voted on separately. I-124 is similar to the initiative discussed in\n   <em>\n    Kiga\n   </em>\n   where our Supreme Court found logrolling of unrelated measures because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   a person who desired systemic changes to future property tax assessments but did not want to fiscally burden cities with the refunding of 1999 tax increases was required to vote for both measures or neither. Similarly, a person who did not own a home or who was otherwise unconcerned with changing methods for assessing property taxes but did desire a refund of other fees was required to vote for both measures or neither.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 828,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20P.3d%20659\">\n    31 P.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Did I-124 receive overwhelming support because almost 80 percent of Seattle voters supported all the provisions? Or did a majority of the voters want to provide better healthcare to these workers and were willing to accept the guest registry provisions as a necessary evil to achieve the healthcare goal? The question could be asked for any combination of the subjects covered in I-124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 48 Because there is no rational unity between the provisions of I-124, it is impossible for the court to determine whether any provision would have received majority support if voted on separately. We conclude the Associations have carried their burden of proving that I-124 violates the single subject rule set out in RCW 35A.12.130 and article IV, section 7 of the Seattle City Charter. It is, thus, unconstitutional under Article XI, section 11 of the Washington Constitution and invalid in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 49 We reverse the trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of the City and Intervenors and remand to the superior court for entry of summary judgment in favor of the Associations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 50 Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Dwyer, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The ordinance authorized and directed the Office of Labor Standards to promulgate rules consistent with the new chapter.
