Because we cannot properly review the award on this record, we set aside the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 Aguirre, a firefighter for the City of Goodyear (\"Goodyear\"), received a blood test for his annual employment physical in May 2015. His test results were abnormal and soon thereafter he was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (\"CML\"). Aguirre filed a workers' compensation claim, which was denied by the respondent carrier, CopperPoint American Insurance Company (\"CopperPoint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aguirre timely requested an ICA hearing, and the ALJ held hearings where Aguirre and two physicians testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Aguirre testified that in August 2000 he started working as a firefighter in Sierra Vista, and as part of his job duties he responded to both structural and wildland fires. In August 2007, Goodyear hired Aguirre as a firefighter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Following his CML diagnosis, Aguirre obtained his Goodyear firefighting records to help him recall the types of fires he responded to and his likely chemical exposures. Of the fires identified, Aguirre was most concerned about a large fire in a cabinet factory that contained \"paints, thinners, lacquers, [and] everything that they used to make cabinets,\" an airport hangar with burning jet fuel, a potato chip factory, a house with chlorine stored in the attic, and a number of meth labs. For some fires, Aguirre wore a self-contained breathing apparatus (\"SCBA\"), but for others it was not standard practice, and afterwards-when he would not wear a SCBA-he would have soot on his hands and face, and up his nose. When the firefighters returned to the station after a fire, they would use a garden hose and a brush to \"try to get as much off of us that we could.\" Then they cleaned up the equipment and showered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Marc Wilkenfeld, M.D., board certified in occupational medicine, authored a report\n   based on Aguirre's occupational history as a firefighter, and testified at the hearing. When attempting to relate a disease to an exposure, the doctor explained that several elements were important: (1) the correct disease diagnosis, (2) workplace exposures and latency periods-the time between \"exposures and the development of the disease,\" and (3) biologic responsibility, i.e., what the medical literature says about exposures in terms of carcinogenicity. The doctor addressed these points in his report and testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 As background for his report, Wilkenfeld interviewed Aguirre and reviewed his work-related exposures to carcinogenic material and medical treatment records. Wilkenfeld stated that Aguirre responded to four or five fires per month and had annual physical examinations clearing him for work as a firefighter. As a firefighter, Aguirre \"had repeated exposure to the carcinogens present at the fires, often without proper protective equipment.\" Wilkenfeld concluded that based on his review of medical literature, exposure records, and Aguirre's medical history, Aguirre developed CML as a result of such exposures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Wilkenfeld testified about Aguirre's exposure to chemicals and toxins that could lead to a diagnosis of CML, including benzene, asbestos, heavy metals, dioxins, and volatile organic compounds, to which he was exposed only during his work as a firefighter. Wilkenfeld explained that the fires Aguirre identified as being of particular concern were dangerous in terms of exposure to carcinogens because they involved oils and solvents. He also noted that even if Aguirre used protective gear, he still would have been exposed to toxins while cleaning his equipment at the fire station after firefighting in toxic environments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Wilkenfeld has experience working with the World Trade Center program that has treated firefighters, responders, and survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks (\"9/11\") since 2001. He stated that CML is on the list of cancers compiled by the federal government that are believed to have resulted from 9/11 exposures. He further testified that for firefighters present at Ground Zero who developed CML, the federal government has accepted latency periods as short as two years. Wilkenfeld relied on peer-reviewed studies that have shown increased rates of leukemia in firefighters. For these reasons, Wilkenfeld opined that \"to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\" Aguirre developed CML \"as a result of exposure that he experienced during his work as a firefighter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Jason Salganick, M.D., board certified in medical oncology, produced a report and testified on behalf of CopperPoint. He reviewed Aguirre's testimony, medical treatment records, and the Goodyear call records, as well as Wilkenfeld's report and testimony. Salganick also performed a literature search on PubMed and reviewed monographs by the International Association for Research on Cancer (\"IARC\") and what he termed documents \"involving 9/11 research and government directive protocols for compensation of firefighters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 In his report, Salganick noted that the toxins to which firefighters are generally exposed include \"benzenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, [and] chlorinated dioxins.\" He acknowledged that benzene is a potential carcinogen and is included in IARC's list of chemicals to which firefighters are presumed to be exposed. Salganick testified that firefighters are generally exposed to potential carcinogens, including benzene, but he could not determine if Aguirre was exposed to a known carcinogen as defined by the IARC because the records did not indicate what specific toxins were present at particular fires, what protective gear Aguirre wore, or the length of time he spent at each fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Salganick also explained he was not aware of a reasonable relationship between any carcinogen to which Aguirre may have been exposed and CML, yet he acknowledged that Aguirre \"would have been exposed\" to various \"well-documented substances,\" including benzene. Salganick stated he was unable to find that Aguirre's cancer was \"causally related to his work as a firefighter.\" Salganick also explained why his opinion differed from Wilkenfeld's opinion when they had both relied on the same studies. Salganick stated that based on his review\n   of the medical literature, it was necessary to show a standard mortality ratio (\"SMR\") of greater than 200, or a two-fold increase in the risk of developing cancer, before a study could be considered statistically significant and the cancer reasonably related for purposes of establishing a compensable claim. According to Salganick, there is a paucity of medical literature meeting that standard. As a result, the literature only supported a\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   connection between Aguirre's work as a firefighter and CML. Regarding the federal government's 9/11 Ground Zero list of potentially-related cancers, the only two on the list that have been recognized as being causally related are thyroid and prostate cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Following the hearings, the parties filed simultaneous post-hearing memoranda. In his ruling, after briefly summarizing the testimony, the ALJ stated he was more persuaded by CopperPoint's memorandum and concluded that Aguirre \"failed to carry his burden of proving by a reasonable preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a work related injury on May 14, 2015.\" Following Aguirre's request for review, the ALJ summarily affirmed the award and Aguirre sought review in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 To establish a compensable injury under the Arizona Workers' Compensation Act, a claimant must prove an accidental injury that arose out of, and in the course of, employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

The compensability of certain occupational diseases contracted by firefighters or peace officers, however, involves a lower burden of proof, as reflected in A.R.S. \u00a7 23-901.01(B) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [A]ny disease, infirmity, or impairment of a firefighter's or peace officer's health that is caused by ... leukemia... and that results in disability or death is presumed to be an occupational disease as defined in \u00a7 23-901, paragraph 13, subdivision (c) and is deemed to arise out of employment.

To meet that condition, Aguirre had to \"demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    at least one\n   </em>\n   carcinogen he was exposed to during hazardous duty is reasonably related\" to his CML.\n   <em>\n    Hahn v.

Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 CopperPoint contends that Aguirre is precluded from seeking appellate review of the sufficiency of the ALJ's findings because he failed to raise the issue in his request for review of the award by the ALJ. We are not persuaded by this contention for several reasons. First, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   suggests a party is required to challenge the sufficiency of findings in a request for review as a condition of asserting that argument on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    160 Ariz. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    770 P.2d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring ALJs to include sufficient findings to ensure that judicial review is possible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 Second, although a party seeking to challenge an ICA award in the appellate courts must first file a request for review, A.R.S. \u00a7 23-943(A), that same provision makes it clear that a party has no obligation to include any specific arguments in the request to preserve them for appellate review,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating that a request for review \"\n   <em>\n    need only state that the party requests a review of the award\n   </em>\n   \" and that the request \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities\") (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Backus v.

Instead, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   centered on the claimant's argument that the hearing officer erred by addressing whether a permanent disability had been proven.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457037\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/114/92/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457037\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/114/92/\">\n    at 94, 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457037\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/114/92/\">\n    559 P.2d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Explaining that the claimant had previously challenged the carrier's notice terminating benefits with no permanent disability, we rejected his argument on three grounds: (1) the claimant clearly placed the matter at issue in his request for hearing; (2) given the lack of evidence presented regarding a permanent disability, the claimant necessarily failed to meet his burden; and (3) he failed to raise the issue at any point in the ICA proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457037\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/114/92/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457037\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/114/92/\">\n    at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457037\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/114/92/\">\n    559 P.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, unlike the issue in\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   , the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine does not apply here because \u00a7 23-943 is permissive as to whether a party may challenge the sufficiency of the ALJ's findings in a request for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sw.

In\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Pearce\n   </em>\n   , because the ALJ in\n   <em>\n    Pearce\n   </em>\n   \"had at least drawn conclusions on the legal issues so that we could determine from the record whether the evidence supported his conclusions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    160 Ariz. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    770 P.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The ALJ summarized the facts and the testimony of both doctors and came to the bare conclusion that Aguirre \"failed to carry his burden of proving by a reasonable preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a work related injury.\" The ALJ did not resolve conflicting evidence, make ultimate factual findings, provide legal analysis of \u00a7 23-901.01(B)(3), or discuss\n   <em>\n    Hahn\n   </em>\n   , which is the only reported decision to date interpreting that statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    160 Ariz. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    770 P.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If we were to approve the award here, however, with no stated resolution of conflicting testimony, no findings of ultimate fact, and no conclusions on the legal issues, there would be no purpose in requiring [ALJs] to make findings.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, with no citation to authority, CopperPoint also argues the ALJ's reliance on its post-hearing memorandum makes the findings sufficient.

We need not address every point in the eight-page memorandum to reach this determination, as a few examples will suffice. CopperPoint asserted that Aguirre failed to meet the statutory presumption, but even if he did, the ALJ \"should conclude that Dr. Salganick's opinions are more probably correct that there is insufficient scientific evidence to support a causal connection between [Aguirre's] CML and his work as a firefighter.\" But CopperPoint cited no authority addressing under what circumstances an employer may rebut the presumption under the statute, as worded in 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057903\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/72/#p75\">\n    227 Ariz. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057903\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/72/#p75\">\n    252 P.3d at 1041, n.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to address the \"nature and effect\" of the presumption \"when it does apply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25 CopperPoint argued Aguirre failed to establish, under the first prong of \u00a7 23-901.01(B)(3), he was exposed to a known carcinogen as defined by the IARC, relying on Salganick's testimony. Wilkenfeld stated in his report that Aguirre \"had repeated exposures to the carcinogens present at the fires,\" including \"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins.\" Wilkenfeld testified that as a firefighter Aguirre would have been exposed to \"things like benzene.\" Salganick testified that nothing in the records showed that Aguirre was exposed to a known carcinogen, but on cross-examination he agreed Aguirre \"would have been exposed\" to substances such as \"benzenes, [etc.]\" because \"they are generally accepted as the kinds of chemicals to which firefighters are exposed.\" And Salganick did not dispute that benzene is listed by the IARC. CopperPoint's memorandum, however, did not include any discussion of benzene or the other potential carcinogens the doctors discussed in their reports and testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26 CopperPoint's memorandum also seemed to suggest that Aguirre failed to report his exposure to his employer as required by the second prong of \u00a7 23-901.01(B)(3). The statute does not address when, or in what format, such a report must be given.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23-901.01(B)(3). Regardless, other than the award's bare reference to the memorandum, nothing else in the record indicates the ALJ relied on either of these prongs to conclude that Aguirre failed to meet his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 CopperPoint argued further that Aguirre \"presented absolutely no evidence that he was exposed at a particular time to a particular carcinogen.\" Aguirre challenged this point in his request for review, asserting that CopperPoint was seeking to impose \"an impossible burden\" by contending that he was required to connect exposure to a specific potential carcinogen to a specific firefighting event. Without citation to authority, CopperPoint faulted Wilkenfeld for failing to identify details such as the year of the exposure, the length of time Aguirre was on the scene, whether Aguirre went into the fire or manned a hose or what type of protective equipment he used during the alleged exposure. Nothing in the statute or\n   <em>\n    Hahn\n   </em>\n   requires this level of detail. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Hahn\n   </em>\n   , application of the statute means Aguirre \"need only show a\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   causal link between a carcinogen to which he was exposed and one of the enumerated cancers to qualify for the presumption,\n   <em>\n    not that the exposure caused his particular cancer\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057903\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/72/#p75\">\n    227 Ariz. at 76, \u00b6 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057903\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/72/#p75\">\n    252 P.3d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 Finally, as to the credibility of witnesses, the memorandum fails to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   's directive that an ALJ \"must resolve all conflicts in the evidence, especially when the conflicts involve expert medical testimony.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    160 Ariz. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    770 P.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although CopperPoint analyzed portions of the testimony, the memorandum lacks any meaningful attempt to resolve the various conflicts\n   between the opinions offered by Wilkenfeld and Salganick. For example, the experts offered conflicting testimony as to what the SMR, or increase of risk in developing cancer, must be to show a reasonable relation between exposure of a carcinogen and the cancer. According to Salganick, anything less than a two-fold increase in the risk means that a connection between a carcinogen and the cancer is only possible, not probable, but Wilkenfeld disputed that a two-fold increase is required to establish a probable association. They also offered differing opinions as to what types of carcinogens Aguirre was exposed to, if any, and disagreed as to whether Salganick was qualified to offer an expert opinion on causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 29 Nothing in the ALJ's award or the memorandum indicate that the ALJ resolved these issues. It is not our role to speculate as to which arguments made by CopperPoint the ALJ found more persuasive to ultimately conclude that Aguirre failed to meet his burden. Thus, referencing the memorandum does not remedy the ALJ's inadequate findings. In our view, an ALJ will generally be better served to issue his or her own findings instead of relying on a party's memorandum. Doing so will help avoid ambiguities and conflicts that may arise on appeal. Thus, at a minimum, an ALJ choosing to rely on a memorandum should carefully delineate which portions of the memorandum he or she is relying on and how those portions support the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 30 On this record, we must set aside the award because the lack of findings leaves us unable to meaningfully review the ALJ's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520788\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/160/4/\">\n    770 P.2d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have no way of evaluating the basis of the judge's award and consequently cannot determine the factual support for, or the legal propriety of, his conclusion.\").
