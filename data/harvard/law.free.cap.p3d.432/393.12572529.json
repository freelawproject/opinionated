ORS 426.130. Appellant contends that the trial court committed plain error when it failed to advise him of his rights in accordance with ORS 426.100(1). The state concedes the error, and we agree that the court's failure to provide appellant with the information required under ORS 426.100(1) constitutes plain error.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, for the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    M. L.
