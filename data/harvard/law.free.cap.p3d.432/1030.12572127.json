(Father) appeals from the Order and Decree of Adoption issued by the Thirteenth\n   Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, terminating his parental rights and ordering the adoption of his minor daughter, L.F.R., by her stepfather, K.J.D. We reverse and remand for further proceedings, addressing the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by terminating Father's parental rights in violation of his right to counsel?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 L.F.R. is the natural child of Father and S.M.T. (Mother). The District Court found that L.F.R. \"has been with [Mother] and in her custody ever since birth,\" but that L.F.R.'s paternal great-grandparents \"have been parenting the minor child under the Final Parenting Plan dated April 16, 2015.\" Prior to and during the time covered by the Final Parenting Plan, Father failed to exercise his visitation rights with L.F.R., did not financially contribute to L.F.R.'s care, or otherwise be involved \"in any meaningful way\" with her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In December 2015, Mother married K.J.D., who became L.F.R.'s stepfather. L.F.R. began living with Mother and K.J.D., and, in March 2018, K.J.D. petitioned for termination of Father's parental rights, and for adoption of L.F.R., pursuant to \u00a7 42-2-608, MCA. At the May 7, 2018 hearing on the petition, K.J.D., Mother, and L.F.R.'s paternal great-grandparents all appeared and were represented by counsel. Father also appeared, but was not represented by counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On May 12, 2018, the District Court entered an order terminating\n   Father's parental rights and granting K.J.D.'s petition to adopt L.F.R., concluding the adoption was in L.F.R.'s best interests. The District Court did not address either any position taken by L.F.R.'s great-grandparents on the petition, or the status of their interest under the Final Parenting Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Father appeals, contending the District Court's failure to notify him of his right to counsel during the proceeding violated his constitutional rights.

Father relies on\n   <em>\n    A.W.S. v.

Here, Father faced the risk of permanently losing his parental rights to L.F.R. via a private adoption proceeding under Title 42, MCA, and was thus entitled to court-appointed counsel if he qualified as indigent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Appellee K.J.D. first argues that Father \"failed to object to the adoption at the time of hearing, despite testifying on his own behalf.\" However, the District Court found in its order that Father \"did object to the adoption proceeding,\" and K.J.D. has not established from the record that this finding is clearly erroneous. Regarding the right to counsel, the parties agree the District Court did not advise Father of his right during the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 In response to Father's reliance on\n   <em>\n    A.W.S.\n   </em>\n   , K.J.D. distinguishes that case from this one, arguing that the District Court did not err by failing to notify Father of his right to counsel because Father \"did not request appointed counsel, nor did he suggest or imply that he did not have the money to retain an attorney,\" as the mother in\n   <em>\n    A.W.S.\n   </em>\n   had suggested. K.J.D. argues that, by failing to express a desire for counsel, Father failed to preserve the issue for appeal (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Declaring A.N.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3342145\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/331/208/\">\n    2006 MT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3342145\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/331/208/\">\n    331 Mont. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3342145\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/331/208/\">\n    130 P.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This Court does not consider an issue presented for the first time on appeal.\") ). Indeed, in response to the argument in\n   <em>\n    A.W.S.\n   </em>\n   that mother had failed to raise the issue and preserve it for appeal, we stated that, \"where Mother was not advised of any right to counsel, she preserved the issue when she explained that she represented herself only because she did not have the money to employ an attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    A.W.S.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 However, having concluded in\n   <em>\n    A.W.S.\n   </em>\n   that the mother's right to counsel was properly before us as a sufficiently invoked issue, it was not necessary for the Court to address the issue we confront here-whether a parent in a termination proceeding, having received no notice of the right to counsel, can waive the right by mere silence. We conclude the right cannot be so waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 We acknowledge our line of authority requiring parties to affirmatively invoke the right to counsel. In\n   <em>\n    J.M.\n   </em>\n   , which, as here, was a parental right termination and adoption proceeding, we held, \"[w]hile\n   it does not take 'particular words' to request counsel, some indication must be given to the court that respondent wishes counsel to be appointed because he is indigent or financially unable to secure representation in an involuntary termination proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    J.M.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. However, the respondent in\n   <em>\n    J.M.\n   </em>\n   had been represented by private counsel for much of the proceeding, and was notified by the court of his right to obtain new counsel after receiving notice of his attorney's withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    J.M.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. Thus, the record demonstrated the respondent's knowledge of his right to counsel. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    In re M.V.R.\n   </em>\n   , a state-initiated parental right termination proceeding, we held the district court did not err by failing to appoint another public defender for the indigent mother, when she failed \"to indicate to the District Court, in any manner, that she needed another public defender\" after she terminated her first public defender, hired private counsel, her private counsel withdrew, and the district court provided notice of her continuing right to counsel.\n   <em>\n    In re M.V.R.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 51. We reasoned that \"Mother was aware of what was required to obtain a public defender,\" but she had failed to request appointment of other counsel, and thus, \"was not denied counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    In re M.V.R.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 50. Again, in contrast to Father here, the mother in\n   <em>\n    In re M.V.R.\n   </em>\n   was well aware of her right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Generally, waiver of the right to counsel requires a knowing and voluntary waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-8-102, MCA (a criminal defendant\n   may waive the right to counsel \"knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Missoula v.
