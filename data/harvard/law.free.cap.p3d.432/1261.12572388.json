The district court imposed a 3 to 5-year sentence for that crime as well.

This Court subsequently entered Orders Granting Motions for Extension of Time to File\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Brief. This Court ordered that, on or before December 13, 2018, Appellant \"may file with this Court a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief specifying the issues he would like the Court to consider in this appeal.\" This Court also provided notice that, after the time for filing a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief expired, this Court would make its ruling on counsel's motions to withdraw and, if appropriate, make a final decision on these appeals. This Court notes that Appellant did not file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief or other pleading in the time allotted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [\u00b63]Now, following a careful review of the record and the \"\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   \" briefs submitted by appellate counsel, this Court finds that appellate counsel's motions to withdraw should be granted and the district court's \"Judgment and Sentence\" should be affirmed in both appeals.
