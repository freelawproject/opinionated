Review is also granted on the following issues raised in Pierce's answer to the petition for review: whether the trial court erred in allowing the State to strike Juror 6, an African-American, on pretextual grounds; whether the trial court erred in failing to instruct the reconstituted jury to begin deliberations anew after the court sat an alternate in the place of an excused juror; and whether the presence of non-deliberating jurors in the jury room violated the requirement that the jury deliberate in private. This case is consolidated with Supreme Court No. 96345-2 -\n   <em>\n    State v. Bienhoff, et al.\n   </em>\n   All further documents should be filed under this case number, No. 96344-4.
