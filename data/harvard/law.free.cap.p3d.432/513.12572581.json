His daughter, Kaley Addison, appeals the district court's order affirming the forfeiture of Mr. Addison's $50,000 cash bond, claiming the doctrine of abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   applies to the bond forfeiture proceeding.

Mr. Addison died the day after the State filed a motion to revoke his bond and the district court issued a warrant for his arrest, and five days prior to his scheduled criminal trial in Albany County, Wyoming. In March 2017, the State charged Mr. Addison with 25 felony counts: one count of first degree sexual assault, one count of blackmail, two counts of attempted blackmail, one count of felonious restraint, and twenty counts of sexual exploitation of a child. At the time of his death, Mr. Addison was free on a $50,000 cash appearance bond, which, among other things, limited his travel to Albany and Laramie counties, and prohibited his use of alcohol or controlled substances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] Following Mr. Addison's death, the district court, on the State's motion, ordered Mr. Addison's $50,000 cash appearance bond forfeited to the State of Wyoming. Shortly thereafter, Kaley Addison filed an objection to the forfeiture order as Mr. Addison's heir, and requested that the district court either set aside the forfeiture order or stay the forfeiture pending appeal. The district court held a hearing during which it received evidence and heard argument regarding bond forfeiture. After the hearing, Mr. Addison's counsel, on behalf of Mr. Addison's estate, filed a motion for abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   of Mr. Addison's case, including the bond forfeiture order. The district court entered its order affirming forfeiture of Mr. Addison's bond on January 17, 2018. In affirming the bond forfeiture, the district court,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , applied Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure 46 - 46.4 and the seven factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Nw.

According to Ms. Addison, stare decisis requires that we apply that doctrine in this case. She cautions us against departing from settled precedent and emphasizes language from\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

We have never applied the doctrine to a bond forfeiture proceeding or any proceeding when the defendant died prior to trial. Consequently, whether the doctrine applies under the circumstances of this case is a question of first impression untethered to principles of stare decisis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] The doctrine of abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   is a common law doctrine in which criminal proceedings are deemed nullified from the beginning for reasons unrelated to the merits of the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11263131\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/37/188/\">\n    260 P. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A cornerstone of this doctrine is the abatement of a judgment of conviction, in \"the interests of finality and just punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Free\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , (\"[t]he underlying principle is that the object of all criminal punishment is to punish the one who committed the crime or offense, and not to punish those upon whom his estate is cast, by operation of law or otherwise.\"). \"Finality requires that 'a defendant not stand convicted without resolution of the merits of an appeal', and recognition of the purposes of just punishment leads to the conclusion that 'to the extent that the judgment of conviction orders incarceration or other sanctions that are designed to punish the defendant, that purpose can no longer be served.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263759\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/78/#p87\">\n    872 F.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] Here, because Mr. Addison died prior to trial he was neither convicted nor punished.

Mr. Addison's bond was a civil contractual agreement between the State and Mr. Addison,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., and the State demonstrated that Mr. Addison violated the terms and conditions of that agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, though the $50,000 cash bond was constructed in relation to Mr. Addison's pending trial, the bond forfeiture proceeding did not fall under the criminal prosecution or any judgment. The terms of Mr. Addison's pre-trial release were independent of the ultimate determination of his guilt or innocence, and the forfeiture of Mr. Addison's bond operated as damages for his breach of those terms, not as punishment for the criminal offenses for which he was charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beagle\n   </em>\n   , 86 P.3d at 1273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610] Ms. Addison would have us distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   and cases cited therein on grounds that the interest in finality was served in those cases but has not been served in this case because Mr. Addison's bond was forfeited after, rather than before his death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263759\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/78/#p87\">\n    872 F.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91-94 (court decided whether defendant's death while case was pending on appeal abates the previous bond forfeiture, for which the revocation was affirmed on interlocutory appeal);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We conclude that the timing of Mr. Addison's death relative to his bond forfeiture is of no consequence given he died before any judgment of conviction or punishment was imposed, and, most important, because the timing of Mr. Addison's death does not change the collateral, contractual nature of his bond proceeding. For the same reasons, we reject Ms. Addison's suggestion that the doctrine of abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   should apply here because Mr. Addison acted as his own surety and under those circumstances we should not punish his estate. As both the district court and Ms. Addison correctly noted, \"[t]he purpose of a bail bond is not punitive.\"\n   <em>\n    Beagle\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3, 86 P.3d at 1273 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
