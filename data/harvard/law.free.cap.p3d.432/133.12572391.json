(\"DF Inc.\") by allowing a former authorized agent to charge on DF Inc.'s credit account after DF Inc. notified Kenyon Noble\n   that it had ceased operations. The court awarded DF Inc. attorney fees. Kenyon Noble argues that because it lacked notice of the agent's termination, it could not have breached the contract. Kenyon Noble also contests the award of attorney fees. We affirm and award the Defendants their attorney fees for this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Mark Markovich founded DF Inc. in Michigan. In 2007, Mark formed Dependant Foundations, LLC (\"DF LLC\") in Montana. At that time, Mark continued to operate DF Inc. in Michigan, and Shawn Karczewski operated DF LLC in Montana. Mark's son, Marco Markovich, worked for DF LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Kenyon Noble operates a building supply store. It allows customers to establish credit accounts to purchase building materials and concrete on a credit basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kenyon Noble requires an individual personally to guarantee payment for the debts of companies that hold credit accounts. In 2007, DF LLC entered into a credit agreement with Kenyon Noble that allowed DF LLC to purchase building materials and concrete on credit. The contract included Mark's signed personal guaranty for the debts incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 When Karczewski left DF LLC in 2008, he removed himself as an authorized user on DF LLC's credit account and added Marco as a new authorized user. In 2011, when Mark relocated to Montana, he merged DF Inc. and DF LLC. DF Inc. became the successor-by-merger. Marco continued as an employee and authorized agent of DF Inc. DF Inc. did not notify Kenyon Noble that it merged with DF LLC, but continued to use DF LLC's credit account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 In 2012, Mark told Marco that he intended to wind down DF Inc. and that Marco would need to start his own company. Marco organized Dependant Foundations and Flatwork, LLC (\"Foundations and Flatwork\"). Mark decided to send a letter to DF Inc.'s Montana-based suppliers to ensure that they knew Foundations and Flatwork was a separate and distinct company from DF Inc. and that Mark was not responsible for Marco's debt. On September 20, 2012, JoEllen Markovich, Mark's wife and DF Inc.'s bookkeeper, sent a letter to DF Inc.'s suppliers stating that DF Inc. was no longer operating and that it was not responsible for Foundations and Flatwork's debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 In fall 2013, Marco began to purchase concrete from Kenyon Noble on DF LLC's credit account. Marco charged the materials he purchased on behalf of \"Dependant Foundations.\" He did not inform Kenyon Noble that he had started his own business, nor did he open a new credit account for Foundations and Flatwork. He did, however, change the address on the account. By late 2013, the outstanding principal balance on the account was $28,798.56. In January 2014, Marco sent Kenyon Noble a $15,000 check, but it was returned for insufficient funds. The check was written on the account of \"Dependant Foundations &amp; Flatwork, LLC.\" Kenyon Noble was unsuccessful in collecting payment on the account balance, and it filed suit against Mark and DF Inc. in March 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 Two months later, Kenyon Noble amended its complaint to add Marco and Foundations and Flatwork as defendants. Marco admitted that the debts belonged to him and agreed on a repayment schedule with Kenyon Noble. Consequently, Kenyon Noble dismissed Mark and DF Inc. from the case. Shortly thereafter, Kenyon Noble reinstated Mark and DF Inc. as defendants because the attempted settlement with Marco never materialized. The District Court entered default judgment against Marco. Kenyon Noble tried unsuccessfully to execute its judgment against Marco and continued the lawsuit against Mark and DF Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 Mark and DF Inc. brought five counterclaims against Kenyon Noble: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, in violation of \u00a7 28-1-211, MCA ; (3) defamation-libel; (4) invasion of privacy-false light; and (5) abuse of the judicial process by claiming that Mark and DF Inc. were responsible for Marco's debts. The case was tried to the court without a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 At trial JoEllen testified that she sent the September 20, 2012 letter to Kenyon Noble in a properly addressed and stamped envelope, complete with a return address. Kenyon Noble denied receiving the letter from DF Inc. After three days of testimony, the District Court found that DF Inc. was entitled to the statutory presumption that Kenyon Noble received the letter. The court concluded that Kenyon Noble failed to successfully rebut the presumption. Because Kenyon Noble continued to allow Marco to charge on the account after it was notified that his authority was terminated, Kenyon Noble's claims failed. DF Inc.'s revocation of Marco's authority was valid pursuant to \u00a7 28-10-802(1), MCA, and the court ruled in favor of Mark and DF Inc. on their counterclaim for breach of contract. The court ruled against Mark and DF Inc. on their remaining counterclaims. It awarded Mark and DF Inc. attorney fees and costs as the prevailing parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 On appeal from a bench trial, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Roland v.

Inc. JoEllen testified further that, customary with her habit and practice, she addressed the letters, placed a stamp on the letters, and wrote a return address on the envelopes. The letters were not returned from the postal service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 Kenyon Noble maintains that DF Inc. did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that it is entitled to the presumption that Kenyon Noble received DF Inc.'s letter. Kenyon Noble frames the issue as whether the District Court misapplied the law governing presumption of receipt. But its argument essentially is that the evidence did not establish the presumption. Kenyon Noble argues that there was no proof regarding the correct address, correct postage, or DF Inc.'s custom of mailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 On the basis of JoEllen's testimony, which it found credible, the District Court concluded that the statutory presumption of receipt applied because the September 20, 2012 letter was sent in a properly addressed and stamped envelope, complete with a return address. The court's factual finding is supported by substantial evidence. It did not misapply the statute because JoEllen provided affirmative testimony that she followed her office practice or custom when mailing letters to DF Inc.'s suppliers, including Kenyon Noble.\n   <em>\n    Crissey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5240107\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/147/374/#p378\">\n    147 Mont. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5240107\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/147/374/#p378\">\n    413 P.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Even if DF Inc. were entitled to the presumption, Kenyon Noble insists that it rebutted the presumption with evidence of its routine mail handling practices showing that if either copy of the letter had been received, it would have been on file.

Hyatt testified that if he received mail related to credit accounts, a series of actions would occur, and those actions did not occur with regard to DF Inc.'s account. Hyatt did not testify about any specific individuals who handled the mail for Kenyon Noble in September 2012 or persons who would have delivered\n   mail to his office in September 2012.

Mark and DF Inc. reduced their fee claim to deduct hours expended solely in relation to the unsuccessful counterclaims. The District Court removed\n   additional claimed fees solely related to time spent on a motion related to unsuccessful counterclaims. The court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the remaining fees and costs were inextricably intertwined because the breach of contract counterclaim was based on the same facts and witnesses as the unsuccessful counterclaims. Pursuant to the credit agreement, the prevailing party was entitled to attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b628 When an entitlement to costs and attorney fees arises from contract, that entitlement includes costs and attorney fees on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Mark and DF Inc. are the prevailing parties on appeal. They prevailed on the attorney fee issue, and they prevailed against Kenyon Noble's argument that it did not receive notice terminating Marco's authority or the account. Therefore, Mark and DF Inc. are entitled to attorney fees in connection with this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Reasonableness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b629 Mark and DF Inc. were represented at trial by Matthew Dodd and Roger Dodd. Matthew claimed a range from $150 to $215 per hour, and the more experienced Roger claimed a rate of $500 per hour. After considering Kenyon Noble's objection, the District Court reduced Roger's hourly rate to $375. Kenyon Noble argues that the District Court's reduction is unreasonable because it exceeds the prevailing rate for attorneys in \"straightforward commercial contract disputes\" in Montana. Kenyon Noble argues that Roger's rate should be reduced to no more than $250 per hour. Kenyon Noble relies on\n   <em>\n    Blum v.

In contrast, the attorney fees in this case were awarded under the provisions of the contract between the parties.

The District Court concluded that $500 per hour for the second-chair trial attorney was not a reasonable rate in this case and reduced Roger's rate to $375 per hour. In limiting the hourly rate, the District Court explained that it looked to the seven\n   <em>\n    Plath\n   </em>\n   factors. The District Court found that the importance of the litigation to Mark and DF Inc. justified the number of hours billed. And even though Kenyon Noble described the litigation as \"a routine collection matter,\" it was of significant importance to the parties, as the litigation impacted \"not only [Mark's] sense of self but his relationships with his wife and his grown son.\" The court reasoned that the nature of the legal issues did not diminish \"the professional skill and experience\" necessary for Mark and DF Inc. to prevail at trial. The court emphasized that Kenyon Noble's expert conceded that \"[g]iven the complexity of the matter,\" it was \"prudent to have a second chair available in the Courtroom during trial.\" The court emphasized Roger's high standing in the profession, his forty-plus years of experience as a trial lawyer, and that he has lectured and taught nationwide and internationally for decades. The court also recognized that even though Mark and DF Inc. did not prevail on all of their counterclaims, they prevailed on what the parties agree was the most significant issue in dispute. Comparing Roger's claimed hourly rate to other recent attorney fee awards and the rates charged by highly skilled attorneys in the Bozeman community, the District Court concluded that $375 per hour for Roger's time billed was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b632 After a review of the full record, we conclude that Kenyon Noble has not shown the District Court's award to be arbitrary, without the employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason under the circumstances.
