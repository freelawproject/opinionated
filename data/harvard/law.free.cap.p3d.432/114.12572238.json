We address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the District Court erred in granting Victory's Motion to Change Venue on the basis that the venue provision in \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, controlled over the venue provision in \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Victory is a Montana workers' compensation insurance company with its principal office located in Custer County. Keith Brownfield is Victory's president and chief executive officer. The Judy Bretsch Trust (Trust) is a living trust formed under the laws of South Dakota and is a Victory shareholder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On September 19, 2017, the Commissioner filed a Complaint in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, against Victory, Brownfield, and the Trust, seeking statutory fines and to enjoin Victory pursuant to alleged violations of Montana's Holding Company Act. The Commissioner argued venue was proper in Lewis and Clark County because the Commissioner sought statutory fines pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, and injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On October 4, 2017, Victory filed a Motion to Change Venue. In its Motion, Victory argued \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, requires the injunction claim be filed in Custer County and necessitates a transfer of the entire action to Custer County. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted Victory's Motion to Change Venue, holding that \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, controlled and that venue was proper in Custer County. The Commissioner appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Whether a county is the proper venue for trial is an issue of law involving the application of the venue statutes to the pleaded facts.\n   <em>\n    Farmers Union Ass'n v.

If an action is brought in an improper venue, a defendant may move for a change of venue to a designated county. Section 25-2-114, MCA. If an action involves two or more claims where Title 25, chapter 2, part 1, designates more than one venue as a proper place of trial, a party entitled to a change of venue on any claim is entitled to a change of venue on the entire action. Section 25-2-116, MCA. If there are two or more defendants in an action, a county that is a proper venue for any defendant is proper for all defendants. Section 25-2-117, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The Legislature created an exception to the general venue guidelines where a venue provision outside of Title 25, chapter 2, part 1, conflicts with a Title 25 venue statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.J.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446525\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/386/218/\">\n    2017 MT 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446525\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/386/218/\">\n    386 Mont. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446525\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/386/218/\">\n    388 P.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing \u00a7 25-2-131, MCA ). In such instances, specific venue statutes outside\n   of Title 25, chapter 2, part 1, control over more general venue statutes within Title 25, chapter 2, part 1. Section 25-2-131, MCA (\"The provisions of this part do not repeal, by implication or otherwise,\n   <em>\n    specific statutes not within this part\n   </em>\n   , designating a proper place of trial, whether or not such a designation is called venue or proper place of trial.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 This Court will \"avoid a statutory construction that renders any section of a statute superfluous or fails to give effect to all of the words used.\"\n   <em>\n    Mont.

This Court operates \"under the presumption that the legislature does not pass meaningless legislation, and we will harmonize statutes relating to the same subject in order to give effect to each statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The Commissioner's Complaint seeks statutory fines pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, and an injunction pursuant to \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA. Section 25-2-124, MCA, states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The proper place of trial for the recovery of a penalty or forfeiture imposed by statute is the county where the cause or some part thereof arose....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 33-2-1118, MCA, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer or any director, officer, employee, or insurance producer thereof has committed or is about to commit a violation of this part or of any rule or order issued by the commissioner hereunder,\n   <em>\n    the commissioner may apply to the district court for the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located\n   </em>\n   or if such insurer has no such officer in this state then to the district court for Lewis and Clark County for an order enjoining such insurer or such director, officer, employee, or insurance producer thereof from violating or continuing to violate this part or any such rule or order and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interests of the insurer's policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 In this case, the District Court determined the Commissioner ignored the plain language of \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, and held the Commissioner must seek injunctive relief in Custer County. The District Court also concluded that Custer County is a proper venue for Brownfield and the Trust, pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA, because Custer County is a proper venue for Victory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The Commissioner argues venue is mandatory and proper in Lewis and Clark County because the claims involve Victory, Brownfield, and the Trust's alleged failure to make regulatory filings under Montana's Holding Company Act. The Commissioner contends \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, is the mandatory and specific venue provision for this action, and Lewis and Clark County is the proper venue for all the defendants, because the Complaint's statutory fine claims arose in Helena. Additionally, the Commissioner argues under\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   that when there are two potentially proper venues, and neither is proper for all defendants and all claims, no defendant has the right to move for a change of venue if the plaintiff's choice was a proper venue for at least one defendant. The Commissioner argues Lewis and Clark County is proper for at least the Trust because of the statutory penalty sought under \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, and the District Court erred by granting primacy to \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, because that section applies\n   only to insurers or directors, officers, or employees of the insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Victory argues that the specific venue provision in \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, should control over the general venue provision found in \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA. Victory also argues the Commissioner's interpretation of \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, would render its venue provision meaningless because \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, would consistently concede to the statutory penalty venue provision in \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, and the Commissioner could always avoid it by raising a statutory forfeiture claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 The specific venue provision language in \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, defeats the general venue provision language found in \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA. The plain language of \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, clearly indicates the Commissioner must seek injunctive relief in the district court \"for the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located....\" Section 33-2-1118, MCA. Section 25-2-124, MCA, is a venue statute that generally applies to statutory penalty cases. However, \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, is the more specific venue statute for this action because it involves the alleged failure to file as a holding company under Title 33-the actual complaint brought by the Commissioner-and not just the enforcement of a general statutory penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-2-131, MCA. Section 25-2-131, MCA, provides that specific statutes control, and \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, provides the specific venue provision when injunctions are sought under Title 33. Accordingly, \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, controls venue in this action and requires it to be placed in Custer County, the location of the principal office and residence of Victory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-2-131, MCA ; \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    In re C.J.L.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Allowing for the venue provision in \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, to control would render the venue provision in \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mont. Trout Unltd.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23. Under our jurisprudence, both \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, and \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, must be harmonized to give effect to each statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. The Commissioner's claim seeking injunctive relief requires that the more specific venue statute, \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, control to not render its venue provision meaningless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-2-131, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Mont. Trout Unltd.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23 ;\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 The Commissioner's argument that, under\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   , a defendant\n   may only attempt to change venue if the initial action is brought in a county that is improper for all defendants is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   concerned a conflict between multiple Title 25, chapter 2, part 1, venue statutes resulting in two potentially proper venues where neither venue was proper for all defendants and all claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13.\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue in this action where a conflict exists between a specific venue provision outside Title 25, chapter 2, part 1, and a general venue provision within Title 25, chapter 2, part 1. Here, \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, is the specific statute concerning venue relating to the Complaint's allegation that Victory failed to file as a holding company and is outside Title 25, chapter 2, part 1. Therefore, according to \u00a7 25-2-131, MCA, \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, controls and requires a change of venue to Custer County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-2-131, MCA ; \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Venue for the Commissioner's claims is proper in Custer County for Brownfield and the Trust because \"[i]f there are two or more defendants in an action, a county that is a proper place of trial for any defendant is proper for all defendants....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA. Custer County is the only appropriate venue for Victory and, therefore, is also an appropriate venue for Brownfield and the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 The District Court correctly concluded Victory is entitled to a change of venue based on the injunctive relief sought by the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paquin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. Consequently, Victory is entitled to a change of venue on the entire action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 The specific venue provision in \u00a7 33-2-1118, MCA, controls over the general venue provision in \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA. The District Court correctly concluded venue is proper in Custer County for all the defendants.
