Several family members survived Decedent, including his spouse, Emily Frank; four sons, Marvin Frank, Kenneth Frank, Darrell Frank, and Richard Frank; and a daughter, Ardith Ross.

Appellant identified herself and the four surviving children of Decedent and Emily as the estate's distributees and asked the court to distribute Decedent's real property interests in equal shares to the distributees. The district court denied Appellant's application because Appellant did not fit the definition of \"distributee\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-301\">\n    Wyo.

The court stated in support of its decision that Decedent's spouse, Emily Frank, was the \"distributee\" under Decedent's will, not Appellant. The court also opined that, if Decedent's estate was subject to intestate succession under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-4-101\">\n    Wyo.

Despite waiting sixteen years to seek summary distribution of Decedent's estate, Appellant argues speed and efficiency are especially important in proceedings for the summary distribution of an estate's property because the legislature limited the availability of such proceedings to small estates not exceeding $200,000 in value. She alleges that adopting the district court's interpretation would undermine the intended speed and efficiency by preventing Decedent's real property from being distributed in a single proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-205\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2-1-205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, she alleges the district court's interpretation would require separate probate proceedings (one each for Decedent, Emily Frank, Ardith Ross, and Henry Ross) to accomplish the same task. Appellant argues that the costs in time and money to pursue those proceedings could be disproportionate to the value of the estate and that requiring a person to incur those costs would be contrary to the legislature's stated policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b613] We agree that by capping the value of estates eligible under the statute, the legislature intended the \"summary procedure for distribution of personal or real property\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-205\">\n    Wyo.

However, the legislature also promoted the purpose of \"mak[ing] effective the intent of a decedent in distribution of his property\" by writing the summary distribution statute and the definition of distributee to address a single decedent (\"the decedent\", \"his will\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-102\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2-1-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(ii), 2-1-205, 2-1-301(a)(xiii). Neither the language of those statutes nor the probate code's express policies indicate the legislature intended the summary distribution proceeding to adjudicate more than one decedent's estate; something Appellant's interpretation would require. Accordingly, the district court's interpretation better adheres to the statutes' focus on a single decedent's estate while also providing for an efficient proceeding for distribution of property in smaller estates. Limiting the scope of distributees to only those who are entitled to a decedent's property through his immediate will or through intestate succession as applied only to that decedent's estate promotes use of the summary distribution process for smaller estates that are uncomplicated by lines of inheritance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b614] We conclude, as the district court did, that the definition of distributee applies solely to persons who are entitled to property of a decedent through that decedent's will or the statutes of intestate succession as applied to that decedent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-301\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2-1-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(xiii). In this case, Decedent's will passed his assets and real property to Emily Frank. Appellant allegedly possesses an interest in the real property by way of several estates-a claim that does not fit the definition of distributee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because she\n   was not a distributee of Decedent's estate, Appellant was not a proper applicant under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-205\">\n    Wyo.
