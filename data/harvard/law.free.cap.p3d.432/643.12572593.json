Lawrence G.

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 14, 2005, McDay was arrested for driving under the influence in violation of Idaho Code section 18-8004. On the same day, the prosecuting attorney filed a case against McDay, CR-2005-7362 (\"DUI case\"), supported by an affidavit of probable cause, and the magistrate court issued an order finding probable cause. On August 3, 2005, the case was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Four years later, on March 25, 2009, McDay was arrested for: (1) driving without privileges in violation of Idaho Code section 18-8001 ; (2) failure to provide proof of insurance in violation of Idaho Code section 49-1232 ; and (3) possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Idaho Code section 37-2734A(1). The next day, the prosecuting attorney filed a case against McDay, CR-2009-6228 (\"Paraphernalia case\"), supported by an affidavit of probable cause, and the magistrate court issued an order finding probable cause on all three charges. The charges were subsequently reduced or dismissed on May 6, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On approximately October 2, 2016, McDay filed an expungement application with the BCI to have both criminal cases expunged from his record. On October 14, 2016, BCI denied McDay's request after finding that he was ineligible for expungement. On October 24, 2016, McDay filed a Notice of Appeal to Expunge in magistrate court under his previous DUI case number. McDay also filed an Affidavit Statement under both the DUI case number and the Paraphernalia case number. The State objected, alleging that the time to file an appeal had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 7, 2016, McDay filed a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal under his DUI case number in magistrate court. After a hearing the magistrate judge entered an order-under both of McDay's previous criminal case numbers-that denied McDay's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal; however, the magistrate court construed McDay's October 24, 2016, Notice of Appeal to Expunge as a request for judicial review of a state agency action and forwarded BCI's expungement decision to the district court under I.R.C.P. 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A district court judge was assigned to the appeal under both of McDay's previous criminal case numbers. The district court affirmed the BCI decision after finding that McDay's failure to follow procedural rules was fatal to his appeal; namely, that McDay had failed to provide the district court with an agency record for review. McDay timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After providing a factual background of the case, McDay's opening brief provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-17\">\n   1. BCI's denial of expungement of a criminal record, stating the person seeking expungement must provide \"a certified copy of the court's order of acquittal finding the applicant was not guilty of the crime charged.\" Hon. James D. Stow advised that because the record is already sealed in the District Court, there is nothing further that the District Court can do. It is out of their jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The up-coding of the original civil infraction to criminal offense by adding the verbiage/DRUG to both State and Federal records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   3. BCI's claim that the Appellant's petition for judicial review was not filed in a timely manner per Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 84(b)(1)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. The DUI, CR-7362, [sic] was not a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5. The Paraphernalia charge, CR-09-6228, was an unlawful conviction and\n   false imprisonment, and a violation of due process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   The pro se attorney litigant expects that they are entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) in the amount of $100.00 hour at 57.75 hours starting July 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    ARGUMENT\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    1. Appellant cannot get employment in his educational field due to the fact he cannot pass a BCI/ FBI background check.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    2. Appellant is continually today profiled based on inaccurate data on record and affects passage between US and Canadian borders as an example.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    3. The basis of BCI's denial to update is \"based on the record\". Given that statement, there is no reason to deny revision in order to match the existing Idaho Repository.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Based on McDay's briefing, we will not reach the merits of his claims on appeal. While his ultimate goal is clear-he wants to have the two criminal cases expunged from his BCI record-McDay fails to present any cogent argument or authority to achieve such a remedy. This Court has established standards it will use when determining whether to consider the issues a litigant has raised on appeal:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    We will not consider an issue not \"supported by argument and authority in the opening brief.\"\n    <em>\n     Jorgensen v.

Regardless of whether an issue is explicitly set forth in the party's brief as one of the issues on appeal, if the issue is only mentioned in passing and not supported by any cogent argument or authority, it cannot be considered by this Court.\n    <em>\n     Inama v.

Because McDay's arguments lack citations to the record, citations of applicable authority, and comprehensible argument, this Court will not consider them on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     III. ATTORNEY FEES\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    McDay is not the prevailing party and not entitled to attorney fees on appeal. The State requests fees under\n    Idaho Code section 12-117, which allows a court to award attorney fees to the prevailing party \"in any proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency ... and a person ... if [the court] finds that the nonprevailing party acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\" I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1). We decline to award attorney fees under section 12-117 because McDay's efforts, although lacking the particularity and citations required for a cogent appeal here, were based on what is an obvious effort to obtain recourse that he may now be entitled to under recently amended Idaho statutes. As a result, McDay did not act without a reasonable basis in fact or law in seeking relief that he may yet be entitled to under Idaho law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The district court judgment is affirmed. Costs are awarded to the State as a matter of right. Despite this holding, we note that BCI originally denied McDay's request because his criminal cases were \"dismissed\" and Idaho Code section 67-3004(10) required that he be \"acquitted.\" In July 2018, the Idaho Legislature amended section 67-3004(10) to also allow for criminal history record expungement for any person who has had charges \"dismissed.\" Thus, McDay may now be eligible to have his record expunged should he file a new application with BCI. This opinion in no way forecloses his ability to file such an application or bring a civil action challenging the denial of any such application should he choose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices HORTON, BRODY and STEGNER concur.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
