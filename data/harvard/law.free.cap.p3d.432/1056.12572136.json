In this case, we are tasked with crafting suitable discipline for an attorney who-in the course of a contentious child-custody dispute with a former spouse-violated the conditions of a victim protective order by sending a flurry of harassing and inappropriate text messages. Although Dunivan did not physically harm or threaten his ex-wife (or act in a manner directly detrimental to the interests of any client), Dunivan's general course of conduct-both before and\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   entering his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the misdemeanor violation of the protective order-evinces a pattern of disregard for complying with judicial orders. An attorney\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   follow the rules, and Dunivan (who previously received a private reprimand from the Professional Responsibility Commission of the Oklahoma Bar Association in 2010) too frequently has not. Under the circumstances, a standalone verbal rebuke from this Court risks being too easily brushed aside. We suspend Dunivan from the practice of law for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Dunivan was admitted to the Oklahoma Bar Association (OBA) in 2002. In recent years, he has maintained a general law practice in Perry, Oklahoma. Dunivan married his now-former wife, Ginger Swann, in 2008. In May of that year, Dunivan was involved in a\n   verbal altercation with Swann's ex-husband during a child-custody exchange in Texas. Because of that encounter, the ex-husband filed a police report and-later on-a grievance against Dunivan with the OBA. Dunivan was not charged in the Texas incident. In March 2009, however, Dunivan was arrested in Bartlesville for driving under the influence. As a result of both the Texas-based grievance and Dunivan's self-reported DUI arrest, the OBA's Professional Responsibility Commission issued a private reprimand to Dunivan in August 2010. The Professional Responsibility Commission conditioned Dunivan's reprimand upon his successful completion of anger-management counseling and a substance-abuse assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 While married, Dunivan and Swann had one child together: S.D., a son, who is now nine years old. Shortly after S.D.'s birth, Dunivan and Swann divorced. It is abundantly clear from the record that their divorce-and, in particular, their subsequent battle for custody of S.D.-was extraordinarily bitter, protracted, and painful for both parties. As hostilities escalated between Dunivan and Swann, the Blaine County District Court issued a protective order on December 4, 2014 that prohibited Dunivan from contacting Swann, with the sole exception that \"[t]he parties may send texts and/or emails to each other concerning visitation with their minor child.\" The protective order also required Dunivan to remain away from Swann's residence in Watonga.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On March 25, 2016, following one of many disagreements over his visitation with S.D., Dunivan sent a series of 17 text messages to Swann. These text messages have been variously-and accurately-described as \"churlish,\" \"vexatious,\" \"ugly,\" \"vulgar and mean-spirited,\" \"unkind and immature,\" \"out of line,\" and \"written in anger and haste.\" After receiving the texts, Swann filed a report with the Watonga Police Department, alleging a violation of the protective order. As noted by the investigating officer, Dunivan's text messages to Swann \"were of a harassing nature and had very little to do with Mr. Dunivan's visits with their son.\" Thereafter, Dunivan was charged in Blaine County District Court (Case No. CM-2016-83) with a misdemeanor protective-order violation, in contravention of 22 O.S.2011 \u00a7 60.6. The feuding with Swann did not end there, and Dunivan was later charged with two more protective-order violations in Blaine County in June and December 2016-once for allegedly sending Swann another string of bizarrely harassing text messages in which he appeared to impersonate their young son (Blaine County District Court Case No. CM-2016-117), and then for allegedly approaching her off-limits Watonga residence in a vehicle with his then-girlfriend (Blaine County District Court Case No. CM-2016-210).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On December 4, 2017, Dunivan entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to misdemeanor violation of a protective order in Blaine County District Court Case No. CM-2016-83, stemming from his text-message harassment of Swann on March 25, 2016. As part of a negotiated plea agreement, the State dismissed the two remaining Blaine County cases charging Dunivan with the additional protective-order violations. Dunivan received a one-year deferred sentence, subject to the conditions-as relevant here-that he would obtain a psychiatric evaluation, refrain from committing any further protective-order violations, and \"not possess, consume or purchase alcoholic beverages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On the same day, Dunivan self-reported his misdemeanor\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea and deferred sentence to the OBA. In compliance with RGDP Rule 7.2, the OBA duly forwarded to this Court copies of the information, plea, and sentence. On December 18, 2017, we entered an order of immediate interim suspension-in accordance with RGDP Rule 7.3-in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Association v. Dunivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20OK%20101\">\n    2017 OK 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (for publication in OBJ only).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 To put the matter bluntly, the OBA suspected the behavior leading to Dunivan's protective-order violation might be attributed to problems with alcohol, anger, or impulse\n   control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the OBA's request, Dunivan promptly submitted to evaluations by a psychologist (Dr. Terese Hall) and a substance-abuse specialist (Dr. Julio Rojas). In her psychological report of January 12, 2018, Dr. Hall concluded that Dunivan's \"test results as a whole do not raise concern about alcohol abuse,\" but went on to suggest that he \"honestly monitor his alcohol intake to ensure that drinking does not become problematic.\" In addressing the protective-order violation, Dr. Hall observed in a January 29, 2018 supplemental report that \"[t]he text messages that Mr. Dunivan sent were in the context of [a] protracted and deeply frustrating custody battle. This does not excuse their inappropriate nature, but it helps to explain them.\" Additionally, Dr. Hall stated that she was \"not aware of any impulsive or aggressive behavior on his part in other contexts, so I do not believe there is a pattern of behavior that would indicate deeper problems.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 For his part, Dr. Rojas largely concurred in Dr. Hall's assessment. Although Dr. Rojas believed that Dunivan suffered from a moderate alcohol-use disorder in the past, he agreed that he is currently fit to practice law. Dr. Rojas was troubled, though, by Dunivan's admission that he had consumed alcohol about ten days prior to his evaluation-a clear violation of the terms of Dunivan's deferred sentence, which unequivocally prohibited him from possessing or consuming alcoholic beverages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, Dr. Rojas supplemented his evaluation with a list of further recommendations for Dunivan that included at least one year of alcohol-related counseling and therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 On June 5, 2018, the PRT conducted a hearing on the issues of mitigation and appropriate discipline. Three witnesses testified on Dunivan's behalf: two lawyers (including an assistant district attorney) who are familiar with his character and reputation within his community; and his church pastor. Dunivan's witnesses testified that he had gone through a remarkably wrenching divorce, during which time he was routinely denied visitation with his son by Swann. The witnesses further testified they do not believe he has a problem with alcohol. In sum, Dunivan's witnesses persuasively characterized him as a decent and capable man whose legal abilities are valued-and needed-in his rural community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Dunivan testified next in his own behalf. As described by the PRT, he \"presented compelling testimony that he is remorseful, shameful [sic], embarrassed and sorry that he has brought disrepute on the legal profession and apologizes for his past conduct.\" He explained to the PRT that his suspension from the practice of law has been \"life-altering\" because, as he put it, \"the biggest part of my life is gone.\" He stated that he is now \"a much more humble person.\" Dunivan also testified that, as of this year, he has finally obtained sole primary custody of S.D., and that this fact \"would probably be the highest motivation that could be presented\" to him to become \"a better man in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Although finding \"commendable\" the mitigating evidence offered by Dunivan-and acknowledging that his conduct toward his ex-wife did not involve physical violence or abuse, nor that his \"misconduct had any effect on any client\"-the PRT found that Dunivan's disregard of the protective order constituted professional misconduct. Accordingly, the PRT recommended in its report of August 6, 2018 that Dunivan be suspended from the date on which this Court entered its order of immediate interim suspension-December 18, 2017-through the remaining period of his one-year deferred sentence in Blaine County-that is, until December 4, 2018. Following that, the PRT recommended an additional year of suspension for Dunivan, to be deferred subject to: (a) his compliance with the conditions of the deferred sentence in the Blaine County case, including\n   the total prohibition on alcohol use; (b) signing and maintaining a contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers, coupled with regularly scheduled contact with a mentor; (c) waiver of confidentiality, such that Lawyers Helping Lawyers could notify the OBA of any default by Dunivan; and (d) continued compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 In its brief filed with this Court, the OBA recommends we adopt the full disciplinary recommendation of the PRT or else, \"at a minimum,\" suspend Dunivan from the practice of law for the duration of his Blaine County deferred sentence. Dunivan, in turn, submits that a public reprimand from this Court is sufficient to satisfy the goals of discipline and deterrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 This Court is vested with exclusive, original, and nondelegable jurisdiction over attorney-discipline cases.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Offenses involving violence, dishonesty, breach of trust, or serious interference with the administration of justice are in that category.\n   <em>\n    A pattern of repeated offenses, even ones of minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to legal obligation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Our task in this case is to evaluate Dunivan's\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to the protective-order violation to determine whether that crime demonstrates unfitness to practice law and, if so, to impose appropriate discipline. Dunivan has not disputed that his deferred sentence indicates such unfitness-and he is correct. The PRT found that Dunivan's \"criminal behavior\" violated ORPC Rule 8.4 in general. We think that Dunivan's actions most directly implicate ORPC Rule 8.4(b), which defines as professional misconduct the commission of \"a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or\n   <em>\n    fitness as a lawyer in other respects\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Violation of a victim protective order-a criminal act-indicates \"a willful indifference for judicial orders and a disregard for the rule of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905491\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/339/895/\">\n    2014 OK 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905491\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/339/895/\">\n    339 P.3d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But an attorney must adhere to a higher standard of conduct, notwithstanding the issues he is facing in his private life. \"Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.

On more than one occasion in 2016, Dunivan violated a protective order issued by an Oklahoma court of record. Then, while under a deferred sentence in 2018 for his protective-order violation, Dunivan twice broke that same court's plain conditions of deferment by drinking alcohol in his home. And, while under this Court's order of interim suspension, Dunivan nevertheless used his OBA membership number when signing a pro se filing in his ongoing divorce case with his current wife. Even when allowing for some degree of carelessness in the latter instance, all of this adds up to \"a lawyer [who] appears to the public to be placing himself above the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10360061\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/770/#p774\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted).

The record before us-which includes detailed evaluations by a psychologist and a substance-abuse specialist-does not clearly and convincingly establish that Dunivan currently abuses alcohol. This record also does not permit us to declare with certainty that Dunivan's past alcohol use bore a definite and direct causal relationship to his professional misconduct. \"While the steps recommended by the trial panel are laudable, we are not making them a condition of reinstatement.\"\n   <em>\n    Albert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8355597\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/163/527/\">\n    2007 OK 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18, 163 P.3d at 534.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26 We conclude that the appropriate discipline for Dunivan is suspension for a period of one year, to be imposed retroactively to December 18, 2017, the date on which his interim suspension began.
