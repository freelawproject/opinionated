In particular, the district court correctly determined that Ditech Financial's predecessor cured the default as to the superpriority portion of the HOA's lien by tendering $1,774.12 to Nevada Association Services (NAS), an amount which undisputedly exceeded nine months of assessments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A. v.

The tender of the defaulted superpriority portion of the HOA's lien cured the default as to that portion of the lien such that the ensuing foreclosure sale did not extinguish the first deed of trust.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/#p117\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/#p117\">\n    at 118-121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although SFR contends that NAS's belief that collection costs were part of the superpriority lien constituted a good-faith basis for rejecting the tender, the tender in this case included an estimate of reasonable collection costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, although SFR contends that (1) the tender was ineffective because it imposed conditions, (2) Ditechs predecessor needed to record evidence of the tender, (3) Ditech's predecessor needed to keep the tender good, and (4) SFR is protected as a bona fide purchaser, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Bank of America\n   </em>\n   rejected similar arguments. 3 134 Nev., Adv.

In other words, the necessary implication behind the district court's ruling was that the untimely disclosure was harmless. NRCP 37(c)(1). Similarly, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the district court's factual finding that the tender was received.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The district court made a factual finding that it was NAS's policy to reject any payment attempt that was for less than the full unpaid balance. In light of this finding, which is not challenged on appeal, we are not persuaded by SFR's suggestion that the tender's inclusion of estimated collection costs made it less likely the tender was actually delivered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    In light of this conclusion, we need not determine whether the deed of trust survived the foreclosure sale based on the Federal Foreclosure Bar.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
