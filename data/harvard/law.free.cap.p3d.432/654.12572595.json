The respondent failed to file an answer. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on March 22, 2018, at which the respondent did not appear. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

On June 19, 2013, W.D. was involved in a two-car automobile accident in Baldwin City, Kansas. The driver of the other car failed to stop at a stop sign and collided with W.D.'s car. Both drivers were insured. W.D. suffered injuries to his hip, back, and shoulder. In the fall of 2013, W.D. underwent laminectomy surgery (a surgical operation to remove the back of vertebrae to relieve pressure on nerves). An MRI had shown that five of W.D.'s vertebrae were pinching against his spinal cord.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"10. W.D. was advised by his insurance company to seek legal counsel. W.D. and his wife, K.D., met with and hired the respondent in June or July of 2013, shortly after the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"11. The respondent proposed a contingent fee arrangement in which the respondent would receive 30% of any recovery. W.D. and K.D. agreed to the fee proposed by the respondent. The respondent failed to reduce the agreement to writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"12. W.D. and K.D. again met with respondent at the respondent's office in Lawrence. At that time, W.D. provided the respondent with his medical records. The respondent advised W.D. and K.D. that he was submitting information to an insurance company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"13. Throughout the representation, W.D. and K.D. had a difficult time communicating with respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"14. In the spring of 2014, W.D. spoke with the respondent by telephone. The respondent explained that he had not maintained communication because the respondent's wife had been ill. The respondent, however, assured W.D. that everything was fine with the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"15. Thereafter, W.D. and K.D. were unable to reach the respondent. They were aware that a deadline existed in the case and they increased their attempts to contact the respondent. W.D. and K.D. believed that the respondent had filed a civil case on behalf of W.D. by this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"16. The respondent failed to inform W.D. that he moved his office to another location. On his own, W.D. learned that the respondent had moved his office to 810 Pennsylvania, Lawrence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"W.D. or K.D. called the respondent weekly, but were not able to make contact with him. At some point, the respondent's voicemail box was full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"During the fall of 2015, they left notes on the door of the respondent's office because when they would attempt to locate him in his office, he was never present. They contacted the manager of the building where the respondent's office was located, but they were not able to obtain information on how to get in touch with the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"17. In February 2016, W.D. and K.D. sent a letter to the respondent\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   certified mail, return receipt requested. The letter eventually came back as unclaimed because it was not picked up by the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"18. On March 11, 2016, W.D. filed a complaint with the disciplinary\n   administrator's office. Leslie Miller of the Douglas County Ethics and Grievance Committee was assigned to investigate the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"19. On March 14, 2016, the disciplinary administrator notified the respondent by letter that W.D.'s complaint had been docketed for investigation. The disciplinary administrator directed the respondent to provide a written response to the complaint within 20 days. The respondent did not provide a written response to the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"20. Ms. Miller sent letters to the respondent on March 21, 2016, May 11, 2016, and June 6, 2016, directing the respondent to provide a written response to W.D.'s complaint. The respondent did not provide\n   a written response to the complaint filed by W.D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"21. In June 2016, Special Investigator William Delaney contacted the respondent at his home. The respondent claimed that he had not received the complaint, but that he would respond. While the respondent provided Mr. Delaney with W.D.'s client file, respondent never provided a response to the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"22. During the investigation, Ms. Miller checked the Douglas County court records and determined that two civil cases had been filed by the respondent on behalf of W.D., cases numbered 2015-V-000457 and 2015-V-000458. Both cases were filed on December 21, 2015. The petitions in the two cases were identical and filing fees had been paid by the respondent in both cases. Both cases were filed outside of the two-year statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"23. In 2015-V-000457, after counsel for the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case based on the statute of limitations, on May 11, 2016, the court dismissed the case with prejudice. In 2015-V-000458, the court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution on December 22, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"24. Robert Luder represented the defendant in the personal injury cases. Mr. Luder advised Ms. Miller that the respondent told him that he had filed the case within the statute of limitations but that there was a glitch in the clerk's office with respect to the filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"25. On May 24, 2016, Ms. Miller met with W.D. and K.D. During that meeting, W.D. and K.D. asked Ms. Miller about the status of the case. Ms. Miller told W.D. and K.D. that the case had been filed approximately six months too late and that it had been dismissed on May 11, 2016. According to Ms. Miller, W.D. and K.D. were shocked and upset that the case had been dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"26. During the time that the respondent represented W.D., the respondent did not have malpractice insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"On December 23, 2016, the Supreme Court issued an opinion suspending the respondent's license to practice law for a period of one year.\n   <em>\n    In re Knox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Kan.%20628\">\n    305 Kan. 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20P.3d%20500\">\n    385 P.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

That same day, the formal complaint and the notice of hearing were sent to the respondent at his last registration address by certified mail. Additionally, a copy of the formal complaint and notice of hearing were sent to the respondent at his last registration address and his home address by regular mail. The respondent failed\n   to file an answer to the formal complaint. Later, on November 30, 2017, William C. Delaney, Special Investigator with the disciplinary administrator's office served a copy of the formal complaint and notice of hearing on the respondent's wife at the respondent's home address, notifying the respondent that a hearing on the formal complaint was scheduled for January 11, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"28.

Due process requires only that the charges must be sufficiently clear and specific to inform the attorney of the misconduct charged, but the state is not required to plead specific rules, since it is the factual allegations against which the attorney must defend. ...

The hearing panel concludes that the disciplinary administrator included sufficient facts in the formal complaint to warrant consideration of a violation of Rule 207 (cooperation). Further, the respondent was not put on notice that the hearing panel would be considering a violation of Rule 211(b) (failure to file an answer to the formal complaint).

Despite being retained in 2013, shortly after the automobile accident, the respondent failed to timely file suit on behalf of W.D. Based on the respondent's lack of competent representation, W.D.'s suit was dismissed because it was filed outside the statute of limitations.

In making this recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel considered the factors outlined by the American Bar Association in its Standards for Imposing\n   Lawyer Sanctions (hereinafter 'Standards'). Pursuant to Standard 3, the factors to be considered are the duty violated, the lawyer's mental state, the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct, and the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"44.\n   <em>\n    Duty Violated\n   </em>\n   . The respondent violated his duty to his client to provide competent and diligent representation and reasonable communication. The respondent violated his duty to the public to maintain his personal integrity. Additionally, the respondent violated his duty to the legal system to refrain from causing prejudice to the administration of justice. Finally, the respondent violated his duty to the legal profession to cooperate in disciplinary proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"45.\n   <em>\n    Mental State\n   </em>\n   . The respondent knowingly and intentionally violated his duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"46.\n   <em>\n    Injury\n   </em>\n   . As a result of the respondent's misconduct, the respondent caused actual serious injury to his client, to the legal system, and the legal profession. While the total injury to his client is unclear, it is clear that W.D. is\n   responsible for $2,000 of medical bills which should have been paid through the lawsuit. Because W.D. is an older gentleman on a fixed income, he has been paying toward the outstanding bills at a rate of $20 per month. W.D. will continue to pay $20 per month until the financial obligations have been satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"47.\n   <em>\n    Aggravating and Mitigating Factors\n   </em>\n   . Aggravating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify an increase in the degree of discipline to be imposed. In reaching its recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel, in this case, found the following aggravating factors present:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Prior Disciplinary Offenses\n   </em>\n   . The respondent has been previously disciplined on four occasions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   1) On November 29, 2001, the respondent entered into the attorney diversion program for an advertising rule violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   2) On July 18, 2006, the disciplinary administrator informally admonished the respondent for having violated Rule 1.3 (diligence), Rule 1.4 (communication), and Rule 3.2 (expediting litigation).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   3) On December 19, 2008, the disciplinary administrator informally admonished the respondent for having violated Rule 1.4 (communication).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   4) On December 23, 2016, the Supreme Court suspended the respondent's license to practice law for a period of one year for violating Rules 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5 (fees), 1.15 (safeguarding property), 1.16 (termination of representation), 8.1 (cooperation), 8.4 (professional misconduct), 207 (cooperation), and 211 (failure to file an answer to the formal complaint).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Dishonest or Selfish Motive\n   </em>\n   . The respondent's misconduct was motivated by dishonesty. The respondent failed to inform W.D. that he had not filed the case timely. The respondent falsely told W.D. and K.D. that the case was progressing. The respondent falsely told opposing counsel that the suit had been timely filed and that there was a 'glitch' in the clerk's office. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent's misconduct was motivated by dishonesty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    A Pattern of Misconduct\n   </em>\n   . Over an extended period of time, the respondent failed to properly communicate with W.D. and K.D. Additionally, much of the misconduct in this case is similar to the misconduct in the three of the four previous disciplinary cases. Thus, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent has engaged in a pattern of misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Multiple Offenses\n   </em>\n   . The respondent violated Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 1.5 (fees), 3.2 (expediting litigation), 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others), 8.4 (professional misconduct), and 207 (cooperation). Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent committed multiple offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Bad Faith Obstruction of the Disciplinary Proceeding by Intentionally Failing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to Comply with Rules or Orders of the Disciplinary Process\n   </em>\n   . The respondent failed to provide a written response to the complaint in this case\n   despite the repeated directions to do so. Additionally, the respondent failed to file an answer and failed to appear at the hearing on this matter. The respondent's failure to cooperate in this disciplinary proceeding is further aggravated by the respondent's familiarity with the disciplinary process. In the 2016 attorney disciplinary case, the respondent appeared at the hearing and appeared before the Kansas Supreme Court. In that case, the respondent failed to file an answer and was found in violation of Rule 211(b). Moreover, in that case, the Kansas Supreme Court ordered the respondent to reimburse the Client Protection Fund $3,000. To date, the respondent has not done so. The respondent's failure to participate, cooperate, appear, and comply with court orders and rules amounts to bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Vulnerability of Victim\n   </em>\n   . When W.D., an older gentleman on a fixed income, testified before the hearing panel, his trusting nature was clear. As a result of the underlying accident, W.D. was seriously injured. W.D. trusted the respondent to take appropriate action to ensure that his medical bills were covered by the other driver who was clearly at fault. The respondent violated that trust by failing to take action on behalf of W.D. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that because W.D. wholly relied on the respondent to take appropriate action on his behalf, W.D. was vulnerable to the respondent's misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   g.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Experience in the Practice of Law\n   </em>\n   . The Kansas Supreme Court admitted the respondent to practice law in the State of Kansas in 1994. At the time of the misconduct, the respondent had been practicing law for more than 20 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   h.\n   <em>\n    Indifference to Making Restitution\n   </em>\n   . The respondent did not have malpractice insurance at the time of his misconduct. Further, the respondent took no steps to right the wrongs he committed against W.D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \"48. Mitigating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify a reduction in the degree of discipline to be imposed. Because the respondent chose to not cooperate in the disciplinary investigation and chose to not appear at the hearing on the formal complaint and present evidence on his own behalf, the hearing panel has no evidence to consider in mitigation of the misconduct. Accordingly, the hearing panel, in this case, finds no mitigating circumstances present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"49. In addition to the above-cited factors, the hearing panel has thoroughly examined and considered Standard 4.41(b) which provides that '[d]isbarment is generally appropriate when ... a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Recommendation\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \"50. Based on the significant injury to W.D. and the respondent's previous history of attorney misconduct, the disciplinary administrator recommended that the respondent be disbarred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"51. The respondent engaged in serious misconduct. Additionally, the\n   significant evidence in aggravation, including the evidence that the respondent failed to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation and participate in the disciplinary hearing, compounds the respondent['s] serious misconduct. It is clear that the respondent should no longer have a license to practice law. Accordingly, based upon the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the Standard listed above, the hearing panel unanimously recommends that the respondent be disbarred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"52. Costs are assessed against the respondent in an amount to be certified by the Office of the Disciplinary Administrator.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In a disciplinary proceeding, this court considers the evidence, the findings of the disciplinary panel, and the arguments of\n   the parties and determines whether violations of KRPC exist and, if they do, what discipline should be imposed.

Service on respondent was achieved through certified mail to respondent's last address on file with the Clerk of the Appellate Courts, through regular mail to respondent's home address, and through personal service by Special Investigator William C. Delaney who served a copy of the formal complaint and notice of hearing on respondent's wife at the respondent's home address on November 30, 2017. Because of inclement weather, offices in the Judicial Branch were closed on the original date of the hearing, January 11, 2018. The hearing was rescheduled for March 22, 2018, and notice was sent to respondent both by certified mail to his last address on file with the Clerk of the Appellate Courts and by regular mail to his home address. Respondent also failed to appear before the Supreme Court on October 24, 2018, after being given proper notice. The respondent did not file exceptions\n   to the panel's final hearing report. As such, the findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Furthermore, the evidence before the panel establishes by clear and convincing evidence the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 3.2 (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

At the panel hearing, the Disciplinary Administrator recommended disbarment. In its final hearing report, the panel agreed with the Disciplinary Administrator and recommended disbarment. At the hearing before this court, the Disciplinary Administrator continues to recommend disbarment. Respondent did not appear.
