Smith of aggravated kidnapping, rape, aggravated battery, three counts of criminal threat, criminal damage to property, and violation of a protection order. The district court sentenced Smith to a total of 911 months of incarceration and ordered each sentence to run consecutively. Smith appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Smith met D.S. on the dating website Plenty of Fish in the spring of 2015. For their first date, D.S. picked Smith up at his grandmother's house. He took a large bag with him. They went to her apartment to hang out with her adult son and some friends. After the rest of the company had left, Smith asked to shower there. Smith spent that night at D.S.'s apartment and when she asked him to leave, he asked to stay a couple days because he had just returned to Wichita and was trying to figure out living arrangements. At first, they were good friends, but eventually they became involved in a romantic relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As time went on, D.S. asked Smith a few times about his living arrangements and he always replied that he was working on it. Things began going downhill the longer Smith stayed. He took control of her car, money, and phone. He also became verbally abusive, calling her names and threatening to burn her alive and pimp her out on Back Page. D.S. testified, \"Oh, everything was Back Page, everything was burn me alive, everything was I'm gonna check your temperature when you get home,\" which meant he was going to beat her. Smith was \"always drunk\" and grabbed D.S. several times. One time, she refused to go to the liquor store for him and he grabbed her and flung her on the bed. He told her, \"You're lucky I'm not gonna go full fledge.\" It was easier for D.S. to surrender and do as he asked than to continue the fight. D.S. also reported incidents of nonconsensual sex, times in which Smith proceeded to have intercourse with her without her consent. This included one time when she verbalized she did not want to have sex and \"he just went ahead and did it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In reference to the escalation of behaviors, D.S. testified, \"I guess I let it happen, I got scared. I lived in fear, every day. I was sick to come home, I didn't want to come home from work, you know.\" She continued asking Smith to leave, but he refused. When her son, T.G., was about to be discharged from the military, she asked him to return to Wichita to help her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   T.G. moved in on October 2, 2015. Initially, Smith treated D.S. well, but as time went on, T.G. saw more of his bad behaviors surface. He testified: \"Her mobile devices were all basically on lock, she wasn't allowed to leave the house really as much, always questioning when she did anything, where she was going, what she was doing, the time, just every little thing was monitored, micromanaged.\" Smith threatened to burn T.G. and D.S. with gasoline while they were sleeping. T.G. did not intervene when Smith was verbally abusive out of fear that the conflict would become physical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   D.S.'s employer participated in domestic violence awareness in the month of October. While D.S. was in a training class at work, Smith sent her threatening texts that she shared with her class. A supervisor later pulled her out of class to talk about getting help. D.S. hesitated because she did not want the situation to get worse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Smith and D.S. were arguing about her not going to buy him more alcohol. Smith punched D.S. then pinned her against the wall by her throat. T.G. ran in and told Smith \"if he ever touched my mother again, I'll kill you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two days later, the human resources director from D.S.'s job took her to the district court to obtain a protection from abuse (PFA) order. She testified that she did not include everything that had happened in her application for the PFA order, because,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"at the time I was scatter-brained, I was just in a rush and I put the basic in there to be able to get this approved, as I was on work time and ... I needed the money so I had to hurry up and get right back to work.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   D.S. stated she did not want any issues; she just wanted him to take his things and leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After work, T.G. took D.S. to the Wichita Police Department. She gave the officers her house key and the paperwork to serve Smith. Officer Katherine Goebel went with another officer to D.S.'s apartment at approximately 8 p.m. on October 21, 2015. Smith was under the influence of alcohol and argumentative when she served him. He took about 15 to 20 minutes to gather his things. He called S.R. to pick him up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   S.R., had known Smith since she was 14. She took Smith to her house so he could make some calls. Smith acted like he did not know why D.S. had obtained a PFA and he denied all her allegations. He messaged some people on Facebook and when he had not been able to get a hold of anybody, he asked to stay the night. S.R. agreed to let him stay that night only. The next day, she took him to a few places to help him find a place to stay, but she realized he was just trying to buy marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After they returned to S.R.'s house, Smith became upset and blamed S.R. for ruining his life. She offered to talk to D.S. and see if they could work things out. Smith grabbed her by the back of her neck and shoved her, telling her, \"you ain't makin' nothin' better, in fact, you're gonna put your shoes on, you're gonna go beat her ass. I can at least get some enjoyment out of all of this.\" When she refused, he choked her, pinning her against her dresser for 5 or 6 seconds. As he held her by the throat, he told S.R. that he was not going anywhere now that he finally had her. S.R. stated she did not call police because she knew it would only get worse if she did. Plus, Smith had taken her phone and would not give it back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Every day, S.R. drove Smith to D.S.'s apartment complex. He claimed he needed to get money from somebody who owed him. On October 27, 2015, as she drove through the lot, Smith, who had a glass full of liquor, \"flipped out\", and spilled the alcohol on the floorboard and on himself. She tried handing him something to wipe off with, but he had gotten out of the car and was cussing at her. He broke the rain guard off her passenger window and threw it straight through the car, grazing S.R.'s eye. He walked around to the driver's side, reached through the open window, and slammed S.R.'s head against the side of the vehicle. Smith said something like \"you need to park your little ass over there or leave\" and so she left. As she drove off, her vision started getting \"fuzzy\" so she pulled into a parking lot to check her eye and find her phone. When she looked up, Smith was walking toward the vehicle and he looked angry. He grabbed her head again and slammed it against the side of the vehicle. He told her she needed to start listening and know her role. Smith got back into the passenger seat and told her to go home. S.R. told Smith he had to leave. He agreed to get his things and find somewhere else to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the way home, she pulled in behind a police car and tried to stay close. She told Smith that it might have been best to call police and have an officer present at the house to make sure everything went smoothly. Smith did not want police involved and she knew something bad was going to happen. S.R. then drove into the Wendy's parking lot and tried to go inside. He grabbed her by the arm and forced her back into the car. He told her to calm down and just go home. He assured her there would be no problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When they arrived at S.R.'s home, she asked him to stay in the car. As she unlocked the door, Smith flung the door open, shoved her into the house, took her keys, and slammed the door behind them. S.R. threatened to call 911, but Smith would not allow it. He smacked the phone out of her hand and every time she tried to leave, he grabbed her by the hair to keep her in the house. Then Smith began beating her. He knocked her to the floor and punched her repeatedly on the side of her head. S.R. testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"He's standing over me, just whaling on me. My face was like the main part, my head and my face and my throat were the main parts that he was going after, it was just blow after blow after blow to my head, my face, punching me over and over again, choking me until that went on for I couldn't tell you how long. I begged for him to stop and - he wasn't having it. And I was like, something is seriously wrong, please stop, like, I need medical attention now, like something is really, really wrong. And he was like - just wouldn't stop, he just kept just blow after blow ...\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At one point, Smith grabbed S.R. by the throat with one hand as he punched her with the other. He choked her to the point she could not breathe and she lost consciousness. When she woke up, she was on the floor and confused. Her head was throbbing, her eyes were swelling, and her nose hurt. When she went to the bathroom to see the damage, Smith followed behind her. She asked him why he was doing that to her and he told her \"you just don't know when to stop, you need to shut your fuckin' mouth ... you'll learn your role.\" She sat on the couch and asked him for medical treatment. He told her that neither of them were leaving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   S.R. asked Smith to take her to her mother's house. He grabbed her from behind, threw her on the couch, and began beating her again. He choked her again to the point she lost consciousness. When she awoke, Smith continued beating her until she lost consciousness again. S.R. stated that although the violence lasted only minutes, it felt like hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When Smith stopped, S.R. begged him for hours to let her get medical treatment or at least go to her mother's house. Smith refused because he knew the police would get involved. At one point, he professed his love for her, admitting that he had been in love with her for years. He told her, \"now that he had [S.R.], he wasn't letting [her] go.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Smith wanted her to go to her bedroom, but she was afraid of what might happen if she did. She finally went, hoping that Smith would fall asleep and she could escape. She put her body pillow between them and turned her back to him. As she laid on the bed, she cried, thinking she was dying. He continued telling her how much he loved her and said, \"oh, my God, I wanna make love to you so bad right now.\" While he removed her clothing, she cried and repeatedly begged him, \"don't do this.\" He shushed her and told her it would be okay and that he loved her. She never consented to having sex with Smith. After all that had occurred that evening, she did not have the strength to fight him off. Smith penetrated her vagina with his penis. After he ejaculated, he got up and got a washcloth to clean her up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next morning, Smith still refused to allow her to seek medical treatment, repeating that neither of them were going anywhere. He insisted that he loved her and he would never let her go. He was going to nurse her back to health so he could feel better about what he had done. Smith told S.R. that he was going to kill D.S. and he needed a small blunt object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   S.R. was finally able to run out of the house. She ran to the next block, but her eyes were so swollen she could not see. Smith drove up in her car and agreed to take her to her mother's house. He dropped her off and told her she better be ready in 45 minutes. Her mother called the police and took her to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After Smith dropped off S.R., he sideswiped Pheasant Weber's vehicle as she was waiting to turn, damaging her back bumper and wheel. Repairs cost $3,500. Smith continued driving after he struck Weber's vehicle and she followed while she called 911. Smith got out of S.R.'s vehicle and attempted to open Weber's driver's side door and when he could not, he hit her window and windshield. By the time police arrived, Smith was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That evening, T.G. was home with D.S. and a friend. He heard loud music coming from a vehicle in front of the apartment. T.G. saw Smith in the car. Smith pointed his fingers like a gun toward T.G. and the apartment. T.G. yelled to D.S. to call 911 because he perceived the gun-like gesture as a threat. Smith drove away but returned and drove into the parking lot-getting closer to the apartment and looking up at their balcony. Three police vehicles entered the lot. Smith drove around the parking lot and crashed S.R.'s vehicle before running on foot. Police tased Smith and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 2, 2015, the State charged Smith with aggravated kidnapping, rape, two counts of aggravated battery, violation of a protective order, two counts of criminal threat, and criminal damage to property in case number 15CR3128 for the incidents that occurred after Smith was removed from D.S.'s house on October 21, 2015. Police did not learn of Smith's criminal behaviors toward D.S. until she spoke with a detective at the preliminary hearing. Because the information became available at the preliminary hearing, rather than amending the charges, the State filed a second case against Smith for the incidents that occurred while he was living with D.S. On December 28, 2015, the State filed case number 15CR3717, alleging Smith committed aggravated battery, two counts of criminal threat, and cruelty to animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 14, 2016, the State moved to consolidate the two cases or, in the alternative, to admit evidence of prior crimes or bad acts under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-455. The State contended that all of the offenses were of the same general character as Smith \"controlled [his victims], beat them, choked them, forcefully had sex with them, threatened to kill them, refused to let them leave their homes, and when they asked him to leave he became violent with them.\" The State also asserted that the crimes were based on two or more transactions constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, as permitted for joinder under K.S.A. 22-3202(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Smith argued against consolidation because the acts were separate acts with different victims at separate times. He contended the State was attempting to use the behaviors in one case as evidence of Smith's propensity to commit the offenses in the other case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court granted the State's motion for consolidation, finding that the offenses were very similar in nature. The court noted that under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-455(c) and (d), the Kansas Legislature opened the door to evidence of prior sex offenses when a defendant is charged with a sex offense. Such evidence can be considered for its bearing on any other matter to which it is relevant or probative. The court noted that with domestic violence and rape allegations, the evidence deals with the relationship as well. Not only can the victims testify to prior occurrences to show the relationship of the parties, but anyone else can testify to acts perpetrated against them under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-455(d). The court reasoned that if the permissible 60-455 evidence were presented in one case, and evidence of the other case was presented to the jurors, who then used that information in deciding the verdict, the State might be presented with a double jeopardy issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court conducted a five-day jury trial with the above facts. After the lunch break on the second day of trial, Juror 12 reported she had been in the elevator with some of the State's witnesses. Juror 12 said she heard somebody say, \"shh, shh, shh, don't say anything, be quiet.\" She reported the incident because it made her a little nervous and she wanted to make sure she had not done anything wrong. Neither the State nor Smith expressed any concern for Juror 12 remaining on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the morning on the third day of trial, the district court called Juror 12 in because after jurors had been released the previous day, she told the court's aide that she had some anxiety or fear that the victims or the victims' families were going to follow her home or there would be some problems. The State requested removal based on that statement alone. Juror 12 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Well, we all park in the same parking garage, I guess I was just feeling uncomfortable yesterday with that so. I'm okay now .... It's nothing ... there was nothing said ... I guess it was just as I get older things bother me more, that didn't bother me before. So I'm okay.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court expressed an overriding concern that, as a deciding juror, Juror 12 might not decide only on the evidence, uninfluenced by any personal experiences, biases, personal views or any other factor. The State questioned Juror 12:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[State]: Do you still feel that if I prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt, not what your verdict would be or where you're leaning, that you could enter an appropriate verdict of guilt if the case is proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[Juror 12]: If all the evidence and everything from everything, could I make an accurate decision, is that what you're -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[State]: If it's proven.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[Juror 12]: Is that what the question is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"[State]: The question, just like we asked before, before in jury selection, if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt can you follow the law and vote guilty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[Juror 12]: Yes, I can do what I need to do with everything presented, I can do what I need to do once everything is laid on the table and all of us discussing the decision, yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Smith asked if the victims took any actions, made any looks or did anything that made Juror 12 concerned. She stated the victim looked straight at her when the victim took the stand but testified that none of these things would affect her ability to be fair to the State and Smith. Before taking the issue under advisement, the district court noted that even though Juror 12 ultimately answered the questions correctly, it remained concerned that she hesitated before answering whether she could enter a guilty verdict if the State proved Smith's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further expressed concern that her answer was indirect and her concerns were irrational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The following morning, the State proffered the information provided by the victim witness coordinator who was escorting the witnesses in the elevator when Juror 12 rode in the elevator with them. The coordinator stated that before entering the elevator, she told the witnesses to be quiet but nobody said, \"oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit\" as reported by Juror 12. The coordinator contended that nobody spoke a word in the elevator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The district court expressed significant concerns about Juror 12's ability to be a fair judge in the case. It noted her perception of what happened in the elevator did not match that of the coordinator. The court found it concerning that she was susceptible to misperceiving things as threatening or intimidating when that was not the reality. The court expressed further concern that Juror 12 had no basis for her fear of the victim, as she never indicated she felt like the victims were following her around or that they made comments to her. The court pointed out that witnesses are supposed to look at the jurors and tell them their story. The court noted that when the State specifically asked about Juror 12's ability to render a guilty verdict, she hesitated both times \"for an extended period of time and some awkward silence. And then her response was evasive, something to the effect that she'll look at the evidence and you know, based on that render a verdict.\" As a result, the court removed Juror 12 and sat an alternate juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The jury found Smith guilty of criminal threat to D.S. and T.G., criminal threat to D.S., aggravated kidnapping, rape, aggravated battery against S.R., violation of a protection order, criminal threat to T.G., and criminal damage to property. The district court sentenced Smith to the high box number for each crime of conviction, with each sentence to run consecutively. Smith's total sentence for both cases was 899 months in the custody of the Kansas Department of Corrections and 12 months in county jail with lifetime postrelease supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Smith appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Jury Nullification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Smith contends the district court undermined the jury's inherent right of jury nullification by instructing the jurors to consider lesser included offenses sequentially rather than simultaneously with the greater offenses and by instructing the jurors that they \"must\" follow the law and that it was their \"duty\" to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   During the jury instruction conference, Smith stated that the instructions were the result of consultation and informal meetings between counsel and the district court. The instructions complied with requests he made and he had no objection to the jury instructions as prepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   When analyzing jury instruction issues, an appellate court follows a three-step process. First, we must determine whether we can or should review the issue,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether there is a lack of appellate jurisdiction or a failure to preserve the issue for appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. McLinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Kan.%20307\">\n    307 Kan. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20P.3d%201\">\n    409 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). If a party fails to object to an instruction, we evaluate whether the instruction was a clear error.\n   <em>\n    State v. Betancourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417235\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/131/#p135\">\n    299 Kan. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417235\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/299/131/#p135\">\n    322 P.3d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Because Smith failed to preserve the issue, the court can review the issue, but the analysis of the next two steps is altered to reflect the failure to preserve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, we consider whether the instructions were legally and factually appropriate, using an unlimited review of the entire record.\n   <em>\n    McLinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Kan.%20307\">\n    307 Kan. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the instructions were legally and factually appropriate, no error exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, we must assess whether the error requires reversal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Kan.%20307\">\n    307 Kan. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Smith's failure to preserve the jury instruction issue affects our reversibility inquiry in the third step. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3414(3). We apply a clear error standard and will only reverse the district court if an error occurred and we are firmly convinced that the jury would have reached a different verdict if the instruction error had not occurred. The party claiming error has the burden to demonstrate the necessary prejudice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Kan.%20307\">\n    307 Kan. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Smith argues the district court impermissibly prohibited the jury from exercising jury nullification, essentially challenging the legal appropriateness of the instructions. Jury nullification occurs when the jury deliberately rejects the evidence or refuses to apply the law to either send a message about a social issue or because the legal results are contrary to the jurors' sense of justice, morality, or fairness.\n   <em>\n    Silvers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679297\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/38/886/#p888\">\n    38 Kan.

App. 2d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, Smith challenges the sequential consideration of the lesser included offenses, contending that the offenses should be considered simultaneously. The district court prefaced each lesser included offense instruction with \"If you do not agree that the defendant is guilty of [the greater offense] you should then consider the lesser included offense of [lesser offense].\" Then, he challenges the instructions as containing mandatory language, disallowing the jurors to disregard the rules of law and exercise the right of nullification. The district court instructed the jury: \"[I]t is your duty to consider and follow all of the instructions\" and \"[y]our verdict must be founded entirely upon the evidence admitted and the law as given in these instructions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Sequential consideration of lesser included offenses is legally appropriate. Under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3414(3), in cases in which some evidence would reasonably justify a conviction of a lesser included crime, the district court shall instruct the jury as to the crime charged and any lesser included crimes.

The statement, when removed from its context, appears to be a broad rule covering all jury instructions. But the issue in\n   <em>\n    Smith-Parker\n   </em>\n   was not a matter of using \"must\" or \"will\" anywhere in the jury instructions, it was with regard to the burden of proof instruction where use of such language prevented the jury from making any other determination.

The court held that instructing jurors to enter a guilty verdict was akin to directing a verdict for the State. However, PIK Crim. 4th 51.010 (2017 Supp.), which the district court here read to the jurors, reads, \"If you have no reasonable doubt as to the truth of each of the claims required to be proved by the State, you should find the defendant guilty.\" Kansas courts have consistently found the use of \"should\" \" 'does not upset the balance between encouraging jury nullification and forbidding it ....

But, despite what she said, the court had \"significant concerns\" about Juror 12's ability to be a fair judge in the case. The court was concerned about her perception of what happened in the elevator. She told the court's aide that somebody in the elevator said, \"oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.\" However, the victim advocate recounted that before she and the witnesses entered the elevator, she told the witnesses to be quiet and nobody spoke a word in the elevator. The court noted that this \"raises concerns about [Juror 12's] perception or just that she appears to be very susceptible to misperceiving things as intimidating or threatening or uncomfortable, when that's not the reality.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The district court further addressed its concern that Juror 12 might tend to develop unreasonable fears. Specifically, she was afraid that the victims or their families would follow her home. The court noted that there was no basis for this fear, considering the victims had never followed her around or made comments to her. Her only reason had been that everybody parked in the same parking garage and she lived in the same part of Sedgwick County as the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Additionally, Juror 12 feared one of the victims because she had looked at Juror 12 when the victim took the stand. The court noted that the victim did exactly what she was supposed to because witnesses testify to the jurors. The court was concerned that Juror 12 was susceptible to fears that are not associated with facts and are not reasonable. Though the fears were specific to the victim, the court stated, \"this raises a whole bunch of concerns, one, is she gonna start thinking this about the defendant. Well, he looked at me or I'm afraid he's gonna follow me ... I'm gonna find him guilty ... because I'm fearful of him.\" The court noted that even if she remained fearful of only the victim, her fear could influence her to render a guilty finding, contrary to evidence, to prevent the victims from going after her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The district court noted that both times she was specifically asked whether she could render a guilty verdict if the State met its burden of proof, the juror hesitated \"for an extended period of time and some awkward silence.\" And when she answered, her response was evasive.

Under that statute, multiple complaints against a defendant can be tried together if the State could have brought the charges in a single complaint. K.S.A. 22-3202(1) establishes the three conditions permitting the joining of multiple crimes in a single complaint: (1) the charges must be of the \"same or similar character\"; (2) the charges are part of the \"same act or transaction\"; or (3) the charges result from \"two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\" Whether one of these conditions is satisfied is a fact-specific inquiry, and the appellate court will review the district court's factual findings for substantial competent evidence and the legal conclusions de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Kansas Supreme Court specifically analyzed the \" 'same or similar character' \" condition of joinder, noting that earlier Kansas cases required multiple commonalities, not merely similar classification of charges.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Kan.%20956\">\n    305 Kan. at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Smith-Parker\n   </em>\n   , 301 Kan. at 157.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Here, the two cases both involve criminal threat and aggravated battery. Smith contends the two separate situations are analogous to those in\n   <em>\n    Smith-Parker\n   </em>\n   , in which the district court erred in consolidating Smith-Parker's two murder charges. In one homicide, Smith-Parker targeted the victim in a burglary to steal drugs and the other homicide was the result of an argument between two good friends. Smith argues that like the offense in\n   <em>\n    Smith-Parker\n   </em>\n   , his offenses were only relatable in that they fell into the category of domestic violence. He asserts the level of violence involved in the two cases disallow consolidation. The State alleged that he violently beat and choked S.R. to the point she lost consciousness, raped her, and she sustained injuries to her neck, chin, and eyes; whereas, the State only alleged he slapped D.S. The crimes against S.R. included aggravated kidnapping, a level 1 person felony; rape, a level 1 person felony; and aggravated battery, a level 4 person felony. However, the crimes against D.S. included aggravated battery, a level 7 person felony and two counts of criminal threat, level 9 person felonies. He claims the district court failed to look at the facts of each situation and so erred in consolidating the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   However, Smith's case appears to be more analogous to the offenses in\n   <em>\n    Ritz\n   </em>\n   , in which the State charged Ritz with multiple offenses stemming from two incidents that both included fleeing or attempting to elude an officer, theft, and driving while a habitual violator. In\n   <em>\n    Ritz\n   </em>\n   , the district court found that in both situations, Ritz fled because he panicked when police approached him and his flight took place in residential neighborhoods. Both incidents resulted with Ritz crashing. The district court additionally found the cases required the same mode of trial and would result in the same punishment. The significant difference between the two separate incidents was that in the second, Ritz collided with another vehicle, killing the driver. The State charged Ritz with first-degree felony murder. Despite the disparity between the severity of charges, the court recognized the similarity of facts leading up to the murder that were sufficiently similar to warrant consolidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Here, Smith operated similarly in both situations. He asked to stay with the victims while he figured out his living arrangements, controlled their access to their cell phones quickly, and controlled their use of their cars. In both situations, his victims asked him repeatedly to leave but he refused and threatened them with violence if they called the police. In both situations, Smith began by grabbing and shoving the victims, grabbing them around the throat without squeezing, while pinning them and leaving them unable to move. Smith became verbally abusive very quickly, calling the women names and threatening them with further violence if they did not comply. With both victims, he insisted that because he had them he would not let them go. Smith operated the same in taking control over the women's lives and forcing them to comply out of fear. Also, D.S. obtained the PFA and had Smith removed from her residence two days after he punched her. He went straight to S.R.'s residence and became violent toward her the following day. The incidents of violence were mere days apart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Although there was a significant difference in the level of violence, there was a significant factor that may have played a role-support from others. Even with T.G.'s presence, Smith continued his abusive behaviors. But when he punched D.S., T.G. ran to her rescue and they developed a plan to get Smith out of their lives. D.S. obtained the PFA because her coworkers expressed concern and assisted her in getting to the courthouse to file the application. Even though she did not have access to her phone or car, she had access to others who helped her. However, S.R. did not have anybody in her home to help her. She did not have access to her phone and could not reach out to anybody without Smith monitoring. The difference in the level of violence is not sufficient to disallow consolidation. If anything, it shows a continuation of behaviors in an environment he could control even more. The district court did not err in consolidating the cases as they were of the same or similar character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   A judicial action constitutes an abuse of discretion if (1) no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court; (2) it is based on an error of law; or (3) it is based on an error of fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.
