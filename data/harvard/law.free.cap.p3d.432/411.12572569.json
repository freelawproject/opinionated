Everi argues that the B&amp;O tax at issue is improper because the tax is preempted by federal law through the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), the Indian Trader Statutes, and the\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   balancing test, and that the tax is inconsistent with Department of Revenue Rule\n   192(7). Alternatively, Everi argues that if the B&amp;O tax is not completely preempted, there is a question of material fact as to the amount of B&amp;O tax Everi is obligated to pay because it was acting as the tribes' agent when it received some of its revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that the B&amp;O tax assessed against Everi is neither preempted by federal law nor inconsistent with Department Rule 192(7). Additionally, we hold that, as a matter of law, Everi was not acting as the tribes' agent when it collected revenue. Accordingly, we affirm the order granting summary judgment to the Department of Revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Everi, formerly known as Global Cash Access Inc., is a Delaware for-profit corporation headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is not a federally recognized Indian tribe or member of a tribe. For its operations in the state, Everi employs Washington residents and also employs nonresident employees who visit Washington and use Seattle-Tacoma airport and Washington roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Everi provides cash access services to tribal casinos in the form of self-service kiosks located on the casino floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cash access services include ATM (automatic teller machine) withdrawals, credit card cash advances, debit card points-of-sale, and check cashing. Cash access services allow patrons to obtain cash without leaving the casino floor. A casino patron using cash access services pays a surcharge or transaction fee for the service. Everi acknowledges that its cash access services and the kiosks are not games of chance or class I, II, or III gaming. Everi also\n   acknowledges that for the relevant time periods here, it did not track whether kiosk patrons were Indian or non-Indian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 To use one of Everi's kiosks to access cash, a casino patron swipes or inserts his or her debit or credit card. After validating the card, the machine requests the patron enter an amount of cash to withdraw. Once the amount is entered, Everi's kiosk notifies the patron that a fee will be charged for the transaction and asks the patron if he or she agrees to pay the fee. If the patron does not agree, the transaction is cancelled. No fee is collected if the transaction is cancelled. If, however, the patron agrees to the fee, Everi then sends a request for approval for the cash and fee to be withdrawn. The Everi kiosk sends the request for approval for the cash and fee to be withdrawn to its third-party processor located in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The third-party processor obtains approval from the patron's issuing financial institution through the appropriate network (Visa, MasterCard, etc.). Once an approval message is received, the patron's financial\n   institution sends the amount requested by the patron, plus the fee, to Everi's bank account, and the kiosk dispenses the requested cash to the patron. Everi earns additional revenue from reverse interchange fees paid by the patron's issuing bank to Everi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Everi maintains contracts with a number of Indian tribes in Washington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These contracts govern the types of services Everi provides and the amount of the fees Everi charges the casino patrons for the cash access services. The contracts also determine what portion of the fees are kept by Everi and what portion Everi distributes to the tribes as commissions. Depending on the contract, the commissions\n   taken by the tribes were between 65 and 67 percent of the revenue generated by all cash access transactions. The contracts stated that Everi was not exempt from federal and state taxes based on its \"net income, capital or gross receipts.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 1240. The contracts did not expressly establish an agent/principal relationship between the tribes and Everi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The Department of Revenue audited Everi for the period of January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2012 and assessed $375,222 in B&amp;O tax. Everi filed an appeal to the Department's Appeals Division, disputing the Department's authority to tax the transaction. Everi's appeal was denied. Everi continued to pay B&amp;O tax. From January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015 Everi paid a total of over $1,400,000 in B&amp;O tax to the Department. The Department did not tax the tribes on their gross revenue from commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Everi then filed a Notice of Appeal and Complaint for Refund of Taxes in superior court, seeking a refund of over $1,400,000 for the B&amp;O tax assessed toward its on-reservation cash access transactions. Everi contended that the tax was preempted by federal law and contrary to the Department's Rule 192. Everi filed a motion for summary judgment, and the Department filed a cross motion for summary judgment. In its response brief to the Department's cross motion for summary judgment, Everi alleged that there was an issue of material fact regarding the amount of gross income because it was acting as the tribes' agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 The trial court ruled that the B&amp;O tax was not preempted by federal law because the transactions at issue were between Everi and casino patrons, denied Everi's motion for summary judgment, and granted the Department's cross motion for summary judgment. Everi appeals the trial court's summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.

In doing business within Washington, Everi and its employees use a variety of government services. When providing cash access services, Everi used Washington's telecommunication infrastructure to communicate with Everi's processor in California. Everi employed Washington residents and also employed nonresidents who travelled to Washington, using Seattle-Tacoma Airport resources and Washington roads.

Although IGRA preempts state gaming laws, it does not preempt, through its language or underlying policies, cash access services of non-Indians to non-Indians in tribal casinos.

Here, the B&amp;O tax is not applied to services Everi provides to the tribes.
