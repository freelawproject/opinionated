(Pro-Active) appeals seven citations issued by the Department of Labor and Industries (Department) for violations of the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act of 1973 (WISHA), chapter 49.17 RCW. Pro-Active contends that substantial evidence does not support the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals' (Board's) finding that Pro-Active had knowledge of the safety violations and the findings of fact do not support the Board's\n  conclusion that Pro-active failed to prove the conduct was the result of unpreventable employee misconduct. We affirm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A. JOB SITE CITATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Pro-Active installs siding and trim on new homes. Pro-Active contracted to install siding on two adjoining homes in Tumwater. The homes were two-story buildings that were over 10 feet high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On January 13, 2014, one of Pro-Active's superintendents, John Hodges, visited the Tumwater site. Hodges observed a lead worker, Onofre Valadez Gomez, on the roof of one of the homes without safety equipment. He told Valadez to make sure he used his safety line to connect his harness to an anchor. Hodges considered this a verbal warning. Hodges then left Valadez in charge of safety at the site. Hodges testified that Pro-Active employees were trained in the proper use of scaffold and fall protections. Hodges also claimed the company held safety meetings and disciplined workers who violated safety protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Later that day, Valadez constructed a scaffold that used a ladder as the walkway. Valadez was not trained in how to construct scaffold. The scaffold was potentially unstable and if it fell could cause death or serious injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 While Valadez worked on the roof, Department inspector Raul De Leon arrived at the site and observed from his car Valadez walking on the roof without fall protection. Inspector De Leon also observed Valadez walk on the scaffold without fall protection. Valadez was in charge when De Leon visited the site. Pro Active admits that Valadez was exposed to fall hazards for not using a safety line while on the roof and while walking on the scaffold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Inspector De Leon observed at the other home another employee, Martin Gonzalez Verdozco, on a scaffold\n   that used a pump jack scaffold that was not secured to the ground with spikes. Gonzalez testified he erected the scaffold but could not recall if he used spikes. Inspector De Leon took pictures of the scaffold. Gonzalez testified that he could not see spikes in the pictures and that if there were spikes they would show in the picture. Gonzalez, who had worked for Pro-Active for two years, testified he never observed Pro-Active discipline an employee for safety violations other than Valadez on January 13, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Pro-Active's owner, Chad Hansen, claimed Pro-Active did not approve of the scaffold that Valadez was standing on and always used spikes to secure the scaffold to the ground\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The Department cited Pro-Active for the following seven WISHA violations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1-1. The employer did not ensure the employees exposed to fall hazards over 4 feet on steep pitched roofs used appropriate fall protection in violation of WAC 296-155-24609(07)(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1-2.

The employer did not ensure that employees working from a scaffold platform were provided with appropriate safe access in violation of WAC 296-874-20020.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1-5. The employer did not ensure that employees working from scaffold platforms at heights over 10 feet used appropriate personal fall arrest systems in violation of WAC 296-874-20052.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1-6. The employer did not ensure that ladders used by employees on site, were used in accordance with\n   manufacture's instructions and in a way they were designed for and intended to be used in violation of WAC 296-876-40005.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1-7. The employer did not ensure that pump jack scaffolds used on site met the requirements of having the bottom part of the poles secured in violation of 296-874-40032.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   All violations are characterized as \"serious\" violations. Board Record (BR) at 69-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B. PRO-ACTIVE APPEALS TO THE BOARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 Pro-Active appealed to the Board, arguing that unpreventable employee misconduct excused its violations. The Board rejected Pro-Active's argument, deciding that Pro-Active did not prove that it took adequate steps to correct violations of its safety rules or enforced its safety program. The Board affirmed the citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C. PRO-ACTIVE APPEALS TO THE SUPERIOR COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 10 Pro-Active appealed to the superior court, which also rejected its unpreventable employee misconduct defense. The superior court, however, remanded for a further finding of fact regarding employer knowledge. On remand, the Board entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, specifically finding that \"Pro-Active Home Builders, Inc. had constructive knowledge of all seven serious violations because it could have discovered or prevented them by exercising reasonable diligence.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 11. The Board further found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   18. Pro-Active Home Builders, Inc., failed to effectively enforce safety rules regarding fall protection and the construction and use of scaffolds on January 13, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   19. Pro-Active Home Builders, Inc., did not take adequate steps to correct violations of its safety rules on January 13, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   20. On January 13, 2014, Pro-Active Home Builders, Inc., did not effectively enforce its safety program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   CP at 12 The Board concluded \"Pro-Active Home Builders, Inc., does not meet the requirements for vacating this Corrective Notice of Redetermination ... based on unpreventable employee misconduct.\" CP at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 11 Pro-Active again appealed to the superior court, which affirmed the Board's order. Pro-Active now appeals to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 12 Pro-Active argues the Department failed to prove it had actual or constructive knowledge of the violations, and, even if the Department did prove knowledge, Pro-Active should not have been fined because the actions were based on unpreventable employee misconduct. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.

Hodges observed Valadez on the roof without safety equipment and told Valadez to make sure he used his safety line to connect his harness to an anchor. Hodges then left Valadez in charge of safety at the job site. It was obvious that the job site required scaffolding since the houses were two-story building and over 10 feet high. Valadez was not trained in how to construct a scaffold, he constructed a scaffold that used a ladder as the walkway without fall protection. The scaffold was potentially unstable and if it fell could cause death or serious injury. Hodges acknowledged that Valadez did not correctly erect the scaffold.

UNPREVENTABLE EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 29 We next turn to whether Pro-Active established the affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct. The Department may not issue a citation if unpreventable employee misconduct caused the violation. RCW 49.17.120(5)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 30 RCW 49.17.120(5)(a) establishes the requirements for the affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct. To succeed on its claim, Pro-Active had to show (1) a thorough safety program (including work rules, training, and equipment designed to prevent the violation), (2) adequate communication of these rules, (3) steps to discover and correct violations, and (4) effective enforcement of its safety program as written in practice and not just in theory. RCW 49.17.120(5) ;\n   <em>\n    W. Oilfields Supply\n   </em>\n   , 1 Wash.

In order to show that a safety program is effective in practice, the employer must prove that the employee's misconduct was an isolated occurrence and was not foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    Washington Cedar,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1350119\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/119/906/#p914\">\n    119 Wash.

This affirmative defense applies in \"situations in which employees disobey safety rules despite the employer's diligent communication and enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Asplundh Tree Expert Co. v.

The Board concluded that Pro-Active did not meet its burden to show unpreventable employee misconduct. The Board did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 32 First, Pro-Active failed to show it tried to discover and correct safety violations. To prove unpreventable employee misconduct, the employer must show that the conduct was idiosyncratic and not foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    Washington Cedar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1350119\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/119/906/#p914\">\n    119 Wash.

Here, the conduct was foreseeable because Hodges witnessed Valadez violating a safety rule that day. Despite seeing Valadez commit a safety violation, the superintendent left him in charge of safety and made no further attempt to monitor Valadez's compliance with safety rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 33 Pro-Active argues that where an employee has just been reminded of the safety requirements, those safety standards are fresh in their mind and it would be foreseeable that the employee would be cognizant and abide by the rules. But, the opposite inference may also be raised by knowledge that an employee is flouting safety rules and that the employee may require additional monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 34 Also, the job site required scaffolding to work in the location where Valadez erected the scaffold. Hodges left Valadez at the house even though he was not competent in scaffold construction, and Hodges did not verify that a competent person would erect the scaffold. Further, there is no evidence that Hodges inspected the pump jack scaffold at the second house to look for safety violations, and he did not testify that the scaffold was properly secured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35 Second, Pro-Active has provided no documentary evidence that it disciplined any employees for violating safety rules before the violations here.

Without showing actual enforcement of a company's disciplinary policy,\n   the employer cannot meet its burden to show unpreventable employee misconduct. And the Board can rely on the lack of documented evidence to determine whether the program is effective in practice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20P.3d%20387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36 Although Pro-Active claims it disciplined Valadez once verbally before the inspection, it did not verify by documentation that it disciplined any other Pro-Active employee. Gonzalez, who had worked for Pro-Active for two years, had never seen Pro-Active discipline an employee other than Valadez's on January 13, 2014. And Gonzalez had seen others working without fall protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37 Based on the above, substantial evidence supports the Board's findings that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   18.
