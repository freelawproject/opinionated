Lewis pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine in case No. 05 CR 3213 for a crime committed in August 2005. At the same plea hearing, he pleaded no contest to forgery in case No. 06 CR 247, committed in January 2006. In case No. 07 CR 428, Lewis pleaded no contest to aggravated battery, criminal possession of a firearm, and aggravated escape from custody, committed in February 2007. In all three cases, the district court sentenced Lewis as having a criminal history score of B based partially on his 1978 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation, which the district court scored as a person felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, Lewis filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence based on\n   <em>\n    State v.

Without holding a hearing, the district court denied that motion and held that\n   <em>\n    Murdock\n   </em>\n   did not apply retroactively to Lewis' cases.

We agreed with the State that Texas' definition of habitation fits within Kansas' definition of dwelling, but we reversed and remanded the case with directions to the district court for two reasons: to review court documents from the 1978 case and determine if the prior conviction involved burglary of a habitation; and to determine whether Texas' 1978 burglary statute was comparable to the Kansas burglary statute in effect when Lewis committed his current crimes of conviction.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201546133\">\n    2016 WL 1546133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing on remand, Lewis argued that his 1978 Texas conviction should be scored as a nonperson felony because the facts showed his crime involved a separate garage without an entrance to the house. The district court rejected that argument based on prior court rulings that treated Texas' burglary of a habitation the same as Kansas' burglary of a dwelling. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Mullens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417002\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/51/1114/#p1117\">\n    51 Kan.

After reviewing the Texas court documents, the district court determined that Lewis' Texas burglary involved a habitation so that crime was comparable to Kansas' burglary and was thus properly scored as a person crime. Lewis appeals. All three cases are consolidated on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lewis argues solely that his sentence is illegal because the district court erroneously classified his 1978 Texas burglary conviction as a person felony. He contends that Texas' burglary of a habitation is not comparable to Kansas' burglary of a dwelling because Texas' definition of habitation is broader than Kansas' definition of dwelling, encompassing both nondwelling buildings or structures and unenclosed property that would not constitute burglary of a dwelling in Kansas. Lewis asks us to remand the case for resentencing with an amended criminal history score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first examine the State's contention that the doctrine of res judicata precludes Lewis' argument.

His claim was denied on the merits. Now, Lewis claims that his 1978 Texas burglary of a habitation conviction should not be classified as a person felony because Kansas has no comparable crime. This is the same claim based on a different legal theory-one that is not distinct enough to give rise to a new claim for purposes of res judicata.\n   <em>\n    Midwest Crane &amp; Rigging v.

So ordinarily res judicata would bar Lewis' current appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But the Kansas Supreme Court does not seem to apply res judicata in this context, finding that \"arguments concerning retroactivity and res judicata ... are all unavailing in the context of a motion to correct an illegal sentence which can be made at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lewis filed his first motion to correct illegal sentence under\n   <em>\n    Murdock\n   </em>\n   in 2014. The district court denied his motion and he appealed. This court found \"the Texas definition of habitation fits within the Kansas definition of dwelling,\" but it remanded the case for the district court to see if it could determine from relevant documents whether Lewis' prior conviction actually involved a burglary of a habitation, as well as whether the 1978 Texas burglary conviction was comparable to Kansas' burglary statute in effect when Lewis committed the current crimes.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201546133\">\n    2016 WL 1546133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Now Lewis claims Texas' definition of \"habitation\" is broader than Kansas' definition of a \"dwelling,\" so the two crimes are not comparable. Thus Lewis is bringing an already litigated claim based on a different legal theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Yet this doctrine \" 'is not an inexorable command, or a constitutional requirement, but is, rather, a discretionary policy which expresses the practice of the courts generally to refuse to reopen a matter already decided, without limiting their power to do so.' \"\n   <em>\n    Collier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"194046\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/263/629/\">\n    263 Kan. at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts have limited their discretion by applying three generally recognized exceptions to this doctrine. These exceptions permit an appellate court to reconsider an issue it already decided when: (1) a later trial produces substantially different evidence; (2) a controlling authority has made a contrary decision regarding the law applicable to the issues; or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would result in manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A defendant may be convicted in Texas for burglary of a victim's garage-a structure appurtenant to or connected with victim's house. A garage falls within the definition of a \"habitation,\" as contained in its statute defining the offense of burglary of a habitation.\n   <em>\n    Shakesnider v.

App. 1985). But Kansas' burglary of a dwelling statute has no such \"structure appurtenant to or connected with\" language. Instead, the Kansas statute considers burglaries of buildings other than \"dwellings,\" such as unattached garages, to be nonperson crimes. K.S.A. 21-3715.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nor does Texas law require that a structure be enclosed to be considered a habitation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030.01\">\n    Tex.
