For each campsite, the County charges $25.00 per week and does not collect any sales or lodging taxes. The Department of Revenue (Department) determined the use of these campsites was subject to sales and lodging taxation, and the Board of Equalization (Board) reversed.

The Fair Board rents these campsites annually and charges campers $25.00 for use during the week of fair. These campsites have historically been made available to fair exhibitors or their families. In 2016, the Johnson County Tourism Association inquired of the Department whether lodging taxes must be collected for the use and rental of these campsites. In response, the Department issued a determination finding the Fair Board was a non-exempt lodging vendor required to obtain a Wyoming Sales/Use Tax License and statutorily obligated to collect and remit sales and lodging taxes for the campsite rentals. The Department assessed the County $113.75 for the uncollected taxes in 2016, representing the unpaid taxes for the week-long use of the sixty-five (65) campsites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] On appeal, the Board analyzed: (1) whether the camping fee was a user fee for county-owned recreational facilities and therefore exempt from excise taxes, and (2) whether the Department met its burden of proof to show that the Fair Board qualified as a vendor, as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-15-101\">\n    Wyo.

The crux of the Board's decision follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   29. The Department bypasses the statutory \"engaged in the business of\" language and declares that the campsite revenue is taxable under Chapter 2, section 4(b) of its own rules. (Dep't Opening Br. 3).

The governmental entity shall be considered a vendor and shall be licensed and collect tax on taxable transactions.\" Rules, Wyo. Dep't of Revenue, ch. 2, \u00a7 4(b) (2014).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   30. The Department reads its rule in a way that renders moot the \"engaged in the business\" clause of Wyoming Statutes section 39-15-101(a)(xv) (2015). The Department cannot unilaterally declare that such sales are subject to tax: if the legislature hasn't subjected a class of transactions to sales and lodging tax, the Department has no power to do so.\n   <em>\n    In re National Park Adventures, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20370030\">\n    1999 WL 370030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Docket Nos. 96-19, 96-22, 96-121, \u00b6 21 (Wyo. State Bd. of Equalization, May 28, 1999) (\"Taxation is solely a legislative function and an administrative agency does not have the authority to impose, levy or collect a tax absent clear statutory authority.\"). Thus, the \"engaged in the business of\" clause of Wyoming Statutes section 39-15-101(a)(xv) (2015) must be satisfied before we can determine that the fair board is a \"vendor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b613] The Board determined the meaning of \"engaged in the business of selling\" by using what it described as the \"plain meaning of those words.\" To arrive at this, and in addition to the uncontested facts, the Board relied upon Black's law dictionary and a U.S. Supreme Court decision. The Board found that to be engaged in the business of selling it required \"a continuing effort to make a profit\" or to be \"engaged in a trade or business ... involved in the activity with continuity and regularity and ... [the] primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.\" The Board concluded the Fair Board was not \"engaged in the business of selling\" because it did not seek out other income generating opportunities throughout the year and because the primary purpose of renting out the campsites was to \"provide a service to county fair participants,\" and not necessarily for profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b614] The Board also relied upon certain uncontested facts to determine whether the Department met its burden of proving the Fair Board was a vendor. These uncontested facts included that the Fair Board provides its fair participants with camp spots that have electrical hook-ups; it only rents the campsites to fair and rodeo participants; the Fair Board is not a licensed vendor with the Department; in 2016, sixty five (65) spots were rented for fair week at the price of $25.00 for the entire week for a total income of $1,625.00 to the Fair Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b615] We find no error or violation of law with the Board's identification of the issues or its analysis of the phrase \"engaged in the business of selling.\" It is clear to this Court that defining \"engaged in the business of selling\" was a central issue, and the Board's analysis was necessary and appropriate for purposes of determining whether the Fair\n   Board was a vendor under the applicable statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b616] The Board's conclusion that the income derived by the County was not for profit but used only to offset the operating costs is supported by the undisputed facts of this case. Furthermore, the Board's conclusion that the Department failed to show that the income derived from these rentals was \"for profit,\" rather than to offset operating costs of the fairgrounds, is also supported by the record. The Court cannot find these conclusions were unreasonable, contrary to the law, or arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b617] The Department had the burden of proving that the Fair Board's rental of the campsites was a taxable event, and there is a reasonable basis for the Board's determination that the Department failed to meet its burden. The Court cannot find the Board committed error by finding the Department failed to meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b618] The Department had the burden of showing that renting campsites at the Johnson County Fair for one week per year, at $25.00 per campsite, was a taxable event. We find the Board's determination that the Johnson County Fair Board was not a \"vendor\" and therefore not required to impose an excise tax is supported by the record. The Board's conclusion that the Department failed to meet its burden of proof was not arbitrary or capricious.
