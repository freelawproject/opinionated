Claimants submitted claims to the Division for those services, and the Division paid those claims. The Division's payments were made, however, in accordance with its statutorily-directed fee schedule and resulted in payments that were significantly less than the amounts billed. As a result, Air Methods billed a total of just under $3 million for\n   seventy claims during the period 2013-2016, and received payments totaling about $423,000. EagleMed billed close to $527,000 for thirteen claims during the period 2013-2015, and received payments totaling about $85,000. Med-Trans billed close to $432,000 for twelve claims during the period 2012-2015, and received payments totaling about $109,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b67] Claimants submitted objections to the underpayments, with each objection requesting a hearing and asserting that the Airline Deregulation Act (\"ADA\") barred application of the Division fee schedule to air ambulance billings. Around the time Claimants filed a complaint in federal court challenging the Division's fee schedule under the ADA, the Division referred the objections to the OAH for hearing. As a result of the federal action, the OAH stayed its proceedings \"pending an anticipated judicial adjudication of whether the Airline Deregulation Act preempts the [Division's] fee schedule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b68] On May 16, 2016, the District Court for the District of Wyoming issued a summary judgment ruling in favor of Claimants' preemption claim.\n   <em>\n    EagleMed, LLC v.

Wyo. 2016). The federal district court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [T]he Court concludes that the Airline Deregulation Act preempts Wyoming Statute section 27-14-401(e) and Chapter 9, Section 8 of the Rules, Regulations and Fee Schedules of the Wyoming Workers' Compensation Division to the extent the statute and regulation set compensation that air ambulances may receive for their services. The state officials are permanently enjoined from enforcing the statute and regulation against air ambulance services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    EagleMed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270577\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/1255/#p1281\">\n    227 F.Supp.3d at 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b69] The Division appealed the district court's decision to the United States Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and in the interim took the position that since it was enjoined from paying air ambulance providers according to its fee schedule, it was enjoined from paying them at all for their services. On August 16, 2016, the district court responded with an order directing \"that the named state officials and their employees and agents are required to compensate air ambulance entities the full amount charged for air ambulance services.\" The court explained (record cites omitted):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendants mischaracterize the effect of this Court's\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Order Denying Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n   . The defendants claim that this Court has enjoined them from paying the air ambulances any sum of money for services rendered. Such a result would reward the defendants for illegally enforcing its [sic] fee schedule for years. After rereading the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n   , it is readily apparent that the Court enjoined enforcement of the statute and regulation because the defendants were illegally regulating air ambulance rates. In fact, by violating this Court's\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n   and not paying air ambulances for any services, the defendants are again regulating air ambulance rates, only more severely this time around. The defendants cannot set air ambulance rates. Because the defendants cannot do so, they must pay the air ambulance services whatever they charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b610] On October 7, 2016, Air Methods filed a motion with the OAH to lift the stay of the contested case proceeding. Air Methods renewed its motion on October 20, and on December 19, 2016, the OAH entered an order lifting the stay. The parties thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and on August 10, 2016, the OAH ruled in favor of Claimants. The OAH found that \u00a7 401(e) was severable, and that, as severed, it authorized payment outside the Division's fee schedule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [S]everability is the general rule and statutes should be found severable if the valid portions are sufficient in themselves to accomplish the purpose of the statute. [citations omitted] The general purpose of Wyoming Statute \u00a7 27-14-401(e) (LexisNexis) is to allow for the payment of ambulance services provided to injured Wyoming workers under the WC Act. The remaining valid portions of Wyoming Statute \u00a7 27-14-401(e) (LexisNexis)-\"If transportation by ambulance is necessary, the division shall allow a ... charge for the ambulance service\"-are sufficient to accomplish the goal of paying for ambulance services provided to injured Wyoming workers covered by the WC Act. In other words, Wyoming Statute \u00a7 27-14-401(e) (LexisNexis) as preempted by the US District Court, allows for: (a) the payment of air ambulance charges for necessary transportation of workers' compensation claimants; and (b) the payment of reasonable ground ambulance charges for the necessary transportation of workers' compensation claimants in accordance with the Division's duly adopted fee schedule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b611] Based on the federal preemption ruling and its finding of severability, the OAH ordered that \"[t]he Air Ambulance Companies are entitled to reimbursement of the full amount of the air ambulance service charges submitted and billed to the Division in all of the consolidated claims before this Office.\" On September 1, 2017, the Division filed a petition for judicial review of the OAH ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b612] On September 11, 2017, Air Methods filed a motion for pre- and post-judgment interest on its claims with the OAH. The Division opposed Air Methods' interest motion, contending that the OAH no longer had jurisdiction over the matter, and that the Worker's Compensation Act does not authorize payment of interest on claims. On October 20, 2017, the OAH entered an order denying the interest motion on grounds that the OAH lacked both jurisdiction and statutory authority to award interest on Air Methods' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b613] On October 31, 2017, Air Methods filed a petition for judicial review of the OAH order denying its interest motion. On November 29, 2017, the district court entered an order consolidating the Division and Air Methods appeals, and on February 23, 2018, the court entered an order certifying the consolidated appeals to this Court.

We will address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Federal Courts' Preemption Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b617] The Division's first argument on appeal is a challenge to the preemption ruling made by the federal district court and upheld by the Tenth Circuit. The Division contends that the preemption ruling was based on an incorrect interpretation of state law and that\n   this Court should correct that alleged misstep by the federal courts. Claimants respond that this is a new argument on appeal that this Court should not consider, and because the argument represents a collateral attack on the federal rulings, it is also barred by the doctrines of collateral estoppel,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , and judicial estoppel. We agree that the argument is one raised for the first time on appeal, and we therefore decline to consider it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b618] In support of its preemption argument, the Division points to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-14-501\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 27-14-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which defines the procedure for filing claims under the Act and prohibits a medical provider from billing an injured employee for any amount not covered by workers' compensation benefits-also known as balance billing. It argues that the error in the federal analysis was an assumption that the balance billing prohibition applies to air ambulance providers. According to the Division, the prohibition does not apply to air ambulance providers, so those providers may simply bill injured workers for the balance of any charge the Division only partially pays. Thus, the argument goes, since \u00a7 401(e) limits what the Division may pay, but not what the air ambulance may collect, the Act does not impermissibly regulate air ambulance rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b619] It is apparent from a reading of the federal decisions that this was not an argument that the Division presented to either the federal district court or the Tenth Circuit. In fact, it is clear that the Division's argument before the Tenth Circuit was that \u00a7 27-14-501(a) does prohibit Claimants from balance billing injured workers.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants contend that air-ambulance companies are free to either submit a bill to the Division for reimbursement at the rates established in the rate schedule,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     agreeing in return not to bill any remaining unpaid amounts to the injured worker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , or to submit the entire bill to the injured worker for payment. * * * Defendants contend that an air-ambulance provider does not \"accept[ ] the case of an injured employee\" until the provider chooses to present a claim to the Division, and it is only then, Defendants contend\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     , that the remainder of the statute kicks in and prohibits the provider from billing the injured employee for the expenses incurred\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    EagleMed, LLC v.

At no point in the administrative proceedings did the Division question the federal preemption ruling or suggest to the OAH that it could avoid preemption of the fee schedule by ruling that \u00a7 501(a) permits Claimants to bill the balance of their charges to injured employees. In fact, the opposite is again true. In its summary judgment reply brief, the Division stated unequivocally, \"The preemption ruling is not at issue in this proceeding.\" It repeated this position in its oral argument before the OAH, stating in reference to its fee schedule, \"[T]hose limitations have been preempted[.] ... Those are gone. We all agree that those are preempted[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b621] We have repeatedly held that in an appeal from an administrative ruling, we will not consider arguments not raised below.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Wyoming Rule of Appellate Procedure 12.09(a) limits an appellate court's review of administrative action to \"issues set forth in the petition and raised before the agency.\" Accordingly, we have routinely held that, with the exception of jurisdictional or certain fundamental issues, issues raised for the first time on appeal from an administrative decision will not be considered.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

This Office need not create a new medical benefit because the statute, as severed, authorizes payment of air ambulance charges....

In other words, [\u00a7 401(e) ] as preempted by the US District Court, allows for: (a) the payment of air ambulance charges for necessary transportation of workers' compensation claimants; and (b) the payment of reasonable ground ambulance charges for the necessary transportation of workers' compensation claimants in accordance with the Division's duly adopted fee schedule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b625] The Division contends that the OAH erred in relying on the federal district court ruling to find that \u00a7 401(e) is severable and requires the Division to pay Claimants in full because the Tenth Circuit, subsequent to the OAH ruling, overturned the relevant parts of\n   the district court ruling.

The preamble to the 1945 law illustrates that the legislature's objective was to provide the benefit of ambulance transportation to injured workers.

The Wyoming Constitution provides that compensation paid from the workers' compensation fund shall be \"as may be fixed by law.\" Wyo. Const. art. 10, \u00a7 4 (c). Two laws fix the air ambulance benefit. The first is \u00a7 401(e), which, as severed, authorizes\n   the Division to pay an injured worker's necessary air ambulance expenses. The second is the ADA, which, as the Tenth Circuit explained, prohibits state action affecting the rate charged by an air ambulance provider.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The Airline Deregulation Act's preemption provision states in pertinent part that \"a State ... may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

The severed statute is now part of the Act's continuing appropriation, and the OAH therefore did not order a payment without appropriation in violation of Article 16, \u00a7 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Appeal No. S-18-0068\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   [\u00b646] Air Methods filed a motion for pre- and post-judgment interest on its claims ten days after the Division filed its petition for review of the OAH summary judgment order. The OAH denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that once the Division filed its petition for review, jurisdiction over the entire matter vested in the district court. It further ruled that even if it had jurisdiction to rule on the motion, it had no statutory authority to award interest on a worker's compensation claim. We conclude the OAH had jurisdiction to rule on the motion, but we affirm the OAH conclusion that it had no statutory authority to award interest. Before turning to our discussion of the jurisdictional and statutory authority questions, however, we must first address the parties' differing positions on the finality and effect of the OAH summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Finality and Effect of the Summary Judgment Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   [\u00b647] The Division contends the order directing payment of the air ambulance charges was a final appealable order and that it impliedly denied Air Methods' request for interest. In keeping with this position, the Division argues that Air Methods should have filed either a direct appeal or a cross-appeal of the summary judgment order and its failure to do so renders its appeal untimely. On that basis, the Division has filed a motion to dismiss Air Methods' appeal. We took that motion under advisement pending our record review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b648] Air Methods takes a different view of the summary judgment order. It contends the order either impliedly granted its request for interest, but did not calculate the amount due, or it left the question unanswered. On that basis, it argues the summary judgment order was not a final order, and the Division's petition for review was premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [\u00b649] We begin by looking to Air Methods' claims that were referred to the OAH for hearing and on which Air Methods sought summary judgment. Air Methods' claims consisted of notices of objection to the Division's underpayment of seventy separate billings. The objections did not claim a right to or make a demand for interest on the underpayments and instead claimed only a right to the difference between the amount billed and the amount paid. Similarly, in the exhibits to its summary judgment motion, Air Methods included summary tabulations of its claims, but those tabulations did not reference a claim for interest on the underpaid billings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   [\u00b650] During oral argument on the summary judgment motions, Air Methods remained silent on its claim for interest. Counsel for Air Methods argued its claim for relief, but stated it again in the manner stated in its notices of objection and summary judgment exhibits-the unpaid portion of the billing, with no reference to interest.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   So, you know, we're back to where we began. We stayed this case to get an answer on that one legal question that we all knew would supply the rule of the decision. We got that-we got that answer from Judge Johnson. He's answered all of the questions that the Division raises here. So we'd ask that the Court grant the claimant's motion and order the Division to pay the full bill charges as set forth in the pleadings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [\u00b651] The only mention Air Methods made of its request for interest was a passing reference to it in the concluding paragraph of its summary judgment motion, where it requested an award of the underpayments, \"together with pre- and post-judgment interest to the extent permitted by law.\" Aside from this passing reference, the motion offered no argument or legal analysis to support the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   [\u00b652] Not surprisingly, then, the OAH summary judgment order, while explicit in its relief, did not address Air Methods' request for interest. The order directed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   1. The Division's March 17, 2017 Motion for Summary Disposition is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   2. Air Methods' April 20, 2017 Motion for Summary Judgment and EagleMed/Med-Trans April 20, 2017 Motion for Summary Judgment are GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   3. The Air Ambulance Companies are entitled to reimbursement of the full amount of the air ambulance service charges submitted and billed to the Division in all of the consolidated claims before this Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   4. This case is returned to the Wyoming Workers' Compensation Division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   [\u00b653] We find it clear that Air Methods' request for interest was neither at issue in the summary judgment proceedings nor impliedly ruled on by the summary judgment order. That being the case, the order contained no adverse ruling for Air Methods to appeal, and we therefore deny the Division's motion to dismiss Air Methods' appeal as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   [\u00b654] Turning to the question of whether the Division's petition for review was premature, we have said that \"[a] final administrative order is one ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. If the agency retains the matter for further action, the order is not final.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglass v. Wyo.

The summary judgment order was couched in terms of a final order, and expressly stated no further action would be taken on the claims before the OAH. The order fully addressed the merits of Claimants' objections to the Division's underpayments, and it granted the relief Claimants requested in those objections-the difference between the amount billed and the amount paid. Thus, as to the Claimants' notices of objection and the claims made therein, the summary judgment order was a final appealable order, and the Division did not prematurely file its petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   [\u00b655] This leaves Air Methods' claim for interest on the Division's underpayments as a claim separate from its claims for the difference between the billings and payments.
