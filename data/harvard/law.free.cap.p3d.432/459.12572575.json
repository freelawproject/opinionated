B.M. argues that (1) the superior court commissioner lacked a constitutionally compelling state interest to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication, (2) the State failed to present sufficient evidence in support of its petition to involuntarily administer antipsychotics, and (3) the commissioner's order is invalid because it failed to direct the maximum dosages that may be administered by the State. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In September 2016, B.M. was out jogging when he felt excruciating pain. He came to the conclusion that his neighbors shot him with a \"Wi-Fi weapon\" and were responsible for his injury. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (June 13, 2017) at 9. He then unhooked his neighbor's internet cable, threw a planter through the back windshield of his neighbor's car, broke the car windows with a stick, and dented the car. The State charged B.M. with second degree malicious mischief, but B.M. was found to lack the\n   capacity to stand trial, and his criminal charges were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On June 13, 2017, a superior court commissioner presided over the resulting civil commitment petition. Ultimately, the commissioner found B.M. to be \"gravely disabled\" and involuntarily committed B.M. for up to 180 days at Western State Hospital. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. HEARING ON PETITION TO ADMINISTER ANTIPSYCHOTICS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Nine days later, Dr. Liban Rodol, B.M.'s treating psychiatrist at Western State Hospital, filed a petition for involuntary treatment with antipsychotic medication under RCW 71.05.217(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 At the hearing in the superior court, Dr. Rodol testified that B.M.'s current diagnosis was a \"[s]chizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.\" VRP (June 30, 2017) at 4. Dr. Rodol said that B.M. refused to accept any antipsychotic medication and that he still exhibited delusions of his neighbors attacking him. Additionally, Dr. Rodol testified that B.M. said that he would take only Celexa and Klonopin. Celexa and Klonopin treat anxiety and depression, and Dr. Rodol opined they would not be effective to treat B.M.'s symptoms. In Dr. Rodol's opinion, antipsychotic medication would help with psychotic symptoms like delusions, and it could also work as a mood stabilizer to help with manic episodes. Dr. Rodol believed that antipsychotic medication was necessary for B.M. to recover to the point where he would be discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Dr. Rodol testified that since he had filed the petition, there had been multiple incidents where B.M. had been verbally aggressive towards staff and had instigated fights. In Dr. Rodol's opinion, B.M.'s behavior would likely continue or worsen if he remained off of antipsychotic medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Dr. Rodol testified that antipsychotic medication was both necessary and effective in treating B.M. In his opinion,\n   alternative treatments like seclusion, restraints, or milieu therapy would not treat B.M.'s psychotic symptoms and would not address concerns about getting him discharged and keeping people safe. B.M. had previously taken an antipsychotic, Seroquel, and Dr. Rodol testified that \"presumably [B.M.] tolerated the medication\" without too many problems. VRP (June 30, 2017) at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 B.M. testified that he had taken antipsychotic medication in his past and that he had a very strong reaction to it. He said he \"fear[s] for [his] life when [he] take[s] it.\" VRP (June 30, 2017) at 26. He testified that he was not willing to take antipsychotic medication and that the medical professionals would have to forcibly inject him every time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. RULING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 In his oral ruling, the commissioner said he was \"not exactly 100 percent sure one way or the other\" but that he would \"allow the order to stand.\" VRP (June 30, 2017) at 36-37. The commissioner entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. Finding of fact 4 said the State had \"a compelling interest in administering antipsychotic medication\" because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ? [B.M.] has suffered or will suffer a severe deterioration in routine functioning that endangers [B.M.'s] health or safety if he/she does not receive such treatment, as evidenced by [B.M.'s] past behavior and mental condition while he/she was receiving such treatment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ? [B.M.] will likely be detained for a substantially longer period of time, at increased public expense, without such treatment [;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ? Other: _Has been aggressive and goading others into trying to fight and without medication it is likely to continue or worsen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CP at 20-21. The commissioner also entered finding of fact 5, which stated that the antipsychotic medication was necessary and effective and that alternatives were less effective\n   because they would be more likely to prolong the length of commitment and would not address B.M.'s symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 The commissioner authorized the State to administer one antipsychotic at a time and gave B.M. some input and the ability to veto one of the options. Additionally, the commissioner determined that review would occur in 60 days. The order remained in effect until November 30, and on that day a new civil commitment order was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I. MOOTNESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 As a threshold issue, the State argues that the case is moot.

COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 This case is not moot because like an involuntary commitment order, an order to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication can have collateral consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029309\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/168/621/#p626\">\n    168 Wash.

The legislative intent in RCW 71.05.012 states that \"the consideration of\n   <em>\n    prior mental history\n   </em>\n   is particularly relevant in determining whether the person would receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.\" (Emphasis added.) For individuals under a commitment order \"a\n   <em>\n    prior history of decompensation leading to repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions\n   </em>\n   should be given great weight in determining whether a new less restrictive alternative commitment should be ordered.\" RCW 71.05.012 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RCW 71.05.575(2) (when determining whether an offender is dangerous to himself or others \"a court shall give great weight to any evidence submitted to the court regarding an offender's recent history of judicially required or administratively ordered involuntary antipsychotic medication while in confinement\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   RCW 71.05.212(4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (when conducting an evaluation prior to release for offenders with a mental illness believed to be dangerous, the designated professional \"shall consider an offender's history of judicially required or administratively ordered antipsychotic medication while in confinement.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 An order to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication as part of B.M.'s prior medical history may have weight in future commitment orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 71.05.012. Because each order to administer antipsychotic medication may have collateral consequences in future proceedings, this appeal is not moot even though B.M.'s order has expired. Thus, we exercise our discretion and consider the issues raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. COMPELLING STATE INTEREST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 B.M. argues that the commissioner lacked a constitutionally compelling state interest when he authorized the State to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication.

Therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   I. SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 56 On June 13, 2017, the superior court ordered that B.M. be committed for 180 days of involuntary mental illness treatment under chapter 71.05 RCW. Nine days later, on June 22, B.M.'s treating psychiatrist at Western State Hospital, Dr. Liban Rodol, filed a petition to force B.M. to be treated with antipsychotic drugs against his will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 57 Eight days after the petition was filed, the superior court entered an order allowing B.M. to be involuntarily medicated with such drugs. By checking boxes on a printed form, the court found a compelling interest in administering antipsychotic medication for three reasons. First, the court found that B.M. has suffered or will suffer a severe deterioration in routine functioning that endangers his health or safety if he does not receive such treatment, as evidenced by his past behavior and mental condition while receiving prior treatment. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 20. Second, the court found that without the requested treatment, B.M. will likely be detained for a substantially longer period of time, at increased public expense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Finally, the court found that B.M. has been aggressive and has goaded others into trying to fight and that, without medication, this is likely to continue or worsen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. The court did not check the box denoting another pre-printed reason: that B.M. had recently threatened, attempted or caused serious harm to self or others. CP at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 58 The majority opinion ably describes the evidence in support of these findings. As the opinion points out, Dr. Rodol testified to incidents in which B.M. had been very verbally aggressive towards staff members and other patients and had tried to instigate fights with them. Dr. Rodol also testified, though, that these incidents all occurred after he filed the petition to administer antipsychotic drugs. Thus, at the time of filing there was no evidence of aggressive or goading behavior by B.M. at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 59 As far as alternatives are concerned, Dr. Rodol's testimony does not suggest that the hospital actually tried alternative forms of treatment, but it simply asserts that other alternatives, such as seclusion, restraints, or milieu therapy, would not treat the underlying psychotic symptoms. VRP, 6/30/17 at 12. However, in his petition, Dr. Rodol did note\n   milieu therapy as a possible alternative treatment, but alleged that it would be less effective than antipsychotic medications because it is more likely to prolong length of commitment for involuntary treatment. CP at 16. Neither the petition nor the record indicate whether milieu therapy was ever attempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 60 As to potential side effects of antipsychotic medication, Dr. Rodol noted possible sedation, possible weight gain, possible increase in blood sugar levels, metabolic changes in some cases, such as an increase in cholesterol or lipids, and in some cases movement disorders, like stiffness, rigidity, and restlessness. He noted also that tardive dyskinesia with involuntary movements could result from long-term use of some anti-psychotic medications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 61 Courts, however, have recognized much more profound effects. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , the court described the effects of antipsychotic drugs in the following terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   First, the drugs \"tinker[ ] with the mental processes,\"\n   <em>\n    Mackey v.

Thus, forcing an individual to take these drugs is to force that individual, against his will, to risk degrading his ability to think, to create, to understand, to\n   communicate self and ideas, and to autonomously choose what type of person he is. These liberties are the beating heart of all other liberties. They make up our crowning zone of privacy, the sublime mysteries of the human mind. There might be reasons compelling enough to allow the State to order their sacrifice, but cost savings, speed, and efficiency are not among them. Those and similar rationales should be purged from any asserted justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 69 The State's argument, then, reduces to reliance on the finding that without antipsychotic drugs, B.M. will likely be detained for a substantially longer period of time. As noted, RCW 71.05.217(7)(a) and\n   <em>\n    Vernonia School District\n   </em>\n   require that the compelling state interest be weighty enough to justify sacrificing the central constitutional rights just described.

However, the basis offered by the State for the forced administration\n   of antipsychotics to B.M. falls well short of that in\n   <em>\n    Schuoler\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 71 Dr. Rodol testified that the medications that B.M. is willing to take would not treat his mental illness. However, in the petition for involuntary treatment Dr. Rodol also noted that milieu therapy was a possible alternative treatment, but neither the petition nor the record indicate whether that was ever attempted. At the hearing, the doctor's testimony about this and other alternative treatments was limited to the wholly conclusory statement that there were no less restrictive alternatives to medication that would treat the illness. The petition, though, discloses\n   the rationale for abandoning this alternative treatment: milieu therapy would be less effective than antipsychotic medications because it is more likely to prolong length of commitment for involuntary treatment. CP at 16. In the doctor's view, involuntary medication was justified simply by the fact that alternative measures would take longer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 72 Discharging this patient sooner rather than later would certainly save the State time and money. Transforming B.M. into a more placid and compliant man would certainly save the State the time and trouble of trying to help a difficult patient through means that did not risk the impoverishment of his mental life. These bureaucratic goals, however, lie far from the interest recognized in\n   <em>\n    Schuoler\n   </em>\n   -preventing the permanent warehousing of a \"helpless creature\" beyond hope of recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 73 Soon after his admission, the State petitioned for involuntary medication without giving B.M. more time to change his mind about antipsychotics, without waiting to observe the longer term course of his illness, without waiting to see if he in fact was in the position of the patient in\n   <em>\n    Schuoler\n   </em>\n   , and without trying alternative treatments. The integrity of the elemental rights at stake, to think, to shape ideas, to communicate them and to choose one's own persona cannot be sacrificed in a rush to judgment to serve the mere administrative interests on which the State relies. Similarly, their sacrifice cannot rest on the conclusory opinion of a doctor that alternative treatments would not work, especially when they have not been fairly tried with the patient. These interests offered by the State are far from compelling enough to brush aside the constitutional guarantees of these fundamental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   2. Aggressive and Goading Behavior\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 74 The State argues that B.M.'s aggressive and goading behavior at Western State Hospital provides a compelling state interest for forcing the administration of antipsychotic drugs. In support, the State points out that\n   <em>\n    Schuoler\n   </em>\n   recognized the protection of the interests of innocent third parties as sufficiently compelling to justify overriding a patient's objection to medical treatment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195555\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/106/500/#p508\">\n    106 Wash.2d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=723%20P.2d%201103\">\n    723 P.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 75 The State's argument, though, overlooks the teaching of\n   <em>\n    Vernonia School District\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   It is a mistake, however, to think that the phrase \"compelling state interest,\" in the Fourth Amendment context, describes a fixed, minimum quantum of governmental concern, so that one can dispose of a case by answering in isolation the question: Is there a compelling state interest here? Rather, the phrase describes an interest that appears\n   <em>\n    important enough\n   </em>\n   to justify the particular search at hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564392\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/646/#p661\">\n    515 U.S. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564392\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/646/#p661\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although not involving a search, the circumstances here demand the same conclusion: whether an interest is compelling does not turn on abstractions from other decisions, but rather on whether the State's reasons are sufficiently important to override the constitutional interests they would forfeit. This is also the requirement of RCW 71.05.217(7)(a), discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 76 The record shows that B.M. had been very verbally aggressive towards staff members and patients and had tried to goad some patients to fight. The protection of the staff and other patients from physical harm is undoubtedly a compelling interest in general. As shown, though, the question before us is not whether protection of innocent third parties is compelling in the abstract, but whether the level of risk from B.M.'s behavior is compelling enough to justify the intrusion\n   into the fundamental constitutional rights at stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 71.05.217(7)(a) and\n   <em>\n    Vernonia School Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564392\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/646/#p661\">\n    515 U.S. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564392\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/646/#p661\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 77 For a number of reasons, the State has not made that showing. First, in neither the petition for involuntary treatment nor in the court order directing such treatment was the box checked denoting that B.M. had recently threatened, attempted or caused serious harm to self or\n   others. CP at 20. Instead, the petition simply alleged that B.M.'s delusions might cause him to act aggressively or violently in the future. CP at 15. Second, the record does not show that the State attempted other methods of protecting the staff and patients, such as the alternatives discussed above or other measures. Third, the threatening incidents at the hospital all occurred after the petition to administer antipsychotic drugs was filed. Thus, at the time of filing there was no evidence of aggressive or goading behavior by B.M. at the hospital, raising the possibility that his aggressive behavior was largely the result of the petition itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 78 Neither the aggressive behavior by B.M. in the hospital nor the possibility of aggressive behavior in the future can justify forcing B.M. to take medications that are aimed at transforming his personality, not to mention risking impairment of his thoughts, his ability to understand, his ability to express himself, and his ability to choose. The proffered state interest is not sufficiently compelling to justify these trespasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 79 Attending to psychiatric patients is critical work, often as dangerous as it is important. The beneficiaries of that service, the people of the state, owe to the staff and patients the funding and staffing levels needed to protect them. The constitution, however, does not allow the State to make up for inadequate funding and staffing by medically altering troublesome patients into more docile or compliant individuals against their will.
