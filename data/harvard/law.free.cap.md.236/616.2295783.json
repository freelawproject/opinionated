We find no error. The police were admitted to the apartment by the tenant who had complained to the police that a non-paying guest and her invitees were using narcotics therein. The entry was authorized. Cf. <em>McCray v. State, </em>236 Md. 9, and <em>Bellam v. State, </em>233 Md. 368. Upon entry, narcotics paraphernalia were in plain view. This justified a search of the persons present and an inspection of their arms. Cf. <em>Cannon v. State, 235 </em>Md. 133. Kenard\u2019s oral admission came in without objection, and the objection to his written admission was not on the ground that it was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
