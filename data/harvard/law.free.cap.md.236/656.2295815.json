He further contends that the court was erroneously informed that his last conviction had been for burglary. In fact, the conviction was for breaking into a shop and stealing goods worth $5.00 or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>under Code (1964 Supp.), Art. 27, sec. 33, creating a penitentiary misdemeanor. The error, if it can be deemed an error, was quite immaterial and not prejudicial, since the crime for which he was convicted met the prerequisites of the statute. Code (1957), Art. 31 B, sec. 6(a)(2). He also had a long record of prior convictions. See <em>Gee v. Director, </em>231 Md. 610, 611. His contention that he should have been convicted of \u201cpetty larceny\u201d is beside the point. See <em>Hammond v. Director, </em>229 Md. 643, 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
