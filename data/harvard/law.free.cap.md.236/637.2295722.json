We do not agree. There was evidence to support the verdict. Cf. <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464. The major contention seems to be that court-appointed counsel at the trial was incompetent, relying upon <em>Smallwood v. Warden, </em>205 F. Supp. 325. That case is readily distinguishable on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The election of the accused to take the stand, as he did, and to admit the intercourse and penetration, made it a matter of trial tactics whether to object to leading questions or to call a certain witness. Cf. <em>Greene v. State, </em>233 Md. 274. The criminal record of the appellant could not have been kept out after he took the stand. Likewise, a stipulation as to the place where the alleged act of intercourse took place, was a matter of trial tactics. We find nothing to show that the representation was so inadequate as to make the trial a farce. That, of course, is the test. See <em>Stevens v. State, </em>230 Md. 47, 49, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
