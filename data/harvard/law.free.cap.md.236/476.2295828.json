Marbury, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">This is an appeal from a judgment against the appellant for costs after the Baltimore City Court affirmed the action of the Taxicab Bureau of the Police Department of Baltimore City (Bureau), which refused to issue a taxicab operator\u2019s license to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">The issues involved are not so clearly defined and set forth in the briefs as might be desired: in fact, we find it difficult, on the record presented to us, to state them with clarity and precision. Judge Joseph Carter noted in his opinion dismissing, as premature, an attempted earlier appeal by the same appellant from a refusal to grant him a license that \u201cthe status of the record in this case is somewhat confusing.\u201d The State, in its brief in this appeal, adds: \u201cUnfortunately, the argumentative \u2018statement of facts\u2019 * * * [in] the appellant\u2019s brief does little to clarify this confusion.\u201d After a careful reading and rereading of the record extract and briefs, we are constrained to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The present appeal represents the fifth attempt by the appellant to have the Bureau issue a license to him; all of which were denied. At least two of the previous denials were appealed to the Baltimore City courts; one of the appeals was dismissed; the other affirmed the Bureau\u2019s action. No previous appeal was taken from the rulings of the Baltimore City courts to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The heart of appellant\u2019s contentions is that he has been refused a license because he believes in Socialism; therefore he was denied rights guaranteed to him under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. The record completely fails to sustain this contention. Nowhere in either the lower court\u2019s opinion or that of the Bureau is there any mention of appellant\u2019s being a Socialist and it is not assigned as a reason for denying the license. (On the contrary, the Supervisor of the Bureau explicitly stated that petitioner\u2019s beliefs, or his distribution of literature, had nothing to do with the refusal to grant a license.) The only reference to that fact in the record (other than in a written statement made by appellant\u2019s counsel) is contained in a report from a police captain to the Chief Inspector back in 1959 concerning appellant\u2019s arrest for, and conviction of, disorderly conduct at that time. The report states that certain police officers, when approaching the main entrance to the campus of City College, saw some 300 to 400 students there gathered. The crowd extended into the street and completely blocked traffic. The \u201cyouths\u201d were screaming and threatening bodily harm to the appellant, who was in the center of the crowd. The police asked, \u201cWhat is all this trouble about?\u201d The appellant replied that he was giving out \u201csocialist material and selling our socialist paper.\u201d The report states that appellant was not arrested for distributing the literature but \u201cfor acting disorderly by cursing and using loud and abusive language,\u201d and this was the offense of which he was convicted. We shall not pursue this contention further, but proceed to consider whether the trial court erred in any other manner in sustaining the refusal to grant the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The parties are in dispute as to the law governing this appeal. Section 216 of the Charter &amp; P.L.L. of Baltimore City (1949) provides that appeals from the action of the Bureau are to be made in the same manner as appeals from the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (see Code [1957], Article 66)4 \u00a7 109). However, this Court held in <em>Green v. Baltimore, </em>181 Md. 372, that the Police Department of Baltimore City is a State agency. Code (1957), Article 41, \u00a7 244, states that the Administrative Procedure Act (sections 244 <em>et seq.) </em>shall apply to all State agencies except those expressly excluded there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>from; and Section 3 of Ch. 94 of the Acts of 1957, which enacted the Administrative Procedure Act, provides that \u201c* * * all Acts or parts of Acts which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency * * Consequently, we hold that Code (1957), Article 41, \u00a7 256 is the law governing this appeal. In <em>Bernstein v. Real Estate Comm. of Md., </em>221 Md. 221, we noted that the Administrative Procedure Act may have broadened to some extent the scope of judicial review of the findings, inferences, conclusions and decisions of administrative agencies, but it has not altered the basic concept that a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the expertise of the persons who constitute the agency from which the appeal is taken. Compare <em>State Bd. of Reg. v. Ruth, </em>223 Md. 428 and <em>Duncan v. McNitt Coal Co., </em>212 Md. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We, again, comment on the record extract presented to us. The opinions of the trial judges in the two previous appeals to the Baltimore City courts are contained therein, as well as the trial court\u2019s opinion in the present appeal. Appellant, in his brief, jumps back and forth from one to the other with such celerity that it is difficult to pin-point exactly what his contentions are, when limited to those that properly can be raised in the present appeal. We do not deem the reasons assigned by the trial judge in the two previous appeals to the Baltimore City courts to be pertinent to the issues involved in this appeal. We shall confine ourselves to the issues of this appeal and determine whether the Supervisor acted arbitrarily or unlawfully in denying the license, and whether the trial court was justified in affirming such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Charter &amp; P.L.L. of Baltimore City (1949), \u00a7\u00a7 204 <em>et seq., </em>in pertinent part, provide :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Sec. 205:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201cEach applicant * * * must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u201c* * * (b) Be of sound physique, with good eyesight and not subject to epilepsy, veritgo, heart trouble, or <em>any other infirmity of body or mind </em>which might render the applicant unfit for the safe operation of a taxicab.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Sec. 209:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cUpon satisfactory fulfillment of the requirements of this sub-title, there shall be issued to the applicant a license, * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">And, Sec. 216:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cThe Supervisor of the Taxicab Bureau is hereby <em>vested with discretion </em>to refuse a license to any applicant if, in his opinion, said license should not be granted because of the applicant\u2019s past <em>criminal rec</em>ordaccident record, or for any other reason deemed sufficient by him. * * (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Appellant does not attack the validity of the above sections, but argues that the authority given by them can only be exercised to protect the public health, safety, welfare, or morals, citing <em>Niemotko v. Maryland, </em>340 U. S. 268 and <em>Portsmouth Stove &amp; Range Co. v. Baltimore, </em>156 Md. 244. With this proposition, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The decision of the Supervisor, in part follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cIn the matter of your application filed July 9, 1962, for a taxicab driver\u2019s license, you are advised that we have received from Dr. Guttmacher his impression concerning you which I have reviewed and which is essentially negative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201cI have given careful consideration to your application, both in light of your history and of Dr. Guttmacher\u2019s report, and I am of the opinion that it would not be in the best interest of the public to grant you a taxicab driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201cIn my opinion, in light of your record before me, you have shown a marked animosity toward law and order. Within a comparatively short time you were twice [actually thrice] arrested and convicted for disorderly conduct on a public street. This conduct on each occasion resulted in the gathering of large crowds of young students and required dispersal by the police, while your cooperation with the police in abating the disorder was definitely lacking. Several of these arrests occurred while you were seeking to become a licensed taxicab driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cIn view of the foregoing, I do not consider you a fit and proper person to be permitted to drive a taxicab in Baltimore City and therefore herewith deny your application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">It will be noted that the Supervisor based his refusal on the applicant\u2019s history, Dr. Guttmacher\u2019s impression (which was \u201cessentially negative\u201d), the marked animosity of the applicant towards law and order, his lack of cooperation with the police in abating the disorders created by him, and his convictions of crime. The Supervisor gave additional reasons, but we shall not set them forth or consider them, for we think the ones we have named were sufficient to warrant his action here challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We shall not attempt to state the history in great detail. The record shows that applicant had previously had psychiatric treatment; that he had been convicted of disorderly conduct to the disturbance of the public peace on three separate occasions; on at least two of these occasions large crowds of students had gathered; on one such occasion, applicant was requested by the police Sergeant to move on for \u201cthe sake of his [applicant\u2019s] own safety,\u201d and was answered by, \u201cwhat is your God-dam name and your God-dam badge number ?\u201d; on another such occasion applicant refused to obey a police command; that applicant had made a false statement relative to his employment; and that applicant had \u201cvery definite difficulty with employment * * having been found \u201cunsatisfactory by the School Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">With the background of previous psychiatric treatment, disobedience to the law, and difficulty with employment, there came a time when the Supervisor, having in mind the provisions of Section 205 (b), above, asked that the applicant submit to a psychiatric examination by Dr. Guttmacher, a well-known psychiatrist and Chief Medical Officer of the Supreme Bench. This course had been followed before, and the Supervisor saw no reason to treat applicant\u2019s case \u201cany differently.\u201d This was agreed to and an examination was arranged for by appointment, but applicant failed to keep the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Later, it was agreed between the Supervisor and the applicant that the Supervisor, in making his ruling upon applicant\u2019s request, would be satisfied if he were furnished with a copy of the impressions and conclusions of the psychiatrist rather than the full details of his examination, which, in the eyes of the applicant, would be \u201csnooping into [his] personal, political and private life and should be of no interest to this office [the Bureau\u2019s] and it is being used only to embarrass and harrass me.\u201d An examination was made by Dr. Guttmacher, and his impression forwarded to the Supervisor. This is the \u201cimpression\u201d referred to in the Supervisor\u2019s decision, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Applicant seems to take the position that because Dr. Guttmacher\u2019s impression was described by the Supervisor as being \u201cessentially negative,\u201d he, immediately, became entitled to a license, and its denial to him constituted arbitrary conduct on the part of the Supervisor, an abuse of the discretion vested in the Supervisor by Section 216, and a violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional right. With this, we are unable to agree. The action of the Supervisor must be considered in the light of the overall picture as we have narrated it above, with Dr. Guttmacher\u2019s impression being but one factor. The Supervisor said he had \u201cgiven careful consideration to [appellant\u2019s] application, both in the light of your history and of Dr. Guttmacher\u2019s report * * We do not have the advantage of the contents of this report. According to the trial court\u2019s opinion, this is because, \u201cthe petitioner, through his counsel, refused to testify at this hearing and refused to submit to the court for its consideration the report of Dr. Manfred S. Guttmacher<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * After a careful consideration of all of the factors involved, we are unable to find any abuse of discretion by the Supervisor, or any denial of applicant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We think the last statement should be supported by a few pertinent authorities. Taxicab companies in Maryland are common carriers. Code (1957), Article 78, \u00a7 2 (d). Within constitutional limitations, local authorities may be authorized to regulate taxicabs. Code (1957), Article <em>66y2 </em>\u00a7 1; <em>Vet. Taxi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>192 Md. 551. This includes the right to license their operators in order to protect the public health, welfare, morals, and safety. Cf. <em>Public Service Comm. v. Sun Cab Co., </em>160 Md. 476. Baltimore City has been granted, by the Legislature, broad authority in matters relating to police powers. Charter &amp; P.L.L. of Baltimore City (1949), \u00a7 24. An occupation, under proper circumstances, may be licensed without violating due process, cf. <em>Leonard v. Earle, </em>155 Md. 252, aff., 279 U. S. 392, but, of course, no burdensome conditions, which have no real and substantial relation to the public welfare, may be placed upon a common calling. <em>Dasch v. Jackson, </em>170 Md. 251. Statutes may require (still under proper circumstances) applicants for licenses to have certain personal qualifications, compare <em>State v. Rice, </em>115 Md. 317; 53 C.J.S., <em>Licenses, </em>\u00a7 34 and they may vest a reasonable discretion in an officer to grant or refuse a license, 53 C.J.S., <em>Licenses, </em>\u00a7 38, which of course, should not be arbitrarily exercised. <em>Gonzales v. Ghinger, </em>218 Md. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Without unduly prolonging this opinion by setting forth all of the criteria of Section 255 (g) relative to review by the Courts of action of administrative agencies and showing that the trial court\u2019s action is supportable under each of them, it is sufficient, we think, to say that we have applied each of said criteria to the trial court\u2019s action, and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Marbury, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel claims the trial judge was mistaken when he included this in his opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
