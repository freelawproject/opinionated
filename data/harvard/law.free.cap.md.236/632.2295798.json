We find no merit in any of these contentions. McCoy never requested a lawyer at the time of his interrogation, and this distinguishes <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478. Cf. <em>Sturgis v. State, </em>235 Md. 343, 346, and <em>Parker v. Warden, </em>236 Md. 236, 203 A. 2d 418. His claim of coercion and beating by the officers was denied. Cf. <em>Williams v. State, </em>236 Md. 609, 203 A. 2d 268. There was proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>in both cases. In addition, McCoy was identified by the robbery victim and implicated by his codefendant in both crimes. Cf. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>235 Md. 210. Pawn tickets for the stolen goods were found in the possession of the accused. Of course, there is no appeal from a denial of a new trial, absent abuse of discretion and we find none. As we have often remarked, the problem of the recanting witness is not new. It clearly cannot be resolved in this appeal. <em>Sturgis v.
