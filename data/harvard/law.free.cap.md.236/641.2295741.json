On the first point, it is true that the report of the applicant\u2019s independent psychiatrist, Dr. Lerner, who had found him to be a defective delinquent at the first determination, suggested that he might be \u201con the verge of breaking down into a frank psychosis\u201d, and \u201cfurther evaluation\u201d would be necessary, after treatment with tranquilizers and anti-depressants. Dr. Boslow again found him to be a defective delinquent (as did the staff), although noting that he was not responding to treatment. We think the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding. Cf. <em>Wheatfall v. Director, </em>236 Md. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The second contention is denied by Chief Judge Manley, who states, in a letter included in the record, that no such conference took place, and this has been confirmed by then counsel for the applicant. It seems that the hearing was adjourned to permit the Chief Judge to attend the ceremony of swearing in new attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
