We find no merit in any of these contentions. The State met its burden of proving voluntariness, and there was independent proof, through circumstantial evidence, of the <em>corpus delicti. </em>See <em>Veney v. State, </em>225 Md. 237. We distinguish <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>on the ground that neither Henn nor Johnson requested counsel or were denied an opportunity to consult counsel prior to their brief interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Johnson\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a preliminary hearing is without merit. See <em>Shorey v. State, 227 </em>Md. 385. The fact that counsel had not been appointed at the first arraignment is immaterial. No plea was taken, and there was a subsequent arraignment at a later date after the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
