The reason assigned was that he was suffering from asthma at the time and did not intelligently waive his right to counsel, in connection with his plea of guilty. We find no merit in the contention. Upon the facts found by Judge Carter in the court below, the application for leave to appeal must be denied. Cf. <em>Hoskins v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 613, 200 A. 2d 688, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
