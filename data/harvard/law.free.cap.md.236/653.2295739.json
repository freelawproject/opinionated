The chief contention is as to the sufficiency of the evidence. The transcript shows that Dr. Boslow, the only medical witness (although the applicant took the stand), in response to questions by Chief Judge Manley, testified that the applicant was not psychotic, not emotionally unbalanced, and not intellectually deficient, having an \u00cd.Q. of 90. He nevertheless expressed the opinion that the applicant came within the definition of a defective delinquent \u201con the basis of persistent aggravated antisocial and criminal conduct and marked emotional instability.\u201d It is true, as the applicant\u2019s counsel points out, that the definition in Code (1964 Supp.), Art. 31 B, sec. 5, requires that in addition to \u201cpersistent aggravated antisocial or criminal behavior\u201d, the person charged must have \u201ceither such intellectual deficiency or emotional unbalance, or both\u201d as to clearly demonstrate a danger to society. Obviously, mere criminal activity will not support a commitment to Patuxent. But in the context we think the \u201cmarked emotional instability\u201d found by Dr. Boslow is sufficiently equated to \u201cemotional unbalance\u201d, and the later statement can be fairly said to correct the earlier one. In any event, we find in the record evidence, in the staff report read into the record, and in the report of Dr. Eerner, who examined the applicant at his request, to support the finding of Chief Judge Manley. These reports unequivocally ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>pressed the opinion that the applicant met the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
