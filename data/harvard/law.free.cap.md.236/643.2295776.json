State, </em>209 Md. 504; <em>Gee v. Director, </em>231 Md. 610; <em>Porter v. Director, </em>232 Md. 639, and <em>Pierson v. Director, </em>235 Md. 654. The crimes for which he was sentenced were enough to bring him within the provisions of sub-sections 1 and 5 of section 6(a) of Article 31B, and we think the report of Patuxent supports the finding of defective delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
