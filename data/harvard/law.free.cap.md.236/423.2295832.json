Warden, </em>221 Md. 604,\u201d and \u201cthe legality of an arrest, likewise, cannot be raised under the Act in <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>223 Md. 638.\u201d These cases were decided in 1959 and 1960, respectively; and it is true that we held therein in accordance with the statement of the trial judge. However, more recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, which are controlling on federal constitutional questions, have required this Court and the Courts of many of our sister States to modify, and to make changes in, some of the previous holdings, which, until the recent decisions of the Supreme Court were considered as settled law. <em>Adair v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 653. The Attorney General\u2019s office concedes that the above quoted portion of the trial judge\u2019s memorandum is no longer an accurate exposition of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In addition, the trial judge did not pass upon the other questions raised in the petiton. Maryland Rule BK45 b; <em>Ellinger v. Warden, </em>221 Md. 628. Apparently no testimony was offered at the hearing relative to certain of the contentions made, and this probably accounts for the court\u2019s failure to rule thereon; however, this does not affirmatively appear from the record. If this were the case, it would have been a simple matter to have so stated in the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">We must therefore grant the application for leave to appeal and remand the case, so that the trial judge may pass upon all of the contentions made.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\n<em>Application for leave to appeal granted, md case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
