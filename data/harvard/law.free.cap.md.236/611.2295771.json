It was noted in the latter case that a claim of incompetency of counsel was abandoned in that proceeding, and that a claim of deprivation of a right to call a certain witness was finally adjudicated in the former proceeding. The contention based on an alleged illegal search was fully and correctly answered in the opinion of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
