We find the evidence sufficient. Although the victim\u2019s identification was open to some question, because of an apparent failure to identify on one occasion, there was an unshaken identification by an eyewitness to the crime. The cases make it clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>that the State was not confined in its proof to the date alleged in the indictment. <em>Fulton v.
