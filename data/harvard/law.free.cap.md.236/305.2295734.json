C. on August 31, 1962, at about 8.30 A.M. Construction was under way in the area, and at the trial an important question of fact on the issue of contributory negligence was whether, at the time of the accident, a sign was posted by the District Department of Highways and Traffic bearing the instruction \u201cPedestrians use West Sidewalk.\u201d The appellant, Mrs. Smith, crossed the intersection on the east crosswalk and was hit by a truck owned by the appellee. She did not remember seeing any sign directing the use of the west sidewalk, although a witness called by the appellee, after some uncertainty, testified to its presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">The paper here involved, the letter of Mr. Parl\u00f3n, dated September 10, 1962, was procured by one of the appellee\u2019s attorneys on the morning of the trial. Objection to its introduction was duly made and overruled. The letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201cGOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAYS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">Electrical Division</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACO\">Washington 1, D. C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">September 10, 1963</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">This is to certify that I, Mr. Joseph P. Parl\u00f3n in my official capacity of General Foreman District of Columbia Sign Shop has charge of and custody of the records, daily work sheets, memoranda and similar records that indicate that various locations of controlling traffic and street signs and the dates during which the signs are operative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">On the basis of these records I can state that as of August 8th 1962 through June 1963 there were posted at the Northeast and Southeast corners of the intersection of 19th and E. Streets, N.W. two official traffic signs bearing the instructions \u2018Pedestrians use West Crosswalk\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">Attached hereto is a diagram which indicates the exact locations of the above mentioned signs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">I hereby affix my personal signature having read the above and found it to be accurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">/s/ Joseph P. Parl\u00f3n General Foreman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-14\">Witnessed by /s/ Melvin B. Sansbury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVL\">Witnessed by /s/ John A. Oliphant\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">Attached to Mr. Parlon\u2019s letter was a copy of a diagram of the intersection. On the face of the diagram there is an order from the Department of Highways and Traffic to the Traffic and Electrical Services Division, Traffic Services Section, to paint the crosswalks and install \u201cPedestrians Use West Crosswalk\u201d signs at the \u201cN. E.\u201d and \u201cS. E.\u201d corners. The date of the request is given as \u201c8-3-62\u201d. Stamped on the diagram are the words \u201cReceived Traffic Section, Aug. 7, 1962\u201d. At the bottom of the diagram there is a space entitled \u201cDate Completed\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Over these printed words there is written in ink \u201c8-8-62 Signs\u201d. Below that space there is written, in pencil, evidently in another hand, \u201c8/31/62\u201d, with initials.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">After the appellants\u2019 objection had been overruled, the letter and the attached diagram were read to the jury. In his instructions to the jury on contributory negligence, the trial court told them that, if they found the sign was present at the time of the accident, they would have to decide if Mrs. Smith had been negligent. In this connection, the court referred to the \u201creport as introduced here as an exhibit\u201d. After a verdict had been given for the appellee, a motion for a new trial was made on the basis of the admission of the evidence in question, and overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Section 40, Article 35, Code (1957), relied upon by the appellee, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">\u201cThe copy of the record or register of any deed or other instrument of writing which the laws of the state or country where the same may be executed require to be recorded or registered and which has been recorded agreeably to such laws, under the hand of the keeper of such record or register and the seal of the court or office in which such record or register has been made, or a copy of any deed or other instrument of writing lodged for safekeeping in any office or court agreeably to the laws of the state or country as aforesaid and certified as aforesaid shall be good and sufficient evidence in any court of this State to prove such deed or instrument of writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In the appellants\u2019 brief, it is contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that neither the paper nor the diagram had any official seal of the office in which the records were kept (there is a printed seal of the District of Columbia on the letterhead of Mr. Parlon\u2019s letter of September 10th) and that they were not properly certified at the trial by any authorized official of the District of Columbia. In the argument, however, these points were abandoned. The only contention of the appellants before us is that Mr. Parlon\u2019s letter of September 10th was improperly admitted and was prejudicial. Under these circumstances, we confine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>our consideration of the case to the admissibility of the letter. See <em>Howard County v. Leaf, </em>177 Md. 82, 85, 8 A. 2d 756, 757 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The appellants conceded in argument that the diagram would have been admissible by itself. There is an ambiguity in the diagram as to the date of completion of the erection of the signs. If the later date of August 31, the date of the accident, is correct, the diagram does not show the time of completion. The accident took place at about 8:30 A.M. If only the diagram had been admitted, any ambiguities it contained would have been questions for the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Capitol Traction Co. v. McKeon, </em>132 Md. 79, 86, 103 Atl. 314, 316 (1918). The question before us, however, goes to the admissibility of the letter to which this diagram was attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Mr. Parl\u00f3n is the general foreman of the sign shop. His letter stated in response to the inquiry put to him that on the basis of the records, daily work sheets, memoranda and similar records in his charge \u201cI can state that as of August 8, 1962 through June 1963\u201d the traffic signs in question were posted. The only record, work sheet or memorandum attached to the letter is the diagram, which, Mr. Parl\u00f3n states, \u201cindicates the exact locations\u201d of the signs. It is evident that Mr. Parl\u00f3n, in reaching the conclusion set forth in his letter, was relying on departmental data in addition to the diagram.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Conclusions or opinions as to the meaning or effect of data contained in a file may, under certain circumstances, be admissible under the Maryland law. Exceptions have been made to the rule against hearsay by legislative or judicial determination in some situations where the reliability of record keeping has been deemed a satisfactory substitute for the testing of assertions of witnesses on the stand by cross-examination. Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1420, 1522 (3ded. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Section 59, Article 35, Code (1957), as construed by this Court, permits introduction of business records even though hearsay in nature, when the entry meets the tests of \u201cnecessity and circumstantial guaranty of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Morrow v. State, </em>190 Md. 559, 59 A. 2d 325 (1948). Summaries or compilations made from such records may be admissible, when a proper foundation has been laid by a qualified witness on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>stand. <em>O\u2019Donnell v. State, </em>188 Md. 693, 53 A. 2d 688 (1947); <em>Laporte Corporation v. Cement Corp., </em>164 Md. 642, 648, 165 Atl. 195 (1933). In the present case, had Mr. Parlon been called to the stand and qualified, after the records of his department had been put into evidence, he could have testified as to his conclusion therefrom. Such testimony, of course, would have been subject to cross-examination as to the correct date of the erection of the signs; what inspection, if any, was made between August 8th and the date of- the accident to see if they were in place; and any other relevant matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">If an opinion or summary is part of the official records, it may be admissible. A written opinion of a doctor, if properly authenticated, may be admissible as part of a hospital record. Compare <em>Watts v. State, </em>223 Md. 268, 164 A. 2d 334 (1960), with <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. v. Zapf, </em>192 Md. 403, 64 A. 2d 139 (1948), and <em>Reed v. Order of United Commercial Travelers, </em>123 F. 2d 252, 253 (2d Cir. 1941), with <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>147 F. 2d 297, 301, 79 U. S. App. D. C. <em>66 </em>(1945). See Powell, <em>Admissibility of Hospital Records Into Evidence, </em>21 Md. L. Rev. 22 (1961); 54 Yale L. J. 868 (1945); 94 U. Pa. L. Rev. 112 (1945). In this case, Mr. Par-Ion\u2019s letter was not a part of the official records, but was only ,given in response to an inquiry as to what the records showed. It was a conclusion based in part on unspecified data, and not \u2022a public record or document. Cf. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 635; McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 291 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">By the express terms of a statute, an officer may be authorized or directed to summarize the contents of a file. For example, Section 27, Article 19, Code (1957), provides that when\u25a0ever the Comptroller shall compromise or settle any claim of the State without payment in full, \u201che shall make and keep \u2022 among the records of his office a statement of the evidence or facts upon which such settlement was made.\u201d Section 40, Article 35, relied upon by the appellee, contains no such provision by express terms or implication; it is limited to the admissibility in evidence of a \u201ccopy of the record or register of \u2022any deed or other instrument of writing which the laws of the state or country where the same may be executed require to \u2022be recorded or registered and which has been recorded agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ably to such laws * * * or a copy of any deed or other instrument of writing lodged for safekeeping in any office or court agreeably to the laws of the sate or country * *</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">At common law, no general authority was recognized for officers to give on demand a certificate as to past official happenings. Comm<em>onwealth v. Richardson, </em>142 Mass. 74, 7 N.E. 26 (1886); McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 292; Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1674. \u201cAn officer authorized to certify a copy cannot at common law certify merely the effect of the record.\u201d Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1674. \u201cAs to matters which the officer is not authorized by law to attest, his certificate is extra-official, can have no higher weight than that of a private citizen, and is therefore inadequate to make the proof required.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Richardson, supra. </em>See <em>De Riesthal v. Walton, </em>66 Md. 470, 8 Atl. 462 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\"><em>United Surety Co. v. Summers, </em>110 Md. 95, 72 Atl. 775 (1909), was an action upon a bond to secure the faithful performance of an agreement for the furnishing and erection of concrete work for a building under course of construction. The surety company excepted to the lower court\u2019s refusal to admit in evidence a report made by Mr. Keyser, an engineer, of an inspection made by him of the building. The report was offered without authentication. On appeal, this Court upheld the ruling of the trial court. In delivering the Court\u2019s opinion, Pearce, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201cIn <em>St. Louis Loan Co. v. Yantis, </em>173 Ill. 321, where a printed statement of the number of shares of instalment stock issued was offered in evidence, the Court said: \u2018In no way authenticated, we are aware of no rule of evidence that would justify its consideration by the Court.\u2019 Moreover, that paper was nothing more than what Mr. Keyser <em>said </em>upon the subject. It was an unsworn statement, and no more admissible than his oral statement to the same effect. Even if supported by a mere voluntary affidavit, it would not have been raised above the grade of hearsay. <em>Patterson v. Md. Ins. Co., </em>3 H. &amp; J. 71. There was no error in this ruling.\u201d 110 Md. at 110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Mr. Parlon\u2019s letter was not admissible in evidence under Section 40 of Article 35 or under any other relevant statute, or at common law. It was unauthorized, unsworn hearsay testimony. See <em>Schaefer v. Publix Parking, </em>226 Md. 150, 153, 154, 172 A. 2d 508 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">While there was testimony of an eye-witness that the sign in question was present at the time of the accident, the witness at first was uncertain. The injured appellant, Mrs. Smith, testified she saw no such sign. Mr. Parlon\u2019s letter stating that the sign was there at the time of the accident was read to the jury as an official document. The trial court instructed the jury that the issue of contributory negligence turned on whether or not the sign was present, and referred to \u201cthe report as introduced here as an exhibit\u201d. The error in admitting the letter, under the circumstances, was prejudicial. See <em>Houlihan v. McCall, </em>197 Md. 130, 78 A. 2d 661 (1950) ; <em>Heil v. Zahn, </em>187 Md. 603, 609, 51 A. 2d 174 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial; costs of this appeal to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
