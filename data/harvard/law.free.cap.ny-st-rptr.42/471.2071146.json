Campbell Phelan, Manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">It is always the duty of the plaintiff claiming to have a contract with the defendant made through an agent to inform himself whether the agent had the power to make the contract relied upon. In this case the testimony left that question in doubt, so that it was within the province of the court to determine whether there was such an agency or not. We do-not think the evidence warrants us in disturbing its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">But it further appears that the defendant and his manager received a statement of plaintiff\u2019s claim, which indicated that he thought a contract had been made with defendant. Under such circumstances, it was his duty to immediately notify the plaintiff to discontinue the advertisement. Instead of this, it was allowed to appear in two subsequent numbers of the plaintiff\u2019s periodical, and the justice very properly rendered judgment for those two insertions, and the judgment will, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">Bookstaver and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
