This was verified in the following language : \u201cJohn Foley, sworn, says that he is the defendant herein, and that he knows the foregoing answer to be true.\u201d This the court below held to be an insufficient verification. It has been repeatedly held that where there is nothing to indicate the affiant intends to swear that the contents of a pleading is true to his ,own knowledge, where the allegations are apparently made upon knowledge, that it is insufficient. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Riel, </em>11 How., 374; 5 Duer, 601; <em>Tibballs </em>v. <em>Selfridge, </em>12 How., 64; <em>Van Horne </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>5 id., 238; <em>Sexaner </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>3 Daly, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The case that comes nearest to holding a verification similar to the one under consideration good is <em>The matter of the Application, etc., of Macaulay, </em>94 N. Y., 574. In that case the affiant declared that \u201cshe knows the contents (of the petition) and that the same are. true; \u201d but in this case the affiant is very far from affirming that. He merely says that he knows the answer is true. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u25a0do not think he could be convicted of perjury upon such an .affidavit, and that the justice was therefore justified in treating it .as a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">The final order should be affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Bookstaver and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
