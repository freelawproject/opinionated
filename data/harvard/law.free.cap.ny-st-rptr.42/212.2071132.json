To neither of these rulings was any exception taken, so that they present no question for consideration here. After this, defendant asked for an allowance, which was granted; and then plaintiff took an exception to the dismissal of the complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The plaintiff was at liberty to combine both an action for false imprisonment and one for malicious prosecution in the same complaint, see <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>97 N. Y., 590; also <em>Castro </em>v. Uriarte, 2 Civ. Pro., 210; but as he particularly stated that his action was for false imprisonment, solely, we must consider the case from that standpoint alone. See <em>Von Latham </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>38 Barb., 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">It is well settled that the material allegations in a complaint in an action for false imprisonment, as distinguished from one for malicious prosecution, are that defendant had plaintiff imprisoned, and.that the process was unlawful, <em>i. e., </em>without authority of law. See <em>Ackroyd </em>v. <em>Ackroyd, </em>3 Daly, 38; also, <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Uriarte, </em>2 Civ. Pro., 214; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>97 N. Y., 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The action cannot be maintained where the process was regular, and the arrest under it lawful. See <em>Nebenzahl </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>61 How. Pr., 353; <em>Landt </em>v. <em>Hilts, </em>19 Barb., 283; <em>Sleight </em>v. <em>Ogle, </em>4 E. D. Smith, 445; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>97 N. Y., 596; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Corp, </em>3 Caines, 267; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Crowl, </em>5 Wend., 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">There is no claim made in the complaint that the arrest was unlawful, or the process irregular-.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>As far as the complaint shows, the imprisonment was lawfully effected. The allegation of malice does not help the plaintiff; for even if the defendant were moved by malice in causing the arrest, unless the process was irregular and unlawful, an action for false imprisonment, as distinguished from one for malicious prosecution, would not lie. See <em>Sleight </em>v. Ogle, 4 E. D. Smith, 445; also <em>Von Latham </em>v. <em>Libby, 38 </em>Barb., 339; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Chadsey, </em>39 id., 253; <em>Ackroyd </em>v. <em>Ackroyd, </em>3 Daly, 38; <em>Castro </em>v. Uriarte, 2 Civ. Pro., 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">We are of the opinion that the learned trial judge did not err in his ruling that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Me Adam, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
