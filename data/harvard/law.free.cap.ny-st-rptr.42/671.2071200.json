He showed no employment by the seller or her husband. <em>Held, </em>that under such circumstances he had no claim against her for commissions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b721-10\">Appeal from judgment in favor of plaintiff, entered upon verdict directed by the court</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b721-11\"><em>Frederick </em>Hemming, for resp\u2019t; <em>Fellows, Gray &amp; Hartman, </em>for app\u2019lt.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b721-12\">Fitzsimons, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_L\">The plaintiff is a real estate broker, and sues herein for commissions for the sale of certain property of defendant. The trial j ustice directed a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the amount claimed, $540.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">The testimony of the plaintiff shows that he, <em>representing the purchaser </em>of said property as a broker, called upon defendant\u2019s husband, who acted as her agent in this matter, and made several \u25a0offers for the same. The last offer ($26,000) was accepted. Upon this testimony he bases his claim for a recovery. Nowhere in his testimony does it appear that he was ever employed by the defendant, or her husband, to sell the property as <em>defendant's broker. </em>His testimony shows that he was the <em>purchaser's </em>agent or broker.' In such a case no cause of action exists in favor of the broker against the seller for commissions earned. He must first be employed. Then if he complies with the terms of his employment he is entitled to receive pay for his service.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">Besides, as above stated, it appears that the plaintiff represented the buyer, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that, as the buyer\u2019s agent, he procured the property at the lowest obtainable figure; while it was his duty, if he was the seller\u2019s agent, to obtain the highest possible price for the same. It is because of this conflict and clash of interests that the law in cases of this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>character provides that the broker cannot represent both parties, except by their consent, and exacts from him the highest degree of faithfulness and fidelity to the interests of the party he represents. This he cannot very well do if he serves two masters.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-2\">The judgment and order are reversed, with costs to appellant to-abide event of action. New trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\">Van Wyck and McCarthy, <em>JJ., </em>concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
