Action against copartners on a firm liability. Defendant Fusco appeared and answered. Defendant Adam demurred to the complaint for insufficiency in substance, and the demurrer being overruled, judgment was entered against him. Thereupon defendant Fusco applied for leave to serve a supplemental answer pleading this judgment against his co-contractor in bar of the action against him. The motion was denied, and an appeal to the general term was dismissed. Before notice of that appeal the judgment against Adam was vacated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-13\"><em>Louis 0.
