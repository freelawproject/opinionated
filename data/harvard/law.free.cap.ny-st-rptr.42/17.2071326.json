The ground upon which courts proceed in abating a subsequent suit upon the ground of pendency of a former one between the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u2022parties and for the same cause is that the subsequent suit is unnecessary, and, therefore, vexatious. This is not the case here. The suits were in different jurisdictions, one being in the courts of New Jersey. The circumstances seem to have justified both. No .application seems to have been made either to stay the proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction or those pending here. The pleadings are the same as they were on the former trial of this case, which resulted in a direction for the defendant on the theory of election of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">The court of appeals in reversing that judgment (see decision reported in 87 St. Rep., 230; Book XIII, Lawyers\u2019 Reports, p. 91) settled the law of the case, and the trial judge, upon the second trial, acted in harmony with the views expressed by our .appellate tribunal when he directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. It follows that the judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Freedman, Me Ad am and Gtldersleeve, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
