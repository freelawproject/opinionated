Co., to the order of E. Gf. Oppenheim, and duly accepted by the defendant Locey. That before maturity it was delivered to Oppenheim,' and also, before maturity, endorsed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>delivered to plaintiff That it was presented for payment to both defendants on October 8, 1891, and payment refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">The defendant, The Locey Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., demurred to the complaint upon the ground <em>\u201c </em>that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,\u201d which was overruled as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The demurrer admits all the allegations of the complaint; therefore admits that the draft was presented to both defendants, and payment thereof refused <em>by each of them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The presentation to the demurring defendant of the draft for payment, I think, was sufficient notice to it that the defendant Locey had failed to pay the sum. The law only requires that speedy notice of non-payment by the drawer of a draft shall be given to its accept or, sothat his rights may suffer no detriment by unnecessary delay. Such notice the demurrer admits was given in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">I think that the complaint was sufficient and the demurrer properly overruled. The defendant\u2019s plea is purely technical, and should not be encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Van Wyck and McCarthy, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
