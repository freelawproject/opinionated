The respondent was charged specifically with having violated the following disciplinary rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 1230, Appendix F, Maryland Rules of Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">DR 1-102(A)(4), which states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">DR 2-106(A), which states that a lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-14\">DR 7-102(A)(6), which states that in representing a client a lawyer shall not participate in the creation or preservation of evidence when he knows or it is obvious that the evidence is false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">DR 9-102(B)(4), which states that a lawyer shall promptly pay or deliver to the client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer w\u00ediich the client is entitled to receive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Briefly, the respondent is alleged, in December, 1974, to have unjustifiably retained a three hundred dollar fee after he had been discharged by the client. In his Answer, respondent admits depositing \u201cfor collection a retainer check of a prospective client in the amount of three hundred dollars after he should have known, by virtue of communication with the client, that the client had not authorized him to proceed with legal work on her behalf\u201d. He denies, however, in his Answer that he fabricated justification for keeping the three hundred dollars and that he lied under oath to an inquiry panel of the Attorney Grievance Commission, as alleged in the Petition. The Panel heard the testimony of Mrs. Deborah Drudge, a former associate who originally interviewed the client. The Panel also heard the testimony of the respondent. He admitted having been reprimanded in 1973 by the Bar Association of Montgomery County for having charged a client a fee in excess of what had been agreed upon. Copy of the reprimand was admitted in these proceedings as petitioner\u2019s exhibit 2. The Panel also admitted into evidence respondent\u2019s exhibits 3 and 4, which are letters of gratitude from clients who were pleased with services rendered to them by respondent in matters separate from this inquiry. This Panel also heard the testimony of a client of the respondent\u2019s who spoke highly of him. In addition, the respondent called Charles Foster, a practicing attorney in Montgomery County, who testified that he, at the request of respondent, had advised him generally on the handling of client\u2019s funds and on the proper way to conduct his law practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The respondent himself testified he had enrolled as a student in a course titled \u201cProfessional Responsibility\u201d at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The Panel accepted as part of the record a letter from William I. Weston, Assistant Dean and Assistant Professor of Law there. The letter attests to the fact that the respondent was a student and had \u201cattended every class and was an active participant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The Panel finds from a consideration of all the evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">That the respondent did engage in conduct involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation in violation of DR 1-102 (A)(4) in that he accepted a fee of three hundred dollars from a Mrs. Jennifer Staley when he knew or should have known that she had discharged him, and that he performed unneeded and unwanted legal services and charged Mrs. Staley for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">That the respondent did collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee from Mrs. Staley in violation of DR 2-106(A) in that he knew or should have known he was not authorized to represent her, and, therefore, was not entitled to any fee at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">That the respondent did fail and refuse upon demand to pay to the bank where Mrs. Staley kept her checking account the sum of three hundred dollars which the bank had mistakenly charged to Mrs. Staley\u2019s account and paid to respondent after a stop-payment order, and that this conduct on respondent\u2019s part constitutes a violation of DR 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Panel does not feel that the respondent is guilty of violating DR 7-102(A)(6) because, first of all, it appears to us <em>that </em>this Disciplinary Rule was meant to apply only where a lawyer <em>in the course of representing </em>his client engages in the creation or preservation of evidence which is known to be or is obviously false. Patently, the respondent was not representing Mrs. Staley when it is alleged he fabricated justification for keeping her three hundred dollars, because he admits he was not authorized to proceed with legal work on her behalf. On the issue of whether the respondent fabricated justification for keeping Mrs. Staley\u2019s money, the Panel was divided. Judges Miller and Woodward felt there was insufficient evidence to support this allegation of misconduct while Judge Mathias felt there was. The Panel, by a majority holding, therefore recommends that the respondent not be held guilty of the offense of fabricating justification for keeping Mrs. Staley\u2019s three hundred dollars. A guilty finding herein would have been a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The petition also alleges, and respondent denied, that during the course of the disciplinary proceedings he lied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>under oath to the Inquiry Panel \u201cby testifying as to the validity of the work allegedly performed to justify his keeping the . . . three hundred dollars, and particularly when he testified that one Deborah Drudge, at the time a lawyer associate, asked him to research a question concerning jointly held personal property in a domestic matter, which, on November 29, 1974, necessitated his travelling from his office in Bethesda, Maryland, to the law library in Rockville, Maryland, because said Deborah Drudge had an aversion to going to the library\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">With Judges Miller and Woodward voting in favor and Judge Mathias dissenting, the Panel recommends that, because the evidence thereon is insufficient, that the respondent not be found to have lied to the Inquiry Panel, which, if true, would have been a violation covered by DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The Panel has carefully considered all the evidence and in doing so has given some weight to respondent\u2019s apparent remorse for his admitted offenses and his affirmative steps to reinforce his understanding of the responsibilities of his profession by taking a law school course on the subject and by seeking assistance of another attorney on how properly to conduct a law practice. On the other hand we have taken into consideration the fact that, for the respondent, this is the second time he has been charged with unprofessional conduct. In view of all the facts and circumstances, it is the unanimous recommendation of the Panel that the respondent be punished for his misconduct by having his privilege to practice law in this State as a member of the Bar of the Court of Appeals suspended for a period of six (6) months.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Dated: Dec. 28, 1976</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">/s/ Joseph M.
