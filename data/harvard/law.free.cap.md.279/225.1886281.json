Pollack, a member of the Maryland Bar since 1958. On July 6, 1976, The Court of Appeals of Maryland entered an Order pursuant to \u2018Maryland Rule BV 9, <em>et seq. </em>referring the matter for hearing and determination to a three-judge panel of the Eighth Judicial Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland has charged that Herbert L. Pollack, a member of the Maryland Bar since 1958, did violate DR 6-101 (A ) (3) and DR 7-101 (A) (2), Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 1230, Appendix F, Maryland Rules of Procedure, through his neglect of legal matters entrusted to his professional care. There are three allegations of professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-18\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">Failure to secure a divorce and child support for Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Evelyn E. Hicks after receiving a retainer fee of Three Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350.00) in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Failure to secure a divorce for Mr. Fred Matheson after receiving a retainer fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Failure to represent Mrs. Bonnie L. Rouiller as administratrix of her late husband\u2019s estate. Pollack failed to transfer stock certificates, change an automobile title, and to process a small insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">A hearing on these charges was held on September 24, 1976 and October 1, 1976. The finding of facts of the three judge panel follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\n<em>HICKS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">(Mrs. Evelyn Hicks died in the fall of 1975. Counsel stipulated to the following facts:)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In September, 1973, Pollack was retained by Mrs. Evelyn Hicks (Hicks) to handle a domestic case for her. He was paid three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) in advance, and was also to be paid for any cost incurred. On October 23, 1973, he filed on her behalf a Bill of Complaint and a Show Cause Order for permanent alimony. He also appeared at two hearings, outside of the equity courts, with regard to support and arrearages owed Mrs. Hicks by her husband. (T, p. 63).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">A complaint was filed by Hicks with the Bar Association in June, 1974. This complaint formed part of the subject matter of the hearing of February 12, 1975. Subsequent to this hearing her case was transferred, with her permission to Mr. Crawford by Mr. Pollack. Before her death in the fall of 1975 Pollack returned one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00) to her. (T., p. 100). At the time of the panel hearing in October, 1975, she advised the Bar Association that she no longer wanted to pursue the matter. (T., p. 63).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\n<em>MATHESON</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In January of 1974, Mr. Fred Matheson (Matheson) consulted Pollack for the purpose of obtaining a divorce from his wife, Willie Matheson. (T., p. 108). During their preliminary negotiations, Matheson explained to Pollack that his wife had a long history of alcoholism, had been institutionalized several times, and that her last known address was Spring Grove State Hospital. The couple had been separated for approximately eight (8) year's. (T., pp. 30-32). The contract entered into between Matheson and Pollack provided for a five hundred dollar ($500.00) fee to be paid in advance; one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) was paid after the initial meeting, and in March, 1974, Matheson gave Pollack a check for the balance of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00). (T., p. 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">About two or three months after the initial contact with Pollack, Matheson experienced difficulty in contacting him at either his office or his home for a period of several months. (T., p. 7). Matheson subsequently wrote to the Bar Association of Baltimore City (Bar Association) and requested their assistance in ascertaining what action, if any had been taken on his behalf. (P. X 1). In response to his letter, Matheson received a telephone call from the Bar Association and a letter which confirmed the telephone conversation. (T., p. 8). Counsel for the Bar Association advised Matheson to telegram Pollack, which he did, but the telegram could not be delivered. (T., p. 10). Matheson subsequently had several phone conversations with an attorney for the Bar Association and received notice of a preliminary hearing to be held on the subject matter of his complaint. (T., p. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">A hearing was set for February 12, 1975, which Matheson did not attend. (T., p. 13). Subsequent to that hearing Matheson was directed by the Bar Association to contact Mr. James E. Crawford, Esq. (Crawford) and was told that he was to handle the divorce proceeding for Mr. Pollack. (T., p. 15). Matheson spoke with Crawford who thereupon contacted Mr. Pollack. Pollack telephoned Matheson about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>two weeks later. (T., p. 12). Pollack indicated to Matheson that a hearing would be held on his divorce on or before April 15,1975. (T\u201e pp. 19-20).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Matheson had not heard from Pollack by April 15, 1975, and wrote a second letter to the Bar Association. (P. X 2). Subsequent to this letter he was notified that there would be a hearing on his complaint. (T., p. 21). Mr. Pollack contacted Matheson and asked him if he knew that a hearing had been scheduled. He excused the delay through illness, domestic strife, and difficulties in serving Mrs. Matheson. (T., p. 22). A hearing scheduled by the Bar Association on October 15, 1975, was continued at Matheson\u2019s request because he was satisfied with Pollack\u2019s explanations. (T., p. 23). However the hearing was subsequently scheduled on October 28, 1975, which was postponed because Matheson's witness could not appear. A second hearing was set for February 6, 1976, from which the divorce decree issued. On March 5, 1976, the Matheson divorce became final. (T., p. 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">At his appearance before the three judge panel on September 24, 1976, Pollack described a long history of marital difficulties as mitigation. An already poor marital situation grew progressively worse from 1972 - 1974. The summer of 1974 was a period of rapid deterioration. As a result of a violent argument in July of 1974, the couple separated. In December of 1974, Mrs. Pollack took an overdose of sleeping pills and called Mr. Pollack. That evening Mr. Pollack drove to Atlantic City and brought her back to Baltimore. Both he and Mrs. Pollack\u2019s daughter convinced her to consult a psychiatrist because of her depressed state of mind. At this hearing, the following exchange took place. (T., p. 96).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cTHE CHAIRMAN: That is your mental state and condition and relationship with your wife was to the extent that you couldn\u2019t function completely and that is the reason for all three? (three separate complaints)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">MR. POLLACK: I would say that was a contributing factor. If you are talking in regards to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the Matheson case, we had trouble getting service. I had trouble resolving to myself that I could go on publication with a history like Willie Matheson, that is Fred Matheson\u2019s wife, having been in and out of institutions for alcoholism, I was hesitant. I had contacted, yes, I guess it did affect me because it was after one of the hearings, I think, after that I sent registered letters to, registered and regular mail, to three different addresses hoping that some place she would get a letter and it did work out that way because the supervisor from Spring Grove forwarded it to her and she contacted me and I told her she has to get an attorney to file an answer. She wrote a direct letter to the court and the matter was heard before Master Kenney, and resolved.\u201d (T., p. 97).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Later, during his testimony at the hearing, Pollack was asked: (T., p. 106).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">MR. HOWARD: With regard to the Matheson matter, when did you send the three letters, one of which ultimately reached her through the director of Spring Grove?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">POLLACK: October 25, 1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">JUDGE KARWACKI: That was the first of the letters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">POLLACK: That was when I sent the letters to Spring Grove. It was after that that I had knowledge she was at Spring Grove. That was after the panel hearing, if that is what you are referring to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">JUDGE KARWACKI: My original question is what did you do between the summer of 1975 and the panel hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">POLLACK: The summer of 1975 and the panel hearing, I tried to contact, I made phone calls, to her brother, I had tried to call the hospital, the hospital wouldn\u2019t give you any information and it was after that I finally sent these letters out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>It is apparent that Pollack did little in furtherance of his client\u2019s interests between the summer of 1975, and the Bar Association\u2019s hearing on October 15, 1975. Moreover, the Bar Association had contacted James E. Crawford, Esq., and arranged for him to handle the matter for Pollack. Mr. Pollack failed to act before the hearing was held before the Grievance Committee. As a result, Mr. Matheson\u2019s divorce was delayed for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\n<em>ROUILLER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In December of 1972, Mrs. Bonnie Rouiller (Rouiller) retained Pollack for the purpose of settling the estate of her husband, Richard E. Rouiller, who had died in November of 1972. (T., pp. 39-40). Prior to that time the estate was opened, bond was obtained, notice to creditors was published, and Mrs. Rouiller was appointed the administratrix of the estate. (P. X 4). Rouiller explained to Pollack that the matter involved changing the name of several stock certificates from her husband\u2019s to her own and her daughter\u2019s names, transferring a car title to her, and settling a small insurance policy. (T., p. 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Between December, 1972, and February, 1974, Rouiller had several phone conversations with Pollack on these matters. In March of 1974 Rouiller informed Pollack that her oldest daughter would be marrying and asked him if that would involve another name change on the stock certificates. (T., p. 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Rouiller believed that, at the time of her husband\u2019s death, his car was titled in the name of his company, W. K. Ports &amp; Co. (T., pp. 53-54). Because she did not hear from Pollack on this matter, Rouiller obtained a copy of the registration from the Department of Motor Vehicles (T., p. 48); this title was in her husband\u2019s and her own name. (T., p. 54). When she sold the car, sometime in 1974, she presented this duplicate and a copy of her husband\u2019s death certificate to the purchaser. (T., p. 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In October, 1974 Pollack visited Rouiller at her place of employment and asked her to sign several papers. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>indicated that they concerned the estate, but she did not understand their legal significance. Pollack told Rouiller that the whole matter would be settled within two weeks. Pollack also visited Rouiller at her home on October 28th. He brought her some papers to sign and told her that the estate was about to be closed. (T., p. 58).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Because she had not heard from Pollack, Rouiller filed a grievance with the Bar Association in May of 1975. (P. X 3). On September 3, 1975, she met with Crawford who was acting as Pollack\u2019s attorney at the request of the Bar Association. (T., p. 43). He told her that he had been unable to contact Pollack by phone and that he had sent a registered letter to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Rouiller was unable to determine what legal action had been taken on her behalf and decided to consult another attorney, Claude L. Callegary (Callegary). Callegary made several inquiries and informed Rouiller that the estate had been closed since October, 1974. In September of 1975, Pollack turned the stock certificates over to Callegary who has held them since that time. (T., p. 44).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">During his appearance before the three judge panel, Pollack was asked to explain his handling of this matter. Mr. Pollack had no explanation for his inaction except his state of mind. (T., p. 94):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cPOLLACK: For me, to, well, I can\u2019t offer an excuse for my being dilatory. I can say that my favorite expression, hindsight, I can look back and give reasons why I acted a certain way and the reasons I acted that way is because my mind, I was going through a traumatic period and my mind was not functioning properly. Or, I wasn\u2019t in a mental state where I, where I would carry through or complete something that I had started. This didn\u2019t happen everyday and this didn\u2019t happen every matter, but, this situation with Mrs. Rouiller and the stocks, the court has before it the file from West Baltimore County that will reflect there were three cases that I ordered letters, twelve copies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>letters of administration which had to accompany the stock certificates for transfer. I, forms filled out which were turned over to Mr. Callegary. I went to a point, and I don\u2019t know why, I can\u2019t offer an explanation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Later, during the same hearing, the following exchange took place: (T., p. 114).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">JUDGE SULLIVAN: There was some testimony about Mrs. Rouiller, . . . , there was a car title and insurance policy left with her in addition to the stock certificates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">POLLACK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">JUDGE SULLIVAN: Do you know where the title to that automobile is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">POLLACK: I have the title to that automobile. Now, the, I have to clarify that. I have a title to that automobile in the W. Port Company, and I have, no, nothing to indicate that the title is, that, it is a little confusing. I don\u2019t think the title to that automobile was in W. Port Company as it was given to me and I believe was testified that before, correct me if I am wrong, before his death, Mr. Rouiller, and W. Port Company had put that car in their names. (T., p. 115).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">JUDGE WATTS: Well, two parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">POLLACK: And not Mr. and Mrs. Rouiller which is not the title was given to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">JUDGE KARWACKI: In other words, you think you had an old obsolete title?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">POLLACK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">JUDGE SULLIVAN: How about the insurance policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-14\">POLLACK: The letter and the policy was written and sent to the insurance company. And the letter stipulated, stated in there that the proceeds would be sent directly to Mrs. Rouiller and the reason was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that there was no banking account opened up or on the estate and sent directly to her.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">JUDGE SULLIVAN: Was the receipt of the policy acknowledged and the death claim acknowledged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">POLLACK: I don\u2019t have any knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">JUDGE SULLIVAN: Do you know it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">POLLACK: No, but I sent \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">JUDGE SULLIVAN: In the form of an . acknowledgement? You sent the insurance and the form claim that his policy \u2014 (T., p. 116).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">POLLACK: Yes, there was testimony in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">MR. CRAWFORD: Your honor, we will offer this as Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 1. (R X 1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\n<em>PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">On September 24, 1976, Pollack testified before the three judge panel that prior to the first letter of complaint sent to-the Bar Association on these cases, no charges had ever been placed against him. The following exchange took place: (T., p. 84).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">POLLACK: No, no charges were ever placed against me. There was one time I received a phone call from a Mr. Baker who was on the Grievance Committee of Baltimore City, it was a frivolous thing, resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">MR. CRAWFORD: How long ago was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-15\">POLLACK: It would have been back in 1960\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">POLLACK: I don\u2019t remember the exact (date).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">Later at the same hearing, on cross examination: (T., p. 116).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-18\">MR. HOWARD: Mr. Pollack, you indicated that a complaint or some allegation against your professional conduct was lodged in the mid 60\u2019s? Would that complaint have been filed sometime, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>be as a result of representation of a client prior to June of 1966?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">POLLACK: I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">MR. HOWARD: Would you recall if the name of the client involved or the complainant was Louis Maloff? (T., p. 117).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">POLLACK: I recognize the name, Louis Maloff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">MR. HOWARD: Did you represent Louis Maloff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">POLLACK: I represented him, yes. I said I recognized the name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">MR. HOWARD: And you indicate to this panel that the matter was closed with no official action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">POLLACK: That is my recollection of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">MR. HOWARD: If I advised you you were reprimanded by the Executive Committee of the Bar Association of Baltimore City \u2014 (T., p. 117).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">POLLACK: I recognize the name, but I do not remember or recall the outcome of it. ... I thought the complaint had been dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">(The hearing was continued in order to allow the counsel for the Bar Association to obtain the minutes of the Executive Committee of the Bar Association of June 1966.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">When the hearing resumed on October 1, 1976, counsel entered into a stipulation of facts based on the official minutes of the Executive Committee of the Maryland State Bar Association of June 1966. A reprimand was issued by the Executive Committee in June of 1966, for the reason that Pollack had been dilatory with regard to a real estate transaction; specifically, with regard to filing the documents related to that transaction. (#2T., p. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">During his explanation of the circumstances surrounding that transaction, the following exchange took place: (#2T., pp. 3-5).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-16\">POLLACK: This situation took place about eleven years ago and until . . . things were brought to my attention I didn\u2019t have too much memory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>recall on it. However, Mr. Maloff had a Texaco Gas Station at one time on what would be the east side of Reisterstown Road. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">Now I had frequented Mr. Maloff\u2019s Texaco Station as well as his motor repair place. I had done work in representations for him. He did work on my car and I, as a practice, paid cash for work on the car. The work wasn\u2019t satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">I then represented him in a real estate matter. Now, I don\u2019t recall whether it was a ground rent redemption or purchase. There is a difference as far as monetary matters are involved. If it had been a purchase, a mortgage would have been involved, papers would have been \u2014 I would have been rushed to put them on to protect the lending institution or the mortgagee. In this particular case I held the papers and did not put them on record. I was angry, disturbed, mad, trying to get my money back for work that Maloff did on my car that I felt he hadn\u2019t done properly. The next thing that I recall with the aid of these papers is that I put the papers on record. Maloff had gone to see another attorney and I didn\u2019t know who the attorney was or when the attorney contacted me. But I recorded the papers after being contacted and that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">MR. CRAWFORD: And you had testified prior that you did not recall a formal reprimand for these circumstances. Do you now recall the reprimand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">POLLACK: I have been shown a letter and I recall \u2014 or I received the letter at the time I was working for the City and according to the address it was delivered to me in the right of way division of the City office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LA W</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Maryland Rule 1230 (added October 13, 1970), which adopted the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association as set forth in Appendix F of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Maryland Rules, deals with, in Canon 6, a lawyer\u2019s competent representation of a client as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\n<em>DISCIPLINAR Y R ULES</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">DR 6-101 Failing to act competently</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">(1) Handle a legal matter which he knows or should know that he is not competent to handle, without associating with him a lawyer who is competent to handle it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">(2) Handle a legal matter without preparation adequate in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-13\">(3) Neglect a legal matter entrusted to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">It is the well-settled law of this State that the purpose of a disciplinary action is not to punish the offending attorney, but \u201cis to protect the public from one who has demonstrated his unworthiness to continue the practice of law.\u201d The purpose of such proceeding has been characterized: \u201cas a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public.\u201d See <em>Maryland State Bar Association v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543-549 (1974). When it has been demonstrated that a lawyer was inattentive to his client\u2019s interest or lacks competence in dealing with legal matters, he has violated the Canons and should be disciplined. The Bar Association and the Supreme Bench must be vigilant in protecting the public against individuals who represent themselves to be competent and skillful and who neglect matters entrusted to them. As Judge O\u2019Donnell stated in <em>Maryland State Bar Association v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 361 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-15\">\u201cBecause of the vital role an attorney, licensed to practice plays in the legal process, he must act with competence and proper care in representing his clients. His admission to the Bar attests to the public that he has met the standards for admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and is competent to discharge his duties toward his clients with strictest fidelity. Once retained he must carefully safeguard the interest of his clients, must be diligent in his representation of the client\u2019s interest, must give appropriate attention to his legal work, and must observe the utmost good faith in his professional relationship. See Canon 6, EC 6-1 et seq. His right to continue to practice may be brought into question in a disciplinary proceeding, based upon conduct showing him to be unfit to continue to exercise the duties and responsibilities of an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The panel is aware that attorneys must deal with many disgruntled and difficult clients. However, in this case the complaints were justified and were not the result of anger, revenge, or recrimination. The witnesses against Mr. Pollack were understanding and forgiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The testimony has clearly demonstrated to this panel that Mr. Pollack acted incompetently, carelessly and negligently with respect to all three matters entrusted to him. At one point, he was candid with the panel and testified that \u201cI have no excuse for being dilatory.\u201d This judicial admission of guilt strengthens the case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The severity of the sanction to be imposed is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court may consider facts of mitigation as well as an attorney\u2019s prior misconduct and any previous disciplinary sanctions which may have been imposed. See <em>Maryland State Bar Association v. Phoebus </em>(supra), and <em>Bar Association of Baltimore City v. Dearing, </em>274 Md. 66 (1975) where neglect was found to be grounds for a two year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In the Pollack situation, if it were only one instance of negligence a reprimand might be sufficient. However, we have three separate cases of neglect and incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The cases supporting suspension in similar circumstances are numerous. In <em>Spindell v. State Bar, </em>530 P. 2d 168 (1975), the California Court held that the delay of an attorney in obtaining a dissolution of a divorce for his client\u2019s marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>as well as a failure to communicate with her, despite her persistent efforts to speak with him, justified a finding of willful dereliction in the discharge of professional duties, even though there was no deliberate intent to ignore client\u2019s needs. In <em>In re Albert, </em>212 N.W.2d 17 (1973) the Michigan Court held that an attorney\u2019s inattention to the duties of his client, even if unaccompanied by moral delinquency, may call for censure and suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">There is no indication of deceit, fraud or dishonesty on the part of Mr. Pollack. The panel is also aware that Mr. Pollack did not profit or unjustly enrich himself by his acts. However, Courts have also generally held that returning all or part of fees does not excuse attorney\u2019s breach of professional conduct. See <em>Ferris v. Oneida County Bar Association, </em>297 N.Y.S.2d 280 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The panel is aware that mitigating circumstances may be considered in determining the punishment to be imposed. <em>Marsh v. State Bar, </em>2 Cal. 2d 75 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Respondent urges that the Court not impose sanctions and cites Respondent\u2019s mental and emotional state as its reasons therefore. He produced several members of the Bar who testified in support of his depressed and unstable mental condition which was caused by the break-up of his marriage. He claimed he was experiencing a period of stress and trauma and was unable to complete work he began. It was also agreed by all parties that he was very contrite about his neglect of his client\u2019s matters. The panel did find that he was going through a very stressful domestic period and gave that fact some weight in mitigation. However, the panel believes this situation does not excuse his dilatoriness because he was not completely disabled by his emotional turmoil. These matters did not require hours of concentrated work; it would have required very little effort to complete them. Therefore, there was no excuse for the prolonged failure to attend to clients\u2019 business.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Finally, in its determination of the disciplinary sanction the panel was concerned by Respondent\u2019s lack of candor in testimony about prior involvement with the Bar Association. Initially he testified that he had a minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>problem which was resolved on the telephone with an attorney representing the Association. It was only after the minutes of the Executive Committee of the Maryland State Bar Association were produced, indicating that in June, 1966, he was reprimanded by the Grievance Committee that his recollection became more clear. In that matter he admitted that he delayed in recording a Ground Rent Deed in order to obtain money which he felt the client owed him as a result of unsatisfactory work done by the client on his car. In other words, he allowed his personal business to interfere with his law business and failed to act with diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Respondent\u2019s lack of candor with the Court, and the failure of that reprimand to impress upon him the seriousness of his duties as an attorney were considered by the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>RECOMMENDA TION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The three judge panel unanimously agree that negligent and unprofessional conduct merits disciplinary action. It is also the unanimous opinion of the panel that the petitioner should not be disbarred. After giving serious consideration to all of the factors of mitigation and extenuating circumstances the panel unanimously recommends that Herbert Leonard Pollack be suspended from the practice of law for Six (6) months.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">/s/Robert B.
