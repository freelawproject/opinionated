Vol.), Art. 76A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, ordering the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police to disclose to the plaintiff all records of an investigation which the State Police conducted in connection with the revocation of the plaintiffs permit to carry a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The plaintiff-appellee, Stuart L. Henschen, is a \u201crailway patrolman\u201d employed by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company to guard and patrol property of the railroad in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Sometime prior to 1976, Mr. Henschen had been issued a permit to carry a handgun by the Maryland State Police, in accordance with the Maryland Handgun Act, Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 36E.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">By letter dated January 30, 1976, the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police, pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 36E (f), revoked Mr. Henschen\u2019s handgun permit. The ground for the revocation, as revealed by the January 30 letter and by subsequent correspondence between Mr. Henschen\u2019s attorney and the Assistant Attorney General representing the Superintendent, was that Mr. Henschen allegedly \u201cexhibited a propensity for violence or instability which may reasonably render his possession of a handgun a danger to himself and other law-abiding persons\u201d because of his \u201cexcessive use of alcohol ... on occasions when he was carrying a handgun.\u201d As authorized by Art. 27, \u00a7 36E (g), Mr. Henschen took an appeal from the Superintendent\u2019s action to the Handgun Permit Review Board, a state agency entirely separate from the Maryland State Police and established by the Legislature to review decisions of the State Police regarding handgun permits. As of the date the instant case was heard by us, Mr. Henschen\u2019s appeal had not been decided by the Handgun Permit Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After noting the appeal to the Handgun Permit Review Board, Mr. Henschen requested the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police to disclose the police file relating to his handgun permit and the evidence upon which the revocation was based. Mr. Henschen\u2019s attorney asserted in correspondence with the Superintendent\u2019s attorney that \u201cthere is no way I can prepare an appeal unless I know what the evidence against my client is.\u201d In response, the Attorney General\u2019s office, on behalf of the Superintendent, informed Mr. Henschen\u2019s attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\u201cThe conclusion of the Superintendent was based upon the excessive use of alcohol by Stuart L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Henschen on occasions when he was carrying a handgun. Evidence was received by the Superintendent regarding the excessive use of alcohol by Mr. Henschen from a number of sources considered reliable. These sources included:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201c1. A police report of the Baltimore City Police Department, Complaint No. 1K31705 relating to an arrest of Stuart L. Henschen at 1:30 a.m. November 16,1975. A copy of this two-page report is enclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201c2. A nine-page typewritten statement by Stuart Lee Henschen dated January 6, 1976, which Mr. Henschen furnished to Inspector M. F. Maloney, Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company relating to the November 16, 1975 arrest of Mr. Henschen. A copy of this nine-page statement is enclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201c3. Information received from a number of present and former officers of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Although copies of the police report and Mr. Henschen\u2019s statement, constituting the first two sources of information, were given to Mr. Henschen, the Superintendent declined to furnish the statements given to the State Police from the present and former officers of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad police. The Superintendent relied upon the exception to the Maryland Public Information Act\u2019s disclosure requirement for \u201c[r]ecords of investigations conducted by ... any ... police department or any investigatory files compiled for any other law-enforcement or prosecution purposes .. ..\u201d Art. 76A, \u00a7 3 (b) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Thereafter, Mr. Henschen instituted the present action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking judicial review of the Superintendent\u2019s action and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>In his bill of complaint, and at the subsequent hearing before the circuit court, Mr. Henschen asserted that the ability to carry a handgun was an indispensable part of his employment as a railway patrolman, that he had been suspended from his employment because of the revocation of his handgun permit, and that disclosure of the information received by the State Police from the present and former officers of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad police concerning his alleged misuse of alcohol was necessary in order for him to prepare his appeal to the Handgun Permit Review Board. The Superintendent, on the other hand, reiterated his position that the information sought w\u00e1s within the Public Information Act\u2019s exception for records of investigations conducted by a police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court delivered an opinion holding that, for a record of a police investigation to come within the \u00a7 3 (b) (i) exemption in the Public Information Act, the investigatory record must have been compiled for a \u201claw-enforcement or prosecution purpose\u201d and that the investigation in this case, leading to the handgun permit revocation, did not meet these criteria. The circuit court in its decree ordered the Superintendent to provide Mr. Henschen with all evidence, including all written or recorded statements and the names and addresses of all witnesses, upon which the permit revocation was based. The Superintendent took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari before any decision by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The pertinent provisions of the Public Information Act are as follows (Art. 76A, \u00a7 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201c(a) The custodian of any public records shall allow any person the right of inspection .of such records or any portion thereof except on one or more of the following grounds or as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">* * .*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201c(b) The custodian may deny the right of inspection of the following records, unless otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>provided by law, on the ground that disclosure to the applicant would be contrary to the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">(i) Records of investigations conducted by, or of intelligence information or security procedures of, any sheriff, county attorney, city attorney, the Attorney General, police department or any investigatory files compiled for any other law-enforcement or prosecution purposes; * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Before turning to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3 (b) (i), however, it is desirable to emphasize just what is before us for decision in this case and what is not. This is an action under the Public Information Act and not a proceeding to review an administrative decision revoking a handgun permit. The Public Information Act provides that, subject to certain enumerated exceptions, \u201cthe custodian of any public records shall allow <em>any person </em>the right of inspection of such records . . . .\u201d (Art. 76A, \u00a7 3 (a), emphasis supplied.) The general right of inspection is not limited to a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d or \u201cperson in interest.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The term \u201cperson\u201d is broadly defined to include \u201cany natural person, corporation, partnership, firm or association.\u201d (Art. 76A, \u00a7 1 (g).) Consequently, if the Superintendent\u2019s refusal to disclose in this case is not justified by one of the Public Information Act\u2019s exceptions, Mr. Hensehen would be entitled to the information regardless of the pendency of an appeal to the Handgun Permit Review Board. Moreover, the applicability of the exception upon which the Superintendent relies in this case, the exception for records of investigations (\u00a7 3 (b) (i)), does not at all depend upon whether the records would be available to a party in litigation with the agency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, whether or not due process considerations might make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>records available to Mr. Henschen as a party in the administrative proceeding before the Handgun Permit Review Board does not determine whether they are available under the Public Information Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On the other hand, a ruling that the records need not be disclosed under the Public Information Act, because of the exception in \u00a7 3 (b) (i), does not determine whether Mr. Henschen may be entitled to see them in connection with the Handgun Permit Review Board proceeding. A particular document may not be available to \u201cany person\u201d under the Public Information Act in light of that Act\u2019s exceptions, but procedural due process requirements may yet make that same document available to a party, or unavailable for use against a party, in an administrative or judicial proceeding. <em>See, </em>in this connection, <em>Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 128-129, 314 A. 2d 113 (1974) (holding that an investigator\u2019s report could not, consistent with due process requirements, be used against a party to unemployment compensation proceedings where the party had no opportunity to examine the report, cross-examine the investigator or rebut the contents of the report).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The issue in this case, therefore, is not whether the records here involved may be used against Mr. Henschen in the Handgun Permit Review Board proceeding or may be available to him, in that proceeding. The issue is whether \u201cany person\u201d would be entitled to inspect the' records under the Public Information Act in light of that Act\u2019s exception in \u00a7 3 (b) (i) for \u201crecords of investigations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The relevant language of the \u00a7 3 (b) (i) exception is: \u201cRecords of investigations conducted by ... any sheriff, .. . police department or any investigatory files compiled for any other law-enforcement or prosecution purposes .. ..\u201d As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>previously mentioned, the circuit court held that the records in this case were not within the exception because, in the court\u2019s view, they were not compiled for \u201claw-enforcement or prosecution purposes.\u201d However, as we read the statute, when the documents in question constitute records of an investigation by a police department (or sheriffs office or any of the other law enforcement agencies specifically listed in \u00a7 3 (b) (i)), there need not be an actual showing that the records were compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes for the exception to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Section 3 (b) (i) is in the disjunctive, excepting records of investigation by the enumerated types of law enforcement agencies <em>or </em>investigatory files compiled for any other law enforcement or prosecution purposes. The statutory provision exempts from the mandatory disclosure requirement two categories of documents: (1) investigatory records of certain named law enforcement agencies; (2) investigatory records of other governmental agencies which were compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes. It is only with respect to the second category that there is an express requirement that the records be compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes. The statutory language, and particularly the use of the word <em>other </em>before the phrase \u201claw-enforcement or prosecution purposes,\u201d suggests that the Legislature believed that investigatory records of one of the enumerated law enforcement agencies were presumptively for law enforcement or prosecution purposes, but that investigatory records compiled by other agencies might or might not be for such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Since it is undisputed that the documents sought in this case are records of an investigation conducted by a police department, they fall within the \u00a7 3 (b) (i) exception. There was no necessity for the Superintendent to have demonstrated in court that the records were compiled for law enforcement or prosecution purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\n<em>Appellee to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">. The judicial review provision of the Public Information Act, Art. 76A, \u00a7 3 (e), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">\u201cAny person denied the right to inspect any record covered by this article may apply to the circuit court of the county where the record is found for any order directing the custodian of such record to show cause why he should not permit the inspection of such record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">. In some of the Act\u2019s exceptions, although not the one for records of investigation, a distinction is made between \u201cany person\u201d and a \u201cperson in interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">. Compare \u00a7 3 (b) (v), excepting from the mandatory disclosure requirement \u201c[i]nteragency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. However, if some other statutory provision were to make these records available to Mr. Henschen, the exceptions in \u00a7\u00a7 3 (b) (i) through 3 (b) (v) of the Public Information Act could not be invoked by the Superintendent. The discretion of a custodian of public records to deny inspection on any of the five grounds set forth in \u00a7 3 (b) is limited by the language, \u201cunless otherwise provided by law .... No provision of law other than the Public Information Act has been relied on by Mr. Henschen in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">. In light of our construction of the statute, we are, of course, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>presented with the question of whether the investigatory records in this case would be deemed by; us to have been \u201ccompiled for any . . . law-enforcement or prosecution purposes\u201d within the meaning of the second part of \u00a7 3 (b) (i). In this connection, however, <em>see </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 36E (k), making it a misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to one year imprisonment or both \u201cfor a person to whom a permit has been issued . . . to carry, wear, or transport a handgun while he is under the influence of alcohol...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AuM\">It is also noteworthy that the phrase \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d also appears in one of the exemptions in the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (b) (7). The federal courts have given that language a somewhat broader interpretation than did the circuit court in the instant case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. I.T.O. Corp. of Baltimore, 508 F. 2d 945 (4th Cir. 1974); Wellman Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, 490 F. 2d 427, 430-431 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U. S. 834, 95 S.

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 421 U. S. 132, 162-165, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 1522-1523, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
