Orth, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9, the Court of Appeals of Maryland designated the undersigned judges as a panel for the hearing of charges brought against the Respondent by the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland. A hearing was held before the panel on November 24, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">FINDINGS OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">On December 11, 1975, Respondent pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to the charge of falsely and fraudulently subscribing to a joint income tax return by willfully and knowingly, under penalty of perjury, understating his gross income for the year 1973 by $3,300. The remaining 17 counts of the pertinent indictment were nolle pressed by the United States Attorney pursuant to a plea bargain. On February 18, 1976, Respondent received a two-year sentence, of which 179 days were to be in confinement, and the balance of the term was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">Approximately 10 months before Respondent pleaded guilty, he was tried on mail fraud charges. This resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>mistrial because Respondent suffered a coronary attack during the tenth day of trial. While in the hospital, Respondent also suffered a \u201ccerebral vascular accident.\u201d Respondent was reindicted, and he went to trial on December 3, 1975. His heart had to be monitored regularly during the trial by a portable EKG unit, and he was also under prescribed medication. After the prosecution finished its case, Respondent pleaded guilty as previously mentioned. Respondent asserted at this Disciplinary Hearing that he pleaded guilty because of the danger of aggravating his already precarious physical condition by continuing with the trial, where he would shortly have been subjected to rigorous, strenuous and lengthy cross-examination. Respondent further testified, however, that he was in fact guilty of this tax fraud charge. Respondent further conceded that this conviction was of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Respondent has been a member of the Maryland Bar since 1956, and no further examples of Respondent\u2019s misconduct were brought to the panel\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Respondent first contends that his criminal conduct \u201cdid not so adversely bear upon his moral fitness to practice law so as to warrant disbarment or render him incapable of maintaining the integrity of the bar.\u201d We disagree. It is now well settled in this state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cwhen a member of the bar is shown to be willfully dishonest for personal gain by means of fraud, deceit, cheating or like conduct, absent the most compelling- extenuating circumstances . . . disbarment follow[s] as a matter of course ...\u201d <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 553 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Moreover, willful tax evasion, proscribed by 26 U.S.C., \u00a7 7201, is in that class of crimes which involve moral turpitude and are \u201cinfested with fraud, deceit and dishonesty\u201d that \u201cwill result in automatic disbarment when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the respondent fails to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence a compelling reason to the contrary.\u201d <em>Agnew, supra, </em>271 Md. at 551; <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass'n v. Callanan, </em>271 Md. 554, 556 (1974); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, 524 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">That Respondent was convicted of a violation of 26 U.S.C., \u00a7 7206 (1), instead of the \u00a7 7201 offense involved in the three cases referred to above, is immaterial. Respondent\u2019s offense, making a false and fraudulent income tax statement, is similarly \u201cinfested with fraud, deceit and dishonesty.\u201d Respondent\u2019s offense, as he himself concedes, involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances\u201d necessary to avoid disbarment that Respondent relies on are the physical and mental adversities which he has endured since the criminal prosecution were commenced. What was said in <em>Callanan, supra, </em>271 Md. at 557, and <em>Seigel, </em>275 Md. at 527, is dispositive here: while the \u201chealth problem is distressing . . . we conclude that since [it] ... developed subsequent to his criminal activity, and then only because it was detected . . . (it does) not serve to palliate the evil of his offense.\u201d Respondent\u2019s coronary and cerebral conditions, admittedly serious, occurred after the commencement of the Respondent\u2019s first criminal trial and after the commission of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Respondent also points in mitigation to his \u201cunblemished\u201d reputation as a member of the Bar for 20 years. In rejecting an identical argument as to an attorney who was at the Bar for over 40 years, <em>Seigel </em>stated as follows (275 Md. at 528-529):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201c. . . because \u2018an attorney\u2019s character must remain beyond reproach,\u2019 this \u2018Court has the duty, since attorneys are its officers, to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Disciplinary proceedings have been established for this purpose, not for punishment, but rather as a catharsis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the profession and a prophylactic for the public\u2019 .... Our constancy in the responsibility cannot be shaken by our respect for an individual attorney\u2019s reputation, by our recognition of the longevity of his career at the bar, or by our appreciation for his service to the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We are bound to reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Since Respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and has not demonstrated compelling extenuating circumstances to justify a lesser sanction; we have no alternative but to recommend disbarment, this 9th day of December, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">/s/ John R. Hargrove_</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">/s/ Martin B. Greenfeld</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">/s/ Robert L. Sullivan, Jr.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
