Ill, \u00a7 34 which prohibits the State\u2019s participation \u201cin the construction of works of internal improvement which shall involve the faith or credit of the State....\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Appellant Goldsborough filed a taxpayer\u2019s suit against the State Department of Transportation, the Mass Transit Administration, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Mass Transit Administrator. He alleged that the Rapid Transit System, if constructed, will constitute an \u201cinternal improvement\u201d constitutionally prohibited by \u00a7 34 and that the action of the General .Assembly in authorizing and appropriating expenditures to assist in the financing of the project<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was therefore illegal and unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Childs, J.), relying primarily on <em>Bonsal v. Yellott, </em>100 Md. 481, 60 A. 593 (1905), held that the proposed project was not a work of internal improvement within the contemplation of \u00a7 34. Because of the importance of the issue, certiorari was granted prior to the appeal being heard in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The history underlying and giving rise to the inclusion of \u00a7 34 in the Maryland Constitution is well documented. The constitutional provision prohibiting the State\u2019s involvement in works of internal improvement which implicate its faith or credit was intended to prevent any repetition of the State\u2019s fiscal crises in the second quarter of the 19th century. The State had invested millions of dollars in privately owned and operated railroad and canal companies which had been organized primarily for profit to their stockholders; the State had transferred long-term State bonds to the companies in exchange for subscriptions to their securities. The companies sold the bonds, thereby pledging the State\u2019s credit, in order to raise capital. It was their responsibility to pay the interest on the bonds and ultimately to redeem the principal. The projects failed to generate sufficient income to do so, however, and the State was fiscally unable to meet the interest payments on the bonds. Bankruptcy threatened, and it was only by imposing additional taxes that the State survived the financial crisis. The State\u2019s purpose to realize a profit\u00e1ble investment while at the same time assisting in the development of the State thus ended in fiscal disaster. <em>See Secretary of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>Transportation v. Mancuso, </em>278 Md. 81, 359 A. 2d 79 (1976); <em>Johns Hopkins University v. Williams, </em>199 Md. 382, 86 A. 2d 892 (1952); <em>Bonsal v. Yellott, supra; Report of the Constitutional Convention Commission, Maryland, 1967, </em>at 214, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The seminal case construing the constitutional provision in question was <em>Bonsal v. Yellott, supra. </em>Our predecessors there held that State involvement in the construction of a public road did not violate the provisions of \u00a7 34. While recognizing that a public road was an internal improvement, the Court said that the term \u201cworks of internal improvement,\u201d as used in \u00a7 34, was not intended to encompass such a public project. It held that in view of the history of the constitutional provision, \u201cthe people had in mind the character of \u2018internal improvements,\u2019 which had been so disastrous to the State,\u201d 100 Md. at 499, 60 A. at 594; that the works of internal improvement contemplated by \u00a7 34 \u201cwere such as the State had been connected with or interested in as \u2018stockholder,\u201d or \u2018creditor\u2019 \u2014 such as had driven it to the very verge of bankruptcy and repudiation \u2014 and not such as every State government must have, either in its own name or in the names of its \u2018political agencies, created for the better government of the affairs of the State,\u2019 . . .\u201d 100 Md. at 505, 60 A. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">For reasons identical to those set forth in <em>Bonsai, </em>we held in <em>Lerch v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>240 Md. 438, 214 A. 2d 761 (1965), that a publicly owned international trade center was not a prohibited work of internal improvement under \u00a7 34. The same result was reached in connection with a public sewerage or drainage system, <em>Welch v. Coglan, </em>126 Md. 1, 94 A. 384 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Appellant argues that unlike any of these facilities, the Rapid Transit System is the very type of internal improvement contemplated by the framers of \u00a7 34. He says that the system is a railroad or railway and that it is fated for the same kind of financial disaster as befell the rail and canal companies of the 19th century, with the same disastrous results for the State. Describing the proposed system as \u201ca project of doubtful wisdom,\u201d one which can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>never be self-supporting, he urges that we declare the State\u2019s involvement with it violative of \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Assuming without deciding that the Rapid Transit System is a railroad or railway, it is plain to us, as it was to our predecessors in <em>Bonsai, </em>that the question is not whether such a publicly owned project can be considered as an internal improvement; rather it is whether such a project was intended by the framers of \u00a7 34 and the people who adopted it to constitute a constitutionally prohibited work of internal improvement. <em>Bonsai </em>and its progeny make clear that it was not. The Mass Transit Administration, the public body responsible for the planning, construction, and management of the project, bears no resemblance to the privately owned rail and canal companies of the last century. Its purpose is purely public;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> their purpose was the enhancement of private profit. In other words, the Rapid Transit System will be a publicly owned facility built in response to a legislative determination of a public need for mass transportation and not for some envisioned profit or investment purpose. Under the legislative mandate, the system will be constructed and maintained as a primary function of government; in reality, it is a facility which, like the public road in <em>Bonsal, </em>\u201cpublic authorities alone construct.\u201d 100 Md. at 499, 60 A. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">That the Rapid Transit System may be \u201ca project of doubtful wisdom\u201d because of its alleged inability to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>self-supporting, as appellant suggests, is not the concern of the courts. The wisdom or expediency of a valid law adopted in the exercise of the State\u2019s police power is not subject to judicial review. <em>Steuart Petroleum Co. v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>276 Md. 435, 347 A. 2d 854 (1975). \u201c[T]he validity of the means chosen to carry out a public purpose does not depend upon proof that the means will be successful.\u201d <em>Lerch v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>240 Md. at 449, 214 A. 2d at 767. We judge only the project\u2019s constitutionality and hold that it does not violate the prohibition of \u00a7 34 against State participation in works of internal improvement which involve the faith or credit of the State. In so concluding we have carefully considered, but find inapposite, <em>Attorney General v. Pingree, </em>120 Mich. 550, 79 N. W. 814 (1899), upon which appellant places his principal reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirm,ed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">.

Such a regional transit system cannot be achieved by the unilateral action of any one of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County but requires action by the State of Maryland, through a State authority which is politically responsive to local needs and which will assure that the development of the regional transit system fosters general development plans for the State, the region and the local development plans of the participating political subdivisions.\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl.
