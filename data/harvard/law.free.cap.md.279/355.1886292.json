Vol., 1972 Cum. Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 33, which reduces the workmen\u2019s compensation award of a public employee if he also receives benefits under his employer\u2019s pension plan. The Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Mazor v. Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>30 Md. App. 394, 352 A. 2d 918 (1976), interpreted the statute to apply to the facts presented by this case'and further held' that the statute was constitutional. We then granted Mazor\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and, since we agree with the Court of Special Appeals, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The facts are simple and undisputed. On July 17, 1972, appellant, Donald Louis Mazor, then a 50-year old penitentiary guard who had been employed by the Department of Correction for more than six years, suffered severe injuries when he was stabbed and beaten during an incident at the House of Correction. Unable to return to work, Mazor retired on September 1, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">As a condition to employment with the state, Mazor had become a member of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the State of Maryland. Code (1957, 1970 Repl. Vol., 1972 Cum. Supp.), Art. 73B, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. Consequently, a contribution towards an annuity had been regularly deducted from his salary, while the Department of Correction for its part had contributed to a separate pension fund. Art. 73B, \u00a7 14. Having determined that Mazor was totally and permanently incapacitated for duty as a result of his injury, the retirement system awarded him, effective upon his retirement, an accidental disability pension of $421.59 and an annuity of $26.75, for a total of $448.34 per month or $5,380.08 per year. Art. 73B, \u00a7 11 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Mazor was also eligible for benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws in the event he sustained injury in the course of his employment. Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 36. Workmen\u2019s compensation benefits are supported exclusively by the employer, not by the employee. Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16, 51. If the employer carries insurance with the State Accident Fund, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>here, he pays premiums equal to a predetermined percentage of the payroll of his employees covered by Article 101, \u00a7 72. In any event, Mazor also applied for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. At a hearing before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, Mazor\u2019s employer and the State Accident Fund, who, together with the Subsequent Injury Fund, are the appellees here, claimed that pursuant to Art. 101, \u00a7 33, award of the pension discharged their obligation to provide workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. That section, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">\u201cWhenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21(a)(2) of this article, the dependents and others entitled to benefits under this article as a result of the death of such employees, the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer for any benefit under this article. Should any benefits so furnished be less than those provided for in this article the employer shall be liable to furnish the additional benefit as will make up the difference between the benefit furnished and the similar benefit required in this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cThe Commission shall have full power to determine whether any benefit provided by the employer is equal to or better than any benefit provided for in this article, and to render an award against the employers to furnish additional benefit or benefits to make up the difference between the benefit furnished by the employers and the benefits required by this article as the case may be....\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Four issues were presented to the Commission. First, appellees claimed that Mazor\u2019s pension benefits were equal to or better than any benefit provided by workmen\u2019s compensation. Secondly, while recognizing that the statute is couched in terms of discharging only the employer\u2019s obligation, appellees argued that \u00a7 33 also implicitly provided for discharge of the insurer\u2019s obligation. Thirdly, Mazor contended that as a matter of statutory interpretation, \u00a7 33 required a setoff only if the accident resulted in death. Lastly, Mazor contended that application of \u00a7 33 to his case would violate a number of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In its October 1974 ruling, the Commission determined that Mazor\u2019s pension benefits were equal to or better than those provided under the workmen\u2019s compensation law, but rejected the contention that the insurer, as distinguished from the employer, was entitled to a discharge. Consequently, the Commission did not reach the last two issues. Rather, it found that Mazor suffered a permanent 60% disability solely as a result of the 1972 incident, and therefore awarded him $65 a week or $3,380 per year, not to exceed $26,000. Art. 101, \u00a7 36 (4), (4a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The employer and insurer appealed the decision of the Commission to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. After the case was removed to Harford County for trial, they moved for summary judgment. In granting the motion, the court (Close, J.) held that the insurer, as well as the employer, was entitled to a discharge of his obligation; that \u00a7 33 was not limited to death cases; and that the statute did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>not violate any of Mazor\u2019s constitutional rights. It therefore reversed the Commission\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Because Mazor has conceded here that the benefits he receives from his disability pension are equal to or better than any benefits he could receive from workmen\u2019s compensation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we need consider only two issues of statutory interpretation: whether \u00a7 33 entitles the insurer, as well as the employer, to a discharge of its obligation and whether \u00a7 33 discharges the workmen\u2019s compensation obligation when the employee\u2019s injury does not result in death. We shall answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">As we have so often said, the cardinal rule of construction of a statute is to ascertain and carry out the real intention of the Legislature. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A. 2d 275 (1975); <em>Fairchild v. Maritime Air Serv., </em>274 Md. 181, 185, 333 A. 2d 313 (1975); <em>Purifoy v. Merc.-Safe Dep. </em>&amp; <em>Trust, </em>273 Md. 58, 65, 327 A. 2d 483 (1974). The primary source from which we glean this intention is the language of the statute itself. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. at 421. And in construing a statute we accord the words their ordinary and natural signification. <em>Bright v. Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund Bd., </em>275 Md. 165, 169, 338 A. 2d 248 (1975); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. Rockville, </em>272 Md. 550, 556, 325 A. 2d 748 (1974); <em>Grosvenor v. Supervisor of Assess., </em>271 Md. 232, 237-38, 315 A. 2d 758 (1974). If reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless. <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, </em>275 Md. 314, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>319, 340 A. 2d 236 (1975). Similarly, wherever possible an interpretation should be given to statutory language which will not lead to absurd consequences. <em>Fairchild v. Maritime Air Serv., </em>274 Md. at 186. Moreover, if the statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, the sections must be read together to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature. <em>Blumenthal v. Clerk of Cir. Ct., </em>278 Md. 398, 403, 365 A. 2d 279 (1976); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 314, 317, 353 A. 2d 256 (1976); <em>County Council v. Supervisor, </em>274 Md. 116, 120, 332 A. 2d 897 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Applying these principles, we conclude that \u00a7 83 not only provides for discharge of employers, but also applies in the same manner to insurers. Mazor recognizes that \u201cwhen the Legislature by statute authorized employers to contract with insurance companies in order to cover possible claims under Article 101 it intended the insurance carrier to stand in the position of the employer.\u201d <em>Flood v. Merchants Ins. Co., </em>230 Md. 373, 377, 187 A. 2d 320 (1963). In an attempt to avoid application of this rule, Mazor contends that only by express provision may his benefits be reduced. He recognizes, however, that \u00a7 83 does discharge an employer\u2019s obligation. To adopt Mazor\u2019s interpretation here, then, would produce an anomalous consequence, whereby the insurer conceivably would pay benefits to the employee without receiving premiums from the . employer. For the same reason, the effect of such an interpretation on self-insured employers, <em>see </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 16 (3), would differ from that on employers who are not, self-insured. By interpreting the statute to discharge also the obligation of insurers, we avoid such \u201cabsurd consequences.\u201d <em>Fairchild v. Maritime Air. Serv., </em>274 Md. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The gist of Mazor\u2019s second argument is that \u00a7 33 applies only where the injury results in the employee\u2019s death. To sustain this position, as we understand it, he would have us parse the first sentence in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cWhenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21 (a) (2) of this article,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">[(1)] the dependents and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ars\">[(2)] others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">entitled to benefits under this article as a result of the death of such employees, the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer for any benefit under this article. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the sentence should be read quite differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201cWhenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">[(1)] employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21 (a) (2) of this article [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">[(2)] the dependents and others entitled to benefits under this article as a result of the death of such employees,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer for any benefit under this article.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">We agree with appellees\u2019 interpretation and believe that the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face, thus obviating the necessity of referring to any legislative history. <em>Cf. Blumenthal v. Clerk of Cir. Ct., </em>278 Md. at 403 (ambiguity found). To agree with Mazor\u2019s position would require us to read this portion of \u00a7 33 as a grammatically incorrect English sentence whereby the phrase, \u201cthe dependents and others entitled to benefits under this article as a result of the death of such -employees,\u201d would have absolutely no structural function. As a corollary of the rule that we accord words their ordinary meaning, we must accord sentences an ordinary grammatical structure. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>short, Mazor\u2019s position would create a forced and strained interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">We regard as persuasive the decision of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md. App. 348, 345 A. 2d 134 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 748 (1976), where it considered the identical question presented here. There, the court also held that death of the employee is not a condition precedent to the discharge of the employer\u2019s obligation to provide workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. As the court in <em>Nooe </em>aptly recognized, adoption of the employee\u2019s position would lead to consequences not intended by the Legislature: the rights of widows and orphans of a deceased employee would be severely restricted, while an employee who sustained relatively minor injuries resulting in a disability pension award would be entitled to double benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Our holding recognizes that workmen\u2019s compensation is one facet of an overall system of wage-loss protection, and that the underlying principle of the system is to restore to the worker a portion of wages lost by physical disability, unemployment, or old age. It follows that although two or more causes of wage loss may coincide, the benefits need not cumulate, for the worker experiences but one wage loss. 4 Larson, Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 97.00, 97.10 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">A majority of American jurisdictions provide some form of setoff in the area of wage-loss legislation. 4 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 97.20; <em>cf. </em>Social Security Act \u00a7 224, 42 U.S.C. 424a (1970) (reduction of Social Security benefits where individual is entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation). The cases cited by Mazor for the proposition that one may receive full workmen\u2019s compensation benefits while receiving other disability payments are distinguishable because all of the cases involved a meshing of federal and state programs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Concededly, the statutory schemes throughout the country evidence a variety of approaches, but in any event, the express provision in our statute is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Secondly, Mazor contends that even if we interpret the statute as discharging the obligation of the employer and insurer to provide him with workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, the statute violates several of his constitutional rights. Since the protection afforded by some of these rights overlaps, we need not treat all of them separately. We hold, however, that the statute infringes on none of his rights and is thus constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We turn first to Mazor\u2019s contentions that the statute deprives him of property without just compensation in contravention of Art. Ill, \u00a7 40 of the Maryland Constitution, and without due process of law contrary to both Art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The due process violation, Mazor claims, lies not in the procedures employed, but in the substantive effect of the statute. Manifestly, these contentions are one and the same, since \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment, Art. 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Art. 3, Sec. 40 of the Maryland Constitution have . .. the same meaning and effect in reference to an exaction of property .. . <em>Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, 615-16, 150 A. 2d 421 (1959) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall treat these contentions together.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Because the workmen\u2019s compensation laws protect workers and their families from the hardships inflicted by work-related injuries, they represent an exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>police power. <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, </em>270 Md. 403, 429, 312 A. 2d 225 (1973); <em>Solvuca v. Ryan </em>&amp; <em>Reilly Co., </em>131 Md. 265, 284, 101 A. 710 (1917). To decide whether the exercise of that power violated the Due Process Clause in this instance, we must determine whether the statute \u201cprovides a real and substantial relationship to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state.\u201d <em>Md. Bd. of Pharmacy v. Sav-A-Lot, </em>270 Md. 103, 106, 311 A. 2d 242 (1973) (citations omitted); <em>accord, Md. St. Bd. of Barber Ex. v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. 496, 511, 312 A. 2d 216 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Inclusion of public employees within the coverage of workmen\u2019s compensation, as provided in \u00a7 21 (a) (2), is manifestly a legitimate exercise of the police power because the legislation generally promotes the welfare of the citizens of Maryland. Absent constitutional infirmities, however, there is no requirement that the Legislature include all public employees within the coverage of those laws. The question, then, given inclusion of public employees within the coverage of Article 101, is whether the Legislature may restrict the circumstances in which an employee may receive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We believe that the General Assembly does possess that power. First, the Legislature could rationally have determined that since an employee suffers only one wage loss, he should receive the equivalent of only one disability benefit. As a corollary, the Legislature may have concluded that permitting a disabled employee to receive the full amount of both workmen\u2019s compensation and pension benefits would not promote the public welfare sufficiently to merit its authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Secondly, with an eye to budgetary constraints, the General Assembly may have found that only a limited amount of funds were available for wage-loss programs, and, therefore, that permitting some persons to recover \u201cdouble\u201d benefits would reduce the benefits others would receive. Consequently, the Legislature may have concluded that prohibiting \u201cdouble\u201d recovery would result in a fairer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>allocation of limited funds. In such situations, we do not pass judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">\u201c. . . [T]he Constitution does not empower this Court to second-guess state officials charged with the difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds among the myriad of potential recipients.\u201d <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U. S. 471, 487, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Viewed in terms of the property interest at stake,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mazor\u2019s contention fails for yet another reason. An employee covered by the statute has not such a right in benefits as to make every defeasance of an \u201caccrued\u201d interest violative of the Due Process Clause. <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U. S. 603, 611, 80 S. Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960). To engraft upon the pension and workmen\u2019s compensation programs a concept of accrued property rights would deprive these programs of the \u201cflexibility and boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions\u201d which they demand. <em>Id. </em>at 610. The analogy drawn between social welfare and property for purposes of procedural due process, <em>see Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U. S. 254, 262, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), \u201ccannot be stretched to impose a constitutional limitation on the power of Congress to make substantive changes in the law of entitlement to public benefits.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 U. S. 78, 81, 92 S. Ct. 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">We hold, therefore, that there was no such taking of private property without just compensation as would violate either the federal or state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Mazor contends further that \u00a7 33 deprives him of equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201cA statutory classification in the area of social welfare is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause ... if it is \u2018rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.\u2019 <em>[Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U. S. at 487].\u201d <em>Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 U. S. at 81. Since the Legislature is presumed to have acted within its constitutional limits, the constitutionality of the statute will be presumed unless a clear and convincing showing by the party assailing the legislative classification establishes that it neither bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose nor rests upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, but rather that it is essentially arbitrary. <em>Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54, 70, 79, 344 A. 2d 422 (1975); <em>Aero Motors v. Adm\u2019r, M.V.A., </em>274 Md. 567, 576-77, 337 A. 2d 685 (1975); <em>Matter of Trader, </em>272 Md. 364, 400, 325 A. 2d 398 (1974); <em>Md. St. Bd. of Barber Ex. v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. at 507; <em>Adm\u2019r Motor Veh. Adm. v. Vogt, </em>267 Md. 660, 677, 299 A. 2d 1 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">What we have said in disposing of the Due Process Clause issue is applicable here to demonstrate that a rational basis for the statute exists. <em>See Md. St. Bd. of Barber Ex. v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. at 512. Mazor asserts, within the context of the traditional equal protection standard, that the statute arbitrarily discriminates against him in two respects, but in our view the statute is free from any invidious discrimination. Noting that \u00a7 33 reduces or discharges the workmen\u2019s compensation obligations of only those employers enumerated in \u00a7 21 (a) (2), Mazor contends that \u201cpublic employees,\u201d but not \u201cprivate employees,\u201d suffer the hardship of reduction of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. This distinction alone, however, does not establish an invidious classification. To the contrary, the statute simply reflects the differences that do exist between public and private employees. Just as the Legislature may regulate the terms and conditions, for example, of the hiring, the duties, the pay and the promotion and discharge of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>employees, so too may it regulate the terms of their retirement or compensation for injury. That the Legislature has exercised the police power to regulate private industry in certain of these same areas \u2014 such as workmen\u2019s compensation \u2014 does not constitutionally mandate that public and private employees receive identical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Even where a pension plan in private industry is not subject to state regulation, it may nonetheless provide for reduction or discharge of the employer\u2019s obligation in the event the employee receives workmen\u2019s compensation. Indeed, many employment contracts so provide, 4 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 97.51, or provide for supplementation of statutory benefits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 97.52-.54. Thus, the ostensible discrimination created by the statute may not exist in fact. That the Legislature chose to reduce public employees\u2019 workmen\u2019s compensation benefits rather than their pension benefits may simply reflect an analysis of anticipated costs or administrative problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In further support of his equal protection claim, Mazor contends that \u00a7 33 treats some public employees differently from others. The first paragraph of the section, as applicable to this case, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cIn time of peace and while engaged in military service all officers and enlisted men of the organized militia of the State of Maryland shall be deemed workmen of the State for wages within the meaning of this section; provided that, whenever and so long as provision equal to or better than that given under the terms of this article is made by the federal government for an employee of the military department of Maryland injured in the course of employment, such employee shall not be entitled to the benefit of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Members of the militia, says Mazor, are not subject to setoff against their state pension, only their federal benefits. In our view, this interpretation of this provision is incorrect. The statute clearly states that members of the militia are employees \u201cwithin the meaning of <em>this section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>added). Thus, they too are subject to the offset provision in the succeeding paragraph of \u00a7 33, which we quoted earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The proviso in the paragraph in question does, of course, establish an offset, but only where the federal benefits are equal to or better than those provided by workmen\u2019s compensation. And therefore, before it was amended by Chapter 762, Laws of 1976, <em>see </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 33 (a), the offset established by this paragraph may well have permitted receipt of both workmen\u2019s compensation and federal benefits if the latter were not equal to or better than the former. <em>See Montgomery County v. Kaponin, </em>237 Md. 112, 205 A. 2d 292 (1964). Far from being arbitrary, however, this distinction, when made, stemmed from the unique circumstances and hazards of military employment. Significantly, the members of the militia may in an emergency be ordered into the active military service of the United States. Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 65, \u00a7 41. To the extent, therefore, that the statute permitted \u201cdouble\u201d recovery, it may have reflected the State\u2019s awareness of the services rendered to the State in time of need. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U. S. 361, 94 S. Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (conscientious objectors assigned to alternative civilian service may be excluded from certain veteran\u2019s education benefits offered for military service).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Finally, Mazor urges that \u00a7 33 impairs an obligation of contract in violation of Art. I, \u00a7 10 of the Federal Constitution. To sustain this argument, Mazor advances the contention that Art. 73B, \u00a7 16 establishes payment of the pension as a contractual obligation of the State; and that it is no answer to say that he would receive the full pension benefits, since it is equally improper to reduce his workmen\u2019s compensation benefits by applying his pension entitlement. With equal vigor, appellees contend that no contractual obligation exists, relying for their position on <em>Richardson v. Belcher, </em>404 U. S. 78, in which the Supreme Court held that the obligations of the federal government to pay social security disability benefits may be discharged by payment to the employee of workmen\u2019s compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>benefits. Indeed, appellees argue, the employer\u2019s position here is stronger because Mazor made no contributions to the pension. We need not decide whether Mazor\u2019s pension rights rise to the level of contract, since it is clear to us that even if they do, there has been no impairment of the State\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The only authority which Mazor cites for his contention that his contract rights are impaired regardless of which benefit is reduced is <em>City of Lincoln v. Steffensmeyer, </em>134 Neb. 613, 279 N. W. 272, 274-75 (1938). The court there held that the Nebraska statute did not prohibit Steffensmeyer from receiving both workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and a fireman\u2019s pension, and that therefore the order in which he <em>applied </em>for benefits was of no consequence. Quite obviously, <em>Steffensmeyer </em>cannot stand for the proposition that it is immaterial to which benefit a reduction <em>is applied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In our view, the statute here clearly indicates that it is the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which are to be reduced. Although both the pension and the workmen\u2019s compensation programs spring from the same purpose, to protect workers against the hardships of wage loss, the similarity ends there. The terms and conditions of eligibility for the benefits and awards differ widely between the two programs. Indeed, enactment of \u00a7 33 may have been a legislative response to our decision in <em>Montgomery County v. Kaponin, </em>237 Md. 112. <em>See Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md. App. at 350-52. In any event, it is manifest to us that reduction of workmen\u2019s compensation on the basis that a worker is receiving pension benefits is not equivalent to reduction of the pension itself. In sum, since there has been no reduction of Mazor\u2019s pension, there has been no impairment of a state obligation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">.

Mazor cross-claimed against the employer, insurer and Subsequent Injury Fund, asserting that he should have been adjudged permanently and totally disabled.

Mazor\u2019s contention is that the statute unconstitutionally deprives him of his pension, not of his workmen's compensation.

W. 272 (1938), Mazor claims that it makes no difference which benefit is actually reduced, for the effect is the same. We cannot agree.
