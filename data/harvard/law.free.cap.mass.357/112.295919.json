L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">A complaint charging the respondents with a violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, was filed with the commission by Mandred Henry of Worcester on November 8,1967. In his complaint, Henry, who had answered the respondents\u2019 newspaper advertisement for an apartment in Roslindale, alleged that the respondents refused to rent it to him because of his race and color. After an investigation and finding of probable cause pursuant to c. 151B, \u00a7 5, the commission ordered a hearing on the complaint. Following the hearing the commission rendered a decision entitled \u201cFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Orders.\u201d The commission found that the respondents had refused to rent an apartment to Henry (a Negro) because of his race, and that as a result of this refusal, Henry was caused mental suffering and was forced over a period of eighty-four days to commute from Worcester, where he lived, to Boston where he worked. In addition to ordering the respondents to cease racial discrimination in connection with the rental of housing accommodations, the commission ordered them to pay Henry damages totaling $844.50. These damages consisted of the cost of commuting and finding other housing ($94.50), his loss of time ($500), and $250 for mental suffering from the \u201cconsiderable frustration, anger and humiliation\u201d caused him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Thereafter the commission brought this petition for the enforcement of its order. The respondents did not seek review of the award of damages under c. 151B, \u00a7 5, third paragraph, nor did they seek review of the commission\u2019s order under c. 151B, \u00a7 6. A decree was entered enforcing the order by commanding the respondents to cease racial discrimination in the rental of housing accommodations. The decree, however, did not order the enforcement of the award of damages. Because of the court\u2019s refusal to include damages in its decree, the commission appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The commission 'contends that the Superior Court (1) did not have the power to refuse to order enforcement of the award and (2) that the award was one the commission was empowered to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The authority of the Superior Court with regard to the commission's orders derives from G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. The commission \u201cmay obtain an order\u201d for the enforcement of its orders by initiating a proceeding in the Superior Court. In such ajproceeding \u201cthe court shall have power ... to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in such transcript [of the commission's action] an order or decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The commission argues, however, that because c. 151B, \u00a7 5, provides for a separate review of damage awards, the Superior Court is precluded from setting aside or modifying orders of the commission awarding damages. Under \u00a7 5, a person aggrieved by an award of damages, \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of section six,\u201d within ten days of notice of the award, may seek a review in a District Court. The District Court \u201cshall hear witnesses, review such action, and determine whether or not upon all the evidence such an award was justified and thereafter affirm, modify or reverse the order of the commission. The decision of the court shall be final and conclusive upon all the parties as to all matters of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We think that the commission\u2019s contention conflicts with the plain meaning of \u00a7 6 and the provision in \u00a7 5 that the review there granted is \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of section six.\u201d The statute contains no language indicating that \u00a7 5 is the exclusive avenue of review of damage awards. Rather, the conclusion is unavoidable that the Legislature has chosen to provide two avenues for review of damage awards by the commission. The District Court review of the issue of damages was designed to afford an aggrieved party a simple,[expeditious review of a damage award where only that portion of an order was challenged. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>statutory scheme assures that in cases like the present, where the respondents are unable or unwilling to seek review under \u00a7 5 or \u00a7 6, the propriety of a damage award will still be reviewed by the Superior Court. We hold that the Superior Court\u2019s power under \u00a7 6 to modify or set aside \u201cin whole or in part,\u201d the commission\u2019s order includes the power to refuse to enforce a damage award, notwithstanding the respondents\u2019 failure to seek review under \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The commission\u2019s contention that its award of damages was proper must be sustained. Section 5 explicitly empowers the commission to award \u201cdamages not to exceed one thousand dollars, which damages shall include, <em>but shall not be limited to, </em>the expense incurred by the petitioner for obtaining alternative housing or space, for storage of goods and effects, for moving and for other costs actually incurred by him as a result of such unlawful practice or violation; provided, however, that such damages shall not include attorney\u2019s fees\u201d (emphasis supplied). We find nothing improper in the commission\u2019s exercise of that authority. Its order awarding damages was supported by substantial evidence and was not tainted by error of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court below could not properly disregard this portion of the order. There was evidence that the expenses incurred by the complainant in seeking other housing and in commuting were a direct consequence of the respondents\u2019 action. There was similarly a basis for the commission\u2019s finding that the complainant suffered frustration and humiliation as a result of the respondents\u2019 discrimination. In view of the statutory power of the commission, and the recognition in our cases that damages for mental suffering may be recovered in appropriate cases, <em>Meagher </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>99 Mass. 281 (wrongful removal of a child\u2019s body from its grave), <em>Fillebrown </em>v. <em>Hoar, </em>124 Mass. 580 (wrongful eviction), <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Lennox, </em>155 Mass. 70, 71 (discharge from employment), an award by the commission of $250 for mental suffering was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>not improper. The court below should have entered a decree incorporating the damages awarded by the commission. The decree is to be modified by adding a provision ordering the payment of the damages awarded by the commission, and, as so modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> Because the respondents had paid to the complainant the sum of $175 pursuant to prior conciliation proceedings (see \u00a7 5), this amount was deducted from the award of damages, making the total $669.50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\"> Section 6 provides that the \u201corder or decision of the commission shall be reviewed in accordance with the standards for review provided in paragraph (8) [of G, L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14].\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
