Her father seeks consequential damages. There were verdicts for the defendant and the plaintiffs excepted. The minor plaintiff suffered a cardiac arrest while under anesthesia during the course of a tonsillectomy which, following resuscitation, left her with severe and extensive brain damage. No salutary purpose would be served by a recitation of the operative procedures employed to revive the minor plaintiff, for the plaintiffs\u2019 brief and argument and the bill of exceptions bring but one question to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">The trial judge charged the jury in part: \u201cNow, when a person is confronted with an emergency \u2014 and I say a \u2018person\u2019 \u2014 it might be a lay person or it may be a person practicing his profession as the defendant doctors in this case, who were in the operating room \u2014 his conduct is to be judged or to be measured as the skill and care and due diligence \u2014 due care with respect to the emergency which confronts him \u2014 and he is still obliged to act with due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>care and skill; but it must be taken into consideration, the fact of the emergency, and that in such case the person does not have the time to think that . . . [he] would ordinarily have; and due consideration must be given to that element of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cA person who is confronted with an emergency is bound to use due care, bearing in mind that it is not the usual \u2014 there is not the usual time for thought and consideration of his actions as there would be if there was not an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The plaintiffs allege error in this portion of the charge in that a cardiac arrest is a complication which is a constant possibility in surgery and is not to be considered \u201can emergency within the meaning of the emergency doctrine.\u201d They argue that it was for the jury \u201cto decide whether or not the cardiac arrest presented an emergency under the emergency doctrine\u201d and that the trial judge should have \u201cgiven them the appropriate standards by which to make a judgment.\u201d The fault which the plaintiffs find with the judge\u2019s charge is that it assumed the emergency. See <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>224 Mass. 420; <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>318 Mass. 153; <em>Barton </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>332 Mass. 345; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Redstone, </em>354 Mass. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"Adf\">We are not of opinion that there was error. There were repeated references in the testimony to such a cardiac arrest as an \u201cemergency\u201d; in fact, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in questioning medical \"witnesses so referred to the occurrence on several occasions. The opening sentence of that portion of the charge excepted to did not assume the emergency. We read its meaning to be that if an emergency did exist, a fact left to the determination of the jury, the defendant then and in that event was held to the exercise of a certain standard of care. A reading of the entire charge convinces us that it was a sound statement of the law not to be disturbed by a strained reading of the fragment to which the plaintiffs call our attention. <em>Goltz </em>v. <em>Besarick, </em>313 Mass. 14, 17. <em>Haven </em>v. <em>Brimfield, </em>345 Mass. 529, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
