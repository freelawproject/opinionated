L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, by package store licensees against the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABC). The ABC had found violations of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, and suspended their licenses. The Superior Court quashed the decisions of the ABC, and the ABC appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">In both cases it was established that the petitioners had sold alcoholic beverages at a price below that posted on the shelf. According to a stipulation in each case, the posted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>shelf price was in fact equal to the minimum consumer price as then approved for the alcoholic beverages in question under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25C. There was no evidence showing that there was a price list elsewhere in the store. The ABC charged each petitioner with a violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, by selling alcoholic beverages at a price other than that stated on the current posted price list. The judge in the Superior Court found no substantial evidence of a violation of \u00a7 15 because there was no showing that the shelf prices were posted pursuant to \u00a7 15, rather than \u00a7 25C, which also provides for the posting of prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The question for decision is whether a violation of \u00a7 15 exists on proof that an alcoholic beverage is sold below the shelf price, when that price is also the same as that approved by the ABC under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25C. Both \u00a7 15 and \u00a7 25C require the posting of prices and forbid the sale of alcoholic beverages at a price below those posted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioners argue that since the posted price was exactly the same as the \u201cminimum consumer price\u201d required by \u00a7 25C, this is not proof that the price posted was the \u00a7 15 price. We disagree. Since there is a duty to post prices under both \u00a7 15 and \u00a7 25C, there would normally be two prices posted if a licensee chose, as he could, to sell alcoholic beverages at a price above the minimum set by \u00a7 25C. A licensee may sell at a price higher than the minimum set by \u00a7 25C (see <em>T. J. Hartnett Beverages Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>350 Mass. 619, 622), but both the actual retail price under \u00a7 15 and the minimum approved price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>under \u00a7 25C must be posted. Where the posted shelf price is equivalent to the \u00a7 25C approved minimum price, and there is no other price list posted, the ABC could have found that the posted price was also the current posted price list required by \u00a7 15. See <em>H. Hollander Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>327 Mass. 390, 392. Since the \u00a7 15 and \u00a7 25C prices could be equivalent, a single price posted, as here, conspicuously under the shelf where the alcoholic beverages are displayed satisfies the posting requirements of both sections. As indicated above, there was no evidence that there was any price list other than the shelf list.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">It has been suggested that we reexamine our decision in <em>T. J. Hartnett Beverage Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>350 Mass. 619, holding that \u00a7 15 was not impliedly repealed by \u00a7 25C. We perceive no reason for modifying that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">It follows that the decrees of the court below quashing the decisions of the ABC must be reversed, and new decrees entered affirming these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"> Section 15, as amended through St. 1938, c. 353, reads in part, \u201cEvery licensee hereunder shall keep conspicuously posted in each room where any alcoholic beverages are sold a price list of such beverages ....
