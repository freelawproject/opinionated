The reviewing board (board), after hearing additional impartial evidence, reduced the award of $4,000 by the single member to $1,820, plus interest from May 10, 1966, to the date of payment by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">We summarize the relevant facts found by the single member. On October 26, 1956, the employee, while attempting to pour hot molten metal into a mould was splashed in the face, particularly into his left eye causing extensive burns of the cornea and lower fid. The employee \u201cwas paid total incapacity compensation at a rate of $35.00 a week . . . plus dependency compensation at the rate of $2.50 a week until February 3, 1957.\u201d Three qualified ophthalmologists examined the employee, and as a result of their opinions the single member stated, \u201cparticularly tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ing into consideration the opinion of . . . [\u00a1one James J. Cammisa, M.D-3,1 find that this employee has a permanent reduction of visual acuity in his left eye to 20/70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">After the decision by the single member, the insurer filed a claim for review. Following the hearing on review, the board, under the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 9, appointed one Benjamin Sachs, M.D., as duly qualified and impartial physician to examine the employee. The report of Dr. Sachs was duly received by the board and copies thereof were furnished to the insurer and the employee. Thereafter, the board, based on Dr. Sachs\u2019s opinion, found that \u201cthe employee\u2019s vision in his left eye as a result of his injury has been reduced to 20/40 corrected with glasses\u201d and ordered the \u201cinsurer [\u00a1to3 pay to the employee compensation under section 36 (e) at the rate of $20 a week for a period of 91 weeks in the amount of $1820 ... in a bulk sum,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The insurer contends that \u201cthe decree of the Superior Court was erroneous in form as well as in substance.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The board, acting under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 9, is empowered \u201cto order an examination by an impartial physician after the statutory hearing had been held.\u201d <em>Benham\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 196, 198. The report of a physician so appointed \u201cshall be admissible as evidence in any proceeding before the division . . . provided that the employee and the insurer have seasonably been furnished with copies thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We are of opinion that \u201c[\u00a1t3he decision of the reviewing board superseded that of the single member and must be accepted as final\u201d-because it is supported by evidence and not tainted by error of law. <em>Webb\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 357, 358. <em>Ritchie\u2019s Case, </em>351 Mass. 495, 496. \u201cThe Superior Court has no authority to review the finding of the board and [to3 adopt that of the single member in preference to that of the board.\u201d <em>Di Giovanni\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 241, 242. <em>Ritchie\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The decree is reversed. A decree is to enter in the Superior Court in accordance with the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
