Hamel </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b680-14\"><em>John </em>J. <em>Ryan, III, </em>City Solicitor <em>(Ashod N.

The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The demurrer was rightly sustained. In short, there was no \u201cpromise\u201d by the city as alleged in the declaration. We see no sound reason for overriding <em>Tainter </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>123 Mass. 311, where it was held that the city by providing fire protection made no contract with, and assumed no liability to, the owners of property to furnish water for the extinguishment of fires. At p. 317, it was said that the plaintiff \u201chas no right of action against the city . . . for neglecting to maintain the hydrant, or for cutting off its supply of water.\u201d One ground of decision was that the waterworks \u201cwere, so far as related to safeguards against fire, to be erected and maintained by the city for the benefit of the public and without pecuniary compensation or emolument\u201d (p. 316).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The principle that there is a distinction between the extent of the municipality\u2019s undertaking in the case of a governmental function, such as fire protection, and its undertaking in the case of a commercial function has continued to prevail in this Commonwealth. <em>Galassi Mosaic &amp; Tile Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Boston, </em>295 Mass. 544, 551. <em>Sloper </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>301 Mass. 20, 23-24. <em>Baumgardner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>304 Mass. 100, 104-105. <em>Galluzzi </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>309 Mass. 135, 138. <em>Harvard Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 227, 229. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>331 Mass. 119, 123. See <em>Boston Safe-Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Salem Water Co. </em>94 Fed. 238, 240 (N. D. Ohio). Nothing is held to the contrary in <em>Cole Drug Co. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>326 Mass. 199. See especially page 201. The same general principle continues to be widely observed elsewhere. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Gilbertson, </em>16 Alaska, 590, 598. <em>Stang </em>v. <em>Mill Valley, </em>38 Cal. 2d 486. <em>Yowell </em>v. <em>Lebanon Waterworks Co. </em>254 Ky. 345, 347. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>81 N. H. 369. <em>Springfield Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Keeseville, </em>148 N. Y. 46. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Greenville, </em>159 N. C. 632. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Devil\u2019s Lake, </em>87 N. W. 2d 401 (N. D.). <em>Nashville Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Nashville, </em>182 Tenn. 545, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Any change in the policy of this Commonwealth extending the undertaking of municipalities so as to create liability to individual property owners for damage caused by inadequacies in the system of fire protection, must lie with the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>Order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
