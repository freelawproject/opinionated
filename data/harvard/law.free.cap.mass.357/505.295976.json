L. c. 58, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1960, c. 593, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the fair cash value of all land in the town of Amherst owned by the Commonwealth and used by the University of Massachusetts on January 1, 1967, was $792,800. This determination was made for the purpose of computing a payment from the Commonwealth to the town in lieu of taxes, as provided in G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 17. The board of assessors of Amherst (assessors), who had assessed the value of the university land (exclusive of buildings) at $9,868,200, applied to the Appellate Tax Board (board) for a correction of the determination. G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 14. After a hearing at which both parties presented evidence, the board decided that the fair cash value of the land in question was $1,342,610. It also, at the request of the assessors, made findings of fact and a report. From this decision the assessors appealed under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The basis of the assessors\u2019 appeal is certain rulings of law made by the board and the denial of certain rulings requested by the assessors. These raise two issues: (1) Did the board correctly interpret \u201cfair cash value of all land\u201d as used in \u00a7 13; (2) did the board err in allegedly relying on \u201cknowledge\u201d from a previous case between the parties?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>1. In reaching its decision, the board interpreted \u201cfair cash value\u201d as used in \u00a7 13 to mean in substance the assessed value, rather than the market value, of the land in question. It further found that \u201cland\u201d meant \u201cland\u201d in its original state, that is, exclusive of buildings, and un-enhanced by grading, drainage, utility, and all other improvements. It justified this interpretation, which varies from the usual meaning accorded these words elsewhere in the General Laws, by reference to the history of c. 58, \u00a7 13. The assessors, however, contend that as a matter of law such interpretation was erroneous because it modified, without justification, the \u201ccommon and approved meaning\u201d of the terms. In the assessors\u2019 view \u201cfair cash value\u201d can only mean the highest price which a hypothetical, willing buyer would pay to a hypothetical, willing seller in an assumed free and open market. See <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>317 Mass. 297, 299. The assessors contend that \u201cland\u201d means the land as it exists on the date of valuation, including all improvements, exclusive of buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The resolution of this controversy depends on the meaning of \u201cfair cash value of all land\u201d as used in c. 58, \u00a7 13. Ordinarily statutory words and phrases are to be construed according to \u201cthe common and approved usage of the language\u201d unless \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent of the law-making body.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. The words \u201cfair cash value of all land\u201d is controlled by the common and approved meaning of those words in other contexts, absent a contrary legislative intent. <em>Pacific Wool Growers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>305 Mass. 197, 199. The governing statutes require the Commonwealth to make annual payments to the town as reimbursement \u201cfor loss of taxes\u201d on land owned by the Commonwealth and used by public institutions, including the University of Massachusetts. The amount of the Commonwealth\u2019s payment is computed from a valuation of the land made every five years by the commission, which is then multiplied by a rate fixed by c. 63, \u00a7 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">A. Although the reimbursement scheme is unique, we are of opinion that the board erred in its interpretation of \u201cfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>cash value\u201d as the equivalent of \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d Nothing in the statute\u2019s history evinces a legislative intent that \u201cfair cash value\u201d was to be used in any but its ordinary sense. Indeed language in other sections of the statute indicates that the legislative intent was to use \u201cfair cash value\u201d in its usual sense. General Laws c. 58, \u00a7 15, provides for the valuation of land acquired by the State in the periods between valuations by the commission. It states that \u201cthe commission shall adopt the <em>assessed valuation </em>of said land made in the year last preceding such acquisition . . . until a <em>new valuation </em>is made by the commission\u201d (emphasis added). Such language clearly distinguishes \u201cfair cash value\u201d from \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d It also suggests that the commission\u2019s \u201cnew valuation\u201d is other than the \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The board\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature had a contrary intent is not convincing. It cites first the statute\u2019s legislative history as evidence that \u201cfair cash value\u201d was not to have its ordinary meaning. The governing statute, c. 58, \u00a7\u00a7 13-17B, derives from St. 1910, c. 607. In c. 66 of the Resolves of 1909, the Legislature directed the commissioner to investigate and report on the effect of tax exemptions for the property of educational institutions on the financial status of the cities and towns wherein they were located. It further directed the commissioner to recommend appropriate legislation. The commissioner\u2019s report, a sixty-eight page document, with the bill attached to it entitled \u201cAn Act relative to the reimbursement of certain cities and towns,\u201d was filed as 1910 House Bill No. 1395. This bill with only minor alterations was enacted as St. 1910, c. 607, the predecessor of \u00a7 13 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The board reasoned that this report shows conclusively that the meaning of \u201cfair cash value\u201d was \u201cassessed valuation\u201d and that in enacting the bill, recommended by the commissioner, the Legislature adopted this meaning. An examination of the report, however, does not support this interpretation. The only direct reference in the report to the valuation of land by the commissioner reads: \u201cIn the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>herewith submitted (Appendix D) I have with some hesitation provided that the <em>valuation of such land </em>should be made by the Tax Commissioner. He is probably the one officer of the Commonwealth in closest touch with property valuations, with boards of assessors and with the basis of valuation in the different municipalities\u201d (emphasis added). The board concluded from this statement that conferring upon the commissioner the duty of valuation usually performed by the assessors would insure equal valuation of State and private land for tax purposes. In the board\u2019s view, the commissioner was to determine the assessed valuation of the property, in order to avoid disparities in the assessment of State and private land, which might result if the assessment of both were left to local authorities. Such disparities could result in the Commonwealth\u2019s bearing a disproportionate tax burden, a result in conflict with the statute\u2019s purpose of reimbursement for taxes <em>lost. </em>The board thus concluded that \u201cfair cash value\u201d as used in 1910 House Bill No. 1395 meant \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The board\u2019s conclusions are unwarranted. Nothing in the language quoted suggests that \u201cvaluation\u201d means \u201cassessed valuation.\u201d The reference to the commissioner\u2019s expertise and knowledge of varying local practices merely qualifies him, rather than the local officials, as the appropriate person to determine the \u201cfair cash value\u201d of State land. Nor are the abuses envisaged by the board likely to occur if fair cash value carries its usual meaning. We recently decided in <em>Bettigole </em>v. <em>Assessors of Springfield, </em>343 Mass. 223, that all land must be assessed at full, fair cash value. It is, of course, not intended that Amherst shall shift a larger burden of municipal taxes to the Commonwealth by assessing privately owned property at less than full, fair cash value.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no basis either in the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ute\u2019s Mstory or purpose for the conclusion that the Legislature intended to give \u201cfair cash value\u201d other than its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">B. Contrary to the commission\u2019s argument, there is no basis for the conclusion that the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 13 intended \u201cland\u201d to have any but the \u201ccommon and approved\u201d meaning it has when used in valuation contexts. In valuating land for purposes of tax assessment and eminent domain awards, \u201cland\u201d generally comprehends the improvements made to it. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>166 Mass. 53, 56. <em>Vineyard Grove Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Bluffs, </em>265 Mass. 270, 277. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 3. The commission, however, relies on the legislative history of \u00a7 13 for its contention that the legislative intent was to employ \u201cland\u201d in the narrow sense of unimproved land. 1910 House Bill No. 1395 explains the exclusion of buildings from the commissioner\u2019s valuation on the ground that since they are paid for by the Commonwealth \u201cno town can properly claim that it ever had any right to tax them.\u201d The report then states: \u201cBut for the action of the State no part of the value of the buildings and furnishings would ever have been in the towns. The basis for reimbursement thus becomes the value <em>of the land taken by the Commonwealth\u201d </em>(emphasis added). If buildings are excluded because they are a product of the State\u2019s use of the land, it follows \u2014 so it is contended \u2014 that the value of all improvements made to the land must also be excluded. Improvements, it is said, like buildings, result from State activity, and therefore cannot properly be claimed by the towns to be taxable as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We are of opinion, however, that the quoted section of the report does not control the scope of \u201cland\u201d as used in \u00a7 13. That language is addressed only to the exclusion of buildings from the valuation scheme. Applying similar reasoning to improvements, while logically consistent, conflicts with the statute\u2019s purpose of reimbursement for lost taxes. For State use of the land diminishes tax revenues in two ways. First, unimproved land otherwise generative of tax revenue is exempt from taxation; and second, the higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>tax yield resulting from improvements to that land is also lost because of the land\u2019s tax exempt status. The amount of tax revenue lost by State use of land thus is not to be measured solely by the original unimproved value of the land, but also includes the improvements which, if made, would raise the land\u2019s value and corresponding tax yield. The Legislature, in excluding buildings from the commissioner\u2019s valuation, has made a policy decision that the reimbursement shall not be fully compensatory. But we think that, within the limits of reimbursement set by the exclusion of buildings, the statutory purpose is best fulfilled by making that reimbursement compensatory so far as possible. It follows that \u201cland\u201d must be interpreted to include improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">2. The board in reaching its decision stated: \u201cOn the basis of all the facts found, as stated above, and the careful view taken by the board, as well as its <em>general familiarity with the area based on the former trial, </em>the board found that the fair market value . . . was $1,342,610\u201d (emphasis supplied) . The assessors contend that the italicized words show that the board relied on matters not before it, of which it could not take judicial notice, and which the assessors were not able to contest, all in derogation of its right to due process of law. We disagree. We interpret these words as meaning no more than that the board has merely indicated its former acquaintance with the particularities of the area through a case between the same parties in 1962. So interpreted, the challenged statement cannot be regarded as meaning that the board based its decision on evidence not introduced as such at the hearing. It was not, therefore, obnoxious to our holding in <em>Boott Mills </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation &amp; Arbitration, </em>311 Mass. 223, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The board\u2019s decision is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\"> Provisions of this section here pertinent are: \u201cIn nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and in every fifth year thereafter, the commission shall, between January first and June first, determine as of January first the fair cash value of all land in every town owned by the commonwealth and used for the purposes of . . . the University of Massachusetts . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\"> The Commission refers in its brief to an alleged disparity in the assessors\u2019 valuation of State and private land. It appears that one and one-quarter square miles of university land was valued at $9,868,200 while about twenty-six and one-half square miles of taxable private land was valued at only $11,250,000. If in fact the town is not assessing all land, State and private, at fair cash value, then the Commonwealth may bring appropriate proceedings to compel compliance with the principles of the <em>Bettigole </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
