The case was tried subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, and is here by way of appeal. The defendant filed twenty-three assignments of error but argues only seven of them. Those assignments not argued are deemed waived. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kleciak, </em>350 Mass. 679, 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">On Saturday, May 11, 1968, between 6 and 6:30 p.m. Richard Webber, the victim, left the North Quincy Taxi Company office, where he was employed as a driver. He was next seen by one Barbara Bennett, a waitress and bartender at the Quincy Lounge, Quincy, when she reported for work at 6:45 p.m. The defendant \u201ccame in\u201d after Mrs. Bennett had gone on duty as the bartender. One Victor J. Barbati, an owner of the Quincy Lounge, arrived at the lounge \u201c[b]etween eight and 8:30.\u201d Following Barbati\u2019s arrival, the defendant and Webber exchanged words, after which \u201cthey grabbed each other and . . . fell ... to the floor. . . . Webber was on the floor on his back . . . [[and the defendant] was on top of him.\u201d Barbati then went over to the two men \u201cand tried to break . . . up\u201d the fight. He \u201cpulled\u201d the defendant off Webber and \u201ctried to . . . take him out of the bar. \u2019 \u2019 However, Webber <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>got up and charged towards . . . [[the defendant], swinging at . . . [[him].\u201d The defendant then broke away from Barbati and the two men \u201cstarted . . . fighting again.\u201d The fight was finally stopped and the defendant was \u201cpulled . . . outside the door.\u201d In the.interim Webber.left the lounge and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ceeded in the direction of \u201cthe North Quincy cab stand, Quincy Square.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On that same evening, one John A. Davis, the night dispatcher for the North Quincy Taxi Company \u201ccame to work\u201d at 5 p.m. When Davis arrived, Webber was then at the office on \u201cstand-by duty,\u201d waiting to see whether \u201che may have been needed to drive at' night.\u201d Webber left the stand \u2018 \u2018 between 6:00 and 6:30\u2019 \u2019 p.m. The taxi company office was equipped with a two-way radio, a desk, a pair of telephones and other equipment. On the evening in question Davis, as was his custom, went out of the office and \u201cscrewed in\u201d the light on the \u201cleft-hand side of the . . . building.\u201d Prior to 8:30 p.m. he noticed that the street lights were on and the lighting was \u201cexcellent.\u201d About 9 p.m. Webber \u201creturned to the cab stand. . . . He looked nervous and afraid ... his clothes were disarranged, and he had a couple of marks on him.\u201d After Webber entered the office, he walked to the desk where Davis was sitting \u201cpicked up the phone . . . dropped . . . [it], and . . . was fumbling around with different objects on the desk.\u201d When Webber entered the office he left the door open and Davis observed the defendant approaching the building. After talking with Davis, Webber \u201cstepped outside the cab stand.\u201d The defendant was then standing \u201cabout twelve or fifteen feet\u201d from the office, when Webber left the building. Webber was \u201cyelling, \u2018[l]eave me alone, stay away from me, stay away from me, leave me alone.\u2019\u201d The defendant stepped up on the curb holding a forty-five calibre automatic im his hand. He had \u201cthe gun in around his chest area, ... he pulled . . . [it] up . . . leveled it toward . . . Webber who was running, and he shot.\u201d Davis \u201cducked\u201d under the desk after the shot was fired. As he arose he saw the defendant turn and run. Shortly thereafter Davis \u201cwent out and put . . . [his] sweater over . . . Webber.\u201d The cause of Webber\u2019s death was \u201ca gunshot wound of the heart.\u201d A forty-five calibre bullet was removed from his \u201clefhfront chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">At the time the shooting occurred one Sean O\u2019Brien, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>driver for the taxi company, was also present at the office and his testimony substantially corroborated Davis\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">1. Assignments 12 and 13 claim error in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress \u201cthe identification testimony\u201d of the witnesses O\u2019Brien and Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The defendant argues that the improper identification procedure involving the photographs and \u201cthe display of photographs of the defendant to the two eyewitnesses to the murder in the absence of the defendant\u2019s retained counsel\u201d were respectively a denial of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and a violation of the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We shall first discuss the propriety of the identification procedures. On Sunday, May 12, 1968, O\u2019Brien, in the presence of defence counsel, observed the defendant at a lineup containing nine men which was conducted at the Quincy police station. Although O\u2019Brien recognized the defendant, he did not identify him at that time. On the following Tuesday O\u2019Brien called the district attorney and subsequently went to his office. O\u2019Brien discussed the case for about an hour with the district attorney and with one Lieutenant John Regan of the State police. During this meeting O\u2019Brien was not shown any photographs of the defendant. The next day two State police officers came to O\u2019Brien\u2019s home and told him that they had a picture of the lineup O\u2019Brien had viewed the previous Sunday. Before O\u2019Brien was shown the photograph, he told the officers that the defendant was the \u201cfourth one in on the right as you are looking at the photo.\u201d O\u2019Brien then drew a circle around the defendant\u2019s picture. At the trial O\u2019Brien was asked the following question: \u201cAt the time you saw . . . [[the defendant] at the Quincy [jp]olice [s]tation in the lineup, is there any question in your mind that you were able to recognize the defendant . . .?\u201d He replied, \u201cThe minute I saw him in the lineup I recognized him.\u201d He did not identify the defendant at that time because he \u201cwas scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The defendant maintains that his position in the lineup suggested the defendant to O\u2019Brien. The evidence, however, readily answers this contention. Although the defendant was the fourth man from the right, immediately adjacent to three policemen who were known to O\u2019Brien, he was immediately recognized by O\u2019Brien. In these circumstances we believe that the defendant\u2019s placement in the lineup was not so \u201c-unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to be a denial of due process of law. <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, Warden, </em>388 U. S. 293, 301-302. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We next discuss the identification of the defendant by Davis. On the evening the shooting took place Davis told the police he did not think he could identify the individual who did the shooting'because \u201che did not get a good look at his face.\u201d On May 12, 1968, Davis, at the request of the police, went to the police station. He was shown \u00e1 \u201c[picture of a lineup,\u201d but he did not identify the de-. fendant. Following this visit Davis knew that the defendant had been arrested and he had seen a television clip showing the defendant being taken into custody. Between three and five days after the shooting, Davis was visited by two State police officers and was shown a photograph of the lineup viewed by O\u2019Brien. Davis did not make an identification at that time. On Sunday, May 19, 1968, Davis was again requested to come to the police station and was shown two \u201cface view\u201d photographs of the defendant. Again Davis did not identify the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On May 24, 1968, Davis finally identified the defendant at a probable cause hearing held at the Quincy District Court. It is well recognized that \u201cconvictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside . . . only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 384. Davis testified that he had several opportunities to observe the defendant. He \u201csaw the full view\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s face, accurately described the defendant\u2019s physical appearance, and the clothing the defendant was wearing at the time of the shooting. At the trial Davis was asked the following question in cross-examination: \u201c[I]s it fair to say . . . that . . . last May 11, 1968 you weren't sure of the identification of . . . [[the defendant] but that you are today?\u201d Davis replied that this was not so. He stated that he did not identify the pictures of the defendant because he \u201cwas very much afraid of repercussions about this . . . [for] his family and himself.\u201d Although Davis admitted that on the night the shooting took place he told the police he \u201cdidn\u2019t get a good look\u201d at the defendant\u2019s face, he said the reason he told this to the police at that time was because he \u201cwas afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Even assuming that the identification procedure was improper we are of opinion that the \u201cin-court identifications [[of the defendant] had an independent origin.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 242. Davis\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant was \u201cpurged of the primary taint\u201d of any improper identification procedure. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>at 241. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74, 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We now consider the defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings. We recognize that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may apply to <em>\u201cany </em>pretrial confrontation of the accused to determine whether the presence of his counsel is necessary to preserve the defendant\u2019s basic right to a fair trial as affected by his right meaningfully to cross-examine the witnesses against him and to have effective assistance of counsel at the trial itself.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>at 227. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Assuming that the exhibition of the defendant\u2019s photograph to the witnesses was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings, we do not believe that the absence of defence counsel at that confrontation resulted in \u201csubstantial preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>dice to the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>at 227. Even if the identification procedures are assumed to have been in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the witnesses are not precluded \u201cfrom making valid in-court identifications.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>at 84. The Commonwealth has the opportunity to establish that the in-court identifications stemmed from observations of the defendant at a time other than the improper photographic display. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>at 240. We believe that O\u2019Brien and Davis each had ample opportunity to observe the defendant at the time of the shooting. It is reasonable to conclude that their failure to identify the defendant did not result from their inability to identify him, but stemmed solely from their fear of identifying him. We note, too, that at the trial the defendant was given broad latitude in the cross-examination of Davis and O\u2019Brien regarding their observations of the defendant at the time of the shooting. The defendant was also permitted to extensively cross-examine the witnesses in an attempt to determine what effect, if any, the viewing of the photographs may have had on their in-court identifications of him. In these circumstances, we are of opinion that although the defendant was not represented by counsel at the pretrial photographic confrontation, the absence of counsel was harmless error. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18. There was no error in denying the motions to suppress the in-court identifications of the' defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">2. Assignments 1, 2 and 4 are based on the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions \u201cto be furnished with exculpatory evidence\u201d and \u201cfor production of the Police Department reports.\u201d No exception was taken to the denial of the motion to be furnished with exculpatory evidence. Nevertheless because this is a capital case, we also consider the motion regarding the exculpatory evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>353 Mass. 409, 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The defendant contends that the Commonwealth suppressed \u201ctwo pieces of relevant evidence,\u201d a television clip showing the defendant being arrested and the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Davis made to the police that he doubted he could recognize the individual who did the shooting as \u201che did not get a good look at his face.\u201d He also claims \u201c[t]here is the probability that had the film been viewed by the Court and the statement by Davis admitted on the motion to suppress, . . . [Davis\u2019s] testimony would have been excluded.\u201d The defendant further asserts, \u201c[t]here is also the possibility that if the film was shown it may have been so susceptible to the vice of suggestion as to have excluded both in-court identifications by Davis and O\u2019Brien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">At the time of the voir dire hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the identification testimony it seems clear that the Commonwealth had possession of the television film. It was not produced at the hearing and the defendant, at that time, did not request that it be produced so that the judge might view it. However, the evidence disclosed that although Davis had seen the film, his identification of the defendant at the probable cause hearing had not been affected thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">We have difficulty in following the defendant\u2019s argument that had the film clip been shown to the court not only would Davis\u2019s in-court identification have been excluded, but O\u2019Brien\u2019s in-court identification would also have been excluded. There was no evidence that O\u2019Brien had ever seen the film. In fact, on cross-examination the defendant did not even ask O\u2019Brien if he had seen the film. In these circumstances, we do not agree with the defendant that the showing of the film would have resulted in the exclusion of the in-court identifications by either Davis or O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s argument that the statement of Davis in the police report was exculpatory. The report shows that Davis said he \u201cdoubted\u201d that he could recognize the fellow who did the shooting as he \u201cdid not get a good look at his face.\u201d The instant case differs substantially from <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 83, relied on by the defendant. In that case the prosecution withheld a co-defendant\u2019s confession to the murder with which the defendant was charged and found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Even if we assume that the statement was exculpatory, and although we are unaware of any reason for the judge\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant\u2019s motion at the trial, the Commonwealth made the police report available to the defendant after direct examination of Davis because it felt that it was \u201cpossibly of exculpatory nature.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant had the opportunity to use, and did use, the contents of the report as a basis for an extended cross-examination of Davis on this point. The report was used to full advantage in an attempt to impeach the credibility of Davis\u2019s identification. We are of opinion there was no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">3. Assignment 14 states that \u201cthe trial judge erred in unduly restricting the scope of the voir dire on the motions to suppress identification testimony ... by refusing to let defense counsel cross-examine the witnesses who testified and introduce evidence on behalf of the defendant.\u201d The defendant contends that these restrictions constituted \u201ca denial of due process of law.\u201d He argues that \u201cit is unrealistic to rule that . . . Qie] cannot cross-examine police officers who are hostile to him.\u201d Once again it is difficult to follow the defendant\u2019s argument. In the first place, it is unnecessary for a defendant to show that a police officer, \u00e1 witness for the Commonwealth, is hostile in order to permit the defendant to cross-examine him. Secondly, the transcript reveals that at the voir dire the defendant was not only permitted to cross-examine the <em>one </em>police officer called by the Commonwealth, but that the cross-examination was conducted without a single interruption by either the prosecutor or the court. In any event, the extent of cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>examination rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coshnear, </em>289 Mass. 516, 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We now turn to the defendant's claim that he was \u201cforbidden to cross-examine . . . witnesses [for the Commonwealth],\u201d who \u201chad made a substantial showing of hostility when . . . [the defendant] attempted to interview them.\u201d This contention is directed at the defendant's voir dire examinations of Davis and O'Brien. However, Davis and O\u2019Brien were called as witnesses for the defence. \u201cRulings on whether a witness is hostile and whether cross-examination of the witness by his proponent should ... be permitted are within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>349 Mass. 139, 162-163. There is no evidence that the witnesses were hostile. During an interview with the defendant, Davis explained that he preferred not to answer any questions concerning the shooting at that time because he wanted to explain the circumstances \u201cin court one time and one time alone.\u201d While O\u2019Brien admittedly refused to be interviewed by the defendant, the refusal is not necessarily proof of hostility. There was no evidence that O'Brien was biased against the defendant. Even on the occasions when the defendant was prevented from cross-examining his own witnesses, he did not raise the question of their being hostile. We perceive no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Our final consideration under this assignment of error deals with the defendant's contention that the judge wrongfully \u201cexcluded the script of the newscast of the . . . [defendant\u2019s] arrest\u201d because of the film\u2019s relevancy on the issue of suggestive identification. It seems to us that the script without the showing of the newscast would not be admissible. If the film had been admitted in evidence as it should have been, the script would be admissible. Nevertheless, as heretofore outlined, because of the extensive cross-examination permitted the defendant regarding the film, any error relating to either the film clip or its accompanying script was harmless. Reviewing all of the evidence in proper context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>leads us to conclude that there was no \u201cdenial of due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">4. Assignment 9 is based on the judge\u2019s failure to permit \u201cdefense counsel an opportunity to state his reasons for objecting to the impanelment of the juror, Francis E. McGinty, outside of the presence and hearing of the jury.\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, there is no reason to \u201cbelieve that . . . McGinty would not be a suitable juror because of his familiarity with the locale and the facts of the case.\u201d The defendant did not challenge the juror, but stated that he had \u201cadditional questions\u201d which he thought were \u201cpertinent.\u201d The judge inquired whether the fact that the juror came from Quincy was \u201ca factor\u201d and the defendant\u2019s counsel replied in the affirmative. After this colloquy the judge permitted him to approach the bench. After the conference, and apparently at the defendant\u2019s suggestion, the judge asked McGinty if he had read about the shooting. McGinty replied, \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever having read anything about it.\u201d The judge then declared him \u201cindifferent.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s reliance on the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crehan, </em>345 Mass. 609, 612-613, is unfounded. The discussion between the defendant and the judge regarding the empanellment of McGinty was not of a nature to have a prejudicial effect on the jury or to influence them in any way. We are satisfied that \u201cp]n all respects the judge was meticulous to insure the empanelling of a jury free from bias.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Finally, mindful of the obligation imposed by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended by St. 1962, c. 453, we have reviewed the entire record with great care and are of opinion that justice does not require a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\"> See <em>Foster </em>v. <em>California, </em>394 U. S. 440.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> The record discloses that after the police report containing Davis\u2019s statement was given to defence counsel the following discussion took place at the bench: The Court. \u201cDo you want time to look them over before you start your cross-examination or not?\u201d Counsel for the defendant. \u201cJudge, I suppose I should.\u201d The Court. \u201cDo you or not want time to look them over?\u201d Counsel for the defendant. \u201cCan I have a five-minute recess, please?\u201d The Court. \u201cI said do you want time. If you do, then I will rule.\u201d Counsel for the defendant. \u201cYes.\u201d The Court. \u201cYou want time?\u201d Counsel for the defendant. \u201cYes.\u201d The Court. \u201cAll right.\u201d (End of bench proceeding.) The Court. \u201cWe will take a short recess, jurors, on account of the matter that just developed.\u201d (Recess.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> Following this statement by the judge there was a conference between the defendant and his counsel, after which the court was informed that the defendant was \u201csatisfied.\u201d Thereupon McGinty was \u201csworn\u201d as a juror. After McGinty had been directed to \u201cjoin the other jurors\u201d defendant\u2019s counsel again addressed the court and took an exception to the empanelling of McGinty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
