Travelers was permitted to intervene as a party respondent. Each of the respondents filed demurrers. The case is here on the petitioners\u2019 appeal from the sustaining of the demurrers <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and denying the petitioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>motion to amend their petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The petitioners have alleged substantially the following. They are citizens and taxpayers in the Commonwealth. Travelers, a Connecticut corporation, is authorized to conduct certain insurance business in the Commonwealth, as provided for by G. L. c. 175, Tabeo is a corporation organized under the laws of Connecticut to conduct an auto body repair business and is presently engaged in such business in Worcester. Tabeo, since its incorporation in 1966, has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Travelers. After due demand by the petitioners, the Commissioner \u201cspecifically refused to take appropriate action to enforce the provisions of . . . [G. L. c. 175] against Travelers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The petitioners also allege, in substance, that the Commissioner should have taken action against Travelers for the following reasons: (1) Under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 3A, the Commissioner is charged \u201cwith the duty of administering and enforcing the provisions of that chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) Travelers \u25a0has no right to conduct an auto body repair business since under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 150, as amended through St. 1946, c. 250,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Travelers, as a foreign insurance company, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>only participate in those \u201ckinds of business authorized\u201d by the chapter. The Commissioner licensed Travelers only to conduct \u201ccertain types of insurance business,\u201d not an auto body repair business. (3) The relationship between Travelers and Tabeo, that of parent and subsidiary corporations, and \u201cthe complete control of Tabeo by Travelers which is inherent in this relationship is sufficient in and of itself to violate the intent of . . . \u00a3G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 47, 150, 152].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (4) Travelers initially invested $400,000 to $500,000 to create Tabeo; the officers and directors of Tabeo \u201care present or former officers or employees of Travelers, or are . . . closely affiliated with Travelers\u201d; officers and directors of Travelers have made statements in press releases and meetings to the effect \u201cthat Tabeo exists to serve the various purposes of Travelers and will be operated to that end\u201d; and a spokesman for Travelers has stated that one of the primary purposes of Tabeo \u201cis to serve as a research project searching for ways to reduce insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>premium costs.\u201d (5) The operation of Tabeo by its officers and directors is not in the best interest of Tabeo, but \u201cfor the benefit of Travelers and in accordance with decisions made by . . . their superiors in the Travelers organization, which are based on the needs and purposes of Travelers.\u201d The Commissioner, through his general counsel, informed the petitioners that even \u201cif the facts set forth in . . . [the] petition are correct, Travelers is nevertheless not in violation of any provisions of . . . [G. L. c. 175].\u201d This conclusion is based on \u201cthe fact that Tabeo is a subsidiary corporation of Travelers, rather than an open and direct Travelers operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In view of our disposition of the case, we pass questions of the timeliness of the appeal and the corporate relationship of Tabeo and proceed to discuss whether there was error in sustaining the demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The petitioners contend, in effect, that mandamus will lie because \u201c[t]he . . . [Commissioner] has no administrative discretion to refuse to enforce the insurance law where such refusal is based on an erroneous view of [the] law.\u201d They argue that if the directive of the insurance law is to endure, \u201cthe correct view of the extent of the Commissioner\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 3A is that he need not advise the Attorney General or take other action to enforce the law, <em>if </em>the facts as disclosed to him and developed by his investigation do not, in his opinion, constitute a violation of the law as <em>correctly interpreted.\u201d </em>We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 3A, provides that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter and . . . [i]f upon complaint, examination or other evidence exhibited to him <em>he is of opinion </em>that any provision . . . has been violated, he shall forthwith report the facts to the attorney general, to the proper district attorney or to the commissioner of public safety, who shall cause the offender to be prosecuted therefor\u201d (emphasis supplied). Furthermore, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 5, as amended through St. 1933, c. 107, \u00a7 2, the Commissioner <em>may </em>revoke the license of a foreign insurance company, <em>\u201cif he is satisfied </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>. . . that any foreign company has violated any provision of law\u201d (emphasis supplied). The Commissioner\u2019s duties under G. L. c. 175 are not solely ministerial, but involve the exercise of judgment and discretion in determining whether the provisions of the statute have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">It is well established that a writ of mandamus will not issue unless the respondent is under a legal duty to perform some particular act or acts the performance of which the court can order in definite terms and enforce if necessary. <em>Scudder </em>v. <em>Selectmen of </em>Sandwich, 309 Mass. 373, 375, and cases cited. However, we are not confronted with such a case. In the case at bar, the Commissioner acted and found no violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The petitioners, by way of a \u201cflank attack,\u201d are arguing that the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion depends on the correctness of his interpretation of the law and are seeking a review of his decision. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>332 Mass. 246, 251-252. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>325 Mass. 268, 270. <em>M. Doyle &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works of Boston, </em>328 Mass. 269, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Even if the Commissioner had \u201cacted incorrectly\u201d and the petitioners sought \u201ca review of his decision,\u201d mandamus is not an appropriate remedy. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra. Senkarik </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. ante, </em>211, 212. In such an event the remedy \u201clies rather in a petition for a writ of certiorari.\u201d <em>Scudder v. Selectmen of Sandwich, supra, </em>at 376-377.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\n<em>Orders sustaining demurrers affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-15\"> The Commissioner's demurrer assigns the following grounds: \u201c1. The petition does not set forth facts sufficient to warrant relief to the petitioners named therein. 2. The petition does not set forth facts sufficient to establish that petitioners have standing to bring this action. 3. The petition does not set forth facts sufficient to establish any legal duty owed to petitioners by . . &lt; [the Commissioner] or any legal authority or power to do that which petitioners seek this Court to command.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Travelers\u2019 demurrer assigns the following grounds: \u201c1. The Petition does not set forth facts constituting a cause or matter entitling petitioners to relief by way of mandamus. 2. The Petition does not set forth facts showing that the petitioners have such interest in the subject matter as to give them standing to maintain this proceeding. 3. The . . . Commissioner's determination that Travelers was not in violation of the law and his refusal to question the propriety of its investment in Tabeo, as alleged in paragraph 15 of the Petition, was a matter within his discretion and mandamus will not lie. 4. It appears from the Petition that the . . . Commissioner has not failed to act but has decided against petitioners\u2019 contentions and mandamus will not lie to require him to change his decision. 5. The Commissioner has no authority to issue an order to . . . Travelers ... to cease owning and operating the Travelers Auto Body Company, as prayed for in prayer 1 of the Petition. 6. Mandamus will not lie to compel the . . . Commissioner to take action to revoke or suspend the license of . . . Travelers . . ., as prayed for in . . . the Petition, or to report the facts of the case to the Attorney General, as prayed for in . . . the Petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> The petitioners do not argue the denial of their motion and the appeal from such denial is therefore deemed waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\"> Material portions of G.

Any foreign stock company, or any company described in section one hundred and fifty-five, admitted to the commonwealth, may, if its charter permits, be licensed to transact the kinds of business permitted to domestic stock companies under section fifty-one, subject to the provisions of clause (d) of said section fifty-one and of subdivision (2) of the second clause of section one hundred and fifty-one and of the first clause of said section one hundred and fifty-five.
