D. Dugout, Inc. (Dugout) was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The evidence is reported. The trial judge made voluntary findings and rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Dugout proposes to erect a building for a restaurant or caf\u00e9 on land (the locus) at 4 Royall Street, Canton. The owners of the locus desire approval of Dugout\u2019s project. The locus is in an area zoned for business purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 12, 1967, Dugout applied to the board of appeals for \u201csite plan approval\u201d of a proposed new building under the town zoning by-law, \u00a7 IV D.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The Canton zoning by-law (\u00a7 II A) establishes classes of districts, including (among others) business districts, limited industrial districts, and industrial districts. The term \u201cNonResidential Districts\u201d (\u00a7 II B) refers to any one of these \u201cthree types of use districts.\u201d Section III of the by-law prescribes use regulations for each class of district. The provisions (\u00a7 III D) governing \u201cBusiness District Uses\u201d read in part (emphasis supplied): \u201c1. ... In a business District, the following uses are permitted <em>as of </em>right: . . . (j) Restaurant or similar place for the serving of food or beverages only to persons inside a completely enclosed building, subject to the condition that no mechanical or five entertainment is regularly furnished except as hereinafter authorized (in Section III-D 3).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>' Section IV of the by-law contains \u201cSpecial Provisions in Non-Residential Districts,\u201d among which is subsec. D, upon which the board of appeals places principal reliance. Section IV D reads in part: \u201cSite Plan Approval. 1. Requirement for Site Plan. In all Non-Residential Districts, no <em>commercial building </em>shall be constructed or externally enlarged, and no <em>commercial </em>use shall be expanded in ground area . . . except in conformity with a site plan bearing an endorsement of approval by the Board of Appeals\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Under \u00a7 IV D 3, applications for site plan approval are to be submitted directly to the board of appeals. The board then is to refer the application to the planning board which may report upon it. After receipt of the planning board\u2019s report or after the lapse of thirty-five days without such a report, the board of appeals may take action which (emphasis supplied) \u201cshall conform <em>to all requirements of procedure </em>applicable to a board of appeals when deciding requests for <em>special permits </em>under . . . [G. L. c.] 40A, as amended (including the requirements thereof for public notice and hearing).\u201d Under \u00a7 IV D 4, \u201c\u00a1T|n considering a site plan . . . the Board of Appeals shall assure, <em>to a degree consistent with a reasonable use of the site for the purposes permitted or permissible </em>by the regulations of the district in which located: (a) Protection of adjoining premises against detrimental or offensive uses on the site, (b) Convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>within the site, and in relation to adjacent streets, property or improvements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (c) Adequacy of the methods of disposal for sewage, refuse and other wastes resulting from the uses permitted or permissible on the site, and the methods of drainage for surface water, (d) Adequacy of space for the off-street loading and unloading of vehicles, goods, products, materials and equipment incidental to the normal operation of the establishment\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The board of appeals on June 8, 1967, denied site plan approval for the locus, and in its decision set out matters summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board\u2019s principal findings were as follows: \u201c1. Royall Street is primarily used for residential purposes. 2. The parking problems ... on Royall Street are of long standing. 3. . . . Dugout . . . [does] not [now] provide any parking .... 4. The proposed . . . [plan] would provide some parking facilities but the entrance area would be on Royall Street, a narrow street. 5. The entrance area would be an inducement to further parking on Royall Street and aggravate a present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>poor situation. 6. The adjoining premises cannot be adequately protected against . . . noise, loud music, drunkards, parking illegally, blocking of safe passage along Boyall Street. ... 8. The entrance way on Boyall Street is detrimental to the area residents and lessens the convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement in relation to adjacent streets, property, and improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">1. The trial judge, in setting aside the board\u2019s decision, first ruled, in effect, that the provision (in \u00a7 IV D of the by-law) for site plan approval went beyond the authority of the town under G. L. c. 40A to give to its board of appeals power to grant variances and exceptions from the general provisions of its by-laws. He concluded that \u00a7 IV D in effect gave to the \u201c[b]oard power to limit . . . the type [of] business that might be operated in an area . . . designated for business\u201d by imposing additional unauthorized restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Section III D 1, presumably adopted pursuant to the general zoning power described in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 2, defines the type of uses permitted \u201cas of right\u201d in a business district. Section III D 2 (fn. 2) indicates certain additional uses which the board of appeals may allow in a business district \u201cwhere not detrimental to the normal use of any adjacent [residential district] property.\u201d Section III D, however, does not contain the complete by-law restrictions upon the use of \u201cNon-Besidential Districts\u201d for \u00a7 IV also prescribes applicable regulations. As already noted, \u00a7 IV D requires that approval (by the board of appeals) of a site plan be given before any construction or enlargement of a commercial building in a business district after the board\u2019s determination that the standards set out in \u00a7 IV D 4 have been met. This, in effect, requires that the use of land in a business district shall meet the following requirements. (1) The use must be permissible either as of right or by special permit under \u00a7 III D. (2) If the use is permitted only by special permit, the board of appeals must determine that the general standards for granting a special permit for that use have been satisfied. (3) After opportunity for consideration of a site plan by the planning board, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>board of appeals (complying with the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in all instances involving a \u201ccommercial building,\u201d must determine that the further standards contained in \u00a7 IV D 4 have also been met in the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The purpose of \u00a7 IV D 4 is obviously to ensure, not only that the use of land in Non-Residential Districts complies with the principal general use regulations of the by-law, but also that each particular proposed commercial building avoids injury to aspects of the public interest reasonably specified in \u00a7 IV D 4. The town, we assume, in its by-law (1) might have defined geographically the business zone in which Dugout seeks to put up its caf\u00e9 and then (2) might have provided in terms that the area could be used only for residential purposes and, upon special permit, also for the commercial purposes set out in \u00a7 III D, 1 and 2, provided that the standards set out in that section and \u00a7 IV D 4 were met. All nonresidential use of the defined area then would clearly have been a matter of special permit granted in accordance with standards stated in the by-law. If these were sufficient to guide the action of the board of appeals, this would have been a valid traditional type of exception described in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4 (fn. 6). See e.g. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114, 116-119; <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of No. Andover, </em>337 Mass. 648, 650-651; <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beacon Terrace Realty, Inc. </em>353 Mass. 63, 68-70; Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning, pp. 54-1 to 54-30; Anderson, Am. Law of Zoning, \u00a7\u00a7 15.17 - 15.21; note, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 668, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>671-676. Cf. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>345 Mass. 376, 378-379.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We think that, in substance, the Canton by-law may be viewed (a) as prescribing valid general rules for application to commercial buildings and uses in Non-Residential Districts which include satisfaction of the standards stated in \u00a7 IV D 4, and (b) is equivalent to permitting any commercial building construction in such districts only upon special permit if the board determines there is compliance with \u00a7 III and also with the standards set out in \u00a7 IV, especially subsec. D 4. The authorities already cited indicate that towns may adopt reasonably flexible methods, consistent with the substantive and procedural provisions of c. 40A, \u00a7 4 (fn. 6), of allowing boards of appeals to adjust zoning regulation to the public interest in accordance with sufficiently stated standards. We look at the substance as well as the form of the attempted regulation and conclude that the method of regulation adopted by \u00a7 IV D is permitted under c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">2. We next consider whether, under \u00a7 IV D 4, the board of appeals erred in its completely refusing site plan approval. The board\u2019s authority to enforce compliance with \u00a7 IV D 4 is only to \u201cassure\u201d protection of the public interest \u201cto a degree consistent with a reasonable use of the site for the purposes permitted or permissible by the regulations of the district\u201d in which the regulated land lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">This language implies regulation of a use rather than its prohibition. It guides us in interpreting the later portions of \u00a7 IV D 4 as contemplating primarily the imposition, for the public protection, of reasonable terms and conditions upon the commercial use of land zoned for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On the facts of the present case, in any event, \u00a7 IV D 4 warrants no more than the imposition of reasonable conditions in connection with the approval of a site plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>assume (a) that, to prevent traffic congestion where a lot in a business zone has frontage only on a narrow street or where particularly heavy use of commercial premises is likely, the board of appeals could specify parking spaces in addition to the minimum number called for in any event by \u00a7 V A 3 of the by-law (fn. 4) if special conditions affecting particular land and adjacent ways made that appropriate, or (b) that some form of screening (to reduce noise, light, dust, or other injury) might be required for particular commercial uses, or (c) that the board might make other appropriate provisions to protect the neighborhood and the public from unreasonable harm. The evidence shows no such detriment from Dugout\u2019s proposed use for a restaurant or caf\u00e9 as would justify prohibition of the project completely under a regulatory provision no more explicit than that in \u00a7 IV D 4.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">3. The final decree is reversed because the trial judge should not have declared \u00a7 IV D invalid. Because, on the evidence, the board of appeals exceeded its authority in disapproving the site plan for Dugout\u2019s restaurant project entirely, a new final decree is to be entered annulling the board\u2019s decision and remanding the case to the board for reconsideration in the light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> On May 18, 1967, the board of appeals denied without prejudice an application for a variance as \u201cnot required.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\"> The by-law in evidence contains no \u00a7 III D 3. The intended reference is probably to \u00a7 III D 2 which reads: \u201c2. Additional Uses by Special Permit Only. In a Business District outside the Central Business Area, the Board of Appeals may, in a specific case, issue a special permit for any of the following additional uses in this District where not detrimental to the normal use of any adjacent property in a Residential District. ... (b) The regular furnishing of entertainment at a restaurant or similar place, (c) Hotel or motel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> Section IV D 1 then proceeds, \u201cSaid site plan shall show, among other things, all existing and proposed buildings, structures, parking spaces, loading areas, driveway openings, driveways, service areas, and other open uses, all facilities for sewage, refuse and other waste disposal and for surface water drainage, and all landscape features (such as walks, fences, walls, planting areas and greenbelts) on the lot.\u201d Section IV D 2 provides that, for the purposes of \u00a7 IV, \u201cthe following uses shall be considered as commercial purposes and all buildings . . . occupied by . . . one or more of such uses shall be considered as <em>commercial buildings: </em>(a) Any of the uses herein set forth as permitted as of right or permissible on special permit in any NonResidential District but <em>not </em>herein set forth as permitted or <em>permissible in any Residential District\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Restaurant use does not appear to be permitted in any residential district. Section IV A 1, like \u00a7 IV D, effects some modification of \u00a7 III by its provision that in a \u201cBusiness District ... all uses permitted <em>as of right or permissible on special permit, </em>and all uses accessory thereto, shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building\u201d (with exceptions not relevant; emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em> </em>This standard, applicable to the action of the board of appeals with respect to a site plan, should be read with \u00a7 V A 3 of the by-law: \u201cOff Street Parking in All Districts \u2014 A. Parking Requirements. In all districts, there shall be provided and maintained improved off-street automobile parking spaces in connection with the erection, establishment or increase by units or dimensions of buildings, structures and uses, in the following amounts. . . . 3. For places of public assembly, including meeting halls, auditoriums and stadiums, libraries, museums, art galleries, community buildings, private clubs and lodges, funeral parlors, restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments, theatres, bowling alleys, dance halls and other amusements, bus depots and other passenger terminals \u2014 one parking space for each four (4) seats. Where ... no fixed seats are used (as in a terminal or dance hall) each twenty (20) square feet of public floor area shall equal one seat.\u201d Other appropriate standards (not here relevant) for off-street parking spaces are required for premises of different types, e.g. family dwellings, places with sleeping accommodations, recreational facilities, retail stores and offices, other business uses, and industrial properties. The board\u2019s findings on Dugout\u2019s application for a variance show a seating capacity of 104 persons for its new building. Under \u00a7 IV D 5, the board may retain power to modify or amend its approval of a site plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> The locus, in a business district, is occupied by a condemned house. Under the site plan the house would be supplanted by a building thirty-two feet long and fifty feet wide on a lot eighty-seven feet by 160 feet including a parking space for twenty-six vehicles, to be entered from Royall Street. The locus abuts a residential area. Dugout, it appears, conducts its present operations on premises \u201cnext door to\u201d the locus. The board referred to evidence before it of serious traffic congestion on Royall Street and of noise from Dugout\u2019s old building, and of complaints from owners of neighboring residences about Dugout\u2019s present operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> Section 4 (as amended through St. 1966, c. 199) reads in part: \u201cA zoning . . . by-law may provide that exceptions may be allowed to the regulations . . . contained therein, which shall be applicable to all of the districts of a particular class and of a character set forth in such . . . by-law. Such exceptions shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the . . . by-law and <em>may be subject to general or. specific rules therein contained. </em>The board of appeals ... of such . . . town . . . may, in appropriate cases and <em>subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, </em>grant to an applicant a special permit to make use of his land <em>or to </em>erect and <em>maintain buildings^ or other structures thereon </em>in accordance with such an exception. Before granting such a special permit the board of appeals . . . shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given in accordance with\u201d \u00a7 17 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\"> The planning board, for example, recommended (1) shielded lighting facilities for the parking area; (2) fencing the entire lot except for the Royal! Street frontage and on the west fence, providing material to reduce headlight glare on residences nearby; and (3) requiring the applicants to show on the site plan the proposed drainage and sanitary disposal system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> We do not suggest, of course, that the board of appeals must impose restrictions of the types outlined above or that it could not have required appropriate amendment of the site plan to make it conform to the standards of \u00a7 IV D 4, e.g. to show a suitable drainage system and other compliance with the planning board\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
