L. c. 258. The original petitioners were three individuals who were doing business as a partnership under the name of Golden &amp; O\u2019Brien (hereinafter referred to as Golden). They sought to recover damages in the sum of $11,481.36 for \u201cextra expenses and costs\u201d in performing a highway and bridge construction contract with the Commonwealth. Subsequently, one Earl Alpert, trustee in bankruptcy of the partnership, was substituted as petitioner. Alpert (hereinafter referred to as petitioner), on motion, was allowed to amend the petition. The amendment, in essence, alleged that Golden \u201cperformed the work . . . provided for\u201d under the contract and that \u201cfinal payment . . . has not been made\u201d because the \u201camount due ... is in dispute.\u201d Later, the petitioner, on motion, was allowed to further amend the petition by adding certain clauses stated in rather extended detail. The Commonwealth excepted to the allowance of this motion. The case was referred to an auditor whose findings of fact were not to be final. The auditor found for the petitioner on nine of his claims totaling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>$485,422.61 plus \u201cinterest from the date the Commonwealth accepted the work as completed.\u201d The Commonwealth filed a motion to recommit the auditor\u2019s report and a motion to strike a certain paragraph from the report. The trial judge denied each motion subject to the Commonwealth\u2019s exceptions. At the trial, without jury, the evidence comprised the auditor\u2019s report, the testimony of witnesses and numerous exhibits. The Commonwealth filed forty-two requests for rulings of law. The judge made extensive findings and ruled on each of the requests. He found for the petitioner on seven of the nine claims in the total sum of $486,737.06 plus interest \u201cfrom the date of the petition at the rate of five . . . per cent per annum.\u201d The Commonwealth excepted to a number of findings and rulings of the judge. The case is here on an outline bill of exceptions. \u201cWe disregard exceptions to the judge\u2019s findings. See <em>Stella </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>348 Mass. 458, 461 . . . [and] determine whether the judge\u2019s decision can be supported in law or must as matter of law be reversed.\u201d <em>State Line Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 306, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings. On May 31, 1958, the Commonwealth acting through its Department of Public Works (hereinafter referred to as D.P.W.) issued a notice to contractors requesting \u201c[s]ealed proposals for State Highway and Bridge Construction (relocation of Route 202 . . .) in the Municipalities of Holyoke and South Hadley.\u201d Proposals on the construction had to be received by 2 p.m. on Tuesday, June 24, 1958, twenty-one working days later. \u201cThe notice also stated that <em>\u2018complete informa</em>tion\u2019 could be had at the office of the . . . [D.P.W.] and that \u2018plans [were] on display at the . . . [D.P.W.\u2019s] [d]istrict [o]ffice in Greenfield\u2019\u201d (emphasis supplied). On June 4, 1958, Golden mailed the D.P.W. a check for $35 and requested information to enable it to submit a proposal. The D. P.W. responded by sending Golden \u201can invitation to bid which contained plans, specifications and detailed sheets including 16 pages of \u2018quantity sheets\u2019 containing detailed estimates of the work to be done, including estimates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>as to the cubic yardage of the roadway earth excavation that would be necessary, and estimates as to how much of the excavated material to be derived therefrom would be <em>suitable </em>for use on the job site as fill and how much [material] would be <em>unsuitable </em>for such use and would have to be hauled off the job site and dumped elsewhere as waste.\u201d The quantity sheets also gave an estimated amount of the borrow<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that would be necessary to supplement the suitable material excavated. After Golden \u201cvisited the job site insofar as it could,\u201d and relying on \u201cthe information given to it by the . . . [D.P.W.], and believing that information to be approximately correct,\u201d Golden submitted a proposal to the D.P.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On August 12, 1958, the D.P.W. awarded Golden the contract to construct 9,761 linear feet of State highway which was to be a minimum of eighty-five feet wide, divided by a median strip with roads on each side. The contract was duly executed and the total amount to be paid for the job was $2,828,035.20. The D.P.W. allocated $3,731,152.73 from the proceeds of a 1954 and 1956 bond issue for the relocation of Route 202. \u201c[T]he total paid to Golden on the project was $2,998,826.75, which sum included money paid directly to Golden,\u201d including sums for extra work, and money paid \u201cfor Golden\u2019s account.\u201d The contract included the \u201cNotice to contractors, the Proposal and Special Provisions, Standard Specifications for Highways and Bridges (the Blue Book)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the plans referred to therein.\u201d The Blue Book contains provisions governing the contractual relationships between the Commonwealth and contractors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The petitioner makes nine claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Claim One. This relates to extra work performed by Golden under Item A2-1 of the contract, \u201cRoadway Earth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Excavation.\u201d The D.P.W. informed Golden and the other bidders that under Item A2-1 there would be 626,000 cubic yards of material to be excavated \u201cof which only approximately 34,735 cubic yards would be 'unsuitable\u2019 material.\u201d The parties initially contemplated roadway earth excavation \u201cin a ratio of about 17 cubic yards of suitable to one (1) cubic yard of unsuitable\u201d and that the unsuitable material was located in the area of the northwest ramp. However, Golden, under the direction of the D.P.W.\u2019s engineer or his representatives, removed 165,015 cubic yards of unsuitable material. This amount was 130,280 cubic yards in excess of the D.P.W.\u2019s estimate. \u201cThus, Golden removed almost four hundred (400%) per cent more of that type of material than was stated would be present in the information given to Golden by the . . . pD.P.W.].\u201d Whereas suitable material is of a granular nature, usable for \u201cembankment purposes\u201d and capable of being \u201cexcavated by the ordinary bulldozer and scraper method,\u201d unsuitable material is muddy and watery; excavation thereof \u201crequires a crane, a drag-line, dump trucks, the maintenance of . . . roadways and much more labor.\u201d It is obvious that \u201c[T]he cost of excavating, hauling and dumping 'unsuitable\u2019 material greatly exceeds the cost of so doing with suitable material.\u201d Furthermore, the contract explicitly provided that all of the unsuitable material be removed from the construction site, \u201cwhile most importantly from the economic point of view, suitable materials may be utilized elsewhere on the job as fill (borrow).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The D.P.W., even after Golden\u2019s request, failed to reveal or make available to Golden the information concerning various boring reports, boring logs, soil samples, and boring report analyses which it had previously caused to be made. The D.P.W. also \u201cfailed to apprise Golden that only seven (7) borings along the proposed roadway had been taken and that those borings were confined to about a 400 foot square area of the Northwest ramp.\u201d The borings and other tests conducted by the D.P.W. were \u201cinadequate in number and were improperly confined to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>comparatively small area ... in the Northwest ramp.\u201d Good engineering practice would have required test borings to be made along the length of the proposed roadway at \u201cintervals of no more than a few hundred feet.\u201d Only in this manner would \u201cadequate data ... be available for a valid approximation of the nature of the sub-soils to be excavated or built upon.\u201d The twenty-one day bid period precluded Golden from making adequate soil analyses and test borings. Such tests would have<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> taken at least 2 and ^ to 3 months,\u201d a fact known by the D.P.W. When Golden submitted its proposal it \u201cwas compelled to rely and did rely reasonably . . . [as the D.P.W. knew Golden] would rely, almost entirely, on the information it furnished Golden as to the location and maximum amount of \u2018 unsuitable \u2019 material and [the belief] that it would be approximately accurate.\u201d The information regarding the unsuitable material \u201cwas not merely <em>inaccurate, </em>but <em>grossly </em>understated the actual quantity and was totally in error in confining same to the area of . . . [the] Northwest ramp.\u201d Had Golden known that there were only seven borings taken on the roadway, all in the area of the northwest ramp, it \u201cwould not have bid the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The cost of excavating the 130,280 cubic yards in excess of the D.P.W.\u2019s estimate is to be computed in accordance with art. 80 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Blue Book and the petitioner is entitled to receive the sum of $290,518.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Claim Two. The petitioner seeks compensation under contract Item A6-1 for Golden\u2019s hauling 107,188 cubic yards of borrow to the job site so as to have enough fill \u201cto make the required level of the highway.\u201d The D.P.W., by erroneously computing the amount of unsuitable material, also underestimated the amount of borrow \u201cnecessary to be hauled onto the job\u201d to reach the proper highway level. Golden, relying on the D.P.W.\u2019s estimate that 150,700 cubic yards of borrow would be necessary to complete the project, \u201carranged to procure that quantity of borrow from the \u2018Bemis Pit\u2019 in Holyoke, a distance of about 1.3 miles from the job site.\u201d However, when the borrow from the \u201cBemis\u201d pit proved inadequate in quantity to complete the job, \u201cGolden had to procure other pits for the necessary borrow.\u201d The nearest pits Golden \u201ccould procure\u201d were in Granby, Massachusetts, about five miles from the construction site and approximately 3.7 miles farther from the site than the \u201cBemis\u201d pit. Golden\u2019s hauling of this borrow from the Granby pits was done upon the orders of the engineer or his representatives. In accordance with the provisions of art. 80 of the Blue Book, the petitioner is entitled to payment of $37,279.98 for hauling 107,188 cubic yards of borrow an extra 3.7 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Claim Three. The petitioner maintains that although under contract Item A6-2 Golden was to furnish a \u201cspecified quantity of gravel borrow,\u201d it, in fact, supplied an additional 37,497 cubic yards of gravel borrow for which the petitioner is \u201centitled to be paid at the contract price per unit of $1.30 per cubic yard, totalling . . . $48,746.10. Golden was instructed by the engineer or bis representatives to supply the additional gravel borrow, when \u201c[Tphrough no fault of Golden . . . subsidence and seepage of the soil\u201d occurred \u201cin various places on the job where gravel borrow had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>placed.\u201d The additional fill was necessary to bring the highway up to the required level. ' ' The [contract provided that compensation for this item 'shall be determined by the actual quantity of gravel borrow used, as measured complete in place.\u2019 \u201d The in-place measurement method used by the D.P.W. establishes a \u201cbase line for the bottom [of the road] from which the road way was to be built up by gravel borrow to the correct grade line.\u201d However, this method of measurement assumes that the bottom soil forming the base line is reasonably stable and sufficiently dense to support the borrow placed upon it. Since the soil did not possess the above characteristics, Golden was \u201crequired to place in the excavation more gravel than was computed by the theoretical mathematics used by the . . . [D.P.W.] to determine the cubic yardage of gravel borrow placed on the roadway.\u201d The nature of the soil \u201crendered the base line and . . . the <em>in-place </em>measurement not only impracticable, but impossible.\u201d The base line which the D.P.W. \u201cestablished was an inaccurate and unfair base fine because the unstable soils beneath it allowed a seepage of the gravel down through it.\u201d Golden placed 132,400 cubic yards of gravel borrow in the excavation, 37,497 cubic yards of which were in excess of the D.P.W.\u2019s estimate. The petitioner is entitled to receive $48,746.10 for furnishing the excess borrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Claim Five. The petitioner contends that he is entitled to be paid for repairing and maintaining the roads in South Hadley \u201cwhich were damaged and were constantly being used in connection with the building of the highway.\u201d Because of the presence of \u201cexcessive\u201d unsuitable material on the job site, Golden had to use heavier machinery and equipment in the excavation of the site and \u201cheavier trucking, both in hauling the 'unsuitable\u2019 material away from the job and bringing suitable borrow onto the job.\u201d As a result of the constant traffic on the roads in South Hadley which were used \u201cby the heavy machinery, equipment and loaded trucks, those roads were severely damaged since they were not built to withstand such use.\u201d Although this situation was not contemplated by either party when the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>was entered into,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the engineer, after conferences between D.P.W.\u2019s representatives and South Hadley town officials, instructed Golden to repair and maintain the damaged roads. Under the provisions of art. 80 of the Blue Book, the petitioner is entitled to damages in the amount of $43,790.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Claim Six. \u201cThe petitioner claims that Golden replaced 32,880 cubic yards of \u2018 unsuitable \u2019 material on the slopes to the highway [contract Items A6-10 and A6-11],\u201d and that this amount was 15,955 cubic yards \u201cabove and beyond the estimated quantity set forth in the information given to Golden by the . . . [D.P.W.].\u201d Solely because of the defective nature of the subsoil of the embankment, \u201cwhich was inept to hold the gravel borrow,\u201d the material Golden had placed on the surface of the slopes slid to the roadway during the winter. This condition, \u201csloughing off,\u201d was \u201cmainly due to the great abundance of \u2018unsuitable\u2019 material that the . . . [D.P.W.\u2019s] [e]ngineer . . . had ordered [to] be used in a process known as \u2018sandwiching.\u2019\u2019\u2019 In this process layers of unsuitable and suitable material are alternately placed on the slope, \u201cto avoid the use of purely suitable material and make some use of some \u2018unsuitable\u2019 material.\u201d The sandwiched material did not come within the various unit prices specified in the contract because of its nature and the method required to handle it. Golden objected to the \u201csandwiching\u201d method \u201cas being uneffective and a change of the original plans.\u201d At the direction of the representatives of the D.P.W.\u2019s engineer, Golden replaced 32,880 cubic yards of sand borrow and gravel borrow. Golden was paid for 16,925 cubic yards, leaving outstanding the payment for 15,955 cubic yards. Golden was not bound by the in-place measurement provided for in the contract as the \u201csloughing-off in various unrelated areas of the job site and the necessary re-emplacement of additional borrow to bring the slopes back to the theoretical lines [of the in-place measurement] rendered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>accurate <em>in-place </em>measurement impossible.\u201d The petitioner is entitled to recover $22,337 for the borrow deposited on the slopes and as yet unpaid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Claim Seven. Under contract Item C17-1, Golden was required to install riprap (\u201cthe placing of stones\u201d). The petitioner claims that after completing the riprap work, Golden \u201cwas directed by the representative of the . . . [D.P.W.\u2019s] [e]ngineer to re-do the rip rap work\u201d to conform to the requirements of the Federal government. As provided in \u201csubsection 31 of . . . [the Blue Book] . . ., \u2018 [a]ll stones shall be placed on a prepared bed or slope . . . [and] <em>it shall not be required that the surface be especially smooth or even.\u2019\u201d </em>Golden gave the contract for the riprap work to a subcontractor \u201cwho prepared a sample area of the rip rap . . . [which] the [r]esident [e]ngineer, as representative of the [e]ngineer, approved.\u201d The stones in the sample area were not smooth and even. \u201cThe riprap work was completed by the subcontractor in accordance with the approval and direction of the [r]esident [e]ngineer.\u201d Thereafter, Golden and the resident engineer were informed by an inspector of the Federal Bureau of Public Roads that the riprap work did not comply with the requirements of the Federal government, in that the surface of the stones did not have a smooth and even appearance and that the work \u201cwould have to be done over.\u201d The Federal government was participating in the cost of constructing the highway and the construction was subject to inspection and approval by the Federal Bureau of Public Roads. Acting upon orders from the representative of the engineer, Golden instructed the subcontractor \u201cto remove the rip rap as laid and to relay it so that the surfaces would be smooth and even.\u201d The subcontractor acted in accordance with the above instructions. The Federal inspector approved the riprap work and \u201cas a result of proceedings brought by . . . [the subcontractor] against Golden and Golden\u2019s surety company,\u201d the subcontractor was paid $14,749.92 by the D.P.W. \u201cSince the . . . [D.P.W.] altered its original specifications after the contractor completed the original rip rap work as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>required, such order for change constituted work for which the contractor is entitled to be compensated.\u201d Therefore, under the provisions of art. 80 of the Blue Book, the petitioner is entitled to receive compensation in the amount of $16,224.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Claim Eight. This relates to the excavation and removal of the sloughed-off material involved in Claim Six. Golden, at the direction of the representatives of the D.P.W.\u2019s engineer \u201cdid <em>again </em>excavate and remove from the roadway 15,955 cubic yards of road earth and brought the roadway back to the desired grade.\u201d The engineer obviously could not use the cross section measurement to determine the volume of the roadway excavation, but he failed to adopt an alternate method \u201cto measure the re-excavation from the roadway\u201d as provided for by the contract. Because of this, Golden \u201cis entitled to be paid for what was actually excavated again to bring the roadway back to the desired grade.\u201d The amount due the petitioner under the provisions of art. 80 of the Blue Book is $27,940.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Claim Four was waived by the petitioner in open court. The judge found for the Commonwealth on Claim Nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The motion to amend the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The Commonwealth contends that the judge erred in allowing the petitioner\u2019s second motion to amend the petition \u201cbecause the amendment failed to comply with the requirements of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 258, \u00a7 1.\u201d In support of this position, the Commonwealth relies on the case of <em>Putnam Furniture Bldg., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>323 Mass. 179, where we stated, \u201cProceedings on petitions against the Commonwealth are not governed by . . . procedural incidents of ordinary law suits between . . . individuals which conflict with c. 258.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186. The <em>Putnam </em>case is readily distinguishable. There, the petitioner initially brought a petition against the Commonwealth in the Superior Court for Middlesex County. The claim involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>an amount in excess of $2,000 and the petitioner made a motion to transfer the case to Suffolk County -under G. L, c. 223, \u00a7 15, \u201cwhereby in ordinary actions authority is given to the court to transfer from an erroneous venue to a correct one.\u201d However, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, explicitly provides that claims in excess of $2,000 \u201cshall be brought in Suffolk County,\u201d not transferred to that county after being initiated elsewhere. The defect in the <em>Putnam </em>case related to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Further analysis of the <em>Putnam </em>case reveals that the court held that under G. L. c. 258 \u201conly those incidents of ordinary practice, which are expressly set forth or follow by necessary implication, attach to the procedure.\u201d It seems obvious that the amendment of a petition under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 51, is such an \u201cincident of ordinary practice.\u201d See <em>State Line Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>(involving an \u201camended petition under G. L. c. 258\u201d), 356 Mass. 306. This court has long recognized that with the passage of G. L. c. 258 the Commonwealth has waived its sovereign immunity to law suits and thereby consented to have the claim against it \u201cdetermined in its own courts by the same tests to which it forces its citizens to submit in the determination of their claims against each other.\u201d <em>Chilton Club </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>323 Mass. 543, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The petition in the present case was originally brought to recover sums alleged to be due the petitioner on the construction contract. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 51, gives the judge discretion to allow amendments \u201cwhich may enable the petitioner to sustain the action \u2018for the cause for which it was intended to be brought.\u2019\u201d <em>Schertzer </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>345 Mass. 747, 750. The addition of other claims for sums due the petitioner on the contract does not change the identity of that cause of action. The motion to amend was addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the court. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Shubert Holding Co. </em>316 Mass. 470, 477. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Claim One. \u201cRoadway Earth Excavation\u201d Item A2-1 of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The Commonwealth puts forward five grounds for concluding that the finding for the petitioner \u201cin the amount of $290,518.55 in Claim . . . [One] for highway earth excavation . . . was error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">A. It first asserts that \u201c [t]here can be no recovery on the basis that the D.P.W. warranted or represented the quantity of the \u2018unsuitable\u2019 material.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not agree. The D.P.W.\u2019s \u201cNotice to Contractors\u201d expressly stated that \u201c[c]omplete information\u201d was available at its office at 100 Nashua Street, Boston, and that plans were on display at its district office in Greenfield. We assume that by \u201c[c]omplete information\u201d the D.P.W. was referring to all the information in its possession concerning the job which was the subject of the notice. The D.P.W.\u2019s offer of complete information in the notice imposed the correlative obligation on the D.P.W. to make available all the information it possessed on request of the contractors. Prior to submitting its bid, Golden made such a request and was informed \u201cthat all information was contained in the plans and specifications.\u201d The D.P.W. supplied Golden with detailed plans, proposals, specifications and quantity estimates of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">In these circumstances, Golden had every reason to believe that it was given all the information the D.P.W. possessed with regard to the conditions at the site and the amount of work (trucks, heavy equipment and labor force) that would be required to complete the construction of the highway. However, the D.P.W. had not disclosed all the information in its possession. In the preparation of its preliminary quantity sheets, the D.P.W. had directed that borings be taken and that a soil analysis be made thereof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The roadway to be constructed was 9,761 Unear feet and good engineering practice would have required test borings to be taken along the entire length of the roadway. Yet, the test borings, only seven in number, were taken in but a four-hundred square foot area of the northwest ramp. The D.P.W. then used these borings to estimate that there would be only 34,735 cubic yards of \u201c-unsuitable\u201d material at the entire job site when in fact there was 165,015 cubic yards of such material. Golden was not informed of the boring samples, the boring report analyses, the analyses of the soil samples, the method of the boring, nor of the limited area from which the borings were taken. At the trial one Paul T. Golden, a partner in Golden, testified that if he had been apprised of the method the D.P.W. used to estimate the amount of unsuitable material at the site, he would not have bid on the job. It is readily apparent that the D.P.W.\u2019s failure to disclose the boring information affected not only Golden\u2019s ultimate decision to bid on the contract, but the amount of that bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It is well estabHshed that where one party furnishes plans and specifications for a contractor to follow in a construction job, and the contractor in good faith relies thereon, the party furnishing such plans impliedly warrants their sufficiency for the purpose intended. <em>M.

It made a \u201cpositive\u201d representation as to the amount of \u201cunsuitable\u201d material that Golden could expect to encounter on the job site. The Commonwealth thereby impliedly warranted that it had made a full disclosure. <em>Christie </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 239-242. <em>Hersey Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>State Highway Dept. </em>305 Mich. 333, 341.

In \"positively\u201d asserting the specific quantity of 34,735 cubic yards of unsuitable material, the D.P.W. \"made a representation upon which . . .

Golden did, in fact attempt to make an independent investigation of the site, but because of the lack of time<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> between the notice to bidders and the date bids had to be submitted, it was impossible for Golden to take adequate borings. We are of opinion that the D.P.W.\u2019s nondisclosure of the boring information and its positive - representations regarding the amount of unsuitable material at the site constitute a breach of warranty for which Golden is entitled to recover damages.

The Commonwealth next contends that the petitioner should not have been awarded the $290,518.55 for the excavation of the 130,280 cubic yards of unsuitable material in excess of the D.P.W.\u2019s estimate because \u201c[t]he evidence does not support the . . .

[Golden] to bid on the different portions of the work in accordance with . . . [its] cost.\u201d Both Golden and the D.P.W. anticipated that seventeen cubic yards of suitable material would be excavated for every one cubic yard of unsuitable material that was excavated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The D.P.W.\u2019s prehminary estimate sheets and other information given to Golden and the other bidders also \u201cindicated that all the unsuitable material was in the northwest ramp of . . . [the] job.\u201d Golden actually excavated and disposed of \u201c165,015 cubic yards of \u2018unsuitable\u2019 material\u201d from virtually the entire construction area. This was \u201calmost four hundred (400%) per cent more\u201d than the D.P.W. had represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We agree with the judge that the inclusion of art. 3 (B) in the Blue Book evidences the Commonwealth\u2019s intent \u201cthat the contract be interpreted fairly where the types of excavation are of substantially different costs and quantity.\u201d Even assuming that the excavation of \u201cunsuitable material\u201d is not a class of work under art. 3 (B), we think it is clear from the quantity sheets furnished by the D.P.W. and \u00a7 A2.30 (B) of the Blue Book that this contract distinguished between the excavation of \u201csuitable\u201d and \u201cunsuitable\u201d material. It seems to us that the single unit price for \u201c Road<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>way Earth Excavation\" was necessarily calculated on the assumption that the earth excavation would occur in the ratio indicated in the plans. The parties certainly did not contemplate that the unit price for \u201cRoadway Earth Excavation\" would encompass the excavation and disposal of such a large quantity of unsuitable material. It is reasonable to conclude that if the parties had foreseen the above situation, they would have provided for separate unit prices for the excavation of the two types of material.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We are of opinion that the contract must be fairly interpreted as containing separate unit prices for the excavation of \u201csuitable\" and \u201cunsuitable\" material which can be readily calculable. The determination of the engineer is not final as to \u201cthe amount and value of extra work\" as is provided in art. 80 of the Blue Book since his determination was based on a unit price of thirty-eight cents for all roadway excavation. We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s calculations conform to the method for determining \u201cPayment for Extra Work\" as prescribed by art. 80 of the Blue Book. Point 2 in <em>WesJulian Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>351 Mass. 588, 599-601. The Commonwealth relies on the case of <em>Wes-Julian Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>at 601-602 (point 3). The situations, however, are clearly different. In the <em>Wes-Julian </em>case, we held that the changes in the excavation requirements and the resultant cost increase in the excavation of certain materials was not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis for exempting that type of excavation from the unit price as provided in the contract. In that case, as distinguished from the case at bar, we were unable to \u201csay that separate unit prices were contemplated.\" <em>Id. </em>at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">D. In view of our determination that the petitioner could recover damages on the theory of an implied warranty, we need not treat with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the \u201cfailure of the [Vjngineer to make any allowance on this claim [o]ne was a gross error implying a failure to exercise honest judgment ... as to be tantamount to fraud.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">E.

Overhaul of Gravel Borrow Item A6-1 of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The Commonwealth argues that the judge erred in \u201cimposing an overhaul allowance for ordinary borrow, Item A6-1,\u201d since Golden had been paid for 257,888 cubic yards of borrow at the contract price of eighty cents a cubic yard. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s proposal contained a representation by the D.P.W. that \u201conly 150,700 cubic yards of borrow were necessary to be hauled onto the job to make the required level of the highway, when in fact, 257,888 cubic yards\u201d were hauled onto the site.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This amount was 107,188 cubic yards in excess of the D.P.W.^s estimate. Golden had initially purchased the \u201cBemis\u201d pit in Holyoke, which was located about 1.3 miles from the job site. This pit contained sufficient borrow to provide the 150,788 cubic yards that the D.P.W. had estimated would complete the job. The increased demand for borrow, resulting from the D.P.W.\u2019s underestimation, forced Golden to purchase new borrow pits in Granby, which were located approximately 3.7 miles farther from the site than the \u201cBemis\u201d pit. It is clear to us that Golden relied on the D.P.W.\u2019s representation of borrow requirements in acquiring the \u201cBemis\u201d pit. Such reliance was founded on the D.P.W.\u2019s representation that all the information it possessed was contained in the plans and specifications. The theory of warranty as a basis for the recovery of damages, set forth in Claim One, is equally applicable to the instant claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>As in Claim One, we believe that Golden was warranted in computing its unit price for ordinary borrow on the assumption that it would need to haul only the amount that the D.P.W. represented would be necessary to complete the job. Its calculation of that figure was based on the prospect of hauling 150,700 cubic yards of borrow a distance of 1.3 miles from the \u201cBemis\u201d pit to the job site. It seems plain that it was not contemplated that Golden would have to purchase additional borrow pits and supply 107,188 cubic yards of additional borrow to the site. The additional borrow required to complete the job was seventy-one percent of the D.P.W.\u2019s initial estimate of ordinary borrow required. It is certainly reasonable to conclude that had Golden been aware of the vast discrepancy between the actual and projected amounts of ordinary borrow necessary to complete the job, its unit price for such borrow would have reflected the extra cost which necessarily would be incurred in hauling the borrow from pits other than the \u201cBends\u201d pit. Since the Commonwealth\u2019s resident engineer computed the payment for hauling the additional borrow on the unit price submitted by Golden, in reliance on the D.P.W.\u2019s representation of borrow amounts, we are of opinion that Golden was entitled to be compensated for hauling the additional borrow a distance greater than that originally contemplated. Bec'ause of the extraordinary amount of additional borrow required, we think that the hauling thereof, which was done \u201cupon the orders of the [VJngineer,\u201d was in the nature of extra work which was not contemplated by the parties and for which the petitioner is entitled to adequate compensation. There was evidence sufficient to support the judge\u2019s finding that \u201cGolden . . . complied with the terms of the contract, including without limitation, those concerning the claims for the payment of the additional money.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Charles I.

Supplying Extra Gravel Borrow Item A6-2 of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Commonwealth maintains there was error in awarding the petitioner $48,746.10 for the 34,497 cubic yards of extra gravel borrow supplied because there was no evidence on which the court could \u201cbase a finding that the resident engineer ordered a 'truck count\u2019 on this item or a finding that the 'in place\u2019 measurement was \u2018impracticable and inaccurate.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Paul T. Golden, a partner in Golden, testified that in \u201cSeptember or October of 1958,\u201d he had been instructed by one Hubbard, then the resident engineer, \u201cto keep a daily load count of all gravel brought to the job.\u201d He stated that \u201cearly in the job both the Commonwealth and . . . [he] realized that due to subsidence,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> . . . [there would be] a tremendous overrun on gravel.\u201d A complete tally of gravel truckloads was forwarded to the resident engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">One Frederick Panzer, who became resident engineer in June, 1959, testified that there was subsidence at the site due to unstable subsoil. He stated that \u201c[e]arly in the job\u201d he took \u201ctruckload counts\u201d because a proper \u201cin-place\u201d measurement could not be taken. Later, when Panzer took in-place measurement of the gravel borrow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>he did not consider the subsidence although admitting that subsidence would result in an improper in-place measurement and that in all probability there would be seepage of a substantial amount of gravel borrow below the base line used in the measurement. Panzer also stated that he received tallies of the truckloads of gravel borrow hauled onto the job and that he neither asked why he was receiving the tallies nor did he tell Golden it was not necessary to submit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We are of opinion that there was sufficient evidence for the judge to conclude that Golden had been instructed to take a \u201ctruckload count\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the gravel borrow.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Contrary to the Commonwealth's contention, art. 23 of the Blue Book is not applicable. The claim is not one for extra work, but for work done but not paid for. <em>State Line Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 306, 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Claim Five. Repair of Town Roads of South Hadley.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The Commonwealth contends that the petitioner \u201cis not entitled to an additional $43,790.53 ... for repair of roads due to increased use of the highways.\u201d It argues that \u201c[tjhe contract provided that payment for repair of roads was included under unit prices for which Golden has been paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">In the Special Provisions, it appears that the Commonwealth listed those roads which would be primarily affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>during the construction of the highway. The roads were all within the area of the site and readily accessible to travel to and from the dumping and borrow area which Golden acquired in order to meet the job requirements. We believe that Golden had a right to rely on these specifications. However, the actual scope of the dumping and borrow requirements was far in excess of that initially contemplated. Because of this Golden was forced to acquire additional dumping sites in South Hadley and borrow pits in Granby. As a result of the traffic between the site and these additional locations, public roads in South Hadley, other than those in the immediate area of the construction, were damaged. Golden was instructed to repair these roads although not called for in the listings in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Admittedly, the Special Provisions provide for \u201cRepair of Roads.\u201d But this provision certainly did not include the repair of roads not originally contemplated to be involved in the construction job. In these circumstances, we are of opinion that the repair to roads not referred to in the contract is extra work. The petitioner is entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of art. 80 of the Blue Book.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Claim Six.

[the petitioner] was entitled to a \u2018truck count\u2019 and not the specified \u2018in place\u2019 measurement\u201d used by the resident engineer. We do not agree.

Replacement of Riprap \u2014 Item C17-1 of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We discern no basis for the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the court erred in \u201cfinding for Golden ... for redoing the rip rap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Article 49 of the Blue Book states: \u201cAttention is directed to the provisions of the Federal Highway Act of November 9, 1921 (42 U. S. Statute at large, page 212) as modified and as extended, under which the United States shall aid the individual states in the construction of highways. When the United States Government is to pay any portion of the cost of the project the <em>above act of Congress provides that the construction work and labor in each State shall be done in accordance with the laws of that state </em>and under the direct supervision of its Department of Public Works subject to the inspection and approval of the Federal Bureau of Public Roads in accordance with the rules and regulations made pursuant thereto. The work embraced in this contract will therefor be subject to such inspection by the Federal Bureau of Public Roads as may be necessary to meet the above requirements. <em>Such inspection </em>shall, however, in no sense make the United States Government a party to this contract, <em>and will in no way interfere with the rights of either party hereunder\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Article 37 of the Blue Book entitled \u201cRemoval of Defective or Unauthorized Work\u201d provides: \u201cAll defective work shall be removed repaired or made good notwithstanding that such work has previously been inspected and approved or estimated for payment. If the work or any part thereof shall be found defective at any time before the final acceptance of the whole work, the Contractor shall at his own expense make good such defect in a satisfactory manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The riprap work was completed by a subcontractor in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 C17.31 of the Blue Book which provided that stones used in such work <em>\u201cwill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>not be required ... [to be] especially smooth or even\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The resident engineer or his representative approved the work. An inspector of the Federal Bureau of Roads subsequently informed the resident engineer and Golden that the riprap work did not satisfy the standards of the Federal government which required that the stones \u201chave a smooth and even appearance.\u201d At the direction of the resident engineer Golden instructed the subcontractor \u201cto remove the rip rap as laid and to relay it so that the surfaces would be smooth and even.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the controlling effect of art. 37 of the Blue Book is ill founded. That provision of the contract must be read in conjunction with other relevant provisions. The riprap work was originally completed and approved as being \u201cin accordance with the laws\u201d of the Commonwealth as specified by \u00a7 C17.31 of the Blue Book. The fact that an inspector of the Bureau of Public Roads found that the riprap did not satisfy the Federal requirements, <em>\u201cin no way interfere[s] with the rights of either party\u201d </em>and does not make the work defective as contemplated under art. 37 (emphasis supplied). Hence, the relaying of riprap, as ordered by the engineer was in the nature of extra work for which the petitioner is entitled to be compensated. We are satisfied that the sum awarded the petitioner on the instant claim was computed in accordance with art. 80 of the Blue Book.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Claim Eight.
