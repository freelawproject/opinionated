The plaintiffs\u2019 declaration alleged injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>to the minor plaintiff by virtue of ordinary and gross negligence of the defendant. It also contained two counts for consequential damages suffered by the minor plaintiff\u2019s father as the result of the defendant\u2019s ordinary and gross negligence. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 opening statement the judge, subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions, directed verdicts for the defendant on all the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 opening alleged the following facts. The male plaintiff, his wife, and their three children, the minor plaintiff aged three and two boys aged five and seven, arrived at the home of and at the invitation of the defendant for dinner on a Sunday afternoon about three o'clock. After some time \u201cthe suggestion was made that the children go downstairs to the playroom and play.\u201d The three Boyajian children and the son of the defendant, aged eleven, then went down to the playroom where they were the only ones present. After about ten or fifteen minutes one of the older boys returned upstairs reporting an accident to the minor plaintiff, stating, \u201cValerie got a dart in her eye.\u201d The dart which struck her came from a set which had been purchased by the defendant who knew that the darts were lying loose on a table in the playroom. \u201c[T]he young boy who threw the dart was Valerie\u2019s brother, who was then aged seven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In assessing the propriety of directing the verdicts we treat the statements of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as being true. <em>Singarella </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 385, 386. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Suburban Sidney-Hill, Inc. </em>343 Mass. 217. \u201cPQf the opening plainly fails to show a cause of action the motion for a directed verdict may be granted.\u201d <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>324 Mass. 398, 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The minor plaintiff was a social guest. The opening statement showed no gross negligence. The plaintiffs could recover only on proof of gross negligence and the judge rightly directed the verdicts for the defendant. <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Comeau, </em>285 Mass. 578. <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>342 Mass. 778. <em>Tomaino </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>348 Mass. 433, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
