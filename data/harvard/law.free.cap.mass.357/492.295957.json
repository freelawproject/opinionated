(association), to determine and declare certain rights of the chief and the selectmen respectively in the government and operation of the town\u2019s police department. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The suit has arisen because the selectmen negotiated and executed a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between the town and the association, the collective bargaining employee organization for the members of the police department. The chief alleges that the agreement contains provisions which go beyond the authority given to the selectmen by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N, inserted by St. 1965, c. 763, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1969, c. 341; and that it infringes upon his exclusive authority under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, as appearing in St. 1948, c. 595. The case is before us on the appeals of all the defendants from the final decree of the Superior Court substantially upholding the contentions of the chief and enjoining all of the defendants from acting under, enforcing or implementing certain provisions of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The case was submitted to the trial judge for decision as a case stated. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 126. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>283 Mass. 536, 541. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>337 Mass. 560, 561. The facts agreed upon are those alleged by the plaintiff in bis bill and admitted by the defendants in their answers, plus certain other facts stated by counsel in open court and entered in the transcript of the hearing. The relevant facts thus agreed upon are set forth in the following paragraphs to the extent necessary for the purposes of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On March 7, 1955, the town accepted G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and thereafter operated its police department under the provisions of that law until the occurrence of the events hereinafter described. On May 31, 1967, the association informed the selectmen by letter that it had secured signatures from ninety-five per cent of the members of the town\u2019s police department designating it as their exclusive bargaining agent, and it requested the selectmen to recognize the association as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for the members of the police department. The selectmen granted that request on July 27, 1967. On August 1, 1967, they wrote to the chief designating him as their representative for negotiations with the association. On the same date the chief sent the selectmen a letter stating that he would not serve as their representative for such negotiations, and he did not serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Thereafter the selectmen personally conducted negotiations with representatives of the association on the terms of a proposed collective bargaining agreement between the town and the association. On October 26, 1967, the town, acting through its selectmen, and the association, acting through its officers, signed a collective bargaining agreement incorporating the terms negotiated by them prior to October 16, 1967, and containing the provisions which the chief contends are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">After the completion of the negotiations but before the execution of the agreement, a town meeting was held on October 16, 1967. At that meeting it was voted \u201cthat the Town rescind the provisions of Section 97A of Chapter 41, of the General Laws relative to the establishment of Police Departments in certain towns accepted under Article 47 of the Annual Town Meeting of March 7, 1955, and to accept in place thereof the provisions of Section 97 of Chapter 41 of the General Laws, which is an Act relative to the establishment of Police Departments in certain towns [\u00a1quoting the text of this section].\u201d The principal difference between the two sections is that, under \u00a7 97, \u201c[\u00a1t]he selectmen may make suitable regulations governing the police department and the officers thereof\u201d; whereas under \u00a7 97A \u201c\u00a3t]he chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of police . . . shall from time to time make suitable regulations governing the police department, and the officers thereof, subject to the approval of the selectmen Hand in some circumstances without such approval].\u201d The latter section also provides that the chief of police \u201cshall be in immediate control of all town property used by the department, and of the police officers, whom he shall assign to their respective duties and who shall obey his orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">One basic question to be decided in this case is whether the action of the town meeting of October 16, 1967, operated as a rescission of its earlier acceptance of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, on March 7, 1955. Section 97A provides for its acceptance \u201cby a vote at an annual town meeting,\u201d but it contains no provision permitting a town to rescind its acceptance thereof. It has been the law that \u201c[i]n the absence ... of some indication in the language, the form, or the subject matter of a particular statute enacted subject to local acceptance, that an acceptance once given may be revoked, the effect of a valid acceptance by a city or town is to make the statute operative in that community until the statute is repealed or amended. Once the condition precedent stipulated by the Legislature to the taking effect of the statute in the community is satisfied, it becomes applicable statute law, subject to change, as in the case of other statutes, only by subsequent action of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Brucato </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>338 Mass. 612, 615-616. See <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Dover-Sherborn Regional Sch. Dist. </em>341 Mass. 497, 500, fn.; <em>Oleksak </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>342 Mass. 50, 52-53; <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>350 Mass. 214, 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The town and its selectmen concede that if this is still the law then the town was without authority to rescind its prior acceptance of \u00a7 97A. They contend on appeal, however, that the material changes made in art. 2 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth by art. 89 of the Amendments, commonly and herein referred to as the Home Rule Amendment, ratified on November 8, 1966, render this rule obsolete.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">It is not clear that the effect of the Home Rule Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ment is open on the record before us. Although this case was entered more than one year after its ratification, there is no reference to it in any of the pleadings. Nor is there any reference to it in the trial judge\u2019s decision. If this question is now open, we think it is without merit. Section 8 of the Home Rule Amendment expressly provides that \u201c[tjhe general court shall have the power to act in relation to cities and towns, but only by general laws which apply alike to all cities, or to all towns, or to all cities and towns, or to a class of not fewer than two . . ..\u201d The same limitation appears in \u00a7 6 of the Home Rule Amendment which provides in part that \u201cAny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, <em>which is not inconsistent with the </em>constitution or <em>laws enacted by the general court in conformity with powers reserved to the general court by section eight . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis supplied). General Laws c. 43B, inserted by St. 1966, c. 734, \u00a7 1, and entitled the Home Rule Procedures Act, was enacted to implement the Home Rule Amendment. Section 13 of this act repeats substantially all the language of \u00a7 6 of the Home Rule Amendment, and in addition thereto it provides in part that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to permit any city or town, by ordinance or by-law, to exercise any power or function which is inconsistent with any general law enacted by the general court before November eighth, nineteen hundred and sixty-six which applies alike to all cities, or to all towns, or to all cities and towns, or to a class of not fewer than two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 97A, is such a general law, and the fact that a town has the option whether or not to adopt it does not change its character. It therefore falls within the powers reserved to the General Court by the Home Rule Amendment and by the Home Rule Procedures Act. In enacting the Home Rule Procedures Act (G. L. c. 43B) the Legislature included no grant of authority to municipalities to rescind, by unilateral action, their prior acceptance of any provision of the General Laws. That omission may reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the Legislature\u2019s concern that if municipalities had unbridled authority to rescind prior acceptance of basic provisions of the General Laws by unilateral action, there might result frequent and precipitous changes in the administration of municipal affairs which might produce chaos, all contrary to the public interest. Consequently, we hold that the Home Rule Amendment and the Home Rule Procedures Act do not render inoperative the rule laid down in <em>Brucato </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the vote of the town meeting on October 16, 1967, to rescind the town\u2019s earlier acceptance of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, was a nullity. The operation of the town\u2019s police department is therefore still governed by \u00a7 97A, and not by \u00a7 97. The trial judge\u2019s similar conclusion, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Turning now to a consideration of the respective roles of the selectmen and the chief under \u00a7 97A, it is clear that both have some authority with respect to the police department. The selectmen establish the department, appoint \u201ca chief of police and such other officers as they deem necessary, and fix their compensation.\u201d The chief is authorized to \u201cmake suitable regulations governing the police department, and the officers thereof, subject to the approval of the selectmen\u201d but his regulations become effective without approval if the selectmen do not act on them within thirty days after they are submitted to them. The chief is \u201cin immediate control of all town property used by the department, and of the police officers, whom he shall assign to their respective duties and who shall obey his orders.\u201d In contrast, under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N, the selectmen alone, acting as the \u201cchief executive officer's]\u201d of the municipal employer (\u00a7 1781) are given authority to engage in collective bargaining negotiations with town employees, including members of the police department, with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cwages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d They alone are also given authority to \u201cexecute a written contract incorporating any agreement reached.\u201d Section 1781 which expressly gives the selectmen such authority states that \u201c[T]n the event that any part or provision of any such agreement is in conflict with any law, ordinance or by-law, such law, ordinance or by-law shall prevail so long as such conflict remains.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u201cIn meeting the problem of fitting . . . [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N3 into the statutes we are aided by various rules in the nature of axioms. Some meaning, if possible, must be given the later legislation. In its enactment the Legislature presumably knew the existing statute \u00a3G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A] .... All the statutes must be construed, where capable, so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose disclosed in the new act. Such purpose is to be gleaned from the reasons, where ascertainable, leading to the legislation, from the nature of the subject matter, from the supposed evil to be corrected, and from the objective sought to be attained.\u201d <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 614-615. <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85. <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>342 Mass. 222, 225. <em>Atlas Distrib. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>354 Mass. 408, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The several statutes involved in this case do not compel a conclusion that the total authority over the town\u2019s police department is vested in either the chief or in the board of selectmen. They give a measure of authority to each. The later statute on collective bargaining realistically recognizes in \u00a7 1781 that the selectmen's authority to negotiate and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tract on the subject matter of \u201cwages, hours and other conditions of employment \u201d in some instances may overlap or conflict with the authority of the chief under the earlier statute, \u00a7 97A, to make \u201csuitable regulations governing the police department, and the officers thereof\u201d and to assign police officers to their respective duties. That is why \u00a7 1781 says that if the agreement thus negotiated \u201cis in conflict with any law, ordinance or by-law, such law, ordinance or by-law shall prevail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The chief contends that articles 4, 5, 7, 11 (par. 2 through end), 12 (pars. 2 and 3), 16, 17, 18 and 19, of the collective bargaining agreement are null and void because they violate or conflict with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, and his powers thereunder, or because they go beyond the scope of the selectmen\u2019s authority which is limited to negotiating \u201cwith respect to wages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d The trial judge found and ruled in favor of the chief as to all of the disputed articles of the agreement. Certain of the articles involve a common question, and we shall therefore consider them by groups rather than individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Most of the disputed articles require that the chief give exclusive consideration to the individual request, personal preference, seniority and rank of a police officer in determining assignment of duties, shifts, vacations and leaves of absence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is probably the practice for chiefs of police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to consider such personal factors in making such decisions, and to honor them if reasonable, practicable and consistent with the public interest and proper functioning of the police department. But, the fact that the chief, in his discretion, may consider these factors in making such decisions is very different from a contractual obligation that he be bound by such factors. Such a contractual obligation may not be uncommon in a collective bargaining agreement made by a private employer with his employees; but private employers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>are not subject to \u00a7 97A or any other comparable limitations on the authority to assign and control their personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The paramount concern of the chief in assigning his officers to their respective duties must be the interest and safety of the public, and, to some degree, the safety of the officers themselves, not the personal preference of each officer. In making assignments the chief must exercise his own discretion and judgment as to the number, qualifications and identity of officers needed for particular situations at any given time. He clearly has been given that authority by \u00a7 97A, and we cannot believe that the Legislature, in enacting provisions for collective bargaining by municipal employees, meant to take that authority away from the chief and permit the selectmen to bargain it away under the guise of negotiations on \u201cwages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d To deprive the chief of his authority to assign his officers to their respective duties and to substitute therefore the disputed provisions of the agreement would be totally subversive of the discipline and efficiency which is indispensable to a public law enforcement agency. Thus, we conclude that those articles of the agreement which impinge upon the power and authority of the chief to decide duty, vacation and leave assignments are null and void as to members of the police department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What we have said above may not necessarily apply to agreements covering employees of other municipal departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Certain other provisions of the agreement are void because they conflict with specific sections of the General Laws. In such a situation it is provided by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1781, that the law shall prevail over the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">(a) Article 17, par. 2, of the agreement provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201c[t]he establishment of rules and regulations for all police officers of the Dracut Police Department, set up by the Chief and approved by the Board of Selectmen.\u201d The authority of the chief to make rules is contained in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A. By that statute the rules made by the chief may take effect under certain circumstances without the approval of the selectmen. The selectmen are without authority to change that by agreement with the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">(b) Article 17, par. 4, provides for the \u2018 \u2018 Establishment of a proper uniform requirement, which is to include weapons.\u201d This provision as to weapons is in direct conflict with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98, which provides that police officers \u201cmay carry within the commonwealth such weapons as the chief of police or the board or officer having control of the police in a city or town shall determine.\u201d The chief is the \u201cofficer having control of the police\u201d in Dracut by virtue of \u00a7 97A. Thus the provision of the agreement as to weapons conflicts with the statute, and the latter shall prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">There are several disputed provisions of the agreement which we hold are properly within the collective bargaining authority of the selectmen, subject to certain stated limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">(a) Article 5 requires the chief to \u201cmaintain a complete record of all overtime and sick leave accumulation,\u201d and to make the records and information therefrom available to the association. The last paragraph of article 11 requires that \u201c[a]H assignments to shifts shall be posted in the Police Station.\u201d It is inconceivable that the police department should not keep such records in the ordinary course of its affairs. The selectmen may properly agree with the association that it will be furnished with such records or information.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">(b) Article 7 provides that members of the police department shall be granted one leave of absence without pay once every five years for a period not to exceed one month, subject to extension to a total up to ninety days. These leaves may be granted for \u201cany reasonable purpose.\u201d \u201cAt [the] discretion of [the] employer,\u201d which is the town, there may be more than one every five years. The number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of men on leave at one time is to be \u201cat [the] discretion of [the] employer.\u201d In each case \u201c[Reasonable purpose\u201d is to be agreed upon by the association and the employer. The provisions of the agreement, which allow leaves of absence without pay, and which determine their length and frequency, involve matters of policy properly within the authority of the selectmen to negotiate on \u201cconditions of employment\u201d and they do not conflict with any law. But, we reiterate that under \u00a7 97A the chief has the sole authority to assign officers to duty, and therefore he alone has authority to decide when leaves will be granted, how many officers will be permitted to be on leave at one time, and whether any officer may have more than one leave within five years. The selectmen may negotiate a contract specifying what shall constitute a \u201creasonable purpose\u201d for granting a leave, but they have not done so. They may not by contract reserve to themselves the right to fix leaves and by the exercise thereof effectively interfere with the chief\u2019s sole authority to assign officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">(c) Article 16 establishes a detailed procedure for the processing of grievances. It defines a \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201ca complaint by an officer or a group of officers that is based upon an alleged violation of, or an alleged variation from, the provisions of this contract, or the interpretation, meaning or application thereof.\u201d To the extent that the selectmen have authority to bargain and contract on wages, hours and conditions of employment, they may also include in the contract a procedure for processing grievances arising solely under the contract itself. As thus limited, article 16 does not exceed the authority of the selectmen. However, it is clear that such procedures cannot be required by the contract to apply to alleged grievances arising from any action which the chief is authorized to take under \u00a7 97A.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The final decree entered in the Superior Court declared certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the town and the association to be null and void, and it enjoined the defendants from enforcing and implementing those provisions. We have held above that several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of those provisions are valid. The final decree must therefore be modified accordingly. Paragraphs 5 and 7 of the final decree are to be modified by striking out the following language now appearing in each such paragraph: \u201cArticles 4, 5, 7, that portion of Article 11 (2 through end), the second and third paragraphs of Article 12, Article 16, 17, and 19 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement,\u201d and by substituting therefor in each such paragraph the following: \u201cArticle 4, that portion of Article 7 after the word \u2018years\u2019 in the second sentence thereof, that portion of Article 11 consisting of the paragraphs numbered (2) and (3) under the heading of \u2018Seniority,\u2019 and the paragraphs numbered (1) and (2) under the heading of \u2018Other Provisions,\u2019 the second and third paragraphs of Article 12, Article 17, that portion of Article 18 consisting of the first and third sentences of paragraph 1 under the heading of \u2018Extra Paid Details,\u2019 and Article 19 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The final decree, modified as required above, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> \u201cIn any town which accepts this section there shall be a police department established by the selectmen, and such department shall be under the supervision of an officer to_ be known as the chief of police.

L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 111A and 111D, as to the fixing of vacation periods. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 111, provides that vacations to municipal employees other than policemen and firemen \u201cshall be granted by the head of the respective department of the city or town at such time as in his opinion will cause the least interference with the performance of the regular work of the city or town.\u201d Section 111A contains almost identical language applicable to policemen and firemen. Section 111D which is applicable in the town of Dracut is simply a liberalization of the vacation benefits provided in \u00a7 111 A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
