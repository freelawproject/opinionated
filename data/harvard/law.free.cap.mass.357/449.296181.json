In case numbered 14,438, the services were in connection with the construction of a shopping center in Leominster in this Commonwealth. In case numbered 14,439, the services were in connection with the proposed construction of a warehouse in West Haven, Connecticut. The declarations were on accounts annexed for $182,231.94 and $25,965.77, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>respectively, with interest. Amended answers set up a de-fence of illegality in that each contract violates G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 60K, 60L, cl. 8 (both as inserted by St. 1957, c. 679, \u00a7 3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The defendants contend that the contracts are illegal on the basis of the pleadings, the plaintiff\u2019s answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff\u2019s replies to the notices to admit facts. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 69. The trial judge reserved and reported the cases on the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The trial judge gave as his reason for reporting the cases on June 3, 1969, that \"the question of law raised is a novel one in this jurisdiction and ... it so affects the merits of the controversy that it should be decided prior to requiring the parties to undertake the expense of what will obviously be a long and expensive trial on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The defendants\u2019 purpose is wholly to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claims for compensation and to obtain windfalls of $182,231.94 and $25,965.77, plus interest. Forfeiture should not be awarded summarily upon sketchy information. The records in the two cases should contain evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>adequate to enable proper decisions to be made. We cannot be sure that the issues as now presented are solely questions of law. The services were not exclusively architectural; they included engineering and probably other nonarchitectural services which should be fully developed in the respective records, which do not contain the complete account of the services performed, or of who performed them on behalf of the plaintiff, or for what the defendants did, and did not, make payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We should not try to make final disposition of the cases in these circumstances. As was said by Chief Justice Rugg in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>American Tankers Corp. </em>286 Mass. 349, 353, \u201cIt is not the function of this court to pass upon the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence, much less to make our own decision of facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">There is an added difficulty which is insuperable because of the presentation of the facts to us for action on the motions for summary judgment. In order to be entitled to summary judgment, the moving party must affirmatively show that there is no real issue of fact. For the procedure under the Federal rules see <em>Empire Electronics Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>311 F. 2d 175 (2d Cir.); <em>American Manufacturers Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Bdcst.-Paramount Theatres, Inc. </em>388 F. 2d 272, 278 et seq. (2d Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">We fully approve the rules of the Supreme Court of the United States as stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diebold, Inc. </em>369 U. S. 654, 655: \u201cOn summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in such materials must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d Here there is a very definite issue as to whether the actions are brought on oral or written contracts. This is not an issue to impose on an appellate court on the two records of the cases at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">From the notices to admit facts it appears that Reddoch, who is not a registered architect, did not exercise professional and supervisory control over the architectural services called for by the contracts, but inferentially he did supervise the other services. It does not appear who did exercise such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>control over the architectural services or whether that individual is a registered architect.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">There are other shortcomings in the record based upon analysis of the proviso in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 60L, cl. 8. It does not appear that a majority of the officers are registered architects or registered engineers, or that one officer is a registered architect, or that an officer who is a registered architect exercised professional or supervisory control over the services contracted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u201cWhile this matter has already been pending for an inordinate amount of time, we cannot grant or withhold summary judgment merely because it would save time or expense.\u201d <em>American Manufacturers Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Bdcst.-Paramount Theatres, Inc. </em>388 F. 2d 272, 285 (2d Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The cases are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\"> General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 60K, \u201cNo person shall, directly or indirectly, engage in the practice of architecture in this commonwealth, except as hereinafter set forth in section sixty L, or use the title \u2018architect\u2019, \u2018registered architect\u2019, \u2018architectural designer\u2019, or display or use any words, letters, figures, title, sign, card, advertisement or other device to indicate that such person offers to engage or engages in the practice of architecture unless he is registered under the provisions of sections sixty A to sixty O, inclusive. . . .\u201d General Laws c.\u00ae112, \u00a7 60L, \u201cNothing in sections sixty A to sixty M, inclusive, shall be construed to prevent ... 8.
