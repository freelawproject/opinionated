Bryce in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Springfield. He was sentenced to death on the first degree murder charge and was also given a sentence on the charge of armed robbery. The trial was subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. Bryce, a sixty-seven year old man, worked part time at the Summit Package Store and was the victim of a holdup in the late evening of July 13, 1967, at a time when he was alone in the store. The defendant was one of several participants in the crimes which led to Bryce\u2019s death by gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The defendant, whose brief was prepared and filed prior to our decision in <em>Ladetto </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 541, has argued thirteen assignments of error based on <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U. S. 510. They all have to do with the exclusion from the jury of certain veniremen \u201cbecause they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d The Illinois statute, which was challenged in the <em>Witherspoon </em>case, was discussed in comparison with G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 3, in the 1969 <em>Ladetto </em>case, and the differences between the two statutes were noted. In the light of that discussion we see no error in excusing the prospective jurors referred to in the defendant\u2019s assignments. Examination of the responses given by them on voir dire indicates, as the Commonwealth contends, that their views would prevent them from rendering a just verdict, or finding the defendant guilty. In certain instances their answers were not clearly responsive to the inquiry by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Consonant with the duty imposed upon us by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have considered the whole case on the law and the evidence. The conduct of the trial was exemplary. We are of opinion that justice does not require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
