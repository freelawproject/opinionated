Quincy, or bom of a parent who at the time of such child\u2019s birth, was either domiciled in or a resident of . . . Quincy.\u201d The final decree granted an injunction in accordance with this prayer of the petition. There is a report of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>facts on the basis of which the facts are stated, except as otherwise indicated below. The evidence is reported. Dr. Woodward\u2019s will has been considered by this court in earlier cases. See <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>160 Mass. 431 (the 1894 case), and <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>331 Mass. 219 (the 1954 case).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The school exists because of the provisions of the fifth article (art. 5) of Dr. Woodward\u2019s will. By art. 5, he left (at his death on May 21, 1869) to Quincy all his real estate in that town, and certain other property, to found a school for girls, ten to twenty years old.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This school was to be \u201cfor the education of females . . . who are native born, born, I wish it to be understood, in the town of Quincy, and none other than these, to be allowed to attend this Institute which I wish to be as perfect and as well conducted as any other in the state.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>By the sixth article (art. 6), Dr. Woodward provided, \u201cIf . . . Quincy refuses to accept the above property upon the terms herein specified, or [shall] <em>fail to comply with the words and intent of this will, as determined by good judges, </em>or should surrender the property <em>or me it for any other purpose than contemplated in this will, </em>then I bequeath the said property to the Trustees of Dartmouth College to be used by them, in the manner they may think best, <em>for the promotion of science and literature\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The history of the school was stated in the 1954 case (331 Mass. 219, 222-224). Quincy (p. 222) accepted the trust and in 1870 received the property left to it by Dr. Woodward. Mrs. Woodward died in 1870, a year after her husband, and devised substantial property to Quincy \u201cupon the same trusts and for the same purposes as are set forth in the will of my late husband . . . touching the foundation and maintenance of a Female Institution in . . . Quincy.\u201d The property (p. 223) \u201creceived from Mrs. Woodward\u2019s estate was added to that received from her husband and the whole managed, invested, and reinvested as one fund.\u201d In 1894, construction of the school\u2019s first building was completed and paid for from the accumulated income of the Woodward bequests.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Certain facts appear from the reported evidence which are not reflected adequately in the report of material facts. These do not appear to be disputed in any substantial respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The income from the funds left by Dr. and Mrs. Woodward (the Woodward Fund) alone, once sufficient to cover the operating costs of the school (see the 1954 case, 331 Mass. 219, 223), in 1968 provided only $13,266.85 (including building rentals) of the school\u2019s total $53,000 operating costs. Although the school has a capacity of 100 students, only sixty-eight to seventy-five girls had been in attendance for the two years next before the Probate Court hearing on May 20, 1969. Financial difficulties had adversely affected the school\u2019s accreditation. Tuition income, however, could be increased materially if the school were able to operate at capacity, and accreditation could probably be restored. It had been lost largely because of uncertainty concerning the school\u2019s financial future.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Faced with the necessity of additional income \u201cbecause of increased costs,\u201d the trustees formulated a proposal to \u201clet non-Quincy born girls attend only to fill unused space, space not being used by Quincy born girls.\u201d The purpose was that they should \u201cbe paying full tuition for the cost of their education.\u201d All the \u201cWoodward [Fund] money would be used only for girls who qualify as . . . eligible under the . . . [Dr.] Woodward will.\u201d Tuition income from the additional non-Quincy born girls would be used to supplement income from the Woodward Fund, income from rental of the school building, tuition from Quincy born girls, and income from funds totally unconcerned with the Woodward Fund (including scholarship funds to be made available by the city pursuant to St. 1968, c. 515; see 1968 House Doc. No. 1175; 1968 House Journal pp. 2268-2269; 1968 Senate Journal p. 1570-1571). The trustees are \u201ctalking in terms of [having in the school] seventy-five Quincy born girls and twenty-five non-Quincy born girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">On December 11,1968, the board of managers and trustees of the Woodward School approved a proposal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Woodward School, beginning in September, 1969, admit two different classes of students: (a) Quincy-born girls whose tuition pays part of their costs and who benefit from the [t]rust [established by the Woodward will]; and (b) otherwise qualified girls, not born in Quincy, who will pay the full cost of their education.\u201d On January 9, 1969, the Board of Managers voted that tuition figures for 1969 \u201cbe set at $600 for Quincy-born girls, and $800 for non-Quincy-born girls.\u201d This cost differential was based on the city treasurer\u2019s report that \u201cthe Woodward Fund contribution toward each student in the . . . [then current] year amounted to $181.41\u201d and that \u201ca depreciation figure of $11.11 per student per year\u201d was appropriate for the use of the school property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The tuition differential would permit the income from the Woodward Fund to be \u201cexhausted entirely for Quincy born girls.\u201d The proposal thus would seem to be to the advantage of Quincy-born girls \u201cbecause it would help to continue the school and increase the income [from] which they would benefit,\u201d without in any degree depleting the income or assets of the Woodward Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The evidence shows that representatives of the school \u201cgo out to the Sixth Grade in Quincy each year and propose or advise and explain to them the advantages of the smaller school such as Woodward.\u201d About 700 Quincy girls would meet the age and birth requirements set up by Dr. Woodward\u2019s will. The school, however, has entrance examinations. The evidence does not indicate (a) how many Quincy-born girls would be likely to pass them, (b) how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>many girls express an interest in attending the school by taking the examination, or (c) whether the school could be filled to capacity with Quincy-born girls by lowering the admissions standards. Such lower standards would seem in some degree to run counter to Dr. Woodward\u2019s purpose that the school \u201cbe as perfect and as well conducted as any other in the [S]tate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The respondents, including the Attorney General, seek a broad interpretation of Dr. Woodward\u2019s disposition, so that the Woodward School can continue to provide education for Quincy-born girls, even though the proposal involves admitting non-Quincy-born girls. Dartmouth relies on the provisions of art. 6 of the will, quoted above, as precluding the proposal for the admission of non-Quincy-born girls, and contends that the gift over to Dartmouth must take effect if Quincy \u201cfail[s] to comply with the words and intent of this will ... or should . . . use . . . [the property] for any other purpose than contemplated in this will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">1. In the 1894 case, 160 Mass. 431, Quincy as trustee sought instructions on various questions. Dartmouth was named as a defendant and set up a claim to the trust estate on the ground that Quincy had forfeited the estate because it had not guaranteed the fund (pp. 433-434) as provided in art. 5 (see fn. 3, <em>supra). </em>This court (Holmes, J.) construed (p. 434) the word \u201cguaranteed\u201d as purporting to create \u201ca condition subsequent,\u201d and as not expressing \u201cthe object of the gift . . . but merely a means of securing the fund,\u201d in short \u201cmerely an administrative detail.\u201d The court concluded (pp. 435-436) that compliance with this detail, unlike certain matters mentioned in par. 10 of art. 5 (see fn. 4, <em>supra), </em>was not one to which Dr. Woodward had expressly attached the penalty of forfeiture for noncompliance. This circumstance, the opinion said, \u201cgoes far to show that forfeiture was not the sanction of every detail which . . . [Dr. Woodward\u2019s] careful forethought suggested.\u201d The court pointed out (p. 437) that it did \u201cnot appear that any conflicting claims . . . [were then] made, or are likely to be made, in respect of\u201d certain other matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>as to which four instructions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were then sought or that instructions concerning them were then necessary. The court said (p. 437) of these four requested instructions, \u201cThe language of the will is clear, and the trustee asks whether of its own motion it is at liberty to disregard that language.\u201d We construe this casual remark as amounting to no more than a quick disposition of requests as to which no instructions were then necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Some language of the 1894 decision, however, seems of importance in the present case as defining Dr. Woodward\u2019s \u201cdominant intent.\u201d In discussing the provisions of the possible gift over to Dartmouth, it was said (p. 436) \u201cpfjt is questionable . . . whether the words 'as determined by good judges\u2019 do not mean that there must be a failure to comply with the intention expressed . . . after the intention has been declared judicially before the shifting clause comes into operation. At least it is plain from the whole will that <em>the great thing in the testator\u2019s mind, his dominant intent, </em>was to establish the female institute, and the general intent gathered from all the words must prevail over <em>any small detail </em>which interferes with it unless clearly he makes <em>exact </em>compliance essential\u201d (emphasis supplied). This court thus has recognized that the failure of, or difficulty of, carrying out subordinate features of Dr. Woodward\u2019s scheme for the \u201cfemale institute\u201d need not put \u201cthe shifting clause . . . into operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The 1954 case, 331 Mass.' 219, dealt primarily with whether Quincy could invade the principal of the Woodward Fund to meet recurring operating deficits. This court concluded (p. 227) that Quincy \u201cwas not empowered by the will or by order of court to use any part of the fund for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>current expenses\u201d and that Quincy owed \u201cto the fund the amount of the [past] withdrawals [from principal to meet operating deficits] with interest.\u201d The actual decision appears to have slight relevance to the issues now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">2. We assume that Dr. Woodward\u2019s will prevents depletion of the Woodward Fund itself for the education of girls not bom in Quincy. The present proposal is not designed to permit such a depletion of the fund. Each non-Quincy-born girl would pay (a) a tuition differential (above the tuition charged to Quincy-born girls) at least equal to or in excess of (b) the average amount expended from the Woodward Fund for each student in 1968, plus an amount designed to be more than the estimated, average, annual depreciation charge (see fn. 7, <em>supra, </em>and part 5 of this opinion, <em>infra) </em>for each student. Two questions thus arise: (1) Does the will prevent the presence of non-Quincy-born girls at the school, if they really pay their own way without support from the Woodward Fund? (2) Would the dominant intention of Dr. Woodward (described in the 1894 case and expressed in arts. 5 and 6 of his will) be more effectively carried out by permitting non-Quincy-born girls to contribute (by adequate tuition) part of the cost of paying a teaching staff, and carrying on a school, with standards high enough to comply with the requirements of his will?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The situation before us does not call for the usual type of equitable application of a charitable gift cy pres. The gift under art. 5 has not yet failed entirely nor has it become impossible of execution strictly in accordance with that article without application of traditional cy pres principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">3. There does arise, however, a somewhat analogous, immediate problem. Because of the increasing cost and complexity of good college preparatory education (and probably, also, because of the effect of monetary inflation), there is substantial risk of complete failure of the primary charitable gift, if carried out in all its details precisely as Dr. Woodward planned 101 years ago. It is difficult to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>how a school of the superior quality desired by Dr. Woodward can now long be maintained if supported only by (a) the seriously insufficient income of the Woodward Fund, (b) tuition payments of Quincy-born girls, and (c) probable contributions from other charitable or public funds., Particularly is this so because the 1954 case (331 Mass. 219, 227) prevents use of principal of the Woodward Fund to meet current deficits.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Dartmouth contends (a) that this court has no power to approve variations in Dr. Woodward\u2019s precise plan or to modify his express language, and (b) that if the school can no longer operate without admitting girls not born in Quincy, then the alternate charitable gift to Dartmouth must immediately come into operation. It relies on a rigid interpretation of the will and certain statements of the principles of cy pres application to support this contention. See Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7 399, esp. comment i; \u00a7 401, comments b to f, inclusive. See Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 399.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The statements, just referred to, do not seem precisely applicable to a situation where a valid charitable trust and enterprise, carrying out the testator\u2019s dominant charitable purpose, has been in actual operation for over seventy-five years before changed circumstances have made desirable or necessary the abandonment of certain details of the original plan. If Dr. Woodward\u2019s dominant intention \u201cto establish the female institute\u201d (160 Mass. 431, 436) for the benefit of Quincy-born girls is to be realized in the future, more income is necessary \u2014 or the funds may be diverted to a charitable purpose (art. 6) which (although in every respect commendable) in Dr. Woodward\u2019s mind appears to have been secondary. In the last three quarters of a century, the Quincy community has become involved in the charitable enterprise. Had the community not given the school public support by scholarship assistance and by the application of other trust funds, Dr. Woodward\u2019s benefaction probably long since would have proved inadequate for its maintenance. In any event, the school has obviously become a community asset which has been employed, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>public interest, in a manner consistent with Dr. Woodward\u2019s central purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The 1894 case (160 Mass. 431, 436) treated the administrative details of Dr. Woodward\u2019s plan (as to which any decision was then made) as not imposing such conditions subsequent as would lead to a forfeiture of the gift for the girl\u2019s school and a transfer of the Woodward Fund to Dartmouth. There still is strong reason for avoiding, by sensible interpretation or construction of trust instruments and otherwise, any forfeiture of the primary charitable trust. See Restatement 2d: Trusts, Appendix, \u00a7 401, comment e, p. 648, and cases cited. This has been the effect of certain of our decisions. See e. g. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Parish of the Epiphany, </em>302 Mass. 323, 326-328; <em>Union Congregational Soc. of Weymouth </em>v. <em>South Shore Natl. Bank, </em>342 Mass. 41, 44-45, recognizing the general power of courts of equity in the administration of charitable trusts to permit deviations short of cy pres applications. See also <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Rockland Trust Co. </em>331 Mass. 25, 28; Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 381, 399, comment p; Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 381, 399.4, at pp. 3119-3126; Fisch, Cy Pres Doctrine in the United States, \u00a7\u00a7 -1.01, 2.03 (b), 6.04. It is not wholly clear in all instances whether a particular decision involves (a) only construction of a charitable trust or a reasonable deviation, in the public interest, from its subordinate provisions, or (b) a traditional cy pres application, as in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>347 Mass. 126, 132-133.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We think that the present case is one where the means and detailed methods stated by the testator \u201cmust have been subordinate in his mind to the [predominant charitable] end which he had in view.\u201d See the <em>Ford </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at p. 28. The primary charitable objective of providing in Quincy, for girls born there, a good preparatory school education cannot conceivably be harmed by using the same school facilities for other girls whose full tuition payments will make possible continued achievement of that primary objective. We regard the language of art. 5 stating that the school was to be \u201cfor the education of females . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>who are native born, born, I wish it to be understood, in . . . Quincy\u201d as having reference only to the use of Dr. Woodward\u2019s own gift. Doubtless in 1869, he expected that his fund would suffice to maintain the school by the time it was established (see fn. 3, supra) and that there would always be a sufficient number of qualified Quincy-born girls completely to fill the school. He could not foresee the changes in preparatory education costs and in the habits of our population (now much more mobile and migratory than it was) which have taken place in the last 101 years. Nothing in his will indicates that he would object to non-Quincy-born girls attending, wholly at their own expense, the school founded by him, if that should trun out to be an appropriate or necessary method of providing the good schooling which he desired for the specified objects of his charitable bounty. We think that the proposal now before us is (subject to the comments in part 5 of this opinion) a proper method of carrying out Dr. Woodward\u2019s primary charitable trust without violating any of its basic charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Various considerations support this conclusion. The general reluctance of a court of equity to enforce a forfeiture of a charitable trust supports our understanding of the Woodward School gift (art. 5). This court in the 1894 case, 160 Mass. 431, 435-436, exhibited such a reluctance to find occasion for forfeiture at a time when the school was just in process of formation. That reluctance is even greater after seventy-five years of operation of the enterprise which Dr. Woodward\u2019s generosity brought into existence. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>246 Mass. 312, 322-323. Other authorities seem consistent with our view. See <em>In re Jones </em>[1948] 1. Ch. 67, 70-74; Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7 401, comments e, f, and g; Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 401.4; Simes &amp; Smith, Future Interests (2d ed.) \u00a7 257; Bogert, Trusts and Trustees (2d ed.) \u00a7 420. See also <em>Faust </em>v. <em>Little Rock School Dist. </em>224 Ark. 761, 765-767; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Frackelton, </em>263 Ill. App. 250, 267-274; <em>State Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Madison County, </em>275 Ky. 501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>503-505; <em>Patterson\u2019s Estate, </em>333 Pa. 92, 96; Am. Law of Property, \u00a7 24.40; Gray, Rule against Perpetuities (4th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 600-603.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">4. The justification for allowing a charitable gift to continue indefinitely, without regard to the Rule against Perpetuities or related rules, is the public benefit from achievement of important charitable objectives. The same justification does not necessarily apply to subordinate details of such a charitable gift, particularly those which tend unduly to restrict adapting use of the gift to changing conditions. In some cases, indeed, subordinate provisions, originally may have been imposed, not to facilitate the achievement of a general charitable purpose, but for the personal gratification of the donor in respects wholly irrelevant to any effective execution of a public purpose. There is strong ground for disregarding such subordinate details if changed circumstances render them obstructive of, or inappropriate to, the accomplishment of the principal charitable purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See DiClerico, Cy Pres: A Proposal for Change, 47 B. U. L. Rev. 153, 192-195, where it is suggested, we think correctly, that (a) noncompliance with detailed provisions of a charitable trust should not give rise to a transfer to an alternative trust, if such provisions are not of controlling importance in relation to the general framework of the testator\u2019s scheme, and (b) a \u201cgift over . . . [should] be resorted to only when it appears to the court that more benefit to the community would be derived from the alternative disposition and that nobody would be substantially damaged by terminating the original trust\u201d (p. 194).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">A donor who brings into existence a charitable institution must recognize that most institutions are likely to change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>with time, that they will become sterile if they remain static, and that they must be adaptable to new public considerations and unpredictable economic circumstances. For this reason, the intention to make mandatory even detailed restrictions on the conduct of such institutions is not lightly to be inferred. If it appears that the unduly restrictive effect was in fact intended, provisions no longer appropriate must be tested against the requirements of current public policy concerning the donor\u2019s fundamental charitable objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">5. The proposal (see fn. 6, <em>supra, </em>and related text of this opinion) apparently contemplated that the differential between (a) the tuition charged to Quincy-born girls and (b) that charged to other girls will be sufficient (see fn. 7, <em>supra, </em>and related text of this opinion) in effect to confine the benefits from the Woodward Fund to Quincy-born girls. Dartmouth argues that under the present proposal \u201cthe school buildings . . . are to be used for girls\u201d not born in Quincy and that the buildings \u201cwere built with the Woodward gift and are part of the present fund.\u201d No detailed argument is made that the proposed differential in tuition charges is not adequate. This is a matter in the first instance at least, for the reasonable determination of the Board of Managers. If any issue is raised about the adequacy of the differential, it should be presented in the Probate Court upon an adequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">6. The final decree is reversed.

[is at a designated place on a particular farm to which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>refers] but the said committee, with the Selectmen,_ Town Clerk and Treasurer, are to decide on what part of said farm the location shall be.\u201d Then follow provisions dealing with a particular farm, imposing temporary restrictions upon its use, and a gift of a portion of it. In par. 10, some of these restrictions (not here material) in explicit terms were imposed \u201cunder penalty of losing or forfeiting this donation.\u201d In the provision nominating executors, Dr. Woodward provided, \u201cMy executors are simply to convey to . . . Quincy the real estate willed by me after the requirements and conditions of my will are complied with, the remainder of the property to remain in the possession and in the hands of my wife . . . with Frederic Hudson for her adviser.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> The seventh article expresses the wish that \u201cthe real estate held in trust by me for my wife ... be given by her to . . . Quincy for the same purposes as this will directs, provided . . . Quincy accepts of my donation and not otherwise. This my wife can do by confirming this will or by making one of her own . . ..\u201d The ninth article made Quincy Woodward\u2019s residuary legatee (for the benefit of the school) in certain events which did not occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\"> The resolution explained the purpose of the action as follows: \u201cThe same way that Woodward School now rents its auditorium for non-school uses, it would rent its educational facilities to the use of non-Quincy-born girls. This is based on the premise that the present plant and faculty could absorb a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>greater number of pupils, without diminishing the quality of the educational services being offered. Only space unused by Quincy-born girls would be made available. Open enrollment with its potential increase in the total number of students, and with more economical operation at full capacity, will make it possible to continue to carry out the wishes of the testator.\u201d One witness agreed that the proposed method of \u201cupgrading the school\u201d would be likely to result in a \u201cQuincy Girls Latin School comparable to the Boston Latin School.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\"> The minutes of the meeting of January 9, 1969, recite: \u201cThe amount applicable to the use of the building and grounds was discussed; no maintenance costs are presently borne by the [Woodward] Fund.\u201d The average expenditure from the Woodward Fund and depreciation charge, per student, presumably, would be lower for 100 students than for sixty-seven to seventy-five students.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> These requests for instructions asked whether restricting the use of the school to girls born in Quincy was a valid restriction, whether it would prevent attendance by other girls resident in Quincy but not born there, whether Quincy-born girls not resident there could attend, and whether incidental use of the school by other girls, or attendance by girls not resident in Quincy, upon payment of tuition, would be proper. It did not appear that there was any financial need for use of the school by other girls to maintain it, or that those not born in Quincy who attended would pay all their charges and receive no support from the Woodward Fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> As Professor Scott points out, \u201cSome vain and obstinate donors . . . might prefer to have their own way forever, whether that way should ultimately prove beneficial or not. But why should effect be given to such an unreasonable desire?\u201d See Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 399.4, p. 3124, Although this statement was made in the course of discussing the occasion for a traditional cy pres application, it has even more logical application to a situation where changes in only subordinate features of a charitable scheme are necessary to assure its continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
