(Westinghouse) from employing the defendant Gerald Jacoby (Jacoby), also known as Jerry Williams, to \u201can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>nounce and broadcast over or through its Boston facilities,\" until October 14, 1970, and also to enjoin Jacoby from, so \u201cbroadcasting and announcing.\" The trial judge made \u201cFindings, Rulings, and Order for Decree.\" The plaintiff appeals from a final decree dismissing the bill \u201cwith prejudice and without costs.\" The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We summarize the findings of the judge. The plaintiff, operator of radio station WMEX, hired Jacoby as a radio announcer in 1957, at a starting salary of $125 a week. When Jacoby left the employ of the plaintiff on August 28, 1965, \u201che was earning over $40,000 per year, of which $15,000 was salary, and $25,000 were commissions on the net billings of advertisers on his show.\" During most of this employment period, Jacoby was employed under written contracts. \u201cAt some time during the period of his employment with the plaintiff, Jacoby became\u201d the moderator of a \u201ctalk show,\" which \u201c[ytQt the time Jacoby left the plaintiff\u2019s employment . . . was on the air six days a week from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.\u201d At the time Jacoby \u201cleft the plaintiff\u2019s employ, WMEX had one other talk show announcer, and has continued to have two ever since.\" There was no evidence to indicate that the talk show format was originated by either the plaintiff or Jacoby. In 1965, there were several \u201csuch shows on different Boston radio stations; . . . there are presently several such . . . shows on Boston radio and TV stations.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Jacoby\u2019s show \u201cwas popular with the listening audiences and, as indicated by . . . [Ms3 salary and commissions,\" the show \u201cwas successful and profitable not only to him but to the plaintiff as well. The popularity and profitability of Jacoby\u2019s show were due to Ms abilities in tMs particular field wMch he . . . developed over the years.\" No evidence was presented to indicate \u201cthat Jacoby\u2019s success resulted from Ms use of any confidential information, trade secrets, or special training furmshed him by the plaintiff.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">WMle employed by the plaintiff, Jacoby was not involved in the solicitation of advertising sponsors, and virtu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ally his only contact with the sponsors was with regard to the advertising copy to be used during bis shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On October 15, 1964, Jacoby and the plaintiff signed a three year contract of employment, under which Jacoby was \u201cto be paid $300.00 per week, 15% of the net cash receipts of all advertising broadcasts by him on his show, and $50.00 per week for expenses.\u201d The contract contained a restrictive covenant which provided that \u201cfor a period of at least three years after Jacoby ceased to be employed by the plaintiff, . . . [he] would not engage in the radio, television, or advertising business anywhere in New England without the plaintiff\u2019s written permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In early 1965, Jacoby informed the plaintiff of his desire to terminate his contract because of an opportunity to work \u201cfor Station WBBM, Chicago, where he would . . . appear not only on radio but also on TV.\u201d On June 19, 1965, the parties, after negotiations, entered into a new contract which terminated Jacoby\u2019s employment on August 28, 1965. Under this contract Jacoby, in addition to performing his duties was required \u201cto introduce a new radio announcer to conduct the talk show and to train such replacement in the job.\u201d The contract also contained a covenant \u201cthat Jacoby was not to engage in any employment in radio, television, or advertising, in New England until October, 1970.\u201d On August 28, 1965, Jacoby completed his employment with the plaintiff and on August 29, 1965, \u201cbegan broadcasting over Station WBBM, in Chicago. There was no evidence that after Jacoby\u2019s departure from the plaintiff\u2019s Station WMEX the plaintiff lost any advertising sponsors while its talk show was conducted by Jacoby\u2019s successor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">At the time Jacoby terminated his employment, the plaintiff owed him commissions for advertising broadcasts for June, July and up to August 6, 1965. The operating head of the plaintiff admitted \u201cthat Jacoby is owed $3,442.10 in commissions,\u201d plus an additional sum of $572.94.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">On May 6, 1968, Jacoby\u2019s services with Station \"WBBM, Chicago, \u201cwere terminated because that station shifted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>an \u2018all news\u2019 format. Starting some weeks earlier when he knew of his impending release, . . . [Jacoby] had been in touch with representatives of . . . [Westinghouse].\u201d Jacoby subsequently \u201chad direct discussions concerning employment at . . . [Westinghouse\u2019s] WBZ Boston stations as a \u2018talk show\u2019 moderator.\u201d On July 29, 1968, Jacoby began broadcasting for WBZ\u2019s television and radio stations. \u201cJacoby has not contacted any WBZ advertisers, whether or not WMEX advertisers, since his employment began, except one customer to whom he spoke regarding copy requirements.\u201d Furthermore, no evidence has been presented to indicate that the plaintiff \u201chas sustained the loss of any advertising customers since Jacoby began his work at WBZ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Although only one other WMEX employee was in a comparable position to Jacoby in respect to salary, length of employment and advertising commissions, the restrictive covenant in his contract \u201cwas of eighteen months\u2019 duration.\u201d In January, 1968, a contract between the American Federation of Television &amp; Radio Artists and the plaintiff provided \u201cthat negative covenants shall not exceed sixty days in length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The first contention of the plaintiff is that a number of the \u201cfindings of fact by the trial . . . [judge] are not supported by the evidence,\u201d and that where the evidence is reported we may review the judge\u2019s findings and decide \u201call questions of law, fact and discretion.\u201d It is, of course, well established that \u201c[i]t is our duty to examine the evidence . . . [and that] [w]e can find facts not expressly found by the judge and we can reverse the conclusion reached by him if found to be tainted by some error of law, but the findings of fact made by him are to stand unless we are satisfied that they are plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>333 Mass. 323, 324. <em>Glovsky </em>v. <em>Holly Point Estates, Inc. </em>354 Mass. 94, 95. The judge is in the best position to evaluate oral testimony. <em>Younker </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>354 Mass. 738, 741. Our review of the evidence does not lead us to conclude that the judge was \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The plaintiff next contends that the \u201crestrictive covenant was reasonable as to time.\u201d In determining whether a restriction as to time is reasonable, we must consider the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s business and the character of the employment involved, as well as the situation of the parties, the necessity of the restriction for the protection of the employer\u2019s business and the right of the employee to work and earn a livelihood. <em>Club Aluminum Co. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>263 Mass. 223, 226-227. The reasonableness of the duration of a restrictive covenant \u201cdepends on the facts in each case.\u201d <em>Novelty Bias Binding Co. </em>v. <em>Shevrin, </em>342 Mass. 714, 716. While we recognize the unusual nature of the radio broadcasting industry, its relationship with the listening public and the unique nature of its performers, we are unable to perceive any business interest of the plaintiff which merits the length of \u201cprotection\u201d it would receive by the enforcement of the covenant. Jacoby was not involved in the solicitation of advertisers while an employee of the plaintiff. Hence, he was not in a position whereby his competition with the plaintiff would result in any exploitation of previous contacts and thereby injure the plaintiff\u2019s established business. Moreover, there was no evidence introduced which would indicate that the plaintiff had, in fact, lost any advertisers since Jacoby returned to the Greater Boston area. See <em>Club Aluminum Co. </em>v. <em>Young, supra, </em>at 227-228. Furthermore, the nature of the broadcasting industry is such that Jacoby was not in possession of any of the plaintiff\u2019s trade secrets or confidential information communicated to him during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The plaintiff also claims that \u201cJacoby\u2019s immediate success upon his return to the Greater Boston area is a direct product of the plaintiff\u2019s expenditures and promotion.\u201d It further contends that \u201cJacoby was a unique product of plaintiff\u2019s business established over many years.\u201d Even though a broadcasting company may have expended large sums to promote a performer\u2019s popularity with the listening public, it would indeed be difficult to determine that such expenditures and promotion have resulted in the performer\u2019s popularity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The performer\u2019s popularity may well be attributed to his own personality and ability. Even if we assume that the plaintiff\u2019s promotion of Jacoby resulted in his popularity, we believe that Jacoby\u2019s absence for almost three years from the Boston broadcasting area sufficiently protected any business interests of the plaintiff. During this period the plaintiff continued to conduct a \u201ctalk show\u201d during the time slot previously occupied by Jacoby. Thus, during the period when the plaintiff was most vulnerable to competition from Jacoby, there was no such competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u201c[AQn employer cannot by contract prevent his employee from using the skill and intelligence acquired or increased and improved through experience or through instruction received in the course of the employment. The employee may achieve superiority in his particular department by every lawful means at hand, and then, upon the rightful termination of his contract for service, use that superiority for the benefit of rivals in trade of his former employer.\u201d <em>Club Aluminum Co. </em>v. Young, <em>supra, </em>at 226-227. This court in the above case quoting from the case of <em>Herbert Morris, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Saxelby, </em>[1916] 1 A. C. 688, 714, stated, \u201c\u2018a man\u2019s aptitudes, his skill, his dexterity, his manual or mental ability .. . ought not to be relinquished by a servant; they are not his master\u2019s property; they are his own property; they are himself . . .\u201d We are of opinion that the restrictive covenant in the 1965 contract is no longer reasonably necessary for the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s business. Enforcement of the covenant beyond the years of Jacoby\u2019s absence from Boston would merely be protecting the plaintiff against ordinary competition. It is not entitled to such protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In view of our determination that it is unnecessary to enforce the covenant to its full extent in order to protect the business interests of the employer, we need not treat with the plaintiff\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The judge rightly concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to \u201cequitable relief . . . against . . . Jacoby [norj to any injunctive relief or damages\u201d against Westinghouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
