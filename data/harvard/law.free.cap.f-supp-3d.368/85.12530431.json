Laws ch. 176D; and\n   two counts of professional negligence. AIC then filed a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court (Zobel, J.) granted the motion to dismiss in full.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209049596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As to Salvati's contention that AIC had breached the excess policy agreement, Judge Zobel held that pursuant to the agreement's terms, AIC's duty to indemnify could only be triggered once Easton or the LLCs \"bec[ame] legally obligated to pay\" damages to Salvati.\n   <em>\n    Salvati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n    855 F.3d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the Superior Court had dismissed her suit against Easton and the LLCs with prejudice and without having entered a judgment against the defendants, Judge Zobel concluded that \"there [had] never [been] any legal determination of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n    at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On April 26, 2017, the First Circuit affirmed, but on somewhat different grounds. Judge Zobel's holding relied on the conclusion that only a judgment can \"legally obligate[ ]\" a party to pay damages. The First Circuit, however, held that such obligation can also arise from a \"settlement agreement that is wholly contractual in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The First Circuit, however, also concluded that the plain language of the December 2014 agreement, although it created a settlement in the amount of $ 6 million, only required the actual payment of $ 1 million from Western World.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n    at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, it affirmed the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The First Circuit noted that the \"outcome [had] not [been] inevitable,\" and that a \"settlement structured differently could have\" triggered the excess policy by creating a legal obligation on the part of Easton and the LLCs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the court acknowledged that the difference between such a settlement and the actual 2014 settlement may have \"seem[ed] technical,\" and that the court's \"adherence to the terms\" of the excess policy may have \"seem[ed] unforgiving,\" the court concluded that it could not \"rewrite\" either the settlement agreement or the excess policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n    at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December 2017, Salvati returned to Superior Court and filed an \"Unopposed Motion to Remove Stipulation of Dismissal and Enter an Agreement for Judgment in Favor of the Plaintiff\" along with a corresponding \"Agreement for Judgment\" on the docket of her 2011 wrongful death action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both documents were signed by\n   her attorney and by an attorney representing Easton, the LLCs, and various other \"defendants,\" but not AIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The \"Agreement for Judgment\" is largely identical to the 2014 settlement agreement, with two changes: (1) it deletes references to Western World's payment under the primary policy and the stipulation of dismissal and (2) it adds the following sentence to the preamble: \"WHEREAS, it is the express intention of the parties to create a legally binding obligation on the part of the Defendants to settle/pay Salvati's claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 3, 2018, the Superior Court allowed the motion and vacated the stipulation of dismissal.

In an opinion predating\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Judicial Court stated that \"[w]hen a State court is faced with the issue of determining the preclusive effect of a Federal court's judgment, it is the Federal law of res judicata which must be examined.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Here, the evidence in question (the new settlement agreement) did not exist at the time of the first action. As a technical matter, therefore, plaintiff could not have raised any claims in the first action based on that agreement. But the new settlement agreement is not new \"evidence,\" in any ordinary sense of the word. It was not something that was hidden from plaintiff, or that could not have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence. Rather, the settlement agreement was something that plaintiff helped to create. Put another way, the first agreement was essentially the product of a litigation choice made by counsel (that is, to structure the settlement in a particular way), and the second agreement was the product of a new choice (that is, to recast the settlement in light of the First Circuit opinion). At all times, the power to shape that agreement was in plaintiff's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus, at heart, this case involves the consequences of a strategic litigation choice-a decision to enter into a settlement agreement that failed to \"trigger AIC's duty to indemnify because it did not legally obligate [Easton and the LLCs] to pay anything beyond the $ 1 million available through [the] primary policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Salvati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p42\">\n    855 F.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is true, of course, that plaintiff did not have the benefit of the First Circuit's ruling at the time of the settlement, and therefore had to anticipate how the agreement should be structured to avoid potential challenges. But the court's ruling was hardly unforeseeable. The original settlement was structured so that plaintiff could attempt to require the excess carrier to pay out $ 5 million, even though the insureds themselves had no obligation (by judgment or contract) to pay that amount. It was surely foreseeable that the excess carrier would take the position that the duty to indemnify had not been triggered under such an arrangement. There is no obvious reason why the parties could not have structured the settlement to reflect that possibility. And it is likewise difficult to see why it would be entirely unfair to require plaintiff to live with the consequences of her strategic choices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff contends that \"[t]he facts in this case revolve around completely new documentation that adheres to the parties['] original intent and the procedure advocated as enforceable by the [the First Circuit's opinion in the first action].\" (Pl. Opp. at 9). It is true that the First Circuit opined-in\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   , of course-that the plaintiff and the underlying defendants \"could have\" structured a settlement differently to \"me[e]t the requirements\" necessary to trigger the excess policy. That statement, however, is merely an observation of what plaintiff could have done in the past, not a ruling that plaintiff was free to bring a second action on a new agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that the First Circuit's statement that \"[a] settlement structured differently could have met the requirements of the Excess Policy\" provided her with the \"right\" to \"reform[ ]\" the underlying settlement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Again, the question here is not whether she was free to reform the underlying settlement agreement; it is whether after doing so, she can bring a new legal action asserting claims against AIC that she has already brought in a previous action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In short, plaintiff had a fair opportunity to negotiate and enter into a settlement agreement, and she chose to accept an agreement with a particular structure. She then had a fair opportunity to litigate the consequences of that agreement. The facts underlying the second action are identical to those in the first action, except for the modification of the settlement agreement. That is not new \"evidence,\" but a new voluntary agreement that had always been within plaintiff's control to effect. Under the circumstances, the claims in the second action are sufficiently related to those in the first action to trigger principles of claim preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Parties in the Two Suits Are Sufficiently Identical or Closely Related\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the third element of claim preclusion is whether the defendants in this suit are \"sufficiently identical or closely related\" to the defendant in plaintiff's first suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff's first action was brought against one defendant, The American Insurance Company. The present action is against two defendants, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company d/b/a The American Insurance Company and Allianz Global Risks United States Insurance Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   AIC contends, and plaintiff does not dispute, that the named defendants in this\n   action are AIC's parent companies. It further contends that Fireman's Fund Insurance Company owns 100% of the common stock of AIC, and that Allianz Global owns 100% of the common stock of Fireman's Fund. The question, therefore, is whether AIC is \"sufficiently identical or closely related\" with its two parent companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"Whether ... an original defendant and a defendant only named in a later suit\" may be deemed closely related \"varies with the facts\" of each case.\n   <em>\n    Airframe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224668\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/9/#p14\">\n    601 F.3d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"common factor\" in cases where new defendants have successfully asserted claim preclusion is when the \"[later] claims were or could have been brought against the original defendant in the original suit and the subsequent suit trie[s] to hold related defendants liable on related claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224668\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/9/#p14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224668\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/9/#p14\">\n    at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
