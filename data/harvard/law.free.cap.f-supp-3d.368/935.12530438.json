BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This civil action arises out of the alleged torture; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (\"CIDT\"); and war crimes inflicted on plaintiffs Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari (\"Al Shimari\"), Asa'ad Hamza Hanfoosh Al-Zuba'e (\"Al-Zuba'e\"), Salah Hasan Nusaif Jasim Al-Ejaili (\"Al-Ejaili\"), and Taha Yaseen Arraq Rashid (\"Rashid\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, \"plaintiffs\") by members of the United States military and CACI employees while plaintiffs were detained at the Abu Ghraib prison. The procedural and factual background of this civil action is described extensively in the Memorandum Opinion of February 21, 2018 [Dkt. No. 678] and will not be repeated in detail here. For the purposes of the present motions, it is sufficient to understand that plaintiffs, all of whom are Iraqi citizens who were detained at Abu Ghraib for a significant period of time, allege that they suffered severe mistreatment at the hands of military personnel and CACI employees. As summarized in the Memorandum Opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Over the course of six weeks, Al-Ejaili was subjected to repeated stress positions, including at least one that made him vomit black liquid; sexually-related humiliation; disruptive sleeping patterns and long periods of being kept naked or without food or water; and multiple instances of being threatened with dogs. The approximately ten to twelve times he was interrogated involved systematic beatings, including to the head, and being doused with hot and cold liquids. Al-Zuba'e was subjected to sexual assault and threats of rape; being left in a cold shower until he was unable to stand; dog bites and repeated beatings, including with sticks and to the genitals; repeated stress positions, including at least one that lasted an entire day and resulted in his urinating and defecating on himself; and threats that his family would be brought to Abu Ghraib. Al Shimari was subjected to systematic beatings, including on his head and genitals, with a baton and rifle, and some where he was hit against the wall; multiple stress positions, including one where he was forced to kneel on sharp stones, causing lasting\n   damage to his legs; being threatened with dogs; a cold shower similar to Al-Zuba'e's, being doused with water, and being kept in a dark cell and with loud music nearby; threats of being shot and having his wife brought to Abu Ghraib; electric shocks; being dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck; and having fingers inserted into his rectum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mem. Op. [Dkt. No. 678] 31-32. Plaintiffs allege that as a result of this treatment, they have suffered \"severe and lasting physical and mental damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. For example, Al Shimari, Al-Zuba'e, and Al-Ejaili each allege that they have \"been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder,\" and each \"has submitted an expert report detailing how these mental illnesses have caused significant problems in [their] personal and professional lives\" through the present day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Each plaintiff also alleges that he continues to suffer from physical symptoms, including pain and scarring, attributable to this mistreatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The claims against CACI are brought under the Alien Tort Statute (\"ATS\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and were initially for engaging in, conspiring to engage in, and aiding and abetting torture; CIDT; and war crimes, all in violation of international law. On February 21, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part CACI's Motion to Dismiss and dismissed the direct liability counts against CACI. In so doing, the Court determined that plaintiffs' factual allegations describe conduct that represents \"violations of international law norms that are specific, universal, and obligatory.\" Mem.

No. 665] against the United States of America and John Does 1-60.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the allegations in the Third-Party Complaint, the United States military oversaw interrogation operations at Abu Ghraib, including making decisions about which detainees would be interrogated and which \"Tiger Teams,\" consisting of an interrogator (either a CACI employee or a military person) and a linguist, would be assigned to which detainees. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 18. In addition, all Tiger Teams reported to the military chain of command, which included various military noncommissioned officers in charge, the Officer in Charge of the Interrogation Control Element, and the Commanding Officer of the intelligence battalion deployed to Abu Ghraib.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. CACI alleges that the United States military \"exercised direct and plenary control over all aspects of a detainee's experience at Abu Ghraib,\" control which included not only assigning teams to detainees but also establishing the Interrogation Rules of Engagement, approving interrogation plans for each detainee, reviewing interrogation reports prepared after each interrogation, and approving certain techniques that required authorization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The gravamen\n   of CACI's allegations is that the United States military personnel, and not CACI personnel, were ultimately responsible for directing the interrogations of the plaintiffs and subjecting plaintiffs to mistreatment. Accordingly, CACI seeks to hold the government liable on a variety of theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Count 1, CACI seeks common law indemnification against the United States and the John Doe defendants and, in Count 2, exoneration for any judgment that might be entered against CACI for acts of mistreatment toward plaintiffs that the third-party defendants \"inflicted, directed, authorized, or permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 45. In Count 3, CACI seeks contribution against the third-party defendants to the extent that plaintiffs seek to hold CACI liable on a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory based on CACI employees' entry into a conspiracy with or aiding and abetting the United States or the John Doe defendants. Lastly, in Count 4, CACI brings a breach of contract claim against the United States, in which it alleges that CACI's contract with the government to supply interrogators contained an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing that the government violated when it refused to produce discovery that could have allowed CACI to defend itself against plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States has filed a Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. No. 696], in which it argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Third-Party Complaint because all of CACI's claims against it are barred by sovereign immunity. CACI has also filed a derivative Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. No. 1149], in which it argues that any sovereign immunity granted to the United States must apply equally to it due to its status as a government contractor. Because the Court had not ruled on the United States' Motion to Dismiss, the United States has also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. No. 1129], in which it argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because in 2007, CACI and the United States settled all claims arising out of the task orders pursuant to which CACI sent civilian interrogators to Abu Ghraib.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

The FTCA generally waives sovereign immunity and subjects the United States to liability for tort damages \"caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1346(b)(1).

Although the Court did not clearly define the phrase \"foreign country\" as used in that section, it relied primarily on considerations of sovereignty, stating: \"We know of no more accurate phrase in common English usage than 'foreign country' to denote territory subject to the sovereignty of another nation. By the exclusion of 'claims arising in a foreign country,' the coverage of the [FTCA] was geared to the sovereignty of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3942718\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/217/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3942718\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/217/\">\n    at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3942718\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/217/\">\n    70 S.Ct. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). Although this decision indicates that territory subject to another country's sovereignty is categorically within the limits of the foreign country exception, it does not explain how the FTCA treats territory that is subject to no-or overlapping or ambiguous-sovereign claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That being said, more recent Fourth Circuit and Supreme Court decisions have made clear that land may be subject to the foreign country exception even if another country does not exercise sovereignty over it. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Burna v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n    240 F.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1957), the Fourth Circuit applied\n   <em>\n    Spelar\n   </em>\n   to post-World War II Okinawa, which was subject to substantial governance by the United States pursuant to a treaty provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n    at 720-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff in that case argued that\n   <em>\n    Spelar\n   </em>\n   indicated that the FTCA exception only applied to territory under another country's control and that Okinawa was actually under the United States' control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n    at 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit disagreed, concluding that\n   <em>\n    Spelar\n   </em>\n   had held that foreign sovereignty over a particular territory was sufficient, but not necessary, to trigger application of the foreign country exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n    at 721-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching that conclusion, the Fourth Circuit cited Congress's use of the words \"foreign country\" to connote a \"sense of 'otherness,' \" or to mean \"a country which is not the United States or its possession or colony,-an alien country,-other than our own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n    at 722-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419884\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/240/720/\">\n    at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (framing the inquiry in terms of whether \"Okinawa has been incorporated into the United States\").

Although the Court relied on a variety of pieces of evidence in evaluating the status of Antarctica (and did not produce a decision clearly adopting\n   a definition of \"foreign country\"), it did observe that \"the commonsense meaning of the term ['country'] undermines petitioner's attempt to equate it with 'sovereign state' \" because the first definition of \"country\" in the dictionary is \"simply '[a] region or tract of land.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225788\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225788\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/197/\">\n    at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225788\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/197/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Webster's New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   609 (2d ed. 1945) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When these decisions are read together, it becomes clear that Abu Ghraib is in a \"foreign country\" and remained as such during the time it was occupied by coalition forces. In many ways, its status mirrored post-World War II Okinawa's, as the United States and other coalition governments displaced the previous Iraqi sovereign. Abu Ghraib, like Okinawa, was never \"incorporated into the United States\" and, given the concept of \"foreign country\" embraced in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the lack of an independent Iraqi sovereign does not bar the application of the foreign country exception.

It was of necessity, therefore, that suability became incompatible with such sovereignty. Besides, the Prince having all the Executive powers, the judgment of the Courts would, in fact, be only monitory, not mandatory to him, and a capacity to be advised, is a distinct thing from a capacity to be sued.

In all cases where the title to property came into controversy between the crown and a subject, whether held in right of the person who was king or as representative of the nation, the petition of right presented a judicial remedy,-a remedy which this court, on full examination in a case which required it, held to be practical and efficient. There has been, therefore, no necessity for suing the officers or servants of the King who held possession of such property, when the issue could be made with the King himself as defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2. Another reason of much greater weight is found in the vast difference in the essential character of the two governments as regards the source and the depositaries of power. Notwithstanding the progress which has been made since the days of the Stuarts in stripping the crown of its powers and prerogatives, it remains true to-day that the monarch is looked upon with too much reverence to be subjected to the demands of the law as ordinary persons are, and the king-loving nation would be shocked at the spectacle of their Queen being turned out of her pleasure-garden by a writ of ejectment against the gardener. The crown remains the fountain of honor, and the surroundings which give dignity and majesty to its possessor are cherished and enforced all the more strictly because of the loss of real power in the government.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   It is not to be expected, therefore, that the courts will permit their process to disturb the possession of the crown by acting on its officers or agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-52\">\n   Under our system the\n   <em>\n    people\n   </em>\n   , who are there called\n   <em>\n    subjects\n   </em>\n   , are the sovereign. Their rights, whether collective or individual, are not bound to give way to a sentiment of loyalty to the person of monarch. The citizen here knows no person, however near to those in power, or however powerful himself, to whom he need yield the rights which the law secures to him when it is well administered. When he, in one of the courts of competent jurisdiction, has established his right to property, there is no reason why deference to any person, natural or artificial, not even the United States, should prevent him from using the means which the law gives him for the protection and enforcement of that right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498419\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/106/196/#p206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498419\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/106/196/#p206\">\n    at 208-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498419\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/106/196/#p206\">\n    1 S.Ct. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Langford v.

At the same time, Congress has placed two relevant limitations on the ability of injured parties to recover under the FTCA.

Under this provision, if an injured party attempts to bring a tort suit directly against the government officer who caused the harm and the officer was acting within the scope of his employment at the time, the United States is substituted as a defendant,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2679(d), and enjoys all of the privileges of sovereign immunity. Accordingly, for torts committed by government employees, a direct suit against the wrongdoer is no longer available and, when the tort claim falls within an exception delineated in the FTCA, a suit directly against the government is ordinarily blocked by sovereign immunity. As a result, in the realm of\n   torts committed by government agents, sovereign immunity has in many situations evolved into a substantive bar to relief, rather than merely a procedural device regulating how the injured party may recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It was not inevitable that sovereign immunity would develop in this way. Indeed, in many other countries whose legal systems evolved from English common law, sovereign immunity is no longer a bar to suing the government in tort. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Crown Proceedings Act establishes that \"the Crown shall be subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject\" in respect of, among other things, \"torts committed by its servants or agents.\" Crown Proceedings Act 1947, 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6 c. 44, \u00a7 2(1);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Crown Proceedings Act 1950, s 6 (N.Z.) (establishing the same rule for New Zealand). Similarly, in Canada, the \"Crown is liable for the damages for which, if it were a person, it would be liable\" for \"a tort committed by a servant of the Crown\" or \"a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property.\" Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. c-50, s. 3. In Australia, government liability is even broader, as the Australian Constitution gives Parliament the power to \"make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth,\"\n   <em>\n    Australian Constitution\n   </em>\n   s 78, and the Judiciary Act of 1903 provides that any \"person making a claim against the Commonwealth, whether in contract or in tort, may in respect of the claim bring a suit against the Commonwealth\" in the High Court or various state or territorial courts,\n   <em>\n    Judiciary Act 1903\n   </em>\n   (Cth) s 56. Perhaps most relevant to the United States given the debates described above about the application of common law sovereign immunity to a republican government, the Irish Supreme Court has held that sovereign immunity did not survive the creation of the Irish Free State because \"it is the People who are paramount and not the State\" and this system is \"inconsistent with any suggestion that the State is sovereign internally.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrne v.

This criticism of the doctrine has also made its way into the judiciary.

However, this assumption does not withstand historical scrutiny. Furthermore, the present case is the quintessential example of the fact that at times the government\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   , do wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-64\">\n   More importantly, the doctrine of sovereign immunity cannot be sustained in the face of our constitutional structure.

Furthermore, the record of the debates preceding the adoption of the Constitution are bare of any language or asseveration that might serve as a basis for support of this monarchist anachronism. In fact, the establishment in this country of a republican form of government, in which sovereignty does not repose on any single individual or institution, made it clear that neither the government nor any part thereof could be considered as being in the same infallible position as the English king had been, and thus immune from responsibility for harm that it caused its citizens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    On February 27, 2019, Rashid was dismissed from this civil action because the primary mistreatment he described occurred before CACI personnel had arrived at Abu Ghraib.

These cases are not helpful for two reasons. First, they are primarily concerned with interpreting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"), which codifies a doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity in American courts. By contrast, the immunity of the American government from suit is a common law doctrine, and the question whether the United States has waived sovereign immunity for\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations does not turn on the interpretation of any one statute. Second, domestic and international law treat the questions whether a sovereign is immune from suit in its own courts and whether a sovereign is immune from suit in the courts of a different country as distinct questions. In particular, the serious concerns that would arise from any rule allowing a country to be sued in foreign courts the world over, as well as considerations of comity and respect, may incline in favor of a rule of restrictive jurisdiction over suits in courts of a foreign state but that do not apply similarly to suits in domestic courts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    There is some historical evidence that by the time of the Founding, the English legal system had moved responsibility for adjudicating claims against the Crown from these mechanisms formally relying on the king's consent to Parliament, as Parliament won authority over appropriations.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Paul F.

For example, in 2001, the European Court of Human Rights confronted a case in which a dual British and Kuwaiti national alleged that he was tortured by Kuwaiti officials in Kuwait and attempted to sue Kuwait and various Kuwaiti officials in the British courts.\n    <em>\n     Al-Adsani v. U.K.\n    </em>\n    , 2001-XI Eur. Ct. H.R. 79, \u00b6\u00b6 9-16. The British courts found that the State Immunity Act of 1978, which governs the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns in British courts, did not permit such a suit,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 18, and the European Court of Human Rights upheld\n    that decision, ruling that the United Kingdom did not violate international law by declining to exercise jurisdiction over Kuwait to allow for the redress of the\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 66. In particular, the court did not \"find it established that there is yet acceptance in international law of the proposition\" that one state is not entitled to claim sovereign immunity in the courts of another state \"for damages for alleged torture committed outside the forum\" state.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 66. Similarly, a Canadian court has held that the plain language of the State Immunity Act, which governs grants of sovereign immunity to foreign states sued in Canadian courts, does not allow for a foreign state to be sued for torture that allegedly occurred in that foreign state and that international law did not compel the court to exercise jurisdiction despite the plain language of the act.\n    <em>\n     Bouzari v. Iran\n    </em>\n    , [2002] O.J. No. 1624, para. 69 (Can. Ont. Sup. Ct. J.). In so holding, the court interpreted the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85 (\"Convention Against Torture\"), to require states to \"provide a remedy for torture committed within their jurisdiction\" but not to \"require a state to provide a civil remedy for acts of torture by a foreign state outside the forum.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    paras. 51, 54. In addition, the court conducted a survey of international and foreign court decisions and determined that the majority of those decisions held that \"to promote comity and good relations between states,\" a state should be granted immunity from civil suit in the courts of another state, even where torture or other\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations are considered.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    para. 69.

United Kingdom\n    </em>\n    (No. 95), 1998-VIII Eur. Ct. H.R. 3124, 3170-71) ). Accordingly, by ratifying the Convention Against Torture and assuring the Committee Against Torture that an adequate civil remedy exists for such victims, the United States has impliedly waived its sovereign immunity with respect to such claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    This conclusion is further reinforced by the international prosecution structure envisioned by these agreements and effected by international and foreign courts. Article 5 of the Convention Against Torture provides that each state party \"shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its [criminal] jurisdiction over\" torture-related offenses where the offenses occur within the territory of the state, where the offender is a state national, or \"where the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him.\" Convention Against Torture art. 5(1)-(2). This provision establishes a structure whereby each state party to the Convention is required to assume criminal jurisdiction over all cases with a strong jurisdictional nexus to the state-where the offender is a national or the offense occurred within the state-and is also required either to extradite or prosecute offenders who are not nationals and who did not engage in the criminal conduct within the state but who are found in the state's territory. Read together, these rules establish a logical structure for criminal prosecution of those engaged in torture: when possible, prosecution should take place in a state with a strong jurisdictional interest in the case, but when that is not possible, prosecution may take place in any state where the offender is found or to which the offender can be extradited.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Although not specifically required by the Convention Against Torture, courts have effected a similar remedial structure for civil torture claims against states. By refusing to exercise jurisdiction over foreign states where the conduct in question occurred outside the forum, courts have determined that civil suits should, like criminal prosecutions, proceed in the courts that have the strongest jurisdictional nexus to the conduct. Typically, those courts would be in the state that allegedly carried out the torture or where the torture\n    allegedly occurred. Unlike in the case of criminal prosecutions, there is no universal jurisdiction safety valve where such a court is unable or unwilling to exercise jurisdiction. Accordingly, to effectuate the global remedial structure apparently envisioned by the Convention Against Torture, it is necessary for those courts with a nexus to alleged torture to exercise jurisdiction over victims' civil claims. In this case, the United States has decreed that it and its personnel are not subject to the jurisdiction of Iraqi courts for conduct arising out of the occupation of Iraq,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Memorandum Opinion [Dkt. No. 678] 51 (explaining that Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17 directs that injured parties, such as plaintiffs, may not bring claims arising from coalition activities in Iraqi courts because \"occupying powers ... are not subject to the laws or jurisdiction of the occupied territory\" (citation omitted) ), which leaves American courts as the only courts with a jurisdictional nexus to such claims.

[T]he very essence of the Charter [of the International Military Tribunal] is that individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience imposed by the individual State. He who violates the laws of war cannot obtain immunity while acting in pursuance of the authority of the State if the State in authorizing action moves outside its competence under International Law.... The provisions of [the Charter of the International Military Tribunal providing that acting pursuant to a superior's order is not a defense to criminal liability] are in conformity with the law of all nations.

The principle at the heart of the Nuremberg trials, and the concomitant acceptance of the existence of certain peremptory norms, is simple and persuasive: there are some acts that are, as a matter of morality and reason, fundamentally wrong such that no state may authorize their commission nor immunize those involved in such acts from liability. This principle compels the conclusion that just as a government official is unable to cloak himself in the mantle of sovereign immunity to avoid prosecution when he commits a\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violation, so too is a government unable to immunize itself from civil liability for such violations. And indeed, not only has the United States accepted the principles advanced at Nuremberg, it actually\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    led the way in these developments and must therefore accept domestically these legal limitations on national sovereignty. As Justice Jackson, the United States prosecutor at Nuremberg, stated, \"[i]f certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us.\" A complete deference by United States courts to executive orders or congressional acts irrespective of international law implications would be simply inconsistent with the spirit and rationale of Nuremberg.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Lobel,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 1074 (alteration in original) (footnotes omitted).

As Justice Iredell argued in dissent in\n    <em>\n     Chisholm\n    </em>\n    , Georgia's sovereign immunity was \"exactly coextensive with her derivative 'sovereign' lawmaking capacity: A state could use its lawmaking power to adopt rules immunizing itself from liability, as long as such immunity frustrated no higher-law restrictions on the state's limited sovereignty.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 1472. Accordingly, by the very nature of limited sovereignty, governments may \"choose to exercise their sovereign power by immunizing themselves from rules that apply to private citizens\" only when acting \"within the scope of their delegated authority.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1490. On the other hand, when republican \"governments act\n    <em>\n     ultra vires\n    </em>\n    and transgress the boundaries of their charter,\" they have no sovereign power to immunize themselves.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Putting these two conclusions together: the federal government may immunize itself from liability for\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations only if the acts of authorizing or engaging in such violations fall within the sphere of\n    authority that has been legitimately delegated by the People. Under the principles of international law discussed in this section, the People as sovereign are bound by the nonderogability of\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    norms, which means that the People may not legitimately delegate to the government the power to engage in\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations. Accordingly, the federal government, bounded by its status as a limited government of delegated powers, has no sovereign power to immunize itself from liability for such violations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    For these reasons, the United States does not retain sovereign immunity for violations of\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    norms of international law. Because Counts 1-3 in the Third-Party Complaint are derivative of plaintiffs' claims that CACI employees conspired with and aided and abetted the federal government in violation of\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    norms, CACI's assertion of these counts against the United States is not barred by sovereign immunity, and the government's Motion to Dismiss will be denied as to Counts 1-3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <strong>\n     D.\n     <em>\n      Sovereign Immunity and CACI's Contract Claim\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Unlike the claims in Counts 1-3, CACI's contract claim in Count 4 is not derivative of plaintiffs' claims for violations of\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    norms. Instead, in Count 4, CACI alleges that the government has breached an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to provide discovery in this litigation that CACI believes would have been helpful in defending itself against plaintiffs' claims. Accordingly, sovereign immunity with respect to this claim is not waived by the nature of plaintiffs' allegations because no\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    issues are involved in this claim. Instead, CACI argues that the Little Tucker Act functions as a waiver of sovereign immunity for its contract claim.

CACI's argument fails. The Little Tucker Act and the CDA read together put CACI in a double bind. On one hand, if CACI's claim is \"founded upon\" its contract for services with the federal government, then it is subject to the exclusion in the Little Tucker Act because the underlying\n    contract is \"subject to\" the CDA. On the other hand, if CACI's claim is not \"founded upon\" its contract with the federal government, then it never falls within the Little Tucker Act in the first place because \u00a7 1346(a)(2) only reaches claims \"founded ... upon any express or implied contract with the United States.\" Either way, the Little Tucker Act does not provide for jurisdiction.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Although the CDA does not define the type of \"claims\" it governs, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FARs\") define a \"claim\" as \"a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to the contract,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.101\">\n     48 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b), and courts have generally adopted this definition for purposes of the CDA,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Todd Constr., L.P. v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831272,5896254\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1306/\">\n     656 F.3d 1306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2011). This definition, which reaches assertions for any \"relief arising under or relating to the contract,\" is extremely broad, and CACI's claim, which seeks damages for a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing contained in its contract with the government, easily qualifies as such a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    CACI cites a variety of cases in which courts looked at factors such as the type of relief sought by the plaintiff, the basis for the plaintiff's claims, and whether the Court of Federal Claims had any special expertise in the matter to determine whether the plaintiff's claims were \"in essence\" contract claims subject to the CDA; however, none of the cases cited by CACI involved a breach of contract cause of action. Instead, these cases involved situations where a plaintiff that had a contractual relationship with the federal government attempted to plead around the CDA by recasting its claims as sounding in tort or other areas of law. Accordingly, the courts undertook an examination of the claims to ensure compliance with the principle that \"a plaintiff may not avoid the jurisdictional bar of the CDA merely by alleging violations of regulatory or statutory provisions rather than breach of contract.\"\n    <em>\n     Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531296,3604326\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/780/74/\">\n     780 F.2d 74\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 77 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In this case, CACI has explicitly pleaded Count 4 as a breach of contract claim, which means that there is no need for the Court to engage in this analysis of the essence of the claims: the claim arises from and is related to CACI's contract for services with the federal government because the foundation of the claim is a breach of that contract.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Moreover, even if the Court were to consider these other factors, the result would be the same. CACI seeks up to $ 10,000 in reimbursement for any future tort judgment against it as breach of contract damages and cites no law establishing any duty it contends the government has breached or otherwise establishing the government's liability to CACI. In addition, although CACI's breach of contract claim does not call for a price adjustment or other FAR-dependent analysis that\n    might involve the core competency of the Court of Federal Claims, there is a governmental interest in having a uniform national rule about whether government contracts include an implied duty regulating the government's handling of discovery requests in litigation related to the contractor's activity. This governmental interest is best advanced by the procedures of the CDA and subsequent review by the Court of Federal Claims, not district courts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Accordingly, CACI's breach of contract claim is undeniably subject to the provisions of the CDA, which means that this Court does not have jurisdiction over it. Accordingly, the United States' Motion to Dismiss will be granted as to Count 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    III. CACI'S MOTION TO DISMISS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Piggybacking on the United States' motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity, CACI has moved to dismiss plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint based on a claim of \"derivative sovereign immunity.\" Dkt.

Gov't SJ Mem. Ex. 2 \u00b6 3.

As the United States argues, but for the task orders, CACI would not have provided interrogation services at Abu Ghraib.

As the United States appropriately argues, CACI's equitable claims still relate to the task orders and are therefore encompassed by the settlement agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    CACI had been on clear notice for several years that it was exposed to lawsuits directed at its conduct at Abu Ghraib when it entered into the settlement agreement in 2007. As discussed above, as early as 2004, several Abu Ghraib detainees had filed a putative class action complaint against CACI's parent company and two of its subsidiaries, alleging torture. If CACI wished to preserve its right to assert an equitable claim based on\n    <em>\n     jus cogens\n    </em>\n    violations, it should have, and could have, done so in the settlement agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dairyland Power Coop. v.

CACI did not do so, and the Court will not read such a reservation into the settlement agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    CACI points to the language in the settlement agreement that refers to the CBCA proceeding in an effort to limit the scope of the settlement to \"those [claims and disputes] in CBCA No. 546, including but not limited to claims for interest, general administrative costs, direct and indirect costs of all kinds whatsoever relating to the terminated Task Orders.\" Gov't SJ Mem.
