(\"Exlites\")-a Utah-based consumer healthcare and durable medical supply company. The transfer agent, Madison Stock Transfer, Inc. (\"Madison Stock\"), brought this action to extricate itself from the competing directions it received regarding 300 million shares of Exlites-one of which directs it to issue the shares, another which directs it to refrain from doing so. Before this Court is the threshold question of whether\n   this case can be maintained as an interpleader action and, if so, whether personal jurisdiction exists over the former president of Exlites-Mark Julian (\"Julian\")-who claims entitlement to the shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Madison Stock commenced this action on June 5, 2018 against Exlites, Scorpion Bay Holdings, Inc. (\"Scorpion Bay\"), Soleeze Wave (\"Soleeze\"), Julian, Chauncey Washington (\"Washington\"), Claire Singleton (\"Singleton\"), Allegro Holdings, S.A. (\"Allegro Holdings\"), Azure Pro Trading, Ltd. (\"Azure Pro\"), Citrine Enterprises, Ltd. (\"Citrine Enterprises\"), Sandstone Consulting, Inc. (\"Sandstone Consulting\"), and Zenlux, Ltd. (\"Zenlux\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201335\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 22, to have this Court resolve competing directions regarding the issuance and cancellation of Exlites stock. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1). Madison Stock's Complaint also makes an abuse of process claim against Julian and Washington and a claim for \"account stated\" against Exlites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-80). On July 13, 2018, Julian filed a motion to dismiss the claims against him based on lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 7 (\"Julian Mot.\") ). For the reasons stated below, the Court grants in part and denies in part the motion to dismiss; to maintain this action, Madison Stock must provide a deposit or bond equivalent and show that venue is proper in the Eastern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Madison Stock is a New York corporation that has been the transfer agent for Exlites since around April 24, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 27). Madison Stock \"performs all its functions within\" Kings County, New York, which it considers to be its principal place of business, and it has no other offices and \"does not travel for the performing of transfer agent services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Exlites is a New Mexico corporation with is principal place of business in Utah. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). It is the issuer of the stock in question in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to its website, Exlites distributes medical equipment and \"does contract manufacturing for medical products.\"\n   <em>\n    About Us\n   </em>\n   , Exlites Holdings International, Inc., https://exlitesholdings.com/about-us/ (last visited Mar. 21, 2019). Several of the other Defendants are international business entities; Allegro Holdings, Azure Pro, Citrine Enterprises, Sandstone Consulting, and Zenlux are all Belize entities with the same principal place of business at 508 Marina Towers, Belize City, Belize. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10-14). Scorpion Bay is also a Belize entity but has its principal place of business in the Bahamas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Soleeze is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). The Complaint does not indicate the nature of the business or industry in which these Defendants operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The individual Defendants are all current or former officers or shareholders of Exlites. Julian is a citizen of Florida and the former president of Exlites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 30, 33). Julian also controlled the Defendant\n   corporation Soleeze. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Washington is also a citizen of Florida. (Compl. \u00b6 6). As described below, both Julian and Washington obtained default judgment awards for the issuance of 200 million and 100 million shares, respectively, of Exlites common stock in a Florida state court proceeding brought against Exlites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Singleton is a citizen of Texas who, at the time of the Complaint, was \"a majority holder in and authority of record for Defendant Exlites.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The history of the proceedings before the commencement of the federal action is extensive. The following narrative is drawn from the Complaint and the attached exhibits, and is presented to show the alleged competing claims faced by Madison Stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2014, Madison Stock took over as transfer agent for Exlites from Pacific Stock Transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). Soon thereafter, Michael Dillon (\"Dillon\"), the sole officer and director of Exlites, issued 25 million shares of its stock to Soleeze, the entity controlled by Julian, \"in preparation for a merger/acquisition\" with Soleeze. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). Julian became the president of Exlites and Dillon became the corporate secretary, and on May 14, 2015, Exlites sent a resolution to Madison Stock to issue 20 million shares of stock to Scorpion Bay. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scorpion Bay Issuance, attached as Ex. F to Compl., Dkt. No. 1). Around the same time, Dillon held a shareholder vote to unwind Exlites's merger with Soleeze and remove Julian as an officer and director \"for failure to fulfill the terms, agreements and expectations of the merger agreements.\" (Compl. \u00b6 33). It is unclear from the Complaint what the results of this vote were, though it appears that Julian remained on as an Exlites officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weeks later, on June 4, 2015, Julian and Singleton were elected to Exlites's Board of Directors and Dillon was removed from his position as secretary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). On October 3, 2016, Singleton removed Julian as an officer and director of Exlites using her \"super voting block,\" which had been recognized by a corporate resolution signed by Singleton and Julian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Exlites and Singleton are now attempting to cancel a series of earlier Exlites share issuances: 20 million shares issued to Scorpion Bay on May 14, 2015, 15 million shares issued to the five Belize entities,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 25 million shares issued to Soleeze on December 19, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-40). The Complaint does not explain how and when Exlites or Singleton communicated these requests to Madison Stock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In late 2016, Julian and Washington each received a default judgment in Florida state court, Pasco County, against Exlites in cases alleging, among other things, breach of contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24 (case numbers 2016-CA-2400-WS and 2016-CA-2413-WS,\n   respectively);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Florida Default Judgment dated Nov. 1, 2016, attached as Ex. M to Compl., Dkt. No. 1 (\"Julian Default J.\"); Florida Default Judgment dated Sept. 28, 2016, attached as Ex. N to Compl., Dkt. No. 1 (\"Washington Default J.\") ). The judgment ordered \"the transfer agent of Defendant, Exlites Holding International, Inc.\" to issue 200 million shares of stock to Julian and 100 million shares to Washington. (Julian Default J.; Washington Default J. (emphasis omitted) ). In May 2018, Madison Stock received correspondence from counsel for Julian asking it to issue the 300 million shares of stock associated with these default judgments, which Madison Stock indicated it would do upon the docketing of the judgments in New York. (Compl. \u00b6 51). Counsel for Julian subsequently demanded Madison Stock issue the shares immediately rather than wait for docketing in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Court Order dated May 30, 2018, attached as Ex. O to Compl., Dkt. No. 1 (\"Julian Letter\") ). This demand also included threats of suit for wrongful refusal to transfer. (Compl. \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Julian Letter at 2 (\"[U]nless the demand we previously issued ... is complied with in the next 10 days, we will seek leave of Court in the ... Florida Action to amend the Complaint to name Madison as a defendant and seek damages from it co-extensive with the issuer's liability.\") (emphasis omitted) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Madison Stock consulted with Singleton, the majority shareholder, about the issuance of these shares. (Compl. \u00b6 25). Singleton had \"no knowledge regarding the [Florida] litigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Upon further investigation, Madison Stock discovered that Julian had essentially served himself in his Florida default judgment litigation, because he served Exlites via the Florida Secretary of State. The Secretary of State served the party Exlites had elected to receive notice: Julian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). In an email to Madison Stock's attorney from Singleton, Exlites objected to the issuance of the 300 million shares to Julian and Washington on June 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exlites Objection Email, attached Ex. Q to Compl., Dkt. No. 1 (\"June Exlites Objection\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Madison Stock alleges that it has at least two claims for which there are competing directives: (1) a directive from Julian and Washington to issue 300 million shares of Exlites to them; an objection from Exlites to that issuance, and a counter-directive that those shares not be issued; and (2) the shares of Exlites previously issued to Soleeze, Scorpion Bay, and the Belize entities, which Madison Stock was instructed by Singleton to cancel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Madison Stock asks this Court to decide its obligation as to the issuance or cancellation of the shares described above, namely the 200 million shares to Julian, the 100 million shares to Washington, the 25 million shares pertaining to Soleeze,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the 15 million shares pertaining to the Belize entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Request for Relief, attached to\n   Compl. (\"Req. for Relief\") \u00b6\u00b6 66.1-66.4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition to the interpleader request, the Complaint asserts two causes of action: abuse of process against Julian and Washington and \"account stated\" pertaining to Exlites's payments due to Madison Stock for transfer activity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67-80). As to the abuse of process claim, Madison Stock alleges Julian and Washington used their default judgments in an attempt to gain control of Exlites, putting Madison Stock in a position of conflicting liability, and attempted to use the default judgments to extort and threaten Madison Stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-73). Madison Stock seeks $ 6,600,000 for this claim, which it alleges is the value of Julian and Washington's attempted extortion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201335\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201335\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the 300 million shares of stock have a \"mark-to-market value of $ 6,600,000\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the account stated claim, Madison Stock seeks payment of $ 10,931.36 from Exlites for \"various transfers and activities\" that have allegedly not been objected to. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Madison Stock filed proof of service on the docket as to Exlites, Julian, and Singleton, (Acknowledgements of Service, Dkt. Nos. 9, 10; Summons Returned Executed, Dkt. No. 16), and asked that the Court excuse service on Allegro Holdings, Azure Pro, Citrine Enterprises, Sandstone Consulting, and Zenlux, which the Court denied. (Req. for Waiver of Service dated Aug. 9, 2018, Dkt. No. 15; Order dated Aug. 28, 2018, Dkt. No. 24). Madison Stock filed Summonses Returned Unexecuted as to Washington and Soleeze. (Summonses Returned Unexecuted, Dkt. Nos. 17, 18). As of the date of this Order, only Defendants Julian, Singleton, and Exlites have appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 13, 2018, Julian filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(3) for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Julian Mot.). Madison Stock responded on July 30, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 13 (\"Madison Stock Resp. I\") ). The Court held oral argument on the motion on January 17, 2019 at which counsel for Madison Stock and Julian were present. (Minute Entry dated Jan. 17, 2019;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Mot. to Dismiss Hr'g on Jan. 17, 2019, Dkt. No. 37 (\"Jan. 17 Tr.\") ). Madison Stock filed a follow-up memorandum, as permitted by the Court, in opposition to Julian's motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp'n dated Feb. 1, 2019, Dkt. No. 36 (\"Madison Stock\n   Resp. II\"); Minute Entry dated Jan. 17, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court subsequently directed parties to file a status report \"on the Florida cases referenced in their papers, namely [the default judgments obtained by Julian and Washington]\" and on any other litigation \"that asserts a claim on the property subject to this interpleader action.\" (Order dated Mar. 6, 2019). Julian filed copies of the docket from three Florida litigations, only one of which is currently open. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice dated Mar. 13, 2019, Dkt. No. 38 (\"Julian Florida Update\") at 1). The open litigation, Case No. 2016-CA-2400-WS, is the litigation in which Julian obtained a default judgment against Exlites for 200 million shares of stock. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201335\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). The case was re-opened on May 10, 2018, one and a half years after the default judgment was issued, when Julian attempted to amend his complaint to add Madison Stock as a defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 2016-CA-2400-WS docket sheet, attached to Julian Florida Update, Dkt. No. 38 (\"Julian Default Docket\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Amend dated June 5, 2018, attached as Ex. E to Status Report dated Mar. 20, 2019, Dkt. No. 39).

First, the Julian Letter, which threatens to sue Madison Stock-and the subsequent attempt to sue Madison Stock in Florida-may not be a tortious act. The Julian Letter threatens to sue Madison Stock for failure to transfer shares; Madison Stock does not explain what kind of tort this could possibly be. If it is one for abuse of process-the one claim contained in the Complaint that refers to threats of litigation-an abuse of process tort is not complete when there is a mere threat of litigation. The litigation must go beyond threat for the tort to have been committed. \"Abuse of process has three essential elements: (1) regularly issued process, either civil or criminal, (2) an intent to do harm without excuse or justification, and (3) use of the process in a perverted manner to obtain a collateral objective.\"\n   <em>\n    Curiano v.
