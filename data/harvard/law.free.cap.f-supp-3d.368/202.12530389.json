Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Stephanie Rauseo (\"Rauseo\") lives in the Apple Hill neighborhood of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, adjacent to the property at issue in this action (\"the Property\"). Rauseo, along with a local citizens' group, Apple Hill Neighbors Group (\"Apple Hill plaintiffs\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") allege that Marco Tammaro (\"Tammaro\"), the owner of the Property, unlawfully discharged fill into federally protected streams or wetlands without a permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Consequently, plaintiffs contacted the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\"), the Lynnfield Planning Board, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the Army Corps of Engineers (\"the Corps\"). Specifically, plaintiffs complained to the EPA that Tammaro had violated the Clean Water Act (\"the CWA\") to no avail. In 2016, plaintiffs discovered that Tammaro's developer, Peter Ogren (\"Ogren\"), provided notice to the Corps that the activities on the Property were exempt from Section 404 of the CWA. In response, plaintiffs urged the New England Engineer of the Corps to enforce the CWA, claiming that neither an individual nor a general Section 404 permit authorized Tammaro's work on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November, 2016, the Corps visited the Property without notifying plaintiffs and allegedly made a final Jurisdictional Determination (\"JD\") with respect to the Property. They have since averred that the Property abuts a conservation area and that the two water streams that run across the Property and into the conservation\n   area are waters of the United States that are subject to EPA drinking water regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"the SDWA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November, 2017, plaintiffs sent a 60-day Notice of Intent to Sue (\"NOI\") under the CWA and the SDWA to Tammaro, representatives of the Commonwealth, the DEP, the U.S. Department of Justice and the EPA. Although plaintiffs did not name the Corps in its NOI, they filed an amended complaint with this Court in April, 2018, in which they allege: CWA violations against Tammaro (Count I), CWA violations against EPA and the Corps (\"the federal defendants\") (Count II), SDWA violations against Tammaro and the federal defendants (Count III), APA procedural violations against the federal defendants (Count IV), APA substantive violations against the federal defendants (Counts V and VII), improper ex parte communications against all defendants (Count VI) and Sunshine Act violations against the federal defendants (Count VIII). Pending before this Court are motions of the federal defendants and of Tammaro to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Viewing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, the Court finds that Tammaro's alleged pollution of two streams with dirt constitutes a continuous and ongoing violation.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Tammaro contends that plaintiffs have not demonstrated any concrete or actual injury, either individually or as a group, because the alleged interference with the streams has no direct bearing on the plaintiffs themselves. Plaintiffs respond that the harm is not speculative because the drinking water has become non-potable. The Court declines to consider plaintiffs' recently proffered water report conducted by Ms. Langham because it is untimely and its authenticity is in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Watterson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507731\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/1/#p3\">\n    987 F.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3 (1st Cir. 1993) (declining to take judicial notice of documents whose authenticity is in dispute). It does find, however, that plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a cognizable injury in their amended complaint in that they allege that the runoff from Tammaro's property has deposited pollutants into plaintiffs' drinking water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Tammaro ultimately prevails on the other prongs of the standing analysis, however, because plaintiffs have failed to prove both traceability and redressability.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (holding that a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant and it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injury). In their opposition, plaintiffs concede that even the Lynnfield Water District is unsure of the cause of the poor drinking water quality. Thus, even if plaintiffs could demonstrate a causal connection between Tammaro's alleged pollution and the cognizable harm, relief by this Court would not remedy the alleged harm of non-potable drinking water. As such, plaintiffs have failed to satisfy standing requirements and Tammaro's motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs' SDWA claim will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    4.
