FRANK, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This matter is before the Court upon\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Billie Edmonds' (\"Plaintiff\") objections (Doc. No. 47) to Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz's February 14, 2018 Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 45) insofar as it recommends that Defendant Minneapolis Public Schools, Special District No. 1's (\"Defendant\") motion for summary judgment be granted and that the Declaration (Doc. No. 40) and documents/exhibits (Doc. No. 40-1) filed by Plaintiff remain sealed. Defendant filed a response to Plaintiff's objections on March 15, 2018. (Doc. No. 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The factual background for the above-entitled matter is clearly and precisely set forth in the Report and Recommendation and is incorporated by reference for purposes of Plaintiff's objections. In the Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge concluded that Plaintiff did not present facts that support an inference of race discrimination so as to establish a prima facie case. In addition, the Magistrate Judge explained that even if Plaintiff had established a prima face case of race discrimination, Defendant provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Plaintiff's employment and Plaintiff failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that her termination was a pretext for race discrimination. With respect to Plaintiff's reprisal claim, the Magistrate Judge similarly concluded that Plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the reason for her termination was a pretext for unlawful reprisal. Plaintiff objects to the Report and Recommendation. In particular, Plaintiff objects to certain factual findings and argues generally that the record contains evidence of race discrimination and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court has conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record, including a review of the arguments and submissions of counsel, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and Local Rule 72.2(b). The Court finds no reason that would warrant departure from the Magistrate Judge's recommendation. Indeed, viewing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is no genuine issue of fact as to her claims that she was terminated because of her race or because she engaged in protected conduct. Therefore, based upon the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record and all of the arguments and submissions of the parties and the Court being otherwise duly advised in the premises, the Court hereby enters the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

Edmonds alleges that her termination was due to race discrimination and retaliation. Minneapolis Public Schools states that it was due to poor performance. Edmonds has not provided evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the performance reasons given by the school district for her termination were a pretext and that the real reason was race discrimination or retaliation Therefore, the Court grants the school district's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Billie Edmonds filed a complaint as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff against Minneapolis Public Schools, Special School District 1 (\"MPS\") and Martha Spriggs on October 3, 2016. Docket No. 1. She alleged race discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and the Minnesota Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"), Minn. Stat. \u00a7 363A.08 ; and reprisal in violation of the MHRA, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 363A.15.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 24-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On October 7, 2016 the Court informed Edmonds of the Federal Bar Association, Minnesota Chapter (\"FBA\")\n   <em>\n    Pro Se\n   </em>\n   Project, which she could contact to request that a volunteer lawyer review her case. Docket No. 3. Edmonds filed an Amended Complaint against only MPS (not Spriggs) on December 5, 2016. Docket No. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 14, 2016 the Court referred this case to the FBA's Early Settlement Conference Project (\"ESCP\"). Docket No. 10. A day-long settlement conference with the Court was held on February 22, 2017, at which Edmonds was represented by ESCP counsel. Civil Minutes, Docket No. 20. The case did not settle, but a settlement offer to Edmonds remained open through February 27.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On February 28 the parties advised the Court that settlement discussions were continuing. Civil Minutes, Docket No. 21. When the case did not settle, the Court removed it from the ESCP project and released the volunteer attorney from her responsibilities as Edmonds' counsel. Docket No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   MPS moved for summary judgment on September 8, 2017. Docket No. 31. Edmonds did not file any response. A hearing was held on October 31, 2017. Civil Minutes, Docket No. 39. Edmonds attended the hearing, argued in opposition to MPS's motion, and brought documents which the Court marked as Plaintiff's Exhibits 1 to 40.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court made copies of the marked exhibits and provided a set to each party after the hearing ended.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   MPS objected to the documents because Edmonds had failed to file any written response to MPS's summary judgment motion and because some of the documents contained protected non-public information, including students' names and disciplinary incidents, that cannot be disclosed\n   in the public record. Accordingly, the Court stated that they would not be made part of the public file.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court also granted MPS permission to file a supplemental brief to address Edmonds' arguments and documents she brought to the hearing and ordered MPS to file the errata sheet from Edmonds' deposition transcript.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 1, 2017, without permission from the Court, Edmonds filed an untimely declaration opposing MPS's summary judgment motion. Docket No. 40. Edmonds characterized the document as a recitation of what she had stated at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Here is what was spoken out loud at the hearing, October 31, 201[7] at 9:30 AM-10:30 when plaintiff was reading from documents.\") Edmonds attached to her declaration 48 pages of exhibits that included protected non-public information about students. Docket No. 40-1. It appears these exhibits include some of the documents that the Court marked as Plaintiff's Exhibits at the October 31, 2017 hearing; however, they do not show any numbered exhibit stickers that the Court affixed to documents at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the handwritten exhibit numbers on the documents in Docket No. 40-1 do not correspond to the Plaintiff's Exhibit numbers from the hearing. On November 3, 2017, after MPS's counsel alerted the Court that Edmonds had filed documents containing confidential student information, the Court restricted access so that only the parties and the Court are able to see the declaration and attachments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket entry notation, Docket Nos. 40, 40-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As set forth in the Order below, the Court is ordering that the declaration and documents in Docket Nos. 40 and 40-1 remain sealed because they include protected non-public information about students, in particular, information relating to student conduct and discipline. Most of the information in Docket Nos. 40 and 40-1 does not fall in that protected category and the documents could have been filed in redacted form or been the subject of a motion to seal; however, that is not how these materials were filed with the Court. Therefore, the Court will order that Docket Nos. 40 and 40-1 remain sealed and available only to the parties in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 10, 2017 MPS filed its Reply Memorandum, Supplemental Declaration, and the 22-page errata sheet for Edmonds' deposition transcript. Docket Nos. 41-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In approximately May-June 2015 Edmonds, an African-American woman, was working in a short-term education support position at Lake Nokomis Community School-Keewaydin Campus when its then-Principal Martha Spriggs encouraged her to apply for an open position as Behavior Dean/Associate Educator.

She filed no response, offered no explanation or good cause to excuse her failure to do so, and did not move for an extension of time. Edmonds made an oral argument at the October 31 hearing, brought documents to the hearing, and filed a post-hearing declaration and exhibits on November 1, as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Edmonds' failure to submit any legal memorandum or analysis, timely or otherwise, makes it difficult to sort out her arguments as the Court analyzes the legal sufficiency of her case. Her post-hearing declaration and documents merit exclusion from the summary judgment record due to their untimeliness and her failure to follow the Local Rules. Nonetheless, the Court will include them, in part, in the summary\n   judgment record, partly in order for the Court to better explain the basis for its disposition of this case, subject to three important limitations. First, the Court must disregard Edmonds' statements and documents that are not based on personal knowledge and are not admissible evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A[ ] ... declaration used to ... oppose a motion must be based on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the ... declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Hearsay evidence cannot be used to defeat a summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. Tri-Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1550640\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/425/1109/#p1111\">\n    425 F.3d 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1111 (8th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the Court will not consider any statements in Edmonds' declaration that contradict her deposition testimony. Generally, a court should consider a declaration submitted in response to a summary judgment motion when it \"elaborates upon or clarifies information already submitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole v. Homier Distributing Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222176\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/856/#p867\">\n    599 F.3d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 867 (8th Cir. 2010). \"However, a party cannot avoid summary judgment by contradicting previous sworn testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222176\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/856/#p867\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, the Court excludes from the summary judgment record the documents that Edmonds failed to produce during discovery, specifically, exhibits 16, 27-30, 34-37, 39-40\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed in Docket No. 40-1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aba-Onu Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (identifying documents not produced during discovery), Docket No. 42. A party who fails to disclose or supplement required discovery \"is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At her July 28, 2017 deposition, Edmonds testified that she may have some additional documents that she did not previously produce to MPS and that she would check her records and produce any additional documents by July 31, 2017. Edmonds Dep. Tr. 225-29, Aba-Onu Supp. Decl. Ex.7, Docket No. 42-1. However, Edmonds did not provide any additional documents until after the October 31 summary judgment hearing, and she offered no reason or good cause for her months-long delay. Her failure to produce the documents before discovery closed deprived MPS of the opportunity to depose her about them and to address those documents when preparing its summary judgment motion and legal memorandum. Although the Court gave MPS an opportunity to file a reply memorandum to address Edmonds' untimely documents, that is not a substitute for a party's ability to investigate facts and develop legal defenses during discovery. Accordingly, the Court will exclude those documents from the summary judgment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Race Discrimination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To establish a prima facie case of race discrimination, Edmonds must show that (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) there is evidence that gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Green v.

As Edmonds testified at her deposition, the only other Behavior Dean was, like Edmonds, an African-American woman, Charleine Williams. Edmonds Dep. Tr. 76-78, Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 1, Docket No. 35-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although Edmonds testified that \"ten to twenty\" employees performed similar behavioral disciplinary duties as Williams and herself, she was unable to recall any names.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08. She also testified that \"Caucasian employees\" were given training and computer access that was denied to her, but she was unable to provide any specifics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264-66. In her post-hearing declaration, Edmonds makes allegations about actions or inaction by \"Caucasian teachers\" and asserts that she was treated differently. Edmonds Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 27, Docket No. 40. However, despite her belief that teachers are \"support staff\" who may have had some duties in common with her in her position as Behavior Dean [Edmonds Dep. Tr. 106, Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 1, Docket No. 35-1], Edmonds has not established that she is similarly situated to a teacher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaCroix v.

On its face, \"teacher\" is a different job than \"Behavior Dean.\" Moreover, Edmonds did not state any specific facts or present any admissible evidence to show that any teacher's alleged actions or inaction occurred under comparable circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The burden of establishing a prima facie case is not onerous.\n   <em>\n    Torgerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1046\">\n    643 F.3d at 1051-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Edmonds has not identified any \"similarly situated\" employee who was treated differently, and she has not presented any facts that support an inference of race discrimination. Therefore, she has not met her burden, and summary judgment is warranted on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Even if Edmonds had established a prima facie case of race discrimination, MPS provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating her employment, namely, poor job performance during her probationary period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spriggs Decl.

Moreover, it was the same decisionmaker (Spriggs) who encouraged her to apply for the Behavior Dean position, hired her, and then terminated her approximately seven weeks later during her probationary period. When the same person hires and terminates an employee within a short period of time, there is a strong inference that discrimination was not a determining factor in the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rothmeier v.

There is nothing in the record to indicate that during this short time frame Spriggs developed racial animus that motivated her to terminate Edmonds' employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Edmonds also contends that she was denied training and computer access and that Spriggs reneged on an agreement for her to attend a Restorative Practices training seminar.

However, the record shows that Spriggs promptly approved computer access for Edmonds, and the delays in implementing that access involved the IT department, not Spriggs. Edmonds' September 2, 2015 email to the IT help desk states that she \"put in the request [for computer access] a week ago. Ms. Spriggs approved it.\" Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 4, Docket No. 35-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Edmonds Dep. Tr. 142-44, Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 1, Ex. 4 (Sept. 22, 2015 email to IT: \"I have access to Discovery.

She received behavioral standards training from Francis, and she discussed behaviors, interventions and responses with Francis and Williams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130, 133. She was given a chart regarding behavior levels, interventions and responses needed as a Behavior Dean, and an example of an investigatory report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132-33. Spriggs gave her literature on restorative justice approaches, which Edmonds read and discussed with Spriggs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-32. Edmonds had an opportunity to talk with Spriggs, Williams and Francis about any questions or issues regarding the training and documents, and did in fact do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117-18, 130-31, 135-36, 144-45. She testified that Spriggs and Williams provided her with solutions on how to deal with issues relating to her job duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117-18, 135-36. The record does not support an inference of race-based discrimination related to training or computer access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Edmonds offers no response to a specific example given by Spriggs, namely, an incident involving a third grade student who was twice harmed on the playground. Spriggs stated that Edmonds did not investigate or follow up with the student's father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spriggs Decl. Ex. 1, Docket No. 34-1. Edmonds does not address this example; rather, she makes general assertions that she contacted parents while performing her job. However, just because she may have contacted some parents does not mean she contacted parents in all instances or, specifically, in the instances that were reported to Spriggs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Edmonds contends that Spriggs or \"other staff\" \"could have\" altered the Google Documents on which student behavioral incidents and data were recorded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Edmonds Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, Docket No. 40. For example, Edmonds states that \"Spriggs edited the Google doc on September 22, 2015.\n   <em>\n    (Exhibit 27)\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. However, there are two problems with Edmonds' reliance on the document she labeled as Exhibit 27. First, as discussed above, the Court has excluded the document from the summary judgment record due to Edmonds' failure to produce it to MPS during discovery. Second, on its face, it does not support any suggestion that Spriggs altered any information that Edmonds had input; rather, the document is a September 22, 2015 email from Spriggs to Edmonds and Williams that states, \"I've made a change to the behavior log on Google docs. I've added a column to indicate a call home. Please be sure to make a call ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 27, Docket No. 40-1. It is pure speculation by Edmonds, unsupported by any specific facts based on personal knowledge, to allege that Spriggs or other staff \"could have\" altered data in some way that might be relevant to her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   More fundamentally, there is no evidence that the tracking data played any role in Spriggs' termination decision. Edmonds alleges that Spriggs \"could not evaluate my performance on tracking data in Discovery ... because I was not giv[en] [computer] access\" until late September.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Edmonds Decl. \u00b6 19, Docket No. 40. However, there is no evidence that Spriggs based her conclusions about Edmonds'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   performance on a review of tracking documentation. Rather, Spriggs' declaration and her October 1, 2015 email to Employee Relations staff indicate that she relied on reports from parents and on her own observations and interactions with Edmonds to conclude that Edmonds was not meeting performance expectations as Behavior Dean.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spriggs Decl. \u00b6 5 (\"Despite our meetings and discussions, Ms. Edmonds continued to underperform and she demonstrated that she did not have any awareness of what her job responsibilities were and how far away she actually was from performing them competently.\"), Ex. 1 (\"Parents have reported that they 'received no call.' \"; \"Seems confused about her role\"; \"Poor email communication with me\"; \"Does not resolve behavior issues-she brings the issue to me prior to doing any investigation or problem solving. 'These two kids were sent out.' Then looks at me.\"), Docket No. 34-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Spriggs stated that \"[a]t the onset of her employment, I had concerns with Ms. Edmonds's inability to carry out her job duties\" and that she \"continued to underperform.\" Spriggs Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, Docket No. 34. Although Edmonds believes and asserts that she was performing well, she presents no evidence that Spriggs' concerns and opinions about Edmonds' performance were not sincerely held. When evaluating whether MPS's stated reason has a \"basis in fact,\" the \"critical inquiry\" is not whether Edmonds was actually performing well enough to retain her job during her probationary period, but rather \"whether the employer in good faith believed\" that her performance was deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277634\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/810/#p818\">\n    851 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Edmonds has not carried her legal burden to present sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that Spriggs was motivated by retaliation. Edmonds alleges she was terminated in retaliation for \"reporting racially based disparate treatment of students.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 11, 21, Docket No. 8. To support her claim of pretext, Edmonds testified that her Behavior Dean job gave her the authority to document and report students' complaints of unfair treatment due to their race, and that \"teachers [may be] feeling that their jobs would be threatened.\" Edmonds Dep. Tr. 268-74, Aba-Onu Supp. Decl. Ex. 7, Docket No. 42-1. She testified that she made verbal reports to Spriggs and attended meetings with Spriggs, Williams, and a counselor at which they would discuss \"how African-American students were complaining about the treatment of them from teachers and how they felt that they w[ere] being treated harshly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266-68, 276-77. Edmonds testified that \"[w]e discussed that on numerous occasions because we've had to report the color of our student[s] in Google Docs which gave [Spriggs] identification of who the students were.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267. Edmonds stated that she was required to identify a student's race/ethnicity when documenting a complaint or behavior incident and that data was collected \"to make sure that students were not being discriminated against.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 269-70; Edmonds Decl. \u00b6 22, Docket No. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Edmonds offers no connection between her performance of this aspect of her job and any retaliatory motive by Spriggs. The subject was discussed in meetings with other school employees, including the other Behavior Dean, and documented in the school's behavior log. Although Edmonds suggests that one or more teachers may have retaliatory animus towards her-for example, her testimony that \"teachers [may be] feeling that their jobs would be threatened\"-she also testified that some teachers told her she was doing a good job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Edmonds Dep. Tr. 145, 266, 269, Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 1, Docket No. 35-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, it was Principal Spriggs who hired, supervised, and terminated her, not the teachers. The record does not support an inference of retaliatory motive by Spriggs based on communicating students' complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Similarly, Edmonds contends that unidentified persons at a school district meeting may have influenced Spriggs to terminate her employment. An employer may be liable for an adverse employment action \"if one of its agents-other than the ultimate decisionmaker-is motivated by retaliatory animus and intentionally and proximately causes the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Rooney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266659\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1111/#p1115\">\n    878 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence that this person \"initiated, exercised, or even possessed any influence or leverage over the ultimate decisionmaker.\"\n   <em>\n    Liles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277634\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/810/#p818\">\n    851 F.3d at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In her post-hearing declaration Edmonds asserts that \"Martha Spriggs had\n   no complaints of my performance until October after her attending a district meeting with other leaders from the school District which I believe could have influence[d] her decision.\" Edmonds Decl. \u00b6 9, Docket No. 40. However, Edmonds offers no specific facts and no admissible evidence to support her allegation. She does not give any date for the alleged district meeting; does not identify who attended or whether anyone other than Spriggs knew Edmonds or knew about her; does not describe what was said at the meeting, or by whom; does not explain how or why any attendee would have retaliatory animus towards her; and does not explain what influence or leverage any attendee had over Spriggs or how such person would have exercised that influence so as to cause Spriggs to terminate Edmonds' employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, the timing does not support Edmonds' allegation. The record shows that Spriggs had decided to terminate Edmonds' employment no later than October 1, because October 1 is the date of her email to Employee Relations stating her termination decision and her reasons, and October 2 is the date of the termination letter that was hand delivered to Edmonds. Spriggs Decl. Ex. 1, Docket No. 34-1; Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 6, Docket No. 35-1. Any \"district meeting\" in \"October\" that took place after October 1 could not have influenced Spriggs' decision because she communicated her decision to Employee Relations staff on October 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Edmonds also testified that, \"as an African-American parent, not as the behavior dean,\" she told Spriggs that she thought a teacher \"discriminated against\" her child. Edmonds Dep. Tr. 268, Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 1, Docket No. 35-1. The implication is that the discrimination was based on race, but the deposition transcript pages submitted to the Court contain no additional details of the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aba-Onu Decl. Ex. 1 and Supp. Decl. Ex. 7 (attaching deposition excerpts), Docket Nos. 35-1 and 42-1. Edmonds' post-hearing declaration describes the incident but does not mention any discrimination based on race. Edmonds stated that she informed Spriggs during the week of September 28, 2015 about an \"incident that involved my [child].\" Edmonds Decl. \u00b6 10, Docket No. 40. She alleges that a teacher told her child that \"[the child] would not be getting special treatment because I [Edmonds] work at the school,\" that her child's \"feeling was hurt and [the child] felt very uncomfortable by her choice of words. Martha Spriggs let me know that my concern was noted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277634\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/810/#p818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record contains no statement from the teacher or anyone else with personal knowledge of the incident. On its face, Edmonds' description of the incident she reported to Spriggs relates to treatment based not on race but instead on the student having a parent who is a school employee. In addition, the comment that \"Spriggs let me know that my concern was noted\" does not support an inference of retaliatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Edmonds points to the timing of her termination as evidence of pretext. She alleges that during the last couple of weeks of her employment she discussed with Spriggs some students' complaints about being unfairly treated based on their race, and that about a week before she was terminated she told Spriggs about the incident involving her child. Edmonds Dep. Tr. 266, 276-77, Aba-Onu Supp. Decl. Ex. 7, Docket No. 42-1; Edmonds Decl. \u00b6 10, Docket No. 40. While temporal proximity standing alone is not evidence of pretext, it can be evidence to support an inference of retaliation if the other evidence is strong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645198\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/903/#p913\">\n    459 F.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]iming alone is insufficient to show a pretextual motive rebutting a legitimate, non-discriminatory\n   reason for an adverse employment action.\") For example, in\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

The court held that this evidence supported an inference that her employer's stated reason was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933829\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/688/#p692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933829\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/688/#p692\">\n    at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   There are no similar facts here. Edmonds was terminated during her probationary period, which by definition is of relatively short duration. Given that her entire employment lasted only about seven weeks, the temporal proximity factor does not weigh heavily in her favor, given the absence of other specific facts to support an inference of retaliatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Edmonds has not provided evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Spriggs' specific performance reasons given for her termination were a pretext for reprisal. As discussed above regarding Edmonds' race discrimination claim, to defeat MPS's summary judgment motion, Edmonds must do more than dispute Spriggs' conclusion that Edmonds' job performance was unsatisfactory or present some evidence that one or more of Spriggs' reasons may have been wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benassi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089473\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/629/475/#p482\">\n    629 N.W.2d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The proper scope of inquiry on the issue of pretext is limited to whether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior.\").
