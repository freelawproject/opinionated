The creation, distribution and enforcement of the Missouri Lectionary promotes the Missouri Tenets in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because the State of Missouri is using its power to regulate abortion to promote some, but not all, religious beliefs that Human Tissue is, from conception, a separate and unique human being whose destruction is morally wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Missouri Tenets and Missouri Lectionary foster an excessive entanglement between the State of Missouri and adherents to the religious belief that Human Tissue is a separate and unique human being from conception whose destruction is morally wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Neither the Missouri Tenets nor the Missouri Lectionary promote the religious belief that Human Tissue is part of a woman's body that may be removed on demand in good conscience and without consideration of the current or future condition of the Human Tissue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants are acting under color of state law in the creation, distribution and enforcement of the Missouri Lectionary to promote the Missouri Tenets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants have infringed on Plaintiffs' rights under the Establishment Clause in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the creation, distribution and enforcement of the Missouri Lectionary to promote the Missouri Tenets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff has been and will be irreparably injured by that violation because the\n   Missouri Tenets and Missouri Lectionary are forced upon her with the intent and purpose to cause her guilt for believing the Satanic Tenets and not believing the Missouri Tenets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II - Free Exercise Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the following in support of her Free Exercise violation claim:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Missouri Tenets and Missouri Lectionary discriminate between a viewpoint that adheres to the Missouri Tenets and those viewpoints that do not.

That burden includes, without limitation, forcing Plaintiff to act and forgo acting in a manner that violates her belief in the Satanic Tenets as a condition for getting an abortion in Missouri. The Missouri Lectionary and Missouri Tenets have caused and will cause Plaintiff to endure guilt, doubt, and shame because she believes the Satanic Tenets and does not believe the Missouri Tenets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs claim Defendants have infringed on Plaintiffs' rights under the Free Exercise Clause in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the creation, distribution and enforcement of the Missouri Lectionary to promote the Missouri Tenets.

Nevertheless, Plaintiff asserts that the Missouri Tenets convey the messages that abortion is \"morally wrong\" and that \"abortion is murder.\" This interpretation is not reasonable. A woman absolutely maintains the right and ability to legally terminate her pregnancy, making the contention that the state legally conflates abortion with murder through the Missouri Tenets unfounded and untenable. A person's belief as to whether abortion is \"morally wrong\" is, as Plaintiff points out, the subjective conclusion of one's moral, theological, and philosophical ideas and beliefs. The Missouri Tenets do not reach the depth of such beliefs.

The Informed Consent Provisions are neutral laws of general applicability. The Informed Consent Provisions prescribe that all women who seek an abortion in Missouri must be given the Booklet, must receive an Ultrasound Opportunity, must wait 72 hours, and must confirm that she received the Booklet and Ultrasound Opportunity before she can get an abortion. The Satanic Tenets proscribe compliance with any law that places conditions on abortion that are antithetical to the Satanic Tenets.

The theory of hybrid rights comes from\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court noted that the First Amendment can bar \"application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action\" in cases involving \"the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p879\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p879\">\n    at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p879\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Ultrasound Opportunity is not burdensome because a woman is given a choice whether to have an ultrasound.
