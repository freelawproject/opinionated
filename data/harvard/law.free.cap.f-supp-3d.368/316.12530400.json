In\n   <em>\n    Acosta-Mart\u00ednez\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that \"if Congress has made clear its intent that a federal statute apply to Puerto Rico, then the issue of whether a law is otherwise 'locally inapplicable' does not, by definition, arise.\"\n   <em>\n    Acosta-Mart\u00ednez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084902\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/13/\">\n    252 F.3d at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Candelario asserts that the First Circuit Court of Appeals in \"\n   <em>\n    Acosta-Mart\u00ednez\n   </em>\n   did not consider ... whether it is cruel and unusual punishment for the federal government to impose capital punishment on a citizen of Puerto Rico, for an alleged crime committed in Puerto Rico against another Puerto Rican citizen.\" (Docket No. 1482 at p. 147.) Candelario, however, is a United States citizen, and the federal government has authority to regulate his criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath v.

Indeed, Candelario concedes that binding precedent prevents success on his claim regarding the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act. (Docket No. 1483 at pp. 140-41.) Accordingly, the Court rejects Candelario's contention that the FDPA violates the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Request for Informative Outline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Candelario requests that the Court \"require a detailed offer of proof and schedule a hearing to test the relevance, reliability and admissibility of the government's aggravating factors evidence.\" (Docket No. 1482 at p. 70;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 70-81.) Candelario states that the United States provided insufficient notice of two statutory aggravating factors and all non-statutory aggravating factors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 77-78. He also \"seeks a detailed proffer which identifies all witnesses and documents and other evidence which the government intends to present to the jury with regard to victim impact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Candelario's requests are unavailing. The FDPA requires the United States to provide notice of its intent to seek the death penalty but not its evidence in support of the factors requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The United States filed and served Candelario with a Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty on July 8, 2012. (Docket No. 458.) In 2013, the United States presented evidence to establish the aggravating factors during trial. Candelario thus received proper notice of the aggravating factors, in addition to the opportunity to preview the evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is within the Court's discretion to grant a pre-trial reliability hearing if the defendant demonstrates necessity for such procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Pa. 2001). The FDPA provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence, however, do not apply during the penalty phase of trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Consequently, the FDPA establishes \"very low barriers\" for the admissibility of information.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Basham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480916\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/302/#p331\">\n    561 F.3d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (4th Cir. 2009). In\n   <em>\n    Gregg\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court encouraged the introduction of as much information as helpful to assist the jury in determining whether to impose a death sentence.\n   <em>\n    Gregg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176749\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/153/#p181\">\n    428 U.S. at 203-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176749\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/153/#p181\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]o long as the evidence introduced and the arguments made at the pre-sentence hearing do not prejudice a defendant, it is preferred not to impose restrictions. We think it desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes a sentencing decision.\"). Candelario has failed to establish any need to preview the United States' evidence, especially given the existence of the record from the prior trial and the low hurdle for admissibility in the penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because Candelario received sufficient notice, fails to demonstrate any \"danger of surprise,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
