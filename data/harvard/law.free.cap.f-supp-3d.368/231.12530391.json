Plaintiff was shaking and had rolled out of bed onto the floor. He was unresponsive and a substance was coming from his mouth. When officers arrived they attempted to stop Plaintiff from moving and administer oxygen, but Plaintiff resisted. Plaintiff then attempted to leave his apartment; he was flailing his arms and was highly agitated. The officers threw Plaintiff onto a La-Z-Boy sofa, which toppled over backwards, and Plaintiff landed on his back and shoulder. One officer fell on top of Plaintiff and a \"swarm\" of others quickly jumped on top of him. An officer placed his knee in the center of Plaintiff's back and then placed two sets of handcuffs on Plaintiff. Officers also used a leg-lock technique to prevent Plaintiff's kicking. Plaintiff repeatedly hit his head against the hardwood floor, so officers initially attempted to stop Plaintiff with their hands and then placed a pillow under his head. Eventually, Plaintiff was put on a stretcher. While in the ambulance, Plaintiff was kicking, thrashing, and hitting everyone around him. He struggled against the handcuffs so much that they cut his wrists open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff eventually arrived at UMass Memorial Medical Center where he was diagnosed with cluster seizures. Mrs. Lachance observed bruising and abrasions on Plaintiff at the hospital resulting from the altercation with officers. Similarly, Plaintiff's son observed that his father had cuff marks, deep cuts on his wrists, and bruising all over his back, ribs, and shoulders. Plaintiff suffered a thoracic T4-T5 compression fracture from being pushed over the couch which caused back pain for over a year after the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the moving party shows, based on the materials in the record, \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Similarly, here, Defendants knew they were responding to a medical emergency. Plaintiff was in his own home, undressed and unarmed. Further, Plaintiff was even less likely to pose a threat to officers than the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , as Plaintiff was experiencing a medical emergency rather than suffering from mental illness. And while Cummings had a\n   distinct height and weight advantage over Gray, Defendants here had a distinct advantage in numbers.

The record unquestionably supports that Plaintiff resisted officers' efforts to restrain him. Thus, like in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , \"the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors point in conflicting directions.

Here, there is a genuine dispute whether an officer put his knee on Plaintiff's back. Moreover, it is unclear from the record how long officers exerted weight on Plaintiff's back or whether they stopped after his hands and feet were restrained. At this stage, disputes must be resolved, and inferences must be drawn, in Plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Varrasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118515,1848796\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/760/\">\n    37 F.3d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"This means, of course, that summary judgement is inappropriate if inferences are necessary for the judgement and those inferences are not mandated by the record.\");\n   <em>\n    Blanchard v.

Thus, for the purposes of this motion, I find a reasonable officer would have been aware that his actions violated the constitutional right established by the abundant caselaw noted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff's most serious injury, however, seems to have occurred from being pushed over the couch and not from an officer kneeling on his back.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 25-9, 12-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court is faced with\n   the question of whether it should assess the force used by officers with respect to each discrete act or in its entirety.

In\n   <em>\n    Alexis\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the First Circuit, viewing the record in the plaintiff's favor at the summary judgment stage, reversed the district court's grant of qualified immunity on an excessive force claim where\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Leporati suddenly and violently grabbed and pulled [the plaintiff] from the booth and across the table, handcuffed her hands tightly behind her back, and, with the held of Officer Fuer, dragged her from the booth, bruising her legs in the process....

On the other hand, in\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit seemed to confine its focus to a singular, excessive act. In that case, Jennings initially resisted arrest, which required the use of force by officers to subdue him. During the ensuing struggle, Officer Jones used an \"ankle turn control technique.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654226\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/2/#p3\">\n    499 F.3d 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3-4 (1st Cir. 2007). The officer's use of the \"ankle turn control technique\" caused Jennings considerable pain. Jennings then told Jones that the \"ankle turn\" was hurting his previously injured ankle. Jones then increased the force he was using and broke Jennings' ankle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654226\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/2/#p3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654226\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/2/#p3\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Alexis\n   </em>\n   court might have also used a segmented approach because every \"segment\" of the altercation in that case arguably involved excessive force. Here, just as the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   had a right to be free from an ankle-lock after he stopped resisting, Plaintiff had a clearly established right to be free from an officer kneeling on his back after he had already been restrained. Also like in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , however, Plaintiff's own actions might have initially \"require[ed] the use of force by state police officials to subdue him.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654226\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/2/#p3\">\n    499 F.3d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
