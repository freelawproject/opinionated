Plaintiff Gina Pike (\"Plaintiff\") filed a response to the objections. Pursuant to the Magistrate Judge's March 1, 2019 Order, Defendant filed a reply and Plaintiff filed a surreply.

Plaintiff is insured for LTD benefits under the Policy.

However, after later determining Plaintiff was unable to prove she continued to be \"disabled\" under the Policy, Defendant discontinued LTD benefits effective December 15, 2016. The issue is whether Plaintiff is entitled to receive LTD benefits after December 14, 2016 under the Policy. Plaintiff seeks the benefits she has been denied plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, recovery of attorney's fees and costs, clarification of her right to receive future benefits under the policy, and any other appropriate equitable relief.

Dkt. # 33. The Magistrate Judge's recommended findings and conclusions are based upon the Agreed Administrative Record. Plaintiff's lengthy medical history, as well as the facts behind Defendant's termination of LTD benefits, are set forth in detail in the Recommended Findings of Fact section of the R &amp; R and are not duplicated herein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Magistrate Judge stated Plaintiff, to obtain LTD benefits beyond December 14, 2016, must show by a preponderance of the evidence that she cannot perform one or\n   more essential duties of any occupation for which she is qualified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Based on the Agreed Administrative Record, the Magistrate Judge concluded Plaintiff had shown she could not perform all the essential duties of any occupation for which she is reasonably qualified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. The Magistrate Judge summarized the medical evidence she previously set forth in detail in the Recommended Findings of Fact section of the R &amp; R. Dkt. # 33 at 37-39. Specifically, the Magistrate Judge stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff has suffered from severe back pain since at least 2002, when a diagnostic lumbar discogram revealed severe pathology at her L4-5, L5-S1 intervertebral levels as well as less severe degeneration at her L3-4 level. AR 507-08. Plaintiff underwent surgery in 2002 on her L4-S1 levels and improved for a time, but she began to deteriorate in 2004. AR 521, 533-34. By 2007, Plaintiff could not sit in a chair, lie in a bed, or stand for any significant length of time. AR 521.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff pursued aggressive surgical treatment with neurosurgeon, Robert Martin, M.D. On March 25, 2008, Dr. Martin performed an extreme interbody fusion at L3-4. AR 787-89. In July 2008, Dr. Martin stated Plaintiff could sit for no more than two hours in a day, stand for no more than two hours per day, and walk for no more than two hours per day. AR 1925. Dr. Martin further stated these limitations are permanent. AR 1925.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Still complaining of pain, Plaintiff next sought treatment with Ralph F. Rashbaum, M.D. Dr. Rashbaum diagnosed Plaintiff with \"failed back surgery syndrome\" and surgically implanted a spinal cord stimulator. AR 2237. The spinal cord stimulator eventually caused an increase in Plaintiff's symptoms, and Dr. Rashbaum surgically removed it in December 2012. AR 1802-03. Dr. Rashbaum recommended Plaintiff start long-term use of class II narcotics. In a \"long hard conversation,\" Dr. Rashbaum advised Plaintiff as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [S]he probably does need to try a class II medication.... I have told her in the past that she will more than likely always be on some form of pain medication, she wanted to avoid class II if possible. I think we have exhausted every other procedure and modality to try to prevent that. I am referring her now to Dr. Bernstein to see if he can find the right medication mix to help reduce her pain so that she can be more active. She wants to do so much, but is very limited physically. I have also provided her with a prescription for handicap parking placard that she can use. I think she pushes herself so far that she has been in such extreme pain that she is bedridden for 2 to 3 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   AR 2239.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's care then transitioned to pain management physician Sidney Bernstein, M.D., at the Texas Back Institute. Dr. Bernstein stated Plaintiff could sit, stand, and walk for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time and could not do any of the postures for more than a total of four hours per day. AR 1905.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 20, 2011, Hartford management reviewed Plaintiff's claim and noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Plaintiff] continues with chronic lower back and leg pain. Dr. Bernstein is managing her medications and making adjustment to help better control [her] pain. [She] is also having side effects from the meds and her weight is also of concern.... Although Dr. Bernstein notes that [Plaintiff] has the capacity to lift up to 10 lbs. frequently and up to 20 lbs. occasionally and able to frequently\n   fingering and handling, due to chronic intractable pain she is limited to 15-20 minutes sit/stand/walk for no more than 4 hrs/day. Therefore, it is reasonable that [Plaintiff] would be unable to sustain fulltime any occ[upation] activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   AR 926.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   When Dr. Bernstein retired in December 2011, Plaintiff updated Hartford with records from her current pain management physician, Noor Gajraj, M.D. Dr. Gajraj is Board Certified in Pain Management and has treated Plaintiff for more than five years. AR 14. In the most recent Attending Physician's Statement of Disability (\"APS\") No. 10, dated July 10, 2015, Dr. Gajraj listed Plaintiff's primary diagnosis as lumbar degenerative disc disease and her secondary diagnosis as lumbar radiculopathy. AR 1752-53 (duplicate AR 1783-84). He listed her medications as Dilaudid and Fentanyl and her current subjective symptoms as rightsided low back pain and right leg pain and tenderness. AR 1752. He opined Plaintiff could walk, stand, and sit for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time and for no longer than four hours per day. AR 1753.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Magistrate Judge considered the opinions of Plaintiff's treating physicians and the supporting evidence of their opinions, such as the surveillance and objective medical records and Defendant's actions over the course of several years. The Magistrate Judge found the treating physicians' opinions reliable and probative, concluding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the Agreed Administrative Record, Plaintiff has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that she cannot perform the essential duties, which includes the ability to work a full work week, of any occupation for which she qualifies. Plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that her disability persisted beyond December 14, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dkt. # 33 at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In her\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Magistrate Judge also considered the evidence relied upon by Defendant in justifying its termination of benefits and found no evidence of improvement in Plaintiff's condition since Defendant previously found Plaintiff was unable to sustain full time work in any occupation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Magistrate Judge concluded it was improper for Defendant to cease Plaintiff's LTD benefits, and Plaintiff is entitled to the reinstatement of her LTD benefits beginning December 15, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Magistrate Judge recommended Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Record be granted and Defendant's Cross-Motion for Judgment on the Record be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Magistrate Judge also considered whether pre-judgment interest, costs, and attorney's fees should be awarded as requested by Plaintiff. The Magistrate Judge found Plaintiff is entitled to receive LTD benefits from December 15, 2016, and to recover pre-judgment interest on those unpaid benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. She also found the circumstances support an award to Plaintiff for attorney's fees and costs, in addition to the benefits amount owed to her under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, rather than specifically recommend an award of fees and costs, the Magistrate Judge recommended that Plaintiff be directed to file, within twenty days from the date of any Order adopting the R &amp; R, a motion for pre-judgment interest, costs, and attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The R &amp; R specifies that any such motion must be legally and factually supported and that Defendant shall file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     OBJECTIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant filed three main objections to the Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\"), the first and second of which the\n   Court considers first in its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the R &amp; R. In the first main objection, Defendant asserts the R &amp; R fails to follow appropriate ERISA law and the Policy language, which leads to erroneous findings of fact and legal conclusions. This objection has six specific sub-arguments, which the Court lists herein in the order it will consider them: (1) the R &amp; R errs in misstating the Policy's definition of \"disability;\" (2) the R &amp; R improperly relies on outdated records for its conclusion on present disability; (3) the R &amp; R errs in applying the \"treating physician rule\" and giving deference to Plaintiff's treating physicians over independent reviewing physicians; (4) the R &amp; R wrongly relies on Plaintiff's subjective complaints as opposed to objective evidence; (5) the R &amp; R erroneously uses Plaintiff's attorney's arguments in briefing as findings; and (6) the R &amp; R \"cherry-picks\" from the AR instead of reconciling the evidence as the plan administrator must do in its benefits decision. Defendant also argues the R &amp; R improperly shifts the burden to Defendant to show evidence of improvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its related second main objection, Defendant asserts the R &amp; R relies on law outside the Fifth Circuit that is contrary to the way the Fifth Circuit will decide the issues. Specifically, Defendant argues the alleged \"factual and legal errors lead the R &amp; R to look to a district court case within the Ninth Circuit that does not represent how the Fifth Circuit views these issues.\" Dkt. # 37 at 2. According to Defendant, the Magistrate Judge does not address the case law cited by Defendant. Dkt. # 37 at 20. Finally, in its third main objection, Defendant asserts the R &amp; R purports to award Plaintiff attorney's fees without any motion practice and based on erroneous factual and legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In her response, Plaintiff emphasizes the standard in this case is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review as opposed to abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues Defendant's objections revisit a number of contested fact issues raised in the underlying briefing on which the Magistrate Judge found Plaintiff's evidence to be more compelling. Rather than \"cherry pick\" the Agreed Administrative Record, Plaintiff asserts the Magistrate Judge explained in detail why she found some evidence more probative and some evidence less probative. Dkt. # 38 at 12. Even though the Magistrate Judge indicated an award of attorney's fees would be appropriate, Plaintiff points out the R &amp; R did not award attorney's fees and costs to Plaintiff but specifically recommended the parties be ordered to further brief the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     THE UNDERSIGNED'S\n     <em>\n      DE NOVO\n     </em>\n     REVIEW OF R &amp; R\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard and scope of\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review of this ERISA case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the parties have agreed the Court's evaluation of this ERISA case\n   should be subject to\n   <em>\n    Firestone's\n   </em>\n   default\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the parties' arguments reflect a fundamental disagreement as to what such a review entails. The Court provides the following background as to why the Magistrate Judge found it necessary to reference law from outside this circuit in determining what such a review entails. A little over one year ago, a majority of the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled its precedent,\n   <em>\n    Pierre v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins.

The Court next considers whether the R &amp; R improperly relies on outdated records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether the R &amp; R improperly relies on outdated records for its conclusion on present disability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In its next sub-argument, Defendant asserts the Magistrate Judge focused on outdated medical records, outdated notations by Defendant in the claims notes, and outdated offers of settlement and payments, asserting past records do not serve to prove present disability. Dkt. # 37 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Among other things, Defendant criticizes the R &amp; R for \"lean[ing] heavily on outdated notations in the claims notes by Hartford at the time of Hartford's previous determinations that Pike met the definition of 'disability' under the [Policy] earlier in the administration of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

As one example, Defendant asserts the R &amp; R emphasized Dr. Martin, the neurosurgeon that performed Plaintiff's extreme interbody fusion at L3-4, provided limitations in July 2008 that he opined were permanent. Dkt. # 33 at 37 (citing AR 1925). According to Defendant, Dr. Martin last saw Plaintiff in September 2008, and the IME by Dr. Sklar (discussed in detail below) was conducted in September 2016.

Some of the evidence from Plaintiff's treating physicians (whose opinions she found reliable and probative) pre-dates Defendant's termination of benefits, but that does not necessarily make it less probative of Plaintiff's present condition. As noted by the Magistrate Judge, there is evidence in the Agreed Administrative Record indicating Plaintiff's functional impairments persisted beyond December 14, 2016. Dkt. # 33 at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Specifically, the Magistrate Judge noted there are numerous indications from Plaintiff's physicians, and from Defendant's notations, that improvement is not likely with Plaintiff's condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 1925 (Dr. Martin stating in 2008 the limitations are\n   permanent); AR 955 (note from September 21, 2009 that there was still pain that could be residual damage to the nerves from the hardware hitting the nerve or the original injury and further noting if it was nerve damage it could take 12-18 months to resolve \"\n   <strong>\n    if at all\n   </strong>\n   \") (emphasis added in R &amp; R); AR 956 (\"Went to Texas Back Institute on 06/01/2009 and revealed she had\n   <strong>\n    permanent nerve damage\n   </strong>\n   from the screws.\") (emphasis added in R &amp; R); AR 963-64; 2215-2218 (July 16, 2009 sensory nerve conduction study ) (revealing \"reduced recruitment and an increased proportion of high amplitude long duration MUAP's in the bilateral L5 myotomes\"); AR 922 (June 2011 notation by Defendant that due to her medical history of multiple failed back surgeries and her continued need to take class II medications, \"it was likely [Plaintiff] would be unable to participate in any type of work activity on a full time basis\" and also noting Plaintiff's level of medication and need to be \"bedridden for multiple days at a time would impact even limited activity and would be unable to sustain full time work\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   According to Plaintiff, evidence of \"permanent\" limitations in 2008 and \"permanent\" nerve damages in 2009 is probative that these conditions continued to exist in 2016 when Defendant terminated Plaintiff's LTD benefits. The Court agrees. Additionally, the Magistrate Judge did not limit her discussion to evidence pre-dating the termination. For example, in updated records from Plaintiff's pain management physician, Dr. Gajraj, for six office visits between February 17, 2015, and May 6, 2016, Dr. Gajraj wrote that \"[Plaintiff] is taking her medication as prescribed without significant side-effects and is gaining benefit in terms of analgesia and increased function.\" Dkt. # 33 at 18 (citing AR 1742-46, 1749). However, each record also noted Plaintiff's chief complaint remained \"right-sided low back pain and right leg pain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20Fed.%20Appx.%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In its objections, Defendant focuses on Dr. Gajraj's statement in each record that Plaintiff was taking her \"medication as prescribed without significant side-effects and is gaining benefit in terms of analgesia and increased function.\" Defendant further asserts the most recent May 6, 2016 record states Plaintiff \"is doing well overall\" and \"[h]er current medications are effective.\" Defendant argues these statements render any claims notations prior to Defendant's receipt of Dr. Gajraj's records in June 2016 irrelevant to Plaintiff's \"present-day disability.\" Dkt. # 37 at 15. According to Defendant, these 2015 and 2016 records clearly provided Defendant with more recent information on which to base its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Before addressing Defendant's separate argument regarding \"outdated notations\" in its claims notes, the Court notes it does not find Dr. Gajraj's statements that Plaintiff was \"gaining benefit in terms of analgesia and increased function\" as determinative as Defendant. Nor do these records render any claims notations prior to Defendant's receipt of those records irrelevant to the Court's\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. First, as noted by the Magistrate Judge, Dr. Gajraj's assessment in each record was lumbar degenerative disease/radiculopathy. Dkt. # 33 at 19. During this time, Dr. Gajraj also obtained an objective medical test, a Sudoscan on May 14, 2015, to detect peripheral neuropathy (damage to the peripheral nerves).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20Fed.%20Appx.%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 1747-48 (Sudoscan Report) ). Plaintiff's Sudoscan found possible early signs of peripheral autonomic neuropathy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. # 33 at 19 (citing AR 1747).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Importantly, with her appeal of the December 15, 2016 decision to terminate LTD benefits, Plaintiff's counsel submitted to Defendant a letter from Dr. Gajraj dated June 6, 2017. In this letter, Dr. Gajraj states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   I am a Board Certified Pain Management doctor and have been [Plaintiff's] treating physician or more than five years. I am very familiar with her condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [Plaintiff] suffers from chronic pain, secondary to lumbar degenerative disc disease /radiculopathy. Although she is capable of performing limited light tasks, I do not believe she is capable of working in a competitive environment. Even limited physical exertions cause her to require significant down time. If she were to attempt to return to even a sedentary work environment, she would require significant time off-task each day. I believe she could perform no more than 2-4 hours of work per day. She additionally requires the fentanyl patch 100 mcg/hr and Dilaudid simply to achieve limited function. These medications, however can impact cognition and the ability to perform detailed tasks. I consider [Plaintiff] to be disabled from competitive work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Dkt. # 33 at 28 (citing AR 14). According to Plaintiff's response, Dr. Gajraj's opinion from June 6, 2017 is more than sufficient to support a finding that Plaintiff remains disabled under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Magistrate Judge stated Dr. Gajraj noted Plaintiff is capable of performing limited light tasks; even so, she is not capable of working in a competitive environment, even in a sedentary work environment. Dkt. # 33 at 47 (citing AR 14). The Magistrate Judge noted Plaintiff's treating physicians' relationships with Plaintiff allowed them to personally observe the effects of her diagnoses and assess the credibility of her reports of pain. Dkt. # 33 at 51. Specifically, \"Plaintiff's pain management treating physician for over five years, stated in 2017 that Plaintiff suffers from chronic pain, secondary to lumbar degenerative disc disease /radiculopathy and is disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20Fed.%20Appx.%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Additionally, Defendant argues the \"outdated notations in the claims notes in the AR rely on [Plaintiff's] subjective reporting, not on objective medical determinations.\" Dkt. # 37 at 15. According to Defendant's argument, \"[p]roper claims administration says that the administrator should record what the claimant is stating and reporting to the Plan on her claim; but notations of subjective statements by Pike to Hartford does not mean there is 'disability' under the Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20Fed.%20Appx.%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A specific \"outdated\" notation the Magistrate Judge relied upon was from April 2010, wherein Defendant noted Plaintiff had chronic pain which radiated down the leg which may be due to nerve damage. Dkt. # 33 at 12 (citing AR 937). It was noted Plaintiff had been referred to Dr. Bernstein (Plaintiff's first pain management physician) with chronic low back pain and leg pain. According to the Recommended Findings of Fact of the Magistrate Judge, Defendant determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Based on the history of the clmt's multiple back surgeries, continued treatment for severe back pain and in to her legs (including class II meds and spinal stimulator) it is likely clmt would be unable to participate in any type of work activity on a full time basis. Clmt's level of medication and need to be bed-ridden for multiple days at a time would impact\n   even limited activity and would be unable to sustain full time work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Dkt. # 33 at 12 (quoting AR 941).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Not only did the Magistrate Judge consider Defendant's own notations, she also considered that between November 2010 and July 2015, Plaintiff routinely updated Defendant regarding the status of her pain management with Dr. Bernstein and her new pain management physician, Dr. Gajraj, following Dr. Bernstein's retirement. Dkt. # 33 at 13. In the most recent APS No. 10, dated July 10, 2015, Dr. Gajraj listed Plaintiff's primary diagnosis as lumbar degenerative disc disease and her secondary diagnosis as lumbar radiculopathy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=548%20Fed.%20Appx.%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 1752-53).

Unlike the abuse of discretion standard applied in\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   , and in\n   <em>\n    Audino\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Corry\n   </em>\n   cited therein, here the Magistrate Judge and this Court apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. In independently weighing the evidence, the Magistrate Judge gave minimal weight to Dr. Sklar's opinions, explaining in detail the reasons why.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 33 at 48-50. She also found troubling certain aspects of the report of Dr. Lewis, and thus gave it minimal weight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51. The Court finds the Magistrate Judge did not improperly consider subjective complaints over objective evidence. This objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether the R &amp; R erroneously uses Plaintiff's attorney's arguments in briefing as findings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In its next sub-argument, Defendant asserts the R &amp; R erroneously uses Plaintiff's attorney's arguments in briefing as findings. Specifically, Defendant criticizes the Magistrate Judge's discussion of whether the errors contained in Dr. Lewis' report, which Defendant characterized as merely typographical, changed the conclusions in the report. In her discussion, the Magistrate Judge noted Plaintiff's argument as to why the errors are important: \"According to Plaintiff, it is important that Plaintiff's L4-S1 surgery predates her L3-4 surgery because \"that suggests that she is suffering from Transitional Syndrome, where the prior fusion causes increased stress on adjacent levels\" and also implies 'possible further deterioration in the future.' \" Dkt. # 33 at 52 (quoting Dkt. # 17 at 27). Defendant argues the Magistrate Judge never identifies any impact in the AR that \"typographical errors\" have on Dr. Lewis' conclusions. Dkt. # 37 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   As noted above, the Magistrate Judge set forth several errors contained in Dr. Lewis' report that called into question the reliability of his conclusions. The errors were not just limited to what Defendant characterizes as \"typographical.\" Specifically, Dr. Lewis believed Plaintiff's 2008 L3-4 surgery occurred prior to her 2002 L4-S1 surgery; Plaintiff's 2009 surgery was to remove hardware from the L3-4 surgery; Plaintiff continues to use the spinal cord stimulator and it provides some relief; Plaintiff underwent L4-S1 surgery\n   in 2012, and improved post-operatively; Plaintiff reports no adverse medication side effects; and Defendant's surveillance shows physical activity inconsistent with Plaintiff's report. The Court does not find the Magistrate Judge erroneously uses Plaintiff's attorney's arguments in briefing as findings or that any such findings lead to erroneous legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Defendant also criticizes the Magistrate Judge's brief discussion regarding the Social Security Administration's (\"SSA\") determination that Plaintiff remains disabled under its standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 33 at 54-55 (stating the SSA determination was also relevant to the Court's\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review and further stating \"[t]he SSA's determination that Plaintiff remains Totally Disabled under its standards, as of April 10, 2017, is further evidence [of Disability under the Plan].\"). At the end of her discussion after considering the pertinent medical evidence, the Magistrate Judge noted that although not binding, the SSA determination was also relevant to her determination on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 33 at 54 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gellerman v.

Dkt. # 33 at 10, n. 10 (citing AR 959, 961, 1361, 2059). The AR contains a letter dated April 10, 2017. AR 1361. Although it states the SSA had previously sent Plaintiff a letter telling her it was going to review her disability case, it did not need to review the case after all and would not be contacting her doctor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968859\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/724/#p735\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Defendant, the letter says nothing about Plaintiff remaining \"Totally Disabled under the SSA's standards.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Defendant argues the \"regulations make clear that the SSA might waive its disability review for a wide variety of reasons, including based on its capacity for case reviews, backlog of pending reviews, projected number of new applications, and projected staffing levels.\" Dkt. # 37 at 20. Defendant further argues the SSA award with a physical assessment and \"current evaluation\" dated March 13, 2009 (AR 752-759), has no relevancy to whether Plaintiff is disabled as of December 15, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. According to Defendant, \"by nature of the date, it is based on outdated records and involves a time period for which Hartford already paid benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   In her response, Plaintiff argues the 2017 letter ended the continuing disability review, rather than waived it, as asserted by Defendant. Dkt. # 38 at 9. Plaintiff further argues the letter suggests the SSA \"collected evidence from her, and then decided it was no longer necessary to review her claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. According to Plaintiff, the reasonable inference from the AR is the SSA continued to consider Plaintiff to be disabled under its rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   As one of the many considerations she considered in her\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Magistrate Judge simply noted it is also of some relevance to the inquiry that the SSA judged Plaintiff to be disabled and awarded her disability benefits in 2009. Defendant does not dispute Plaintiff continues to receive social security disability benefits. The Court is not convinced the R &amp; R erred in this regard and thus overrules Defendant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether the R &amp; R \"cherry-picks\" from the AR instead of reconciling the evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Nor is the Court persuaded the R &amp; R improperly \"cherry picks\" from the AR instead of reconciling the evidence, as Defendant argues in its last sub-argument. The Magistrate Judge explained in detail why she found some evidence more probative\n   and some evidence less probative. This last objection is also overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion of the third main objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   At the end of the R &amp; R, the Magistrate Judge considered whether pre-judgment interest, costs, and attorney's fees should be awarded as requested by Plaintiff in her Original Complaint. The Magistrate Judge found Plaintiff is entitled to receive LTD benefits from December 15, 2016, and to recover pre-judgment interest on those unpaid benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. She also found the circumstances support an award to Plaintiff for attorney's fees and costs, in addition to the benefits amount owed to her under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59. Rather than specifically recommend an award of fees and costs, the Magistrate Judge recommended that Plaintiff be directed to file, within twenty days from the date of any Order adopting the R &amp; R, a motion for pre-judgment interest, costs and attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In its final objection, Defendant asserts any purported findings in support of the R &amp; R's conclusions regarding attorney's fees and costs should not be adopted. According to Defendant, Plaintiff has not moved for or met her burden of showing entitlement to fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Should that occur, Defendant reserves its rights to challenge the motion, both on the ability to recover fees and on the reasonableness of any recovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The parties acknowledge the R &amp; R anticipates further briefing on the issue. As acknowledged by Plaintiff in her response to Defendant's objections, the R &amp; R specifies that any such award must be legally and factually supported and that Defendant is allowed to file a response. The Magistrate Judge specifically ordered Plaintiff's motion on attorney's fees shall include argument as to the authority upon which such fees may be granted. This Order clarifies the Court will consider\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , following the parties' briefing, whether Plaintiff should be awarded pre-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs and if so, in what amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   With the above clarification regarding the issue of pre-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs, the Court is of the opinion the recommended findings and conclusions of the Magistrate Judge are correct.

Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the objections of Defendant are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   .

However, after later determining Plaintiff was unable to prove she continued to be \"disabled\" under the policy, Hartford discontinued LTD benefits effective December 15, 2016.

AR 507-08. Plaintiff underwent surgery in 2002 on her L4-S1 levels and improved for a time, but she began to deteriorate in 2004. AR 521, 533-34. By 2007, Plaintiff could not sit in a chair, lie in a bed, or stand for any significant length of time. AR 521. An examination at that time revealed her prior L4 to S1 fusion was stable, but she was experiencing transitional instability at her L3-4 level. AR 524.

In the application, Plaintiff reported she was unable to continue working as a regulatory affairs group leader because of an interbody fusion surgery \"needed due to degeneration of [her] spine at the L3-L4 vertebrae locations.\" AR 786, 2254. Plaintiff stopped working on January 24, 2008, but expected to return to work on July 31, 2008. AR 2254. Plaintiff sought LTD benefits to cover three to four months of post-surgery recovery time not covered by her employer Gambro's short term salary continuation, which would expire on April 28, 2008. AR 2037.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Along with the application, Plaintiff submitted an Attending Physician's Statement of Disability (\"APS\") dated March 28, 2008, and completed by Plaintiff's then-treating neurological surgeon Dr. Robert Martin. AR 2259-60 (\"APS No. 1\"). In APS No. 1, Dr. Martin confirmed Plaintiff underwent a L3-4 lateral interbody fusion on March 25, 2008 to treat lumbar/sacral instability and lower back pain. AR 2259. Dr. Martin placed specified physical restrictions\n   and limitations on Plaintiff during the surgery recovery period. AR 2260. Dr. Martin also submitted records regarding the surgery and records of his pre-surgery office visits with Plaintiff that noted the reasons for the surgery (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff had a history of low back pain; she underwent a spinal fusion in December 2002; the pain returned in 2004 and became unmanageable).

AR 968. However, that meant Plaintiff could not return to work until after the Elimination Period due to her post-surgery recovery, which limited Plaintiff from performing the physical tasks required for her occupation as a regulatory affairs group leader (\"constant sitting, walking, stooping, kneeling and reaching\"). AR 968. Finding Plaintiff unable to perform her \"Own Occupation,\" Hartford approved the claim effective April 24, 2008.

A June 1, 2009 consultation note with Dr. Rashbaum at the Texas Back Institute revealed Plaintiff had been having problems for eight years and was no longer able to walk for any distance or even shop. AR 2236. Plaintiff had a spinal cord stimulator implanted in December 2009 to help alleviate her pain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 2237. Dr. Rashbaum's January 2010 record indicated Plaintiff was getting too much stimulation in her low back. AR 2237. The assessment included chronic pain, \"failed back surgery syndrome, status post spinal cord stimulator and peripheral ANS stimulator.\" AR 2237. Plaintiff was taking four to five pain pills a day and four gabapentin per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   By February 18, 2010, Plaintiff was still rating low back pain at a 7/10 sometimes approaching 10/10; leg pain 6/10 also approaching 10/10; and midback pain 5/10 that could escalate to 10/10. AR 2239. As before, Plaintiff produced \"very specific charts and diagrams depicting her pain levels given various activities.\" It was noted Plaintiff was \"always very cooperative with the exam and very gracious in her approach to her chronic pain condition.\" AR 2239. Plaintiff felt the permanent implant was not as effective as a trial device she had previously tried, and Dr. Rashbaum explained that it was doing everything that it could and that she still needed to \"use every tool that she [could] to try to improve her life and reduce her pain.\" AR 2239. Although Plaintiff was managing on Norco\"anywhere from 5 to 6,\" it was not\n   \"really accomplishing what she need[ed] for it to\" so Dr. Rashbaum had a \"long hard conversation\" with Plaintiff. Specifically, Dr. Rashbaum advised Plaintiff as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   [S]he probably does need to try a class II medication.... I have told her in the past that she will more than likely always be on some form of pain medication, she wanted to avoid class II if possible. I think we have exhausted every other procedure and modality to try to prevent that. I am referring her now to Dr. Bernstein to see if he can find the right medication mix to help reduce her pain so that she can be more active. She wants to do so much, but is very limited physically. I have also provided her with a prescription for handicap parking placard that she can use. I think she pushes herself so far that she has been in such extreme pain that she is bedridden for 2 to 3 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   AR 2239.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Plaintiff's care then transitioned to pain management physician Dr. Sidney Bernstein at the Texas Back Institute. AR 949 (Hartford noting it was unexpected Plaintiff would have the capacity to perform full time work on a regular basis due to inability to sit, stand or walk for minimum periods). Hartford continued to pay Plaintiff benefits through the end of the \"Own Occupation\" period on April 23, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The April 24, 2010 change of definition of \"disabled\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Given the LTD Claim was effective April 24, 2008, the definition of \"disabled\" changed under the Policy on April 24, 2010, from \"Own Occupation\" to \"Any Occupation.\" AR 1030-31 (Letter dated October 29, 2009). Thus, Plaintiff was only entitled to LTD benefits beyond April 24, 2010 if she was unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Hartford's information regarding Plaintiff's functional capacity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   To determine whether Plaintiff would be capable of performing any occupation, in October 2009 Hartford began to gather medical information regarding Plaintiff's functional capacity. AR 952. As requested, Dr. Rashbaum provided APS No. 4, which stated Plaintiff could not reach or perform fingering or handling. He provided no restrictions or limitations for sitting, standing, or walking. AR 1916-17. Hartford asked Dr. Rashbaum to specify his opinion on Plaintiff's ability to sit, stand, and walk. AR 944-45. Dr. Rashbaum sent an APS dated March 12, 2010, but it also provided no specific assessment of restrictive limitations, and instead annotated \"Patient Unable to Work.\" AR 1914-15 (\"APS No. 5\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Dr. Rashbaum later provided an APS dated April 20, 2010. AR 1909-10 (\"APS No. 6\"). APS No. 6 explained that Plaintiff could frequently reach at desk level and lift/carry up to ten pounds, but sitting, standing, or walking were all limited to fifteen or twenty minutes at a time, up to four hours total. AR 1909-10, 1912-13. On April 20, 2010, Dr. Rashbaum's office clarified that Plaintiff's functional capacity was limited to four hours a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   On April 22, 2010, Hartford conducted an employability analysis (the first \"EAR\"), which evaluated whether there were any occupations Plaintiff was capable of performing based upon her functional capabilities as specified by Dr. Rashbaum\n   in APS No. 6, education (Bachelor of Science in microbiology), training, and work history, and which would meet the earnings requirement in the Policy. AP 938-40, 1926-33. The EAR identified no occupations. AR 940, 1927.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Hartford continued to pay benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   On April 22, 2010, Hartford calculated the product of Plaintiff's indexed pre-disability earnings and her benefit percentage to be $ 3,974.52 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 937. It was further noted Plaintiff had chronic pain which radiated down the leg which may be due to nerve damage. AR 937. It was noted Plaintiff had been referred to Dr. Bernstein with chronic low back pain and leg pain. Hartford determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   Based on the history of the clmt's multiple back surgeries, continued treatment for severe back pain and in to her legs (including class II meds and spinal stimulator) it is likely clmt would be unable to participate in any type of work activity on a full time basis. Clmt's level of medication and need to be bed-ridden for multiple days at a time would impact even limited activity and would be unable to sustain full time work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   AR 941.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Hartford determined Dr. Rashbaum's opinion on Plaintiff's functional capacity was supported by the medical records to date and was reasonable, especially considering Plaintiff was still dealing with the pain she claimed was caused by the spinal cord stimulator and had only begun to work with Dr. Bernstein \"to reduce pain level and maintain some stability\" using class II drugs for pain management. AR 937-38. Finding Plaintiff was incapable of performing the essential duties of any occupation because she could not sit, stand, or walk for longer than fifteen or twenty minutes at a time and for only up to four hours a day, Hartford determined Plaintiff was disabled under the \"Any Occupation\" definition of disability and she was entitled to benefits on and after April 24, 2010. AR 940, 1029 (Letter dated April 29, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Hartford continued to periodically review the LTD Claim as Plaintiff worked with Dr. Bernstein, who was \"switching the medications to see what works best.\" AR 935. Between November 2010 and July 2015, Plaintiff routinely updated Hartford regarding the status of her pain management with Dr. Bernstein. When Dr. Bernstein retired in December 2011, Plaintiff updated Hartford with records from Dr. Noor Gajraj.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff explained the different medication combinations she tried and how she reacted to each medication. She also advised the spinal cord stimulator was removed in December 2012 because it was ineffective. AR 1817-1823 (March 17, 2014 questionnaire) at 1818. Plaintiff reported that medications did little to alleviate her pain. AR 935.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Dr. Bernstein and Dr. Gajraj corroborated Plaintiff's statements in APS dated December 3, 2010 by Dr. Bernstein (\"APS No. 7\"), APS dated October 31, 2012 by Dr. Gajraj (\"APS No. 8\"), APS dated\n   March 19, 2014 by Dr. Gajraj (\"APS No. 9\"), and APS dated July 10, 2015 by Dr. Gajraj (\"APS No. 10\").

In the most recent APS No. 10, dated July 10, 2015, Dr. Gajraj listed Plaintiff's primary diagnosis as lumbar degenerative disc disease and her secondary diagnosis as lumbar radiculopathy. AR 1752-53. He listed her medications as Dilaudid and Fentanyl and her current subjective symptoms as right sided low back pain and right leg pain and tenderness. AR 1752. He opined Plaintiff could walk, stand, and sit for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time and for no longer than four hours per day. AR 1753. Dr. Gajraj also stated he did not believe Plaintiff was competent to direct the use of her claim proceeds. AR 1753.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   On February 20, 2011, Hartford management reviewed Plaintiff's claim and noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   [Plaintiff] continues with chronic lower back and leg pain.

It was further noted that Plaintiff's level of medication and need to be \"bed-ridden for multiple days at a time would impact even limited activity and would be unable to sustain full time work.\" AR 922. In her June 8, 2011 call, Plaintiff noted Dr. Bernstein had increased her Fentanyl medication, but she still experienced pain in her right lower back where she has \"damaged nerves.\" AR 920-21. Plaintiff further noted her medications affected her - she was not as coherent as before; her memory was not as good; and she had a hard time remembering things. AR 921.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The following week, Hartford determined it would try to close Plaintiff's claim by offering her a lump sum settlement. AR 922. On June 17, 2011, Hartford offered Plaintiff a lump sum of $ 165,300.00 to settle her claim. AR 926-27. Plaintiff did not respond to the offer.

Further investigation into Plaintiff's functional capacity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Over the years, Hartford has placed Plaintiff under video surveillance by its Special Investigative Unit (\"SIU\"). Extensive surveillance was performed in 2008, 2009, and 2011. In February and March 2011, SIU investigated the LTD Claim because of inconsistencies between Plaintiff's self-reported functionality during a January 2011 call and Dr. Bernstein's opinion of Plaintiff's functionality in APS No. 7. AR 1302-06 (2011 SIU Case Report) at 1303-04. Hartford also noted Plaintiff's claims of cognitive impairment seemed at odds with the highly detailed communications she sent to Hartford about her condition. AR 1302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   When Plaintiff was observed outside in April of 2011, she walked in a slow manner and \"with her hand rubbing her low back area.\" AR 1306. On May 10, 2011, it was noted there had been no inconsistencies or\n   evidence of fraud or misrepresentation. AR 1306. Hartford's SIU closed its file on Plaintiff after determining the evidence it gathered warranted no additional involvement. AR 922.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   In July of 2015, Plaintiff reported increased lower back pain for the previous eighteen months. AR 912. On July 17, 2015, Hartford determined it was unreasonable to expect Plaintiff to return to full time gainful employment, noting the findings contained in APS 10 dated July 10, 2015 by Dr. Gajraj. AR 912. It was noted Plaintiff was only forty-eight years old and remained disabled, and the benefit end date was listed as 3/13/2034. AR 912-13. Hartford noted its Risk Management resources had been exhausted and that Plaintiff's claim was again referred to LSS (lump sum settlement). AR 913.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   A Hartford manager, however, determined a lump sum settlement offer should be deferred due to Plaintiff's cognitive decline and the possibility she would be getting a divorce. AR 913-14. Specifically, the manager concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   Clmt reports significant memory issues d/t class II narcotics she is taking for pain relief. Clmt state[s] she is unable to remember things well, has times when there is a spike in her Fentanyl patch that causes her to feel dizzy, nauseous and 'loopy.' Clmt reports she does not drive at all. Clmt states she has a hard time remembering specific dates, numbers, what happened on certain dates and that her husband is tired of being her caretaker.\n   <strong>\n    LSS would not be appropriate based on Clmt's cognitive decline\n   </strong>\n   and her reports that she may be getting a divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   AR 913-14 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   In April 2016, Hartford reassigned Plaintiff's claim to a Specialty Analyst and changed her Continuing Ability Review (\"CAR\") level. AR 909. Hartford again referred Plaintiff's claim to its SIU, but noted that if SIU again closed its file without need for further review, the Specialty Analyst would review the claim to determine if additional claim management was needed; if no additional claim management was needed, the Specialty Agent would determine Plaintiff's appropriate CAR level. AR 909.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   According to Hartford, SIU again investigated the LTD Claim because of inconsistencies between Plaintiff's self-reported functionality in the July 13, 2015 claimant questionnaire (\"questionnaire\"), Dr. Gajraj's opinion on Plaintiff's functional capacity in APS 10, and Plaintiff's Internet postings showing actions inconsistent with her claimed limited functionality (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , attending two concerts (one in 2012 and another in 2015) and references to knitting).

When Plaintiff stood, she did so with her weight evenly distributed upon her feet, but her \"upper body was bent forward as if she was resting on a walker.\" AR 1607. Plaintiff \"sat forward on the couch leaning on a pillow in her lap the entire interview\" and advised the interviewer \"she had just changed the Fentanyl patch and the medication had not absorbed and started blocking\n   the pain.\" AR 1607.

According to Dr. Sklar, a 2009 MRI revealed Plaintiff had a \"problem with pain out of proportion to any known structural abnormalities.\" AR 1529. On physical examination, Dr. Sklar noted Plaintiff walked with a forward flexed posture holding her back, with a \"fairly normal\" gait. AR 1529. He also noted there were multiple healed scars over the lumbar region and decreased sensation in the bilateral lower extremities especially in the S1 distribution. \"Straight leg raising to 90 degrees in the seated position cause[d] complaints of back pain only.\" AR 1529. There was moderate tenderness to palpation over the lumbosacral junction and bilateral gluteals and left lateral thigh/greater trochanter region.

AR 985-92 (Letter dated December 15, 2016). Thus, she was not eligible for and would not receive benefits as of December 15, 2016. AR 985.

Hartford also explained that it considered the most recent medical records from Dr. Gajraj, and specifically referenced the record from a May 6, 2016 office visit that noted \"Plaintiff had analgesia\" and \"increased function\" on her medications. AR 988. Hartford summarized the IME Report, specifically Dr. Sklar's findings and opinions that Plaintiff was capable of working in a sedentary or light occupation up to forty hours per week with specified restrictions and limitations.

According to the letter, Hartford's stated justification for the denial of Plaintiff's benefits (video surveillance, in-person interview, and information compiled during Hartford's Medical Case Manager Review) was disingenuous, noting there was no inconsistency\n   that justified Hartford's reversal regarding Plaintiff's claim.

As an initial matter, the Court notes Hartford's notations indicate Plaintiff's use of class II medications played into Hartford's decision. For example, on June 4, 2011, Hartford determined that, due to her medical history of multiple failed back surgeries and her continued need to take class II medications, \"it was likely [Plaintiff] would be unable to participate in any type of work activity on a full time basis.\" AR 922. It was further noted that Plaintiff's level of medication and need to be \"bed-ridden for multiple days at a time would impact even limited activity and would be unable to sustain full time work.\" AR 922.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   On July 17, 2015, Hartford determined it was unreasonable to expect Plaintiff to return to full time gainful employment, noting the findings contained in APS 10 dated July 10, 2015 by Dr. Gajraj. AR 912. It was noted Plaintiff was only forty-eight years old and remained disabled, and the benefit end date was listed as 3/13/2034. AR 912-13. Hartford noted its Risk Management resources had been exhausted and that Plaintiff's claim was again referred to LSS (lump sum settlement). AR 913. A Hartford manager, however, determined a lump sum settlement offer would not be appropriate. AR 913-14. Specifically, the manager concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-347\">\n   Clmt reports significant memory issues d/t class II narcotics she is taking for pain relief. Clmt state[s] she is unable to remember things well, has times when there is a spike in her Fentanyl patch that causes her to feel dizzy, nauseous and 'loopy.' Clmt reports she does not drive at all. Clmt states she has a hard time remembering specific dates, numbers, what happened on certain dates and that her husband is tired of being her caretaker.\n   <strong>\n    LSS would not be appropriate based on Clmt's cognitive decline\n   </strong>\n   and her reports that she may be getting a divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   AR 913-14 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Yet, there is nothing in the record indicating Plaintiff's use of class II medications - or the ways in which Plaintiff reported the medications affected her - decreased in any significant way between 2015 and the date Hartford terminated Plaintiff's LTD benefits in late 2016. Nevertheless, Hartford maintains Plaintiff saw improvement in her functionality by July 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   In defending its decision, Hartford states Plaintiff's most recent medical records show she had regained functionality; her functionality was steadily increasing; and she was not experiencing any debilitating side effects from her medications, including any cognitive impairment. Hartford relies primarily on the more recent records from Plaintiff's pain management physician from February 2015 to May 2017. In each record, Dr. Gajraj noted \"[Plaintiff] is taking her medication as prescribed without significant side-effects and is gaining benefit in terms of analgesia and increased function.\" AR 9-13, AR 1740-49. In each record, Dr. Gajraj also wrote that a review of her central nervous system found her to be \"alert, oriented, no signs of excessive sedation,\" \"[g]ood remote memory,\" \"[a]dequate attention span and able to concentrate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080426\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/718/1151/#p1162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Hartford, the records showed Plaintiff's medication regimen of Fentanyl patches and Dilaudid pills was working. AR 866 (analysis of Dr. Gajraj's medical records).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   The Court does not find Dr. Gajraj's comments that Plaintiff was \"gaining benefit in terms of analgesia and increased function\" under her medication regime as compelling as Hartford does. Despite the medications she was taking, Plaintiff was still experiencing pain. In each record, Dr. Gajraj noted that Plaintiff's chief complaint was right low back pain and right leg pain. AR 9-13, AR 1740-49. Importantly, in his June 6, 2017 letter, Dr. Gajraj described Plaintiff's current condition as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-352\">\n   Gina Pike suffers from chronic pain, secondary to lumbar degenerative disc disease /radiculopathy. Although she is capable of performing limited light tasks, I do not believe she is capable of working in a competitive environment. Even limited physical exertions cause her to require significant down time. If she were to attempt to return to even a sedentary work environment, she would require significant time off-task each day. I believe she could perform no more than 2-4 hours of work per day. She additionally requires the fentanyl patch 100 mcg/hr and Dilaudid\n   <strong>\n    simply to achieve limited function\n   </strong>\n   . These medications, however can impact cognition and the ability to perform detailed tasks. I consider Ms. Pike to be disabled from competitive work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   AR 14 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   Hartford states Dr. Gajraj's letter does not state the Fentanyl and Dilaudid medications actually impacted Plaintiff, only that they could impact cognition and the ability to perform detailed tasks. However, Dr. Gajraj makes it clear he considers Plaintiff to be disabled from competitive\n   work, noting she could not perform more than two to four hours of work per day and would require significant time off-task each day. What is more, in APS No. 9 (dated March 19, 2014) and APS No. 10 (dated July 10, 2015), Dr. Gajraj stated he did not believe Plaintiff was competent to direct the use of her claim proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 1753.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Hartford further asserts Plaintiff's recent medical records do not support Dr. Gajraj's opinions in the June 2017 letter or in APS Nos. 8-10. However, Dr. Gajraj performed a Sudoscan procedure on May 14, 2015 to detect peripheral neuropathy (damage to the peripheral nerves). AR 1747-48 (Sudoscan Report). Plaintiff's Sudoscan found possible early signs of peripheral neuropathy. AR 1747. Additionally, records from Plaintiff's treating primary care doctor, Purvi Sanghvi, M.D., from October and December 2016 reveal Plaintiff's chronic pain condition remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   At the October 2016 visit to establish care with Dr. Sanghvi, Plaintiff stated she was forgetful and had to write everything down due to her being on high dose narcotics. AR 6. Although the examination noted no abnormalities, Plaintiff admitted low back pain. AR 7. Dr. Sanghvi listed Plaintiff's assessments as Celiac disease and chronic pain syndrome. AR 6. Notably, in Dr. Sanghvi's notes from the December 6, 2016 visit (which was approximately one week before Hartford's denial of LTD benefits), Dr. Sanghvi noted on examination Plaintiff's back was \"tender to palpation over lumbar-sacral spine.\" AR 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   There is other credible evidence regarding Plaintiff's condition, her pain, and the side effects of her medications. Plaintiff routinely updated Hartford regarding the status of her pain management. For example, in her June 8, 2011 call, Plaintiff noted Dr. Bernstein had increased her Fentanyl medication, but she was still experiencing pain in her right lower back where she has \"damaged nerves.\" AR 920-21. Plaintiff further noted her medications affected her - she was not as coherent as before; her memory was not as good; and she had a hard time remembering things. AR 921.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   More recently, in a Claimant Questionnaire completed by Plaintiff in July 2015, Plaintiff explained her back pain continued to increase after the 2012 surgery to remove the spinal cord stimulator, noting implanting the stimulator had \"aggravated the scar tissue and damaged nerves in [her] lower left back area\" so that she had pain on both sides of her back \"every day.\" AR 1786. She stated her pain doctor was prescribing her hydromorphone for the \"breakthrough pain,\" in addition to the Fentanyl patches she was changing every other day; yet, she was still in \"severe pain and [ ] hunched over in pain.\" AR 1786. According to the questionnaire, Dr. Rashbaum had informed Plaintiff she had \"significant scarring and nerve damage from when [her] spinal cord collapsed and that it would never get better,\" and that Dr. Gajraj similarly stated her \"situation [was] severe and would never improve.\" AR 1786. Plaintiff also reported in detail how the pain medications significantly affect her memory and her ability to remember things. AR 1787. In sum, the Court does not agree with Hartford's assertion that the recent medical records show Plaintiff had regained functionality and that she was no longer experiencing significant side effects from her medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   In further support of its decision, Hartford relies on Plaintiff's self-reported functionality\n   in the July 2016 in-person interview, the observed functionality in the June 2016 video surveillance, Dr. Sklar's IME Report, the First EAR Addendum, and Dr. Lewis' Peer Review Report. According to Hartford, these show Plaintiff's back pain was being sufficiently managed by the medication regimen of Fentanyl and Dilaudid, such that Plaintiff was not prevented from working forty hours a week in an occupation for which she was qualified and that met the earnings qualifier in the Policy. The Court finds these other indications of improvement relied upon by Hartford similarly unpersuasive, as explained in further detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In-person interview\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   Plaintiff was interviewed by Jim Jolly with Hartford on July 1, 2016. AR 1263-1294. During the interview, Plaintiff stated she can walk around the grocery store for about thirty or forty minutes. AR 1268. She also stated she could sit for one hour on a cushioned seat and fifteen minutes on a hard seat; she could occasionally grocery shop when her husband was with her; she could carry up to eleven pounds; and she could bend forward at the waist to pick up something from the ground. AR 1268, 1272-73, 1280.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   In his summary report of the interview, Mr. Jolly stated Plaintiff \"walked with a smooth but slow stride, bent over posture and shuffling style gait.\" AR 1607. Although Plaintiff did not spontaneously report any pain in walking, she \"exhibited a noticeable difficulty in walking.\" AR 1607. When Plaintiff stood, she did so with her weight evenly distributed upon her feet, but her \"upper body was bent forward as if she was resting on a walker.\" AR 1607. Throughout the entire interview, Plaintiff complained of pain in her lower back. She did not display any objective signs of cognitive impairment or lack of focus in Mr. Jolly's presence. AR 1608. However, Plaintiff told Mr. Jolly during the interview that her medications make her memory fuzzy, and she has to write things down. AR 1289.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Video surveillance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   Hartford also relies on the June 8, 2016 surveillance wherein Plaintiff was observed making \"two attempts to get one box down small enough\" to fit into a trash bin. AR 1615. However, Hartford does not explain the contrast between this one incident and Plaintiff's numerous days of relative inactivity, \"a noticeable gap in light of her reports that she could obtain temporary relief from pain medications.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gross v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263161\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1/#p12\">\n    880 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (1st Cir. 2018). As described above, the most recent surveillance took place over five days (April 29-30, May 6, and June 8-9), and the investigator saw no activity by Plaintiff on four of those days. She did not leave her house. On June 8, 2016, Plaintiff briefly emerged from her house on two occasions and was seen bending forward and breaking down an empty cardboard box, lifting a hinged lid on her trash can, and moving the can. Hartford treats this only surveilled activity \"as decisive over [Plaintiff's] long history of credible pain, without confronting her inactivity during most of the surveillance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263161\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1/#p12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Importantly, there is no necessary inconsistency between the limitations Dr. Gajraj identified in APS No. 10 and the surveilled activity. In his June 2017 letter, Dr. Gajraj noted Plaintiff is capable of\n   performing limited light tasks; even so, she is not capable of working in a competitive environment, even in a sedentary work environment. AR 14. According to Plaintiff, the limitations, level of activity, and functional ability described in her in-person interview closely matched the level of activity-and inactivity-seen on the video surveillance taken June 8, 2016 and over the course of her claim. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   The Court does not find breaking down a cardboard box and lifting a trash can lid/moving the trash can inconsistent with Plaintiff's own reports as to her limitations in the July 2015 questionnaire and in her in-person interview. Plaintiff told Hartford's investigator that she could touch her toes and \"probably touch the ground.\" AR 1390-91, 1120, 1272-73. She also stated she can push and pull and can handle light garbage. AR 1391, 1274, 1286. Plaintiff stated in her June 7, 2017 Administrative Appeal letter that the video surveillance footage confirmed that she walked with a \"shuffling gait and forward-hunched posture.\" AR 1390. This posture was also repeatedly confirmed by Mr. Jolly in his summary report of the in-person interview. Mr. Jolly specifically noted Plaintiff displayed a \"bent over posture\" when standing, walking, and sitting; \"[s]he slumped forward when walking and she leaned forward on a pillow when sitting.\" AR 1608.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The opinions of independent reviewing physicians\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   Hartford bases its termination decision on the opinions of independent reviewing physicians, Dr. Sklar and Dr. Lewis. Dr. Sklar examined Plaintiff in October 2016 prior to Hartford's initial decision to terminate benefits. AR 1528-30. As part of its consideration of Plaintiff's appeal, Hartford obtained a Peer Review Report in July 2017 from Dr. Lewis. The Court addresses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Hartford asked Dr. Sklar whether, given the totality of the medical evidence and other information provided, he felt there are any restrictions or limitations as to Plaintiff's activity, and if so, would she be capable of performing activity up to forty hours per week with these restrictions. AR 1530. In response, Dr. Sklar opined Plaintiff could work a light or sedentary occupation up to forty hours a week with the following restrictions and limitations based on her chronic pain condition and \"[t]o accommodate her pain:\" ability to change positions on an as needed basis with up to six hours per day of sitting and the rest of the day spent in a combination of standing and walking for up to two hours; occasionally lifting up to twenty pounds; and no repetitive bending or twisting. AR 1530. According to Plaintiff, Dr. Sklar took Plaintiff's medical history, conducted his physical examination, and reached his conclusions in only twenty-one minutes. Docket Entry # 17 at 10-11 (citing AR 1528). Plaintiff asserts Dr. Sklar erroneously stated pain cannot be a disabling condition (stating \"[p]ain is clearly not a reason not to work ...\") and merely suggested that some type of unidentified work could be therapeutic without indicating what type of work would be therapeutic for Plaintiff (\"Work then is not only reasonable here it would be a part of the claimant's reasonable treatment plan to treat her pain complaints.\"). AR 1530. Nevertheless, according to Plaintiff, Dr. Sklar did not opine Plaintiff could return to high-level work, such as the type required under the terms of the Hartford policy and suggested by Hartford in its denial letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   The records reveals that since 2002, Plaintiff has consistently reported that she experienced pain. Rather than showing improvement of Plaintiff's condition, Dr. Skylar's IME Report supports Plaintiff's position. On physical examination, Dr. Sklar noted Plaintiff walked with a forward flexed posture holding her back, and she had decreased sensation in the bilateral lower extremities especially in the S1 distribution. He also noted \"[s]traight leg raising to 90 degrees in the seated position cause[d] complaints of back pain.\" AR 1529. There was also moderate tenderness to palpation over the lumbosacral junction and bilateral gluteals and left lateral thigh/greater trochanter region. Dr. Sklar stated the physical examination was consistent with the diagnosis of chronic unspecified lower back pain. However, according to Dr. Skylar, there was no \"clear evidence of any persistent radiculopathy and records [were] not consistent with the diagnosis of chronic radiculopathy either.\" AR 1529. Dr. Skylar acknowledged Plaintiff has pain but did not believe pain could or should preclude a claimant from working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   However, pain can either prevent or make difficult the tasks required by an occupation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Audino v.

According to Dr. Lewis, although Plaintiff has continued pain complaints, \"there are no objective findings that would prevent her ability for sustainable work 40 hours per week.\" AR 1350.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   The Court finds Dr. Lewis' post-decision report minimally persuasive as well. First, Dr. Lewis did not examine Plaintiff in person.

Here, the treating physicians' relationships with Plaintiff allowed them to personally observe the effects of Plaintiff's diagnoses and assess the credibility of her reports of pain. Dr. Gajraj, Plaintiff's pain management treating physician for over five years, stated in 2017 that Plaintiff suffers from chronic pain, secondary to lumbar degenerative disc disease /radiculopathy and is disabled. AR 14. In contrast, Dr. Lewis, because he did not personally examine Plaintiff, could not have observed the effect of Plaintiff's chronic pain or assessed her credibility. As in\n   <em>\n    Reetz\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds the treating physicians' medical opinions to be more reliable and probative of Plaintiff's condition than Dr. Lewis' report.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523740\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/294/1068/#p1079\">\n    294 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1083 (citing\n   <em>\n    Oldoerp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218617\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/1237/#p1251\">\n    12 F.Supp.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen an in-person medical examination credibly contradicts a paper-only review conducted by a professional who has never examined the claimant, the in-person review may render more credible conclusions.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds certain aspects of Dr. Lewis' report troubling. The record establishes Plaintiff underwent lumbar fusion surgery at L4-5 and L5-S1 in December 2002. AR 532-33. After surgery, Plaintiff experienced a brief time when her pain improved, but she began to deteriorate in 2004. AR 521. Dr. Martin performed surgery on L3-4 on March 25, 2008. In March 2009, Plaintiff had surgery to remove the L4-S1 hardware which had been inserted in the 2002 surgery. AR 644.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   However, Dr. Lewis' report presents the timeline as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-376\">\n   This claimant is a 50-year old female with lower back pain. She has a history of posterior lumbar interbody fusion at L4-L5 and L5-S1 on\n   <strong>\n    12/04/12\n   </strong>\n   . She previously underwent a extreme lateral interbody fusion L3-4 ... on 03/25/08. She underwent surgery on 03/25/09 to explore the fusion and remove existing spinal hardware. She also underwent a spinal cord stimulator implant in December 2009. She continues to utilize this device for pain control with slight improvement in her symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   AR 1343 (emphasis added). Later in the same report, Dr. Lewis again states Plaintiff's L4-L5 and L5-S1 surgery was performed in 2012, rather than 2002. AR 1348. In both instances, Dr. Lewis states Plaintiff \"previously\" underwent surgery on L3-4 on March 25, 2008. This belies Hartford's argument that Dr. Lewis' report had a \"typographical error on [the] surgery date being 2012.\" Docket Entry # 26 at 27. Although Hartford argues the error does not change the conclusions in the report, the Court is not so sure. According to Plaintiff, it is important that Plaintiff's L4-S1 surgery predates her L3-4 surgery because \"that suggests that she is suffering from Transitional Syndrome, where the prior fusion causes increased stress on adjacent levels\" and also implies \"possible further deterioration in the future.\" Docket Entry # 17 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   There are other errors as well. Dr. Lewis states Plaintiff continued to utilize the spinal cord stimulator. AR 1343. However, the record reveals the stimulator was surgically removed in 2012 because it caused an increase in Plaintiff's symptoms. Dr. Lewis also states \"[t]hroughout the documentation the claimant reports that she has functional benefit without adverse medication side effects.\" AR 1349. For these reasons, the Court gives little weight to Dr. Lewis' opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The EAR Addendums\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Hartford's first EAR determined there were no jobs Plaintiff could perform that would pay a gainful wage under the Policy criteria. AR 1926-27. On December 8, 2016, Hartford updated the first EAR using Dr.\n   Sklar's restrictions and limitations in the IME Report. AR 1508-09. Unlike the first EAR, the First EAR Addendum identified several occupations Plaintiff was well-suited for based on her education, training, and work history, and which met the earnings requirement in the Policy. AR 1508-09. Plaintiff asserts the First EAR Addendum, which was the only new EAR available to Hartford at the time of its initial denial, disregarded the functional limitations by Plaintiff's treating doctors, the impact of her chronic pain, and the documented cognitive decline caused by her narcotic medications. Docket Entry # 17 at 11. According to Plaintiff, Hartford did not consider the impact of Plaintiff's required daily use of cognitively impairing medication such a Fentanyl and Dilaudid on her ability to work at this level. Nor did Hartford consider that under Social Security standards for disability, Plaintiff is deemed to be unable to engage in Substantial Gainful Activity, which is work that would pay at least $ 1,170.00 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   As noted above, in determining whether Plaintiff is capable of performing the essential duties of any occupation, the Court accords significant weight to the evaluation of Plaintiff by her treating physicians, who have repeatedly concluded Plaintiff can sit, stand, and walk for no more than four hours a day. These evaluations, along with the evidence regarding Plaintiff's chronic pain and the effects of her pain medication, persuade the Court Plaintiff could not continuously engage in any occupation for which she would be qualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   The First EAR Addendum relied upon Dr. Sklar's IME Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court accords minimal weight to this report. As discussed above, Dr. Skylar's conclusions contradicted those of Plaintiff's treating physicians and thus the First EAR Addendum may not have accurately returned jobs that could be performed by Plaintiff. \"In short, the [C]ourt finds that the search did not accurately reflect [Plaintiff's] limitations, and thus, the [C]ourt is not convinced that the jobs returned by the search are ones that [Plaintiff] can perform.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Reetz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523740\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/294/1068/#p1079\">\n    294 F.Supp.3d at 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   Although not binding, the Court finds the SSA determination is also relevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gellerman v.

Tex. 2005) (noting that \"no court has held that an SSA determination is completely irrelevant\"). Hartford advocated Plaintiff's cause before the SSA. According to Plaintiff, \"[i]t is ironic that this determination, which was sought by Hartford, supported by a vendor hired by Hartford, and resulted in financial gain to Hartford of over $ 194,000.00 was disregarded in order to\n   justify denying further benefits.\" AR 1397.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SSA's determination that Plaintiff remains Totally Disabled under its standards, as of April 10, 2017, is further evidence that Plaintiff is both unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation and that she is unable to earn the threshold salary under the Hartford Policy terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   The Court, having considered all of the evidence relied upon by Hartford in justifying its termination of benefits, finds no evidence of improvement in Plaintiff's condition since Hartford previously found she was unable to sustain full time work in any occupation. Based on the Agreed Administrative Record, Plaintiff has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that she cannot perform the essential duties, which includes the ability to work a full work week, of any occupation for which she qualifies. Plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that her disability persisted beyond December 14, 2016. Accordingly, it was improper for Hartford to cease Plaintiff's LTD benefits, and Plaintiff is entitled to the reinstatement of her LTD benefits beginning December 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Although the Court did not need to address in its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review above whether Hartford's decision to terminate Plaintiff's LTD benefits was influenced by its inherent conflict of interest, the Court considers the conflict of interest here. A finding of bad faith requires more than simply establishing there was a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carolina Care Plan Inc. v.

Instead, a plaintiff must prove that the conflict of interest actually and improperly motivated the decision. This higher standard separates those cases in which a conflict of interest tips the scale in favor of reversing the plan administrator's benefits determination from those cases in which the plan administrator's bad faith clearly motivated the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   Although an abuse of discretion case, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Hines v.

Here, similar to\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   , the \"record does not offer a smoking gun revealing [Hartford's] bad faith, but several factors add up to reveal [Hartford's] duty to pay fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. After paying Plaintiff's LTD benefits for so many years, the Court finds noteworthy the timing of Hartford's decision to terminate, as reflected in Hartford's own documentation. On July 17, 2015, Hartford determined it was unreasonable to expect Plaintiff to return to full time gainful employment, noting the findings contained in APS 10 dated July 10, 2015 by Dr. Gajraj. AR 912. It was noted Plaintiff was only forty-eight years old and remained disabled, and the benefit end date was listed as 3/13/2034. AR 912-13. Hartford noted its Risk Management resources had been exhausted and that Plaintiff's claim was again referred to LSS (lump sum settlement). AR 913.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   A Hartford manager, however, determined a second lump sum settlement offer (Plaintiff did not accept the first one offered) would not be appropriate based on Plaintiff's cognitive decline. AR 913-14. However, in April 2016, Hartford reassigned Plaintiff's claim to a Specialty Analyst and changed her Continuing Ability Review (\"CAR\") level. AR 909. Hartford again referred Plaintiff's claim to its SIU, but noted that if SIU again closed its file without need for further review, the Specialty Analyst would review the claim to determine if additional claim management was needed; if no additional claim management was needed, the Specialty Agent would determine Plaintiff's appropriate CAR level. AR 909. After this reassignment, Hartford proceeded with its \"preferred course of action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206599404\">\n    2018 WL 6599404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   As a large insurance company, Hartford has the ability to satisfy the award (\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   factor two), and such an award may deter Hartford and other insurance companies from similar conduct going forward (\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   factor three). The litigated issues are common in ERISA benefit denial cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206599404\">\n    2018 WL 6599404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.
