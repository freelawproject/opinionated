Compere and his mother, Marly Compere Bernado, also known as Marly Brizard (\"Brizard\" or collectively \"plaintiffs\"), filed a complaint against the Department of Homeland Security and various officers and officials of the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (the \"USCIS\") and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") (collectively \"defendants\") alleging that they have unlawfully deprived Compere the opportunity to adjudicate his application for adjustment of status. Specifically, plaintiffs submit that defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20555\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), by unreasonably failing to produce for nearly 15 years the necessary documentation for Compere to file the Form I-485 Adjustment of Status application. As a result of that allegedly unreasonable delay in agency action, Compere is no longer eligible for naturalization because of subsequent criminal convictions and is subject to a final order of removal from the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs seek a writ of mandamus to compel the USCIS to adjudicate Compere's application for adjustment of status nunc\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tunc\n   </em>\n   to April, 2004, when the USCIS first failed to produce the necessary documentation to plaintiffs for that application. Pending before the Court is 1) plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to stay Compere's removal to Haiti pending the adjudication of the merits of the writ of mandamus and 2) defendants' motions to dismiss the original and amended complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Compere is a 31-year-old native and citizen of Haiti. He is a resident of Stoughton, Massachusetts, but is not a citizen of the United States nor a lawful permanent resident. He entered the United States on\n   humanitarian parole in August, 1989, at the age of two. Compere grew up and went to school in the United States, speaks very little Haitian Creole or French, has no immediate family in Haiti and has two children who are both U.S. citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brizard is Compere's mother. She also resides in Stoughton, Massachusetts, and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. She came to the United States in 1987 after Compere was born. She was 13 years old at the time and entered the United States as a derivative of her mother (Compere's grandmother) who was then a lawful permanent resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security is a department under the Executive Branch of the U.S. federal government responsible for all matters related to public security, including matters regarding citizenship and immigration. Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen is the acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for the administration of the immigration laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Lee Francis Cissna is the Director of the USCIS, the branch of the Department of Homeland Security charged with administering the country's naturalization and immigration system, including the adjudication of immigration applications. Cissna is the official charged with supervisory authority over all operations of the USCIS. Defendant Denis Riordan is the District Director of the Boston District of the USCIS. Riordan is the official of the USCIS with general supervisory authority over all operations within the Boston District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Todd Lyons is the Acting Field Officer of ICE in Boston, Massachusetts, which is the federal law enforcement agency tasked with enforcing U.S. immigration laws. In his role as Acting Field Officer, Lyons is responsible for the enforcement of federal immigration laws, including the deportation of removeable aliens, in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Brizard became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September, 1999, when Compere was 12 years old. In 2002, Brizard sought the assistance of an attorney, Daniel Honore, to assist her with applying to adjust Compere's status to lawful permanent resident. Attorney Honore apparently told Brizard that she would need a form known as an I-94, which is an arrival and departure record issued by a Customs and Border Protection Officer to foreign visitors entering the United States. Brizard did not have the original I-94 for Compere from 13 years earlier so Attorney Honore helped her apply for a replacement I-94 in April, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At some point in communicating with the USCIS, Attorney Honore allegedly informed the agency that it should correspond directly with him rather than with Brizard. The USCIS purportedly did not acknowledge Attorney Honore's request and instead initially sent a denial of the request for a replacement I-94 directly to Brizard's address in September, 2003, indicating that the agency had no record of Compere's arrival in the United States. After learning of the denial, Brizard alleges that she reached out to Attorney Honore who told her that without the I-94, there was nothing more that he could do for her son. Attorney Honore suggested that Brizard send Compere back to Haiti to apply for an immigrant visa through consular processing but Brizard refused to do so because she had no family in Haiti at the time. She sought no further advice from Attorney Honore from that point forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The USCIS reversed its earlier denial of Brizard's application for a replacement I-94 just a few months later. In April, 2004, the USCIS sent a letter addressed to Compere at his home address informing him that he appeared to be on a humanitarian parolee status and that his application would be transferred to the district office in Boston for processing. Neither Brizard nor Compere apparently ever physically received or saw that letter. From April, 2004, to December, 2018, the Boston office of the USCIS took no action to produce the replacement I-94 nor did Brizard or Compere inquire into the status of that application or otherwise apply to adjust Compere's status to lawful permanent resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Compere became 18 years old in October, 2005. Since becoming an adult, he has been arrested and convicted for several trespassing and drug-related offenses. In 2011, he was convicted for possession to distribute heroin, a Class A substance. In 2015, he was convicted for possession of suboxone, a Class B Substance. In 2016, he was convicted for possession of Adderall-Amphetamine, a Class B substance. He has served sentences for all three convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2016, Compere was in a detox program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when ICE officers met with and questioned him. After leaving the detox program, he did not hear from ICE so he visited the USCIS office in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The USCIS informed him that he should consult an attorney because it had no information on him. In 2017, Compere finished his probation program and his probation officer told him to contact ICE. Compere met with an Officer Hamel who told him to follow-up with certain documentation, including his mother's naturalization certificate, his birth certificate and his proof of entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After not hearing from Officer Hamel for several months, Compere called him in October, 2017. Officer Hamel told Compere that he would need a hearing with an immigration judge which Compere took to mean that he had to attend Immigration Court that same day. Compere went to the Immigration Court located in Boston and called Officer Hamel again. Officer Hamel informed Compere that his hearing would not be that day but that he should wait at the court for Hamel to pick him up. Compere complied with that instruction and was arrested and taken into ICE custody by Officer Hamel later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Compere was placed in removal proceedings and charged as an arriving alien with three counts of removability: 1) not having a proper immigrant visa in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) ; 2) being someone the Attorney General has reason to believe is a trafficker of a controlled substance in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C)(i) ; and 3) having been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation relating to a controlled substance in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(II). In 2018, after several hearings, an immigration judge found Compere to be removable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Compere filed an application for relief under the Convention Against Torture. He claims that he is afraid to return to Haiti because he could potentially face torture and prolonged imprisonment upon arrival as a criminal deportee. He also submits that his close relationship to Clarens Renois, a well-known political opponent of the Haitian government and former presidential candidate, increases his risk of being detained and tortured upon arrival in Haiti.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   His application under the Convention Against Torture was denied in April, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Immigration Judge found that Compere had not proven that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if deported to Haiti. The Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"BIA\") affirmed that denial in September, 2018. Compere then filed a petition for review and a motion for a stay of removal with the First Circuit Court of Appeals in October, 2018. In November, 2018, the First Circuit denied Compere's motion to stay, determining that his request was jurisdictionally barred and that he was unlikely to succeed on the merits. The following day, Compere filed a motion to reopen his case with the BIA, arguing that he had obtained new evidence to support his claim for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The day after Compere filed his motion to reopen with the BIA, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the District of New Hampshire where he was being detained. In that petition, Compere sought, among other things, a stay of his removal pending a ruling from the BIA on his motion to reopen his case. Shortly after filing the habeas petition in the District of New Hampshire, Compere filed the present complaint in this Court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel defendants to accept and adjudicate his application for adjustment of status\n   <em>\n    nunc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tunc\n   </em>\n   to April, 2004. Within two weeks of filing the complaint in this Court, the USCIS sent Compere a replacement I-94 after investigating the allegations in his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In January, 2019, United States District Judge Paul Barbadoro of the District of New Hampshire entered a stay of Compere's removal pending a ruling from the BIA on his motion to reopen.\n   <em>\n    Compere\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-cv-1036-PB,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529489\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/170/#p181\">\n    358 F.Supp.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20332193\">\n    2019 WL 332193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (D.N.H. Jan. 24, 2019). Judge Barbadoro determined that, although\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9) and 1252(g) likely applied to strip the District Court of jurisdiction over Compere's challenge to his removal proceedings, application of those provisions to bar his habeas petition would violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution because 1) there would be no federal court review of the denial of Compere's emergency motion to stay while his motion to reopen was pending before the BIA and 2) he would be unable to litigate effectively his motion to reopen from Haiti.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id. at 177-83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20332193\">\n     2019 WL 332193\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5-9. Judge Barbadoro explicitly limited the relief ordered, however, to a stay of removal that would remain in place only until Compere's motion to reopen was resolved by the BIA and he had been given an opportunity to appeal any adverse ruling.\n   <em>\n    Id. at 181-83,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20332193\">\n     2019 WL 332193\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In February, 2019, the BIA denied Compere's motion to reopen, finding that the purportedly new evidence provided was substantially similar to that previously offered to the Immigration Judge and did not materially alter the judge's findings or decision. Compere had 30 days from the date of that decision to appeal the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen to the First Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rather than file such an appeal, Compere instead filed in March, 2019, an amended complaint with this Court naming Nielsen and Lyons as additional defendants and a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction (Docket No. 15). He seeks an order from this Court staying his removal until his petition for writ of mandamus has been properly adjudicated. Shortly after filing the motion, this Court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered plaintiffs to give requisite notice to defendants of a hearing on their motion for a preliminary injunction. The next day, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for\n   lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim (Docket No. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to a preliminary injunction ordering a stay of Compere's removal. First, they contend that they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim because other courts outside this Circuit have recognized the availability of\n   <em>\n    nunc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tunc\n   </em>\n   relief in the immigration context and the First Circuit has not definitively foreclosed such relief. Plaintiffs submit that they have a valid claim under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20555\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), because defendants have failed to conclude agency proceedings within a reasonable time by not sending Compere a replacement I-94 for nearly 15 years. Plaintiffs contend that they are in no way responsible for that unreasonable delay which prevented Compere from applying for an adjustment of status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is the plaintiffs' position that, had Compere been provided a replacement I-94 in 2004 when the USCIS first discovered its mistake, Compere would have been able to file a timely application for adjustment of status before his 18th birthday, which would have qualified him automatically to derive citizenship from his naturalized mother under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Compere would thus not have to satisfy the more restrictive requirements of proving continuing good moral character at the time of his naturalization application which is now precluded by his multiple criminal convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20316.10\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 316.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 316.10(b)(1)(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B), 1101(f)(8), 1421(d). Had Compere's application for adjustment of status been timely processed in 2004, which would have resulted in his automatic naturalization, he would not now be subject to removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to proving a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, plaintiffs also submit that Compere will suffer irreparable harm if he is deported to Haiti before he can fully litigate his petition for writ of mandamus. Plaintiffs contend that Compere will be subject to detention and torture upon arrival in Haiti and that his criminal convictions will prevent him from returning to the United States even if he is ultimately successful on his mandamus petition. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the balance of equities favors a stay of Compere's removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In response to plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, defendants maintain that plaintiffs' requested relief must be denied because they do not have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. First, defendants explain that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) which strips district courts of jurisdiction over claims arising from a removal order. Rather, an alien must seek a stay of a removal order through established administrative procedures subject to direct review of the federal Courts of Appeals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)-(5), 1252(d). Defendants submit that plaintiffs' claim for a stay of removal arises out of Compere's final order of removal and thus falls directly within that jurisdiction-stripping provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Furthermore, defendants contend that plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on their claim for mandamus relief in the form of\n   <em>\n    nunc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tunc\n   </em>\n   adjudication of Compere's application for adjustment of status. Defendants assert that the First Circuit has already decided the limits of\n   <em>\n    nunc\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pro tunc\n   </em>\n   authority in the immigration context and has declined to apply that form of relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fernandes Pereira\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937323\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/38/#p47\">\n    417 F.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (1st Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants also assert that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies because Compere has never actually applied for lawful permanent resident status. Defendants explain that Compere could have applied for lawful permanent resident status in 2004 and thereafter even without a replacement I-94 because the application form explicitly allows for \"other evidence of [the applicant's] status\". Defendants argue that the fact that Attorney Honore misadvised plaintiffs that they required an I-94 for the adjustment of status application does not relieve them of their duty to exhaust their administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish 1) a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, 2) the potential for irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld, 3) a favorable balance of hardships and 4) the effect on the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Jean\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mass.

Nor have plaintiffs proffered any evidence indicating that the USCIS acted in bad faith, rather than merely with neglect, in failing to produce the requested documentation for nearly 15 years.
