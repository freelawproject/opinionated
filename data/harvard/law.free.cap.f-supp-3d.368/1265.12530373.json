Plaintiff Foster Cable Services, Inc. filed a response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 17). The Court finds the matter ripe for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff is the former employer of Defendant Deville. On February 12, 2017, Plaintiff entered into a confidentiality agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Defendant Deville. The Agreement states that any information exchanged between Plaintiff and Defendant Deville is proprietary and has been designated as a trade secret and/or confidential. The Agreement gives examples of such covered information as including, \"but is not limited to: [Plaintiff's] concepts, drawings, designs, and other related proprietary information.\" (ECF No. 3, p. 5). Under the Agreement, Defendant Deville agreed to keep any covered information confidential and to not disclose it to any other party. (ECF No. 3, p. 5). The Agreement states that Defendant Deville's confidentiality obligations survive the termination of the Agreement and shall have no time limit, except as otherwise provided for in the Agreement. The Agreement does not, however, set out any time or geographical limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While employing Defendant Deville, Plaintiff underwent negotiations with Claiborne Electric\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to provide services under a pole and line maintenance agreement. On March 1, 2017, Defendant Deville left his employment with Plaintiff and began employment with Defendant Volt Power. Shortly thereafter, Claiborne Electric removed Plaintiff as an engineering vendor and discontinued negotiations with Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Volt Power subsequently obtained a maintenance agreement with Claiborne Electric because of Defendant Deville's \"disclosure of the potential client, pricing, and other proprietary information as precluded by the [Agreement.]\" (ECF No. 3, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 15, 2018, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit against Defendants in the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas. Plaintiff asserts claims of breach of contract, tortious interference with a contract, and conversion, all stemming from Defendant Deville's alleged disclosure of information protected by the Agreement to Defendant\n   Volt Power. On July 26, 2018, Defendants removed the case to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 29, 2018, Defendants filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Agreement is unenforceable as a matter of law and that Plaintiffs' claims all fail and should be dismissed. Plaintiff opposes the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A party may move for judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings have closed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). In deciding a Rule 12(c) motion, courts apply the same legal standard used for a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Ashley Cnty., Ark. v.

A pleading must state \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). To meet this standard and to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint need only state factual allegations sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level that is plausible on its face.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants argue that the Agreement is an unreasonable and unlawful restraint of trade and, as such, is unenforceable. Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims all fail, as they are premised on the existence of a valid underlying contract, of which there is none. Plaintiff argues in response that the instant motion should be denied as premature because the pleadings have not closed, the parties have not filed their Joint Rule 26(f) Report, and the parties have not conducted any discovery. Plaintiff does not, however, respond to the substance of Defendants' arguments for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court will address Plaintiff's arguments that the instant motion should be denied as premature. Then, if necessary, the Court will take up Defendants' arguments for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the Motion is Premature\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff presents various arguments that the instant motion is premature. First, it contends that the Court should deny the instant motion because the pleadings\n   were not closed at the time Defendants filed the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A party may file a motion for judgment on the pleadings \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). \"The pleadings are 'closed' after the complaint and answer are filed, along with any reply to additional claims asserted in the answer.\"\n   <em>\n    Hesford v. Jefferson Capital Sys.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-CV-100-CJW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20124823\">\n    2019 WL 124823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Iowa Jan. 7, 2019) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1367 (3d ed. 2018) (\"[P]leadings are closed upon the filing of a complaint and an answer (absent a court-ordered reply), unless a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim is interposed, in which event the filing of a reply to a counterclaim, cross-claim answer, or third-party answer normally will mark the close of the pleadings.\") (internal footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants answered Plaintiff's complaint prior to filing the instant motion and Defendants' answer did not assert any additional claims. Thus, the pleadings closed upon the filing of Defendants' answer, and the instant motion is procedurally proper.\n   <em>\n    Hesford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20124823\">\n    2019 WL 124823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. As such, the Court finds that the instant motion should not be denied as premature based on the pleadings not being closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that the instant motion is premature because the parties have not filed their Joint Rule 26(f) Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that a Rule 12(c) motion cannot be filed prior to the submission of the parties' Joint Rule 26(f) Report, and the Court is unaware of any such authority. To the Court's knowledge, the only procedural barrier Rule 26 may present is that parties generally cannot conduct formal discovery before conferring pursuant to Rule 26(f).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). However, this limitation is of no import as to whether the instant motion is premature because a Rule 12(c) motion may be filed at any time after the pleadings close. As discussed above, the pleadings closed in this case before Defendants filed the instant motion, and, thus, the instant motion should not be denied as premature based on the timing of the parties' Joint Rule 26(f) Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that the instant motion should be denied as premature because the parties have not yet had the opportunity to conduct discovery. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize courts to delay a ruling in certain instances to allow parties to conduct additional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) (permitting courts to continue a ruling on a motion for summary judgment if the parties have not conducted adequate discovery). However, Plaintiff cites no authority providing for the use of Rule 56(d) -or any other, similar rule-on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the Court is unaware of any such authority. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Rule 56(d) is applicable to delay a ruling on a Rule 12(c) motion, courts may only delay a ruling to allow for discovery if the requesting party \"shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specific reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Anzaldua v. Ne. Ambulance &amp; Fire Prot. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277796\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/822/#p836\">\n    793 F.3d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836 (8th Cir. 2015). Plaintiff has not provided an affidavit or declaration to this effect, nor has it stated any facts which it hopes to uncover in discovery to allow it to better respond to the instant motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beal v. Old Reliable Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:14-cv-4079-PKH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204230851\">\n    2014 WL 4230851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D. Ark. Aug. 26, 2014). Accordingly, the Court finds that the instant motion should not be denied as premature based on the parties' lack of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff's arguments that the instant motion should be denied as premature are misplaced. Thus, the Court will now turn to the merits of Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Dismissal is Appropriate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue that the Agreement is an unreasonable and unlawful restraint of trade and, as such, is unenforceable. Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims fail, as they are premised on the existence of a valid underlying contract, of which there is none. The Court will now separately address whether dismissal is proper as to each of Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Deville breached the Agreement\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   by disclosing confidential information covered by the Agreement after leaving Plaintiff to work for Defendant Volt Power. Defendants argue that the Agreement is an unreasonable and unlawful restraint of trade and, thus, is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Federal district courts sitting in diversity, like the Court in this case, must apply the forum state's substantive law.\n   <em>\n    Guardian Fiberglass, Inc. v. Whit Davis Lumber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328816\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/512/#p515\">\n    509 F.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515 (8th Cir. 2007). A valid breach-of-contract claim under Arkansas law requires the assertion of: (1) the existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) an obligation on the part of the defendant, (3) a breach of that obligation; and (4) damages resulting from the breach.\n   <em>\n    Rabalaias v. Barnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878580\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/284/527/#p528\">\n    284 Ark. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878580\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/284/527/#p528\">\n    683 S.W.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (1985). Defendants assert that the first element-the existence of a valid and enforceable contract-is missing in this case and, thus, Plaintiff's breach-of-contract claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court must address the standard to be used to determine the validity and enforceability of the Agreement. Defendants state that the Court should analyze the Agreement-and find it unenforceable-using the \"reasonable restraint\" analysis used in Arkansas for covenants not to compete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff offers no response or objection to this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Arkansas caselaw is not particularly well developed regarding how courts should determine whether a confidentiality agreement is enforceable. However, it appears that Arkansas courts use the same test to determine whether confidentiality agreements and non-compete agreements are enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alltel Commc'ns, LLC v.

They argue that the Agreement in this case not only covers \"all information\" provided by Plaintiff to Defendant Deville, but also vice versa, and that the Agreement has no time limitation at all. Thus, Defendants argue that the Court should find the Agreement unenforceable. Plaintiff offers no response to this argument, other than seemingly arguing that \"non-disclosure agreements ... are generally held to be more valid and in a more favorable light [than non-compete agreements].\" (ECF No. 18, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants. Plaintiff's complaint does not allege that Defendant Deville was exposed to any confidential information related to its client list or their prices, but it does allege that he relayed that information to Defendant Volt Power. Giving Plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences, it appears that Plaintiff alleges that it, at some point, gave Defendant Deville confidential information regarding Claiborne Electric.

In light of the Court's above finding that the Agreement is unenforceable, the Court finds that, after taking all well-pled allegations as true and construing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor,\n   Plaintiff's breach-of-contract claim fails because its essential elements are not met.

Tortious Interference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Defendant Volt Power tortiously interfered with the contract between Plaintiff and Defendant Deville by accepting confidential information from Defendant Deville. Defendants argue that this claim fails and should be dismissed because there is no valid, underlying contract between Plaintiff and Defendant Deville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In Arkansas, the elements of tortious interference are: (1) the existence of a valid contractual relationship or a business expectancy; (2) knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on the part of the interfering party; (3) intentional interference inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy; (4) resultant damage to the party whose relationship or expectancy has been disrupted; and (5) improper conduct by the interfering party.\n   <em>\n    Ballard Grp., Inc. v.

Specifically, Defendants argue that the Agreement, which Plaintiff bases its claims on, is unenforceable and, thus, there is no valid contractional relationship or expectancy. Defendants conclude that Plaintiff's tortious-interference claim fails because its essential elements are not satisfied. Plaintiff does not respond to this argument, other than to say that whether tortious interference occurred is a fact-based determination not ripe for a decision prior to a Rule 26(f) report being filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants and finds Plaintiff's argument is misplaced. As previously determined above, the Agreement is an unreasonable restraint of trade and, thus, is unenforceable. The Court has also determined above that Rule 26(f) presents no barrier to the instant Rule 12(c) motion. Thus, for the above-stated reasons, and after taking all well-pled allegations as true and construing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the Court finds that Plaintiff's tortious-interference claim fails because it has not alleged facts demonstrating all essential elements of the claim. Specifically, Plaintiff has not demonstrated the existence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy. Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to state a tortious-interference claim upon which relief may be granted and that claim should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Defendants converted Plaintiff's confidential information for their own use and benefit. Defendants argue that this claim fails and should be dismissed because there is no valid, underlying contract between Plaintiff and Defendant Deville barring the disclosure of information and, thus, Defendants' alleged actions cannot be considered \"wrongful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"[T]o establish liability for the tort of conversion, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant wrongfully committed a distinct act of dominion over the property of another, which is a denial of, or is inconsistent with, the owner's rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Integrated Direct Mktg., LLC v.

For this reason, Defendants argue that their alleged actions cannot be considered \"wrongful\" and, thus, Plaintiff's conversion claim fails and should be dismissed. Plaintiff does not respond to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants. As discussed above, the Agreement is an unreasonable restraint of trade and is unenforceable. Without the Agreement, nothing prevented Defendant Deville from disclosing the information he came into contact with while employed with Plaintiff. Therefore, Defendants' alleged actions cannot be considered \"wrongful,\" an essential element of the tort of conversion in Arkansas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773540\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/73/#p3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[A] plaintiff must prove that the defendant wrongfully committed a distinct act of dominion over the property of another.\").
