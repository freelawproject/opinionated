The crux of Plaintiff's claim is that Defendants conspired to suppress CDOR to benefit their derivatives trading positions from August 9, 2007 to December 31, 2014 (the \"Class Period\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Plaintiff, which administers a retirement system for police officers and firefighters, alleges that it was harmed because it transacted \"in CDOR-Based Derivatives during the Class Period,\" including directly with certain Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CDOR is \"the benchmark used to price Canadian dollar-denominated derivatives in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268. It is supposed to reflect the cost of borrowing Canadian dollars in North America.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. CDOR is calculated daily based on submissions from the \"CDOR Panel\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which included sixteen Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 248, 269. Each CDOR Panel member's submission should reflect the rate at which they are willing to lend against Bankers' Acceptances (\"BAs)\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   for five different tenors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 269. Thomson Reuters collects these submissions, averages them in accordance with a set formula, and publishes the average rate to financial data providers who distribute it throughout the world.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 269-271.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Manipulation of CDOR is central to the claims of the complaint. CDOR is used to price various types of derivatives, which are financial instruments priced, benchmarked,\n   and/or settled based on CDOR (\"CDOR-Based Derivatives\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Changes in CDOR, therefore, impact those derivative transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, a swap is a derivative in which \"two parties exchange the obligation to make a series of periodic payments (e.g. monthly) based on [an] underlying principal amount (e.g. $ 1 billion CAD) for [a] set period (e.g. one year).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 277. CDOR determines the amount paid or received by each party in a CDOR-Based swap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 278. There are many different types of CDOR-Based swaps, but in a \"plain vanilla\" interest rate swap, one party makes payments based on a variable rate (e.g. CDOR) while another makes payments based on a fixed rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 279. In that situation, the party making payments based on the variable rate (CDOR) would benefit if CDOR were suppressed. CDOR also impacts \"CDOR-Based Loans\" in which the loan's interest rate is based on CDOR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 257-58, 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendants conspired to suppress CDOR during the Class Period by submitting artificially low rates that did not reflect the rate at which they were lending Canadian dollars in North America in order to increase profits from their CDOR-Based Derivatives positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 329. Plaintiff claims that prior to the start of the Class Period in 2007, Defendants had large CDOR-Based Loan portfolios in which borrowers made interest payments based on CDOR, but in 2007, they reduced their CDOR-Based lending and increased sales of CDOR-Based Derivatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 299-302. Plaintiff alleges that this created a motive and financial incentive for Defendants to suppress CDOR to reduce the amount of interest they were required to pay on their CDOR-Based Derivatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 309.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In support of its claims, Plaintiff submits the following evidence. First, in terms of Defendants' collusion, Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that Defendants submitted identical or very similar CDOR rates for certain tenors at various points during the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 IV.A. Second, to support its claim that CDOR was suppressed, Plaintiff compares CDOR to two other allegedly comparable benchmarks during the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III. Plaintiff also relies on a report of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (\"IIROC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 261. In 2011, the IIROC announced it was \"initiating a review of the CDOR rate-setting process,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 348, and in January 2013, it released a \"report on its review of CDOR supervisory practices\" and reported that CDOR submissions were \"prepared by employees of [CDOR panel] dealers' parent/affiliate bank or by persons that are dually-employed at both the [CDOR panel dealer and the bank],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 261. The IIROC report recommended that the rate-setting process be clarified, and regulations be implemented to control the rate-setting process to prevent manipulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants are thirty-three financial institutions. Specifically, nine Defendants are parent banks and the other twenty-four are subsidiaries or affiliates of the parent banks.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 B. Many Defendants are incorporated and headquartered in foreign countries, including all of the parent banks with the exception of Bank of America.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 72, 90, 106, 143, 163, 193, 213, 227.

First, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants conspired from 2007 to 2014, but the chart only refers to 2014. Second, even accepting as true that the chart establishes that seven Defendants collectively held more CDOR-Based Derivatives than CDOR-Based Loans, it does not provide any support for the assertion that each Defendant did so individually.\n   <em>\n    Commodity Exch., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 213 F.Supp.3d at 648 n.16 (\"Aggregate data tells the Court little about the actual position of any particular Defendant.

As Plaintiff itself alleges, in a CDOR-Derivative transaction a Defendant could either be the party making payments based on CDOR or the party receiving payments based on CDOR.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am.

In an individual transaction, therefore, a Defendant only profits from the suppression of CDOR if it is making payments based on CDOR, rather than receiving payments based on CDOR. In the aggregate, because both CDOR-Based Loans and CDOR-Receiving Derivatives obligate a Defendant to receive payments based on CDOR, a Defendant would only have a \"net short exposure to CDOR,\" and profit from CDOR suppression, if its portfolio of CDOR-Paying Derivatives outweighed its portfolio of CDOR-Loans\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   CDOR-Receiving Derivatives. Because the Chart does not distinguish between CDOR-Paying Derivatives and CDOR-Receiving Derivatives, the complaint does not plausibly allege that Defendants were \"[net] short at any particular point during the Class Period,\"\n   <em>\n    Commodity Exch., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 213 F.Supp.3d at 663, and therefore had a profit-based motive.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re London Silver Fixing, Ltd., Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , 213 F.Supp.3d at 561 n.20 (rejecting argument that Defendant stood to benefit from conspiracy because it held a large unhedged position when the data provided detailed Defendant's \"total derivatives positions, telling the Court nothing about its position specifically in the [relevant] market.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, the complaint generally alleges that Defendants grew their CDOR-Based Derivatives portfolios during the Class Period, but it similarly fails to distinguish between CDOR-Paying and CDOR-Receiving Derivatives.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am.

However, as discussed above, the complaint fails to plausibly allege that Defendants intended to profit from CDOR-Based Derivatives trading because it does not adequately allege that they held a net short exposure (and, therefore, would profit if CDOR was suppressed).
