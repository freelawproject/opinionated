Hannah Lauck, United States District Judge\n   This matter comes before the Court on Defendants' Haynes Investments, LLC (\"Haynes Investments\"), Sovereign Business Solutions, LLC (\"SBS\" or \"Sovereign Business Solutions\"), and L. Stephen Haynes's (collectively with Haynes Investments and SBS, the \"Haynes Defendants\") three motions: the Motion to Transfer or, in the Alternative, to Stay Proceedings (the \"Motion to Transfer\"), (ECF No. 36), the Motion to Compel Arbitration, (ECF No. 34), and the Motion to Dismiss, (ECF No. 32).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs Darlene Gibbs, Stephanie Edwards, Lula Williams, Patrick Inscho, and Lawrence Mwethuku's (\"Plaintiffs\") responded to the Motions, (ECF Nos. 41, 42, 43), and the Haynes Defendants replied, (ECF Nos. 44, 45, 46).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Accordingly, the matters are ripe for disposition. The Court dispenses with oral argument because the materials before it adequately present the facts and legal contentions, and argument would not aid the decisional process. The Court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 1367.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Procedural and Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Summary of Allegations in the Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This controversy arises out of the Haynes Defendants' involvement in an allegedly\n   unlawful lending operation involving two Native American-owned lending companies\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and multiple alleged co-conspirators. The lending operation allegedly offered loans to Plaintiffs in amounts ranging from $ 300 to $ 3,000, charging interest rates ranging from 227.92% to 448%. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 120-21, ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs bring this suit on behalf of themselves and all individuals similarly situated, alleging that this lending operation violates state and federal lending laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the lending operation constitutes what they refer to as a \"rent-a-tribe.\" Under this improper business model, actors establish entities to originate internet-based high interest loans so as to evade state and federal usury and lending laws. A non-tribal entity and a Tribe agree to establish a lending company in the Tribe's name. According to Plaintiffs, the Native American Tribe nominally establishes the lending company in order to extend its tribal sovereign immunity to the newly-formed business entity. The tribal company, however, receives capital from a different, non-tribal person or company who seeks to use the tribal lending companies in order to cloak the unlawfully high-interest internet loans with sovereign immunity. The non-tribal entity retains the vast majority of the profits and controls the lending tribal entity, from major business decisions to day-to-day operations. In exchange, the Tribe receives only a small percentage of the revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here Plaintiffs challenge the formation and operation of two lending entities: Plain Green\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Great Plains.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plain Green seeks immunity as part of the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Great Plains would claim immunity as part of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe. Because only the Haynes Defendants-who principally ran the Plain Green lending operation-remain in this action, the Court, for clarity, focuses on the factual allegations as to them. Plaintiffs also allege, however, that Haynes played a critical role in finding a new bank to partner with\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   Plain Green\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Great Plains after they had been targeted by state and federal regulators (and the Department of Justice), resulting in some banks ceasing the processing of their loans. As such, some claims regarding Great Plains are interspersed and all five Plaintiffs bring their claims against the Haynes Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    For ease of reference, the Court refers to the Motion to Transfer, the Motion to Compel Arbitration, and the Motion to Dismiss collectively as the \"Motions.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    On March 6, 2019, Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Authority, (ECF No. 49), asking the Court to file and consider a transcript from a case in the Northern District of California which they contend addresses identical motions as those before this Court. Plaintiffs assert that the California district judge's oral comments as to an upcoming written opinion should inform this Court's decision. On March 12, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the California district court's written opinion on the motions. (ECF No. 50.) The Haynes Defendants did not oppose the Motion to File Supplemental Authority and the time to do so has expired.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The Court will deny the Motion to File Supplemental Authority as moot. A ruling from a non-binding court provides meager persuasive value. Even more importantly, the Court need not rely on nor refer to any authority beyond those briefed by the parties in order to render its findings here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

(Compl. \u00b6 2.) Specifically, the Haynes Defendants and\n    several non-tribal actors entered into a term sheet in support of the unlawful tribal lending operation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. Ex. 1 \"March 2011 Term Sheet\" 1, ECF No. 1-1.) Per the March 2011 Term Sheet, a designated non-tribal entity\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    provided \"the infrastructure to run the lending operations.\" (Compl. \u00b6 34 (citing March 2011 Term Sheet 1).) Haynes Investments \"provide[d] funding to the Tribe to enable it to make each of the [l]oans.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 35 (quoting March 2011 Term Sheet 1-2).) In accordance with the provisions in the 2011 Term Sheet, Haynes Investments provided a principal amount of up to $ 2,000,000 through \"a revolving line of credit\" to fund the loans. (Compl. \u00b6 36 (quoting Compl. Ex. 2 \"Credit Agreement\" 1, ECF No. 1-2).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Once Plain Green originated the loans in its name, another designated third-party entity \"purchased\" the loans from Plain Green. (Compl. \u00b6 37.) As part of this \"purchase,\" the third party entity \"refunded [back to Haynes Investments] 99% of the funds provided by Haynes Investments, wh[ich] also received: (1) 5% interest on the money loaned to the Tribe, and (2) 1% of the revenue collected on the loans as a 'referral' fee.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 38.) Plaintiffs allege that Great Plains has a comparable structure, albeit with different entities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    In this way, although Plain Green\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    and Great Plains\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    executed the loan agreements, the Haynes Defendants\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    and other non-tribal entities actually funded and controlled the lending operation. The lending operation issued loans to Virginia residents with interest rates far in excess of Virginia's usury law, which caps interest rates at 12%, with some exceptions not applicable here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Va. Code. Ann. \u00a7 6.2-303. The Haynes Defendants, together with other non-parties, \"marketed, initiated, and collected usurious loans in Virginia.\" (Compl. \u00b6 118, ECF No. 1.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    On several occasions, Haynes Investments increased its investment in the Tribal lending operation. Between December 2011 and June 2012, \"Haynes Investments received a monthly profit between $ 131,555 and $ 166,714\" from its participation in the Tribal lending venture. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 53 (citing Compl. Ex. 7 \"ILP Profit Share Breakout Trend\" TF-VA0602566).) As of July 12, 2012, Haynes Investments had increased the line of credit it extended to the lending operation to $ 20,000,000, ten\n    times the amount originally agreed upon in March 2011.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    In August 2012, Haynes proposed an additional arrangement \"to continue to grow\" the improper lending operation. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 55.) As part of this new financing arrangement, Haynes created Sovereign Business Solutions,\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    which provided Plain Green a principal amount of up to $ 15,000,000 through a revolving line of credit to fund additional loans. In exchange, \"SBS received 15% interest on the outstanding advances on the line of credit, as well as a security interest in the loans in the event of default.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 61 (citing Compl. Ex. 9 \"February 2013 Credit and Security Agreement\" \u00a7\u00a7 3.3, 3.7).) Haynes signed the February 2013 Credit and Security Agreement on behalf of SBS.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Plaintiffs allege that Haynes \"did not merely invest\" in this unlawful Tribal lending scheme, (Compl. \u00b6 64,) but rather, \"played an integral role in helping ... [to] obtain a bank willing to process payments through the Automated Clearing House Network (the 'ACH Network'),\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 65.) The ACH Network \"allows financial institutions to send or take money directly out of a bank account without the requirement of a direct relationship between the financial institution and the borrower.\" (Compl. \u00b6 66.) Plaintiffs quote reports stating that the ACH plays a \"vital role\" in online lenders' ability to conduct business.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 68 (citation omitted).) These same financial reports indicate that due to the ACH's vital role, \"state and federal regulators, as well as the Department of Justice have, seized on the ACH Network as a means to stop online lending by out-of-state lenders.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    When regulators targeted Plain Green and Great Plains, and banks consequently \"ceased processing the debits and credits on their loans,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Compl. \u00b6 72), Haynes \"played a critical role in finding a new bank to partner with Plain Green and Great Plains,\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 73). To this end, Haynes met with several banks beginning in 2013 and identified several possible partners over the course of a year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Plaintiffs in this case all entered into loan agreements (the \"Contracts\" or the \"Loan Contracts\") with either Plain Green or Great Plains. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gibbs Agr., ECF No. 35-1; Williams Agr., ECF No. 35-1; Edwards Agr., ECF No. 35-1; Inscho Agr., ECF No. 35-1; Mwethuku Agr., ECF No. 35-1.) Although some variation in wording exists among the Contracts, they essentially include the same terms and the minor differences do not alter the outcome on the Motions. Because the legal analysis requires a detailed evaluation of specific provisions within each Contract, an introductory summary follows.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Each Contract purports to constitute a loan agreement between the named plaintiff and either Plain Green (two contracts) or Great Plains (three contracts), including the underlying loan terms, choice of law provisions, and arbitration agreements. The principal amounts varied, from as low as $ 500 in a loan through Plain Green, (Mwethuku Agr. 2), to as high as $ 1,700 in a loan through Great Plains, (Inscho Agr. 2). Interest rates\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    also varied, ranging from 219.38%, (Inscho Agr. 3), to 373.97%, (Mwethuku Agr. 2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    All Contracts purport to be governed by Tribal Law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    All Contracts, through both Plain Green and Great Plains, expressly disavow the application of any state law. (Gibbs Agr. 8; Williams Agr. 10; Edwards Agr. 9; Inscho Agr. 10; Mwethuku Agr. 7.) As to federal law, Plaintiffs allege that the provisions make clear the parties' intention to disclaim the application of federal law. For example, the \"Governing Law\" provision in four\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    of the Contracts states that Tribal law governs each Contract, and that the lender \"may choose to voluntarily use certain federal laws as guidelines for the provision of services. Such voluntary use does not represent acquiescence of the [Tribe] to any federal law.\" (Gibbs Agr. 6; Williams Agr. 7; Edwards Agr. 6-7; Inscho Agr. 7.) All Contracts include a \"Truth in Lending Disclosure\" but expressly disavow any conclusion that the inclusion of the disclosure constitutes \"consent\" to any \"application of state or federal law.\" (Gibbs Agr. 3; Williams Agr. 3; Edwards Agr. 3; Inscho Agr. 3; Mwethuku Agr. 2.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    All Contracts also include an additional agreement to arbitrate disputes arising from the Contract (the \"Arbitration Agreements\"). According to the Contracts, the arbitration could take place through a nationally recognized arbitration entity,\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    on tribal land or within thirty (30) miles of the borrower's current address. The Arbitration Agreements all contain a proviso indicating that, should the chosen arbitration firm's policies and procedures conflict with the Loan Contract or Tribal law, the terms of the Loan Contract will prevail. (Gibbs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Agr. 8; Williams Agr. 7; Edwards Agr. 9; Inscho Agr. 9; Mwethuku Agr. 6.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    All Contracts include a severance clause stating that, should any provision within it-such as the Arbitration Agreement-be found unenforceable, the offensive provision would be severed, meaning that the remainder of the Contract would remain in full force and effect. (Gibbs Agr. 7, Williams Agr. 6; Edwards Agr. 6; Inscho Agr. 7; Mwethuku Agr. 6.) Borrowers can opt out of the Arbitration Agreements, but each Contract provides that borrowers who opt out of the Arbitration Agreements nevertheless agree to bring any disputes within the applicable Tribal court system and according to Tribal law. (Gibbs Agr. 7-8; Williams Agr. 7-8; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 7-8; Mwethuku Agr. 5.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The Arbitration Agreements require the application of Tribal law, and limit the Arbitrator's authority to remedies and legal claims recognized by Tribal law. (Gibbs Agr. 6, Williams Agr. 9; Edwards Agr. 9; Inscho Agr. 7; Mwethuku Agr. 6.) The Arbitration Agreements provide that either party may appeal the Arbitrator's decision in the Tribal court system. (Gibbs Agr. 8; Williams Agr. 9; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 9; Mwethuku Agr. 6.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      Procedural Background\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Plaintiffs filed a six-count putative class action Complaint against eight defendants\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    alleging various federal and state violations associated with the allegedly unlawful loan enterprise.

Although\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    predates the action in this Court, thereby satisfying the first and most obvious factor under the test, the present case fails to sufficiently overlap with\n    <em>\n     Gingras.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    As to the second prong of the first-to-file evaluation, the parties do not substantially overlap. Of the eight parties to this case-five named plaintiffs and three defendants-\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    names only Haynes Investments. Plaintiffs bring this purported class action suit on behalf of Virginia residents. The\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs, both Vermont residents, seek to bring suit on behalf of a nationwide class. Although the proposed\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    class may ultimately include some of the named plaintiffs in this suit,\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs have not yet moved to certify the class.\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    On this record, it would be premature to conclude that the plaintiffs in each suit would sufficiently\n    overlap.\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n    Although the difference in named plaintiffs, on its own, might not defeat the first-to-file rule in a purported class action, the Court also considers the absence of both Haynes and Sovereign Business Solutions highly problematic. The\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    Complaint names seventeen defendants and fourteen interested parties. It does not name Haynes or Sovereign Business Solutions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     30\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    More importantly, as to the third factor, the causes of action in the cases do not constitute substantively identical or similar claims. The Haynes Defendants allege that the theories of the cases overlap, as both sets of plaintiffs allege that \"the Haynes Defendants invested in what [the plaintiffs in each case] describe as an illegal lending enterprise involving Native American tribes and various loan servicers... and assisted the servicers in attempting to find a bank to work with the servicers in collecting the loans via the [ACH Network].\" (Mem. Supp. Mot. Transfer 3.) Although\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    raises many of the same factual allegations-a description of how allegedly improper Tribal lending operations work and allegations that Haynes Investments carried out such an operation through Plain Green-the legal claims presented to the United States District Court for the District of Vermont lack sufficient similarity to the current case to justify invoking the first-to-file rule and transferring this suit to Vermont.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Here, Plaintiffs' claims all stem from Virginia's usury laws. Count V of the Complaint states violations of Virginia usury laws, and these alleged violations undergird Plaintiffs' four RICO claims\n    <footnotemark>\n     31\n    </footnotemark>\n    and their unjust enrichment claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     32\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    does not invoke Virginia law or rely on it to support any of the causes of actions. Even if the District Court for the District of Vermont were to certify the proposed\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    nationwide class, the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    class still might not preclude Plaintiffs from pursuing their claims for relief here because of the different theories of legal liability in each suit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    For example, although the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    Complaint brings three RICO claims pursuant to the same provisions Plaintiffs invoke here, the facts underlying each claim differ. The\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs allege that the \"Victory Park Defendants\" violated\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c) by engaging in wire fraud and mail fraud, but they do not allege that Haynes Investments violated this RICO provision. (\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 246.) Also, no allegations of wire or mail fraud stand before this Court. Instead, Plaintiffs allege that the Haynes Defendants violated this RICO provision when they \"associated with the enterprise and participated in the affairs of the enterprise, which existed for the purpose of collection of unlawful debt.\" (Compl. \u00b6 175.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Both the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    Complaint and the Complaint filed in this Court raise a claim under \u00a7 1962(b). But the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs allege that all the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    defendants, including Haynes Investments, violated \u00a7 1962(b) by engaging in the unlawful collection of debt. The facts undergirding these allegations relate to Vermont consumers and Vermont law. Plaintiffs here, instead, allege that the Haynes Defendants violated \u00a7 1962(b) when they acquired and maintained \"interests in and control of the enterprise involved in the unlawful collection of debt.\" (Compl. \u00b6 161.) Plaintiffs describe the debt as unlawful because it violates Virginia usury laws. Although the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    Complaint refers to \"usurious rates of more than twice the legal limit in several states,\" this general assertion does not suffice, on its own, to support a finding that the cases bring duplicate \u00a7 1962(b) claims.\n    <footnotemark>\n     33\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Other important differences among the causes of action also exist. Two of the four claims against Haynes Investments in\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    do not overlap with this case at all: Count One states violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and Count II states violations of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act. Plaintiffs here, meanwhile, bring a claim, completely absent in\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    , pursuant to \u00a7 1962(a) (the \"RICO Receipt &amp; Investment Count\") against all of the Haynes Defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Thus, the Court finds that the parties and the claims in\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    and this action do not present as \"substantively the same or sufficiently similar.\"\n    <em>\n     Victaulic\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206388761\">\n     2013 WL 6388761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *3. Because neither the parties nor the claims substantially overlap, the first-to-file rule does not commend transfer. Although similarities between the cases exist, the Haynes Defendants themselves recognize that \"this case is one of many being litigated in courts across the country,\" all of which bring similar claims. (Mem. Supp. Mot. Transfer 1, ECF No. 37.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In conclusion, assessing the circumstances at bar, the Court will deny the Motion to Transfer under the first-to-file rule. Because the\n    <em>\n     Gingras\n    </em>\n    case and the action here lack a similarity of parties or issues at stake, the final two prongs of the first-to-file rule remain unmet. For these reasons, the Court will deny the Motion to Transfer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     C.\n     <em>\n      Alternatively, Special Circumstances Would Justify Proceeding In This Court Rather than Ordering Transfer\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    As articulated earlier, even in circumstances where the first-to-file would suggest transfer, the decision to invoke the rule \"is an equitable determination that is made on a case-by-case, discretionary basis.\"\n    <em>\n     Elderberry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201164835\">\n     2013 WL 1164835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *4 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Nutrition &amp; Fitness\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109154\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/264/357/#p360\">\n     264 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    360 ).

Va. 2015). Plaintiffs, in their opposition to the Motion to Transfer, raise legitimate concerns about personal jurisdiction over the Haynes Defendants in the District of Vermont as it pertains to Plaintiffs' claims, which stem from acts that took place in Virginia, not Vermont. Specifically, Plaintiffs\n    state that \"the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint would not have established Defendants' minimum contacts with Vermont to satisfy the strictures of due process as applied by the Second Circuit.\" (Resp. Mot. Transfer 13.) The Haynes Defendants do not adequately respond to these concerns. It seems unlikely that Plaintiffs could have brought this case in the District of Vermont.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Even putting aside the issue of personal jurisdiction, given the nature of class action suits, other \u00a7 1404 factors weigh in favor of remaining in this Court. A court considers: \"(1) plaintiffs['] choice of forum, (2) convenience of the parties, (3) witness convenience and access, and (4) the interest of justice.\"\n    <em>\n     Wenzel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20222179\">\n     2015 WL 222179\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *2. \"In some cases, the interest of justice trumps the other factors, even when they suggest a different outcome.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *3. Under this analysis, the Haynes Defendants could not meet their burden to \"clearly establish[ ] that these factors favor transfer.\"\n    <em>\n     Victaulic\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206388761\">\n     2013 WL 6388761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Remarkably, these four \u00a7 1404 factors also commend a denial of transfer. First, as to the plaintiff's choice of forum, no question exists that Plaintiffs prefer this forum to Vermont, given their opposition to the transfer and legitimate concerns about personal jurisdiction to proceed in Vermont. Second, as to party convenience, Plaintiffs each filed declarations detailing the inconvenience and expense that transfer to Vermont would produce. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 43-1, 43-2, 43-3, 43-4, 43-5.) Although the Haynes Defendants may\n    <em>\n     prefer\n    </em>\n    to litigate claims in one venue, party convenience plainly weighs in favor of this venue. Finally, as to the third factor, Plaintiffs' declarations indicate that witnesses familiar with Plaintiffs' claims live in Virginia and that Plaintiffs do not know of any person in Vermont who could act as a witness in this case. For this reason, this factor also weighs in favor of remaining in this Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Most importantly, the interest of justice-the fourth consideration under \u00a7 1404-justifies proceeding in this venue. As the Haynes Defendants recognize, several other actions pending here appear closely related to this case, perhaps more so than\n    <em>\n     Gingras.\n    </em>\n    (Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 3 (\"The instant Complaint alleges identical harms and practically identical theories of liability as those in [other cases before this Court], including as to the Haynes Defendants.\").) Any potential gain in judicial efficiency from transferring this case to the District of Vermont seem overborne because this Court will have to consider the same underlying facts and claims to address other cases before it.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wenzel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20222179\">\n     2015 WL 222179\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *4 (discussing judicial efficiency when determining whether to grant a transfer).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In sum, even absent the Court's finding that the Haynes Defendants cannot invoke the first-to-file rule to justify transfer, the Court would find that ample \"special circumstances\" commend proceeding in this forum and denying the Haynes Defendants' Motion to Transfer.\n    <em>\n     Elderberry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201164835\">\n     2013 WL 1164835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *4 (quotation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      III.

First, the Arbitration Agreements purport to apply Tribal law exclusively. Second, the context provided by the Loan Contracts as a whole reinforces this conclusion.

Just like the arbitration agreements discussed in\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    , the Williams, Edwards, and Inscho Arbitration Agreements state that the arbitrator \"shall apply Tribal Law and the terms of this Agreement.\" (Williams Agr. 9; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 9.) Similarly, the Mwethuku Arbitration Agreement requires the arbitrator to \"apply the laws of the Chippewa Cree Tribe and the terms of this Agreement.\" (Mwethuku Agr. 6.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Gibbs Arbitration Agreement, worded slightly differently, states that it \"shall be governed by Tribal law. The parties additionally agree to look to the Federal Arbitration Act and judicial interpretations thereof for guidance.\" (Gibbs Agr. 9.) In contrast to the Haynes Defendants' assertions otherwise, the fact that this agreement merely \"look[s]\" to the FAA for \"guidance\" supports the conclusion that the Gibbs Arbitration Agreement attempts to make the FAA optional, rather than mandatory. (Gibbs Agr. 9.) All Arbitration Agreements also allow borrowers some choice of venue to pursue any dispute, \"provided that this accommodation ... shall not be construed ... to allow for the application of any law other than [Tribal law].\" (Gibbs Agr. 7; Williams Agr. 9; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 9; Mwethuku Agr. 6.) These provisions plainly disavow the application of federal law, running afoul of the prospective waiver doctrine.\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081072\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/666/#p671\">\n     811 F.3d at 675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     40\n    </footnotemark>\n    Also, the Arbitration Agreements authorize the arbitrator to \"award all remedies available under [Tribal law], whether at law or in equity.\" (Gibbs Agr. 8; Williams Agr. 9; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 9; Mwethuku Agr. 6.) The absence of any reference to awarding remedies under state or federal law supports\n    the inference that the Arbitration Agreements sought to exclude any state or federal remedy, unless separately authorized by Tribal law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276749\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/330/#p334\">\n     856 F.3d at 335-36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    These provisions within the Arbitration Agreements plainly support a finding that the Arbitration Agreements sought to prospectively exclude the application of federal law.

As in\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    , the Court considers the context of the Loan Contracts overall to consider the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreements within them.\n    <footnotemark>\n     42\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court easily concludes that the Loan Contracts attempt to disavow the application of any state and federal law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    As in\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    , the Contracts expressly disavow and sometimes contain purported waivers of the application of any state law. (Gibbs Agr. 1-2; Williams Agr. 1-2, 10; Edwards Agr. 1, 9; Inscho Agr. 1-2, 10; Mwethuku Agr. 1, 7.) As to federal law, several provisions appear to disavow its application. As did the Dillon Contract, all Contracts include a \"Truth in Lending Disclosure\" but expressly provides that the inclusion of the disclosure does not constitute \"consent\" to any \"application of state or federal law.\" (Gibbs Agr. 2; Williams Agr. 2; Edwards Agr. 2; Inscho Agr. 2; Mwethuku Agr. 1.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Mwethuku Contract expressly requires Mwethuku to \"agree that no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this Agreement, its enforcement or interpretation.\" (Mwethuku Agr. 1.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Similarly, the four other Agreements warn the borrower that the loan \"is subject to and governed by Tribal law and not the law of [the borrower's] resident state.\" (Gibbs Agr. 1 (capitalization altered); Williams Agr. 1 (capitalization altered); Edwards Agr. 1 (capitalization altered); Inscho Agr. 1 (capitalization altered).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The \"Governing Law\" provisions in four Contracts state that Tribal law governs each Contract, and that the lender \"may choose to voluntarily use certain federal laws as guidelines for the provision of services. Such voluntary use does not represent acquiescence of the [Tribe] to any federal law.\" (Gibbs Agr. 7; Williams Agr. 8; Edwards Agr. 7-8; Inscho Agr. 8.) The Governing Law provision in the Mwethuku Agreement states that the Loan Contract is \"governed by the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States of America and the laws of the Chippewa Cree Tribe,\" implicitly disavowing any other aspects of the Constitution or federal or state law. (Mwethuku Agr. 6.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Other aspects of the Loan Agreements evince an attempt to disavow the application of federal law. While all of the Arbitration Agreements within the Contracts provide an opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, a borrower that opts out may only bring claims within the Tribal court system and under Tribal law. (Gibbs Agr. 6-7; Williams Agr. 7-8; Edwards Agr. 7; Inscho Agr. 7-8; Mwethuku Agr. 5.) And though arbitrators would apply the standard policies and procedures of the selected arbitration firm, the Arbitration Agreements state that, should any conflict arise between federal rules and Tribal law, Tribal law controls. (Gibbs Agr. 7; Williams Agr. 8; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 9; Mwethuku Agr. 6.) This language constitutes the kind of \"conundrum\" the Fourth Circuit found troubling in\n    <em>\n     Hayes.\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081072\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/666/#p671\">\n     811 F.3d at 673\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Finally, four Contracts provide that any challenge to the arbitration decision must be brought within the Tribal court system, and would be evaluated pursuant to Tribal law, not federal or state law, or even standard arbiter rules. (Gibbs Agr. 8; Williams Agr. 9; Edwards Agr. 8; Inscho Agr. 9-10.) The Mwethuku Arbitration Agreement does not outline any procedure for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision.

The Loan Contracts, according to Plaintiffs, violate Virginia usury laws because all Contracts charge an interest rate that exceed Virginia's statutory limit of 12%.

First, Plaintiffs plainly allege that they paid interest on loans in excess of 12%, citing interest rates as high as 448%. Plaintiffs allege that the Haynes Defendants, Plain Green, and Great Plains did not have a \"consumer finance license when they made the loans to Plaintiffs; nor did they attempt to obtain such a license.\" (Compl. \u00b6 123.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The Complaint includes sufficient facts in support of Plaintiffs' contention that the Haynes Defendants collected or received payments on the loans, including interest payments. According to Plaintiffs, Haynes Investments received 1% of the revenue collected on the loans. Sovereign Business Solutions received 15% interest \"on the outstanding advances on the line of credit, as well as a security interest in the loans in the event of default.\" (Compl. \u00b6 61.) The Court draws the reasonable inference in Plaintiffs' favor, as it must, that the loan repayments provided the funding to repay the 15% interest due to Sovereign Business Solutions. For purposes of the Motion to Dismiss, the Court readily infers that Haynes, as the owner and managing partner of Haynes Investments and the creator of Sovereign Business Solutions, ultimately received proceeds from these loan repayments through both partnerships. And though these allegations pertain largely to the Haynes Defendants' credit agreements with Plain Green, and not Great Plains, the Court concludes-for purposes of the present Motion to Dismiss-that Plaintiffs adequately plead facts in support of construing the lending operation as a single entity under RICO, meaning the claims may proceed as to both Plain Green and Great Plains.\n    <footnotemark>\n     48\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Next, for the reasons articulated above,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.B.2, the Haynes Defendants' choice of law arguments cannot prevail. According to the Haynes Defendants, the Loan Agreements' express adoption of Tribal law constitutes a valid choice of law provision that precludes the application of Virginia law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     49\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court considers\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    instructive on this point.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081072\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/666/#p671\">\n     811 F.3d 666\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276749\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/330/#p334\">\n     856 F.3d 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Just as the Arbitration Agreements cannot prospectively waive federal law in these circumstances, the Loan Contracts as a whole cannot prospectively waive federal law. Because the choice of law provisions throughout the Loan Contracts are unenforceable, the Haynes Defendants cannot rely on them for their state-law related arguments, either.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the Haynes Defendants collected or received payments on loans that violated Virginia's statutory limits as part of their involvement with the alleged RICO enterprise, which implicates both Plain Green and Great Plains.

And the Complaint plainly states that Sovereign Business Solutions-wholly controlled by Haynes-derived income from the alleged enterprise, in the form of interest payments on the principal it advanced to Plain Green. (Compl. \u00b6 61 (citing February 2013 Credit and Security Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 3.3, 3.7).) The Court draws the reasonable inference that the collection of unlawful debt funded the interest payments, so that the Complaint plausibly alleges facts adequate to support Plaintiffs' allegation that the Haynes Defendants derived income through the collection of unlawful debt. Plaintiffs also plausibly allege a similar scheme as to Great Plains as part of the unlawful Tribal lending scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    As such, Plaintiffs meet their Rule 12(b)(6) burden to allege plausible facts supporting their contention that the Haynes Defendants derived income through the collection of unlawful debt.\n    <footnotemark>\n     53\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Plaintiffs also allege facts that the Haynes Defendants used the unlawfully obtained income to further invest in and support the operation. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Haynes Investments increased its line of credit from $ 2,000,000 to $ 20,000,000, \"[d]ue to the success of the operation and the returns it earned.\" (Compl. \u00b6 51.) The Court makes the reasonable inference, as it must at this procedural stage, that Haynes Investments increased its line of credit using income derived through the collection of the unlawful debt. Haynes later created Sovereign Business Solutions to increase his investment in the enterprise, creating a $ 15,000,000 line of credit. The Court reasonably infers that Haynes funded Sovereign Business Solutions's line of credit using funds that Haynes obtained from Haynes Investments. And although these allegations pertain to Plain Green specifically, Plaintiffs who entered into Loan Contracts with Great Plains (Williams, Edwards, and Inscho) may proceed with this claim because the Court, as it must at this procedural stage, favorably construes both Plain Green and Great Plain as members of the unlawful Tribal lending operation for purposes of RICO.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Plaintiffs' allegations satisfy all prongs of the \u00a7 1962(a) analysis.

As discussed at length above, Plaintiffs contend that Haynes helped design and implement the Tribal lending business. And by virtue of funding Plain Green, and increasing its investment in the enterprise, the Haynes Defendants essentially conducted the affairs of the alleged enterprise. Put plainly, the enterprise could not exist or grow without funding. Haynes controlled the amount of funding Plain Green had, thus controlling the size of the business. Finally, Haynes \"played an integral role in helping\" both Plain Green and Great Plains secure a method, via the ACH network, to collect on the loans. (Compl. \u00b6 65.) Haynes acted on behalf of both Plain Green and Great Plains when he met with multiple banks and identifying various potential partners over the course of a year beginning in 2013.
