(Docket No. 11 at p. 2; Docket No. 117, Ex. 3 at p. 2.) To accomplish these ends, PRIDCO maintains an infrastructure development program, and facilities for lease or sale to qualified investors. (Docket No. 117, Ex. 3 at p. 2.) The property, which PRIDCO acquired in 1964, is among these facilities.

(Docket No. 101, Ex. 6 at p. 12.) One of the four PRASA wells is located adjacent to the southern edge of the property (hereinafter, \"Maunabo well\"). (Docket No. 101, Ex. 14 at p. 17.) Between 2001 and 2004, PRASA detected volatile organic compounds (\"VOC\"), including trichloroethylene (\"TCE\") and cis-1, 2-dichloroethene (\"cis-1, 2-DCE\"), in the public water supply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 101, Ex. 3 at p. 23.)

(Docket No. 101, Ex. 6 at pp. 12-13.) The EPA confirmed that the groundwater from the Maunabo well is contaminated primarily with cis-1, 2-DCE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 26. After further investigation, the EPA discovered three plumes of contaminated groundwater throughout the Municipality of Maunabo. (Docket No. 101, Ex. 5 at p. 171.) The three plumes are referred to as: (1) cis-1, 2-DCE, (2) PCE, and (3) 1, 1-DCE. (Docket No. 101, Ex. 5 at p. 171.) The cis-1, 2-DCE plume is located below the property, \"flow[ing] southwest toward [a] river, but is intercepted by [the Maunabo well].\" (Docket No. 101, Ex. 6 at p. 26; Docket No. 101, Ex. 3 at p. 14.) The PCE plume is located south of the PRIDCO property near a former sugar mill. (Docket No. 101, Ex. 4 at p. 18.) The 1, 1-DCE plume is located northwest of the property. (Docket No. 101, Ex. 6 at p. 12.) Together, the three plumes comprise the Maunabo Area Groundwater Contamination Superfund Site (hereinafter, \"the site\"). (Docket No. 101, Ex. 6 at p. 12.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List, a compilation of the most contaminated sites in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The EPA issued the Record of Decision (\"ROD\") in 2012, setting forth the \"factual and legal basis for selecting the [applicable] remedy.\" (Docket No. 139, Ex. 2 at p. 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remedy selected by the EPA incorporates air sparging for the cis-1, 2-DCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   plume and monitored natural attenuation for the PCE and 1, 1-DCE plumes.
