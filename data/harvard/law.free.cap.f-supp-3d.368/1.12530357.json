NABA seeks declaratory and injunctive relief based on alleged constitutional and statutory violations arising from defendants' border wall preparation and law enforcement activities at NABA's National Butterfly Center (\"Butterfly Center\"), which is located near the United States-Mexico border in South Texas.
