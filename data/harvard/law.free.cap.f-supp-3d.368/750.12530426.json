PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge\n   Defendants Alkermes plc (\"Alkermes\"), Richard F. Pops, its Chief Executive Officer, and James M. Frates, its Chief Financial Officer, move to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Lead Plaintiff Local 731 I.B. of T. Private Scavenger and Garage Attendants Pension Trust Fund (\"Local 731\") moves to strike various exhibits appended to Defendants' motion. For the reasons that follow, Local 731's motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part, and Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The allegations in the Complaint are presumed true for purposes of this motion. Alkermes is a global pharmaceutical company that markets and sells a product trade-named Vivitrol, an injectable, extended-release version of an opioid dependence medication called naltrexone. This securities fraud class action concerns statements that Defendants made touting Vivitrol's sales growth and its effectiveness in treating opioid dependence. Local 731 claims that while Defendants crafted a narrative of organic, word-of-mouth growth in SEC filings and on investor conference calls, they concealed from investors a calculated and sustained campaign to market Vivitrol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Starting in June 2017, the truth began to emerge through a steady cascade of news articles that shed a critical light on Alkermes' sales practices, academic studies that reached tepid conclusions as to Vivitrol's relative effectiveness, and revelations of governmental scrutiny of Vivitrol. Based on a progressive decline in Alkermes' stock price, plaintiffs assert claims against all Defendants for violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 20(a) claims against Pops and Frates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Opioid Dependence Treatments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since the 1980s, naltrexone has existed to treat opioid dependence. (Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 34 (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.) In particular, naltrexone works by competing for the receptors in the brain that cause the \"high\" that one experiences from using opioids. However, several aspects of naltrexone contributed to its sparse use by the medical community. First, patients must endure a days-long detoxification process before beginning treatment. Second, naltrexone only provides a brief period of relief from opioid cravings and must be taken every day. Third, because it does not completely block the targeted brain receptors, its effects may be overcome with a sufficiently large quantity of opioids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Alkermes sought to improve on naltrexone by developing Vivitrol, an injectable version of naltrexone that extends relief from opioid cravings for 28 days. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 61.) Although Vivitrol obviates the need to take naltrexone every day, it functions in the same way as naltrexone. Thus, it is subject to the limitations that prospective patients must detoxify first before beginning treatment and that Vivitrol's salutary effects may be overcome by large quantities of opioids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Other prominent treatments for opioid dependence include methadone and Suboxone (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , buprenorphine ), both of which\n   contain opioids. In contrast to \"antagonist\" treatments such as naltrexone and Vivitrol, these \"agonist\" treatments work by tricking the opioid receptors in the brain into believing that it has received the abused opioid. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.) This quality allows prospective patients to wean themselves off opioids without experiencing cravings or opiate withdrawal and without needing to detoxify before they begin treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Increase in Vivitrol Revenues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved Vivitrol for treating opioid dependence. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) At that time, Vivitrol yielded anemic revenues for Alkermes because of naltrexone's many known limitations relative to other available treatments. (Compl. \u00b6 32.) Recognizing that the medical community did not hold naltrexone in high regard, Defendants focused their efforts on attempting to convince drug courts, prison wardens, and law enforcement officials that methadone and Suboxone were less effective than Vivitrol because they contained opioids. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-55.) Specifically, Local 731 alleges that Alkermes circulated misleading and deceptive information that only highlighted methadone and Suboxone's drawbacks while giving short shrift to their benefits. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40, 49-50.) Along similar lines, Alkermes routinely represented to the policymaking community that methadone and Suboxone were themselves addictive and abused, just like other opioids. (Compl. \u00b6 51.) According to Local 731, Defendants took these actions, despite scientific data supporting the use of methadone and Suboxone in treating opioid addiction. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 46.) And Local 731 claims that because this non-medical audience lacked a sophisticated understanding of treating opioid addition, Defendants saw these entities and individuals as easy marks for misinformation. (Compl. \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Even though Defendants lacked scientific evidence demonstrating Vivitrol's superiority over methadone and Suboxone, their allegedly aggressive and fraudulent marketing campaign paid off. A survey of criminal justice representatives found that most favored Vivitrol over methadone and Suboxone. (Compl. \u00b6 55.) And Vivitrol sales rapidly increased starting in February 2015, eventually supplanting the sale of other products as the most important driver of Alkermes' revenue growth. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-40.) In particular, between February 24, 2015 and November 14, 2017 (the \"Class Period\"), Vivitrol sales as a proportion of Alkermes' total revenues trended upward from over 20% starting in 2Q 2015 to over 30% starting in 1Q 2017. (Compl. \u00b6 39.) Ultimately, Vivitrol's modest net sales of $ 28.9 million in FY 2011 ballooned to $ 209 million in FY 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Alleged Misstatements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Local 731 claims that Defendants made a series of materially misleading misstatements in investor and analyst calls between September 17, 2015 and June 6, 2017, as well as in Alkermes' Forms 10-K filed on February 24, 2015, February 25, 2016, and February 17, 2017. These misstatements, which generally relate to the reasons for Vivitrol's increased revenues and Vivitrol's efficacy, may be categorized as follows. First, Local 731 alleges that Defendants mischaracterized the adoption of Vivitrol as \"organic\" and \"self-propagating\" without revealing the role that their deceptive marketing and lobbying tactics played in driving Vivitrol's growth. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56, 83-101.) Second, Local 731 avers that Defendants misrepresented Vivitrol's efficacy by guaranteeing that patients would not relapse for 28 days, despite having access to an in-house study finding that 30% of patients had relapsed\n   within 28 days and a retrospective study revealing that several Vivitrol patients had overdosed within that same period. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-72, 102-103, 106-107, 112-119.) Finally, Local 731 asserts that Defendants falsely claimed that only Vivitrol-and not methadone or Suboxone-could lead to a drug-free life, even though they lacked scientific data to substantiate that claim. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-81, 104-105, 108-111.) Local 731 posits that these misstatements artificially inflated Alkermes' stock price to $ 80.69 per share on December 28, 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The first rumblings that something was amiss came on June 11, 2017, when the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   published an article exposing Alkermes' deceptive and aggressive efforts to market Vivitrol by disparaging its competitors without any scientific basis. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 120, 151.) Over the next two days,\n   <em>\n    NPR\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    The Fix\n   </em>\n   followed on the heels of the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   , further highlighting Alkermes' attempts to suppress the use of methadone or Suboxone by lobbying for increased regulation of those drugs. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-122, 151-154.) After this initial wave of disclosures, Alkermes' stock price dropped from a closing price of $ 61.66 the Friday before the news broke to $ 57.29. (Compl. \u00b6 154.) Alkermes' stock price gradually slid over the next few months following a steady stream of disclosures of governmental scrutiny into Vivitrol and damning information regarding Vivitrol's efficacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For example, Local 731 alleges that\n   <em>\n    ProPublica\n   </em>\n   published an article on June 27, 2017 revealing Alkermes' possession of non-public, internal data showing that nearly 30% of patients relapsed during the 28-day treatment period. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-68, 123, 155.) One month later, Alkermes announced in its second-quarter Form 10-Q that it had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors, seeking documents relating to Vivitrol. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 124, 157.) Subsequently, the\n   <em>\n    Journal of the American Medical Association\n   </em>\n   published a study on October 18, 2017 concluding that Vivitrol was equally as effective as Suboxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from opioid usage. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 78, 125, 159.) Following these disclosures, Senator Kamala Harris announced an investigation into Alkermes' sales practices relating to Vivitrol on November 6, 2017. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60, 126, 161.) Alkermes' stock-price slide was punctuated by a subsequent study published on November 14, 2017 that also found Vivitrol-at best-to be equally effective to Suboxone. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79-80, 127, 163.) That day, Alkermes' stock closed at $ 47.58 per share. (Compl. \u00b6 164.) This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The standard on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is well settled.

Specifically, while investors knew that Alkermes sought to market Vivitrol to the non-medical policymaking community, Defendants characterized that community's growing adoption of Vivitrol to investors as \"organic,\" \"self-propagating,\" and \"very grassroots, viral.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87, 97.) In the same vein, Defendants mused that it \"might be a single sheriff or it might be a single drug court, starts using Vivitrol and they start seeing outcomes and it begins to proliferate\" and that \"other jurisdictions see what is happening and they begin to start pushing for the implementation of Vivitrol programs on their own without our help.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 85, 93.) Defendants further gushed that \"[w]hat's most exciting is how an expanding array of states, counties, and municipalities are beginning to integrate the use of Vivitrol into their criminal justice and healthcare systems,\" and that \"what's cool is the way these are beginning to burgeon is because - not Alkermes people out in those states necessarily pushing all these programs.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91, 97.) Finally, Local 731 points to Defendants' representations in its 2014, 2015, and 2016 Forms 10-K that Alkermes engaged in \"customary pharmaceutical company practices\" in promoting its products. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83, 89, 100.) On the whole, Local 731 submits that these statements are misleading because Defendants failed to disclose their aggressive and deceptive marketing practices and that those practices drove the increased demand in Vivitrol.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    For the most part, these statements are non-actionable.

In particular, Alkermes' Forms 10-K state that it \"use[s] customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our product and to educate physicians,\n    <em>\n     such as sales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, selling initiatives, public relations and other methods\n    </em>\n    .\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83, 89 (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 100 (omitting \"public relations\" but containing an otherwise identical statement).) Against this backdrop, the challenged statements cannot be said to be untrue or materially misleading.

Instead, the thrust of Local 731's contention is that by speaking about the sources of\n    Vivitrol's increasing sales, Defendants had a duty to fully and accurately disclose the facts pertaining to its marketing of Vivitrol to stakeholders in the criminal justice system and the role that those efforts played in Vivitrol's financial success. Although Defendants correctly point out that they\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    attributed the source of Vivitrol's financial success to their focus on criminal justice programs,\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Local 731 alleges that they failed to disclose the true (and improper) nature of those efforts.

According to Local 731, these statements are misleading because Vivitrol's FDA labels warrant that it only offers the\n    <em>\n     possibility\n    </em>\n    of preventing relapse. Local 731 also points to an in-house study presented at a non-public April 2014 conference purportedly concluding that Vivitrol had a 30% relapse rate during a 28-day period. Finally, it cites a post-Class Period study from March 2018 concluding that between October 2010 and March 2016, Alkermes reported to the FDA that several Vivitrol patients had overdosed on opioids within 28 days after receiving a dose of Vivitrol.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    However, the study that Local 731 characterizes as finding a 30% relapse rate yields, at best, a marginal inference of falsity. The study-funded by Alkermes and involving Alkermes-affiliated doctors-was discussed in a PowerPoint presented to participants of an April 2014 conference closed to the general public. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.) As relevant here, the study found that \"nearly 30% of Vivitrol users never took their second dose of Vivitrol.\" (Compl. \u00b6 68.) Although the Complaint continues that \"[t]his means that a significant number of Vivitrol patients relapsed within the 28-day time period that Defendants falsely claimed was a window where relapse would not happen,\" (Compl. \u00b6 68), it is not immediately apparent why that must be the case,\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pehlivanian\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289746\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/628/#p643\">\n     153 F.Supp.3d at 645\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (explaining that \"the Second Circuit has repeatedly indicated that plaintiffs cannot simply assert that a statement is false-'they must demonstrate with specificity why ... that is so' \" (citation omitted) (alteration in original) ). But even assuming the correctness of Local 731's interpretation of the study's findings, it \"took place from 2011 to 2013 across 32 treatment centers in the U.S.\" (Compl. \u00b6 70.) It is well-settled that the securities laws impose liability for misstatements only when \"an alleged material misstatement was false\n    <em>\n     at the time it was made\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     In re Lululemon Sec.

Thus, whether this study allows any meaningful inferences to be drawn as to the veracity of Defendants' statements made at least two years later is questionable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    More fundamentally, however, this Court disagrees with the assertion that these challenged statements constitute ironclad guarantees of Vivitrol's effectiveness in perpetuity such that the existence of incidental overdoses while undergoing treatment with Vivitrol renders Defendants' statements false or misleading. To be sure, Defendants' use of phrases such as \"will not\" or \"cannot\" implies-read literally and in a vacuum-some assurance against relapse. However, the remarks surrounding the purportedly false or misleading statements reveal that the challenged statements explained how Defendants intended or expected Vivitrol to work-a reading corroborated by Defendants' repeated references to Vivitrol's FDA label.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pehlivanian\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289746\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/628/#p643\">\n     153 F.Supp.3d at 647-48\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (reiterating that \"to be actionable, 'the representation must be one of existing fact, and not merely an expression of opinion, expectation[,] or declaration of intention' \" (citation omitted) ).

Further, in discussing Vivitrol's growing adoption, Defendants remarked that \"it's difficult to overstate how different treatment with Vivitrol is in opioid dependence compared to treating somebody with Suboxone or methadone, where you maintain the patient's physical dependence on the opioid.\" (Compl. \u00b6 108.) Local 731 contends that these statements were misleading because Defendants ignored that methadone and Suboxone also enabled patients to live a drug-free life. In addition, Local 731 contends that Defendants lacked a scientific basis for their statements because no studies had compared Vivitrol's efficacy relative to its competitors at the time Defendants made them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The statements that Vivitrol is \"for those patients who want to live a drug-free life\" or that it gives patients \"an opportunity to get to a drug-free life\" are vague, aspirational statements that do not give rise to a violation of the securities laws.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Altayyar v.

Moreover, the mere fact that Vivitrol's competitors\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    enable patients to achieve a drug-free life or that they are also presumably for those who desire a drug-free life simply does not bear on the veracity of Defendants' statements about Vivitrol.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rombach v.

To that end, the Complaint alleges that various high-level Alkermes officers-including Pops and Frates-received over $ 103 million in gross proceeds from stock sales during the Class Period. (Compl. \u00b6 130.) Specifically, Pops' sale of 501,250 shares between September 17, 2014 and November 2, 2017 generated $ 28,210,114 in total proceeds, of which $ 15,881,295 were net profits. (Compl. \u00b6 132.) Frates' sale of 214,663 shares between March 10, 2015 and November 8, 2017 generated $ 12,979,557 in total proceeds, of which $ 8,251,808 were net profits. (Compl. \u00b6 133.) These sales, which include vested shares available to be sold, represent 12.2% of Pops' holdings and 26.1% of Frates' holdings. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 132-133.) The parties spar over the import of Defendants' trading during the Class Period, including the extent to which their holdings changed during the Class Period as compared to an immediately preceding control period, the extent to which sales were conducted pursuant to discretionary Rule 10b-5 trading plans, and precisely when the Defendants entered into those plans. But in light of the determination that only Frates' July 28, 2016 misstatement relating to the source of Vivitrol's growing revenue is actionable, this Court need not enter the fray.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    As relevant here, the Complaint indicates that only two officers and directors-neither of which are Pops or Frates-had even sold Alkermes stock in July or August of 2016. The timing, magnitude, and nature of these sales do not establish that they were unusual, suspicious, or otherwise suggestive of a concrete and personal benefit as a result of the alleged fraud. First, Elliot Ehrich, an Alkermes officer, sold 800 shares on July 28, 2016 for $ 41,456 in total proceeds and 34,399 shares on July 27, 2016 for $ 1,787,028 in total proceeds. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 130.) But these sales both occurred before Frates' July 28, 2016 misstatement, undermining the inference that they constitute the fruits of a fraudulent statement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ong v.

Second, Paul Mitchell, an Alkermes director, sold 2,000 shares on July 5, 2016 for $ 91,620 in total proceeds and another 2,000 shares on August 4, 2016 for $ 98,960 in total proceeds. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 130.) However, these sales are part of a consistent pattern of sales of 1,500-2,000 shares at the beginning of each month.

Local 731 points to two pieces of information to support an inference of scienter. First, it alleges that Alkermes' Director of Public Relations acknowledged the company's 2016 circulation of a white paper attacking Suboxone. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50; Birnbach Decl. Ex. D.) Second, Local 731 avers that sometime between 2011 and 2014, the former Secretary of Maryland's Department of Health and Hygiene called a meeting with Alkermes to \"tell the company to 'back off talking down methadone and [Suboxone ]' to legislators.\" (Compl. \u00b6 52 (alteration in original);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 53.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    But there is no suggestion that Frates knew of or had access to the white paper or the meeting with the Secretary-for example, by making specific statements as to the white paper or the meeting, or being present at meetings where these matters are alleged to have been discussed.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Christine Asia Co. v.
