A Supreme Court case decided in April 2018 necessitates reexamination of whether Petitioner was sentenced pursuant to an unconstitutionally vague and/or inapplicable provision of federal criminal law. As explained below, this new case law requires invalidation of 60 months of Petitioner's 420-month sentence of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Petitioner's Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Federal Sentence.

Petitioner's Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The murder-for-hire plot is summarized in the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 7 (sealed), PSR \u00b6\u00b6 25-45.) Briefly, co-Defendant and business owner Julius Frederick Schill sought Defendant's assistance in killing Wilbur Constable, the fianc\u00e9 of Schill's secretary Asher, a woman whom Schill wished to pursue romantically. Defendant traveled from Las Vegas to Tustin, California, met with Schill, cashed a check given to him by Schill, and then met with another man (co-Defendant Yoon) in order to outsource the \"hit\" to Yoon. Defendant went back to Las Vegas, but returned shortly thereafter to again meet with Yoon to help plan the \"hit.\" The plan included damaging Constable's car, leaving a business card with the information of the \"responsible party,\" and then luring the unsuspecting Constable to a parking lot behind an office park complex, ostensibly so that the responsible party could pay him for the damage to his car. Although suspicious, Constable went to the parking lot. Constable was himself armed with a handgun, but he was unable to successfully defend himself. Yoon and two others (also co-Defendants) met Constable in the parking lot, beat him with baseball bats, shot him in the back of the head, and left him for dead. Yoon, believing\n   Constable was dead, reported to Defendant by telephone that he had \"hit a homerun.\" Surprisingly, Constable survived the assault. Unsurprisingly, he was severely injured and hospitalized. When Schill learned from Asher that Constable was still alive, he called Defendant in Las Vegas, who then called Yoon to tell him Constable had survived. In formulating a plan to finish the job, Yoon again telephoned Defendant. The revised plan fell through, and the present prosecution eventually ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 24, 1992, after a twenty-one day jury trial, Petitioner was convicted on Counts 1 through 9 of the Second Superseding Indictment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CR Doc. 262.) Specifically, Petitioner was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire (Count 1), use of a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A) (Count 2), and seven counts of use of interstate commerce facilities related to murder-for-hire (Counts 3 through 9).

Defendant was charged with and convicted of counts that require no more than the existence of a conspiracy, an overt act in furtherance thereof, the requisite intent to kill a person in exchange for something of value, and interstate travel or use of a facility of interstate commerce (such as use of the telephone). Of course, it may sound counter-intuitive to suggest that, when using these phrases in their ordinary sense, that \"murder for hire\" or is not a \"crime of violence.\" However, as noted earlier,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201958\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not criminalize murder for hire; rather, \u00a7 1958 criminalizes the \"travel in interstate ... commerce\" or \"[u]se [of] the mail or any facility of interstate ... commerce,\" where such travel or such use are coupled with the requisite intent that a murder be committed in exchange for something of value.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201958\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In prosecuting violations\n   of \u00a7 1958, the Government need not prove that any person used any degree of force or that any person was injured as a result. Indeed, \u00a7 1958 has varying degrees of punishment based upon whether or not injury resulted and whether death resulted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201958\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (specifying a maximum sentence of 10 years where no injury results, a maximum sentence of 20 years if injury results, and where death results, a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or the death penalty).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Government argues that it is not a \"realistic possibility\" that it would initiate a prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 1958 based only on overt acts that do not involve the use of force, such as meetings between co-conspirators, telephone calls, and the exchange of money.

Under \u00a7 1958, because of the nature of the conduct it criminalizes, it is likely that prosecutions would be undertaken of cases in which the intended victim was not subjected to force, and where the offenders did not attempt or threaten the use of force. This is because \u00a7 1958 criminalizes the actions leading up to the carrying out of a murder for hire, and failed conspiracies-where no one was killed or injured-would be subject to prosecution. By setting forth the three tiers of mandatory minimum sentences, \u00a7 1958 itself impliedly contemplates that offenders would be prosecuted even when no injury results. This case is not the case of the mere \"application of legal imagination to [statutory language]\" that the Supreme Court cautioned against in\n   <em>\n    Duenas-Alvarez.\n   </em>\n   Many actions leading up to a murder for hire are themselves crimes, and can include the payment of money and the cashing of a check, interstate travel to meet with co-conspirators, and telephone conversations between co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. All of these actions are present in this case and all of these actions fall squarely within the range of conduct that \u00a7 1958 is intended to criminalize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At least two other courts have recently concluded that a violation of \u00a7 1958 is a not a \"crime of violence\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
