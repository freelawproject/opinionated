Even the leading case that Ingenuity relies on,\n   <em>\n    Jonathan H. v.

'bringing an action' is not an exotic species of restraint mandating that the operative statute of limitations governs only claims that initiate a lawsuit, but rather is a conventional phrase that establishes a conventional limitations period-and federal law dictates that such a conventional limitations period constrains any cause of action that falls within its purview, whether brought as an original claim or as a counter- or cross-claim.\" R. &amp; R. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The D.C.

In doing so, it explained that the district court need not apply the relation-back doctrine because the counterclaim was timely and then specified the proper statute of limitations:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1168 n.6. Section 1415(f)(1) states that \"[a]n action under this section may not be brought after\" either six or three years. That is, even though the statute of limitations referenced the\n   <em>\n    bringing\n   </em>\n   of an action, the D.C. Circuit determined that the limitations period applied to counterclaims. So too here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This conclusion tracks with the rest of the statutory provisions. The phrase \"bring an action\" is used several times in section 1415(i). Section 1415(i)(1) states that a hearing officer's determination \"shall be final\" unless a party \"bring[s] an action\" under section 1415(i)(2). And section 1415(i)(2)(A) gives parties \"the right to bring a civil action\" challenging the hearing officer's determination. \"One ordinarily assumes 'that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.' \"\n   <em>\n    Util.

In other words, a party would not have the right to bring a\n   <em>\n    counterclaim\n   </em>\n   to challenge a determination by a hearing officer under the IDEA.

True, an action is \"brought\" when a plaintiff files a complaint-certainly section 1415(i)(2)(B) would apply to a complaint-but the court gave little explanation for why it would not also apply to a counterclaim.

The court expressed concern that IDEA litigants, who had partially succeeded at the administrative level, would file complaints \"even when they otherwise would countenance the administrative judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897341\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/527/#p529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897341\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/527/#p529\">\n    at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They would be motivated by a fear that their adversaries would file their own complaints right before the statute of limitations period expired.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897341\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/527/#p529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court thought that \"this would cause unnecessary litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897341\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/527/#p529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But that is not what happened here. Rather, Mr. Lloyd accepted his partial success and sought only attorneys' fees. Compl. at 1. He did not multiply litigation or even challenge the original award. In fact, there is no chance his substantive relief will increase. Rather, he made an ordinary fee request as provided by the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Adopting Ingenuity's position would discourage attorneys' fees actions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3). The purpose of fee shifting statutes is \"to promote citizen enforcement of important federal policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trustees of Hotel &amp; Rest. Emps. Local 25 v. JPR, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235416,1235850,3712587,3712212\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/136/794/\">\n    136 F.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801 (D.C. Cir. 1998). But under Ingenuity's reading of section 1415(i)(2)(B), successful IDEA litigants would hesitate to bring actions for attorneys' fees because doing so would allow their adversaries to challenge the hearing officer's determination, essentially re-opening the otherwise final adjudication, regardless of the typical 90-day limitations period. A prevailing party would\n   risk his prevailing party status just by seeking attorneys' fees. Such a rule would frustrate the purpose of IDEA's fee shifting provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Lloyd also suggests that Ingenuity's interpretation would violate the Rules Enabling Act (\"Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Reply at 8. The Rules Enabling Act establishes that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \"shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). According to him, Ingenuity is asking the Court to use the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a) -which allows counterclaims-to lift the statute of limitations in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2)(B). Such a reading, argues Mr. Lloyd, would expand a party's right to appeal under the IDEA and violate the Rules Enabling Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To the extent Ingenuity is suggesting that Rule 13(a) trumps the IDEA's statute of limitations, Mr. Lloyd's response seems right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1419 at 151 (2d ed. 1990) (\"[I]f defendant's claim already is barred when plaintiff brings suit ... the fact that the tardily asserted claim is a compulsory counterclaim does not serve to revive defendant's right to assert it.\"). But Ingenuity did not make this argument to the Magistrate Judge, so the Court need not consider it now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2075\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (D.D.C. 2016) (explaining that failure to present an argument to the Magistrate Judge constitutes waiver).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because Ingenuity's counterclaim is untimely, the last inquiry is whether it can be saved by tolling. In its Objections, Ingenuity offers no reason the statute of limitations should be tolled here, and the Court sees no error in the Magistrate Judge's analysis on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For all these reasons, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Court has federal question jurisdiction over this case.
