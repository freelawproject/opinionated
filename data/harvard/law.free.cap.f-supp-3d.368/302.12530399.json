Levesque was initially hired as the east coast director of SIMNA's Institutional Sales division. He received his offer letter in 2008, by mail, in Massachusetts and continued to work for SIMNA while in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At SIMNA, Levesque reported to Jamie Dorrien-Smith (\"Dorrien-Smith\"), then-CEO of SIMNA, from 2008 to 2012, and then to Karl Dasher (\"Dasher\"), a resident of New York and Georgia, in 2013, after Dasher became the new CEO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 2009 to 2012, Levesque received an annual management bonus ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 350,000. Those management bonuses were consistent with the oral representations made by Dorrien-Smith. That agreement was presumably memorialized in an internal memorandum which has not yet been produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, SIMNA implemented a new incentive compensation plan (\"the 2013 Plan\"). Under the 2013 Plan, employees qualified for two kinds of incentive-based compensation schemes: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative based compensation\n   was further broken down into two components: individual and team. Quantitative compensation was earned when revenues were generated and individual quantitative awards were based on a percentage of the employee's gross sales. By contrast, qualitative compensation was earned at the end of each fiscal year, when the company determined whether the employee had met his or her stated goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under that compensation scheme, SIMNA also had the discretion to defer the team quantitative and qualitative compensations into its Equity Compensation Plan (\"the ECP\"). As part of the ECP, employees were given either an amount of shares in the parent company, Schroders plc (\"a share award\") and/or units in a range of investment products for Schroders plc (\"a fund award\") that was equal to the value of their earned incentive-based compensation that was deferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2014, Dasher allegedly told Levesque that he would not be receiving his customary management bonus for work performed in 2013. Dasher allegedly promised, instead, that Levesque would continue to receive a total compensation package of $ 1.4 million, even if Levesque's commission sales were lower than his 2013 numbers. Shortly thereafter, Levesque began reporting directly to Marc Mayer (\"Mayer\") instead of Dasher. Mayer informed Levesque that he was no longer needed as an Institutional Sales manager but reiterated Dasher's earlier promise of $ 1.4 million in total compensation. Mayer refused to put that agreement in writing and Levesque alleges that he was not compensated as promised for work performed in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2015, Mayer, unbeknownst to Levesque, contacted Allan Conway, the head of Emerging Markets, to discuss transferring Levesque to the Emerging Products division. In 2016, Levesque agreed to the transfer with the understanding that 1) his targeted annual compensation would be between $ 750,000 and $ 1 million and 2) he would be entitled to the quantitative commissions he had already earned for the three-year commission cycle within the Institutional Sales division. In June, 2016, the parties memorialized the terms of Levesque's compensation (\"the 2016 Internal Memorandum\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following his transfer, Levesque avers that SIMNA breached its contractual obligations by failing to pay him: 1) a $ 250,000 management bonus for 2013, 2) a $ 300,000 qualitative bonus for 2013, 3) a $ 367,000 quantitative incentive compensation for work performed in 2016, 4) a $ 500,000 qualitative incentive compensation for work performed in 2016, and 5) a $ 732,000 quantitative incentive compensation to which he would have been entitled had he not been terminated in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Levesque discussed his compensation complaints with several managers and in 2017, Dasher informed him that his Emerging Markets compensation was intended to replace his quantitative compensation previously earned while in Institutional Sales. Levesque then contacted Human Resources but was told to handle the issue directly with Dasher. Shortly thereafter, Levesque was terminated on the basis that his position had been upgraded and moved to the London office. Levesque, who is a British national, was not offered the position and was told to tell his co-workers that he intended to retire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rather, this Court must determine that there is an \"independent basis\" for jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    LaVallee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parrot-Ice Drink Prod. of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9447674\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/193/296/#p300\">\n    193 F.Supp.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300 (D. Mass. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Levesque has demonstrated that Dasher, as SIMNA's CEO, has attempted to participate in the Commonwealth's economic life as a \"primary participant\" in corporate activities.\n   <em>\n    Cossart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p18\">\n    804 F.3d at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the term \"transacting any business\" is construed broadly). Here, Dasher retained and supervised Levesque, had significant business-related communications with him and made promises to him regarding compensation, all while Levesque retained significant Massachusetts clients and operated out of his Massachusetts office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding that a non-resident defendant who unsuccessfully negotiated a contract for sale of Massachusetts land while outside the Commonwealth was sufficient to satisfy the \"transacting any business\" requirement). Thus, because Levesque has demonstrated an independent basis for jurisdiction, the requirements of the long arm statute have been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Due Process Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Specific jurisdiction over a defendant exists if a plaintiff demonstrates a nexus between his claims and the defendant's forum-based activities. In determining whether the requisite nexus is satisfied, the Court evaluates 1) relatedness, 2) purposeful availment and 3) reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    Cossart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p18\">\n    804 F.3d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dasher's actions seem to be the catalyst for this action because he allegedly 1) made oral promises to plaintiff regarding his compensation and 2) retaliated against plaintiff for complaining about his compensation. Thus, relatedness is satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Children's Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556332\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/50/#p60\">\n    432 F.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60-61 (1st Cir. 2005) (the defendant's in-state conduct must form an \"important\" or \"material\" element of proof in the plaintiff's case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, Dasher, as plaintiff's supervisor, 1) knew and approved of plaintiff's Massachusetts-generated business, 2) presumably discussed that business with Levesque, 3) negotiated his compensation with respect to Massachusetts-related business and 4) knew of plaintiff's complaints regarding his unpaid compensation. Because Dasher had repeated contacts with the Commonwealth, it was reasonably foreseeable that he would be subject to the forum state's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, with respect to reasonableness, courts assess 1) the defendant's burden of appearing, 2) the forum state's interest, 3) the plaintiff's interest, 4) the judicial system's interest in obtaining effective resolution and 5) the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\n   <em>\n    Ticketmaster-New York, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alioto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507606\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/201/#p209\">\n    26 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (1st Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dasher has not demonstrated that litigating the suit in Massachusetts presents a \"special or unusual burden\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pritzker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415269\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/42/53/#p64\">\n    42 F.3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (1st Cir. 1994). Moreover, Massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating the dispute because a Massachusetts resident was allegedly injured in Massachusetts and is now claiming relief under Massachusetts law.\n   <em>\n    Ticketmaster-New York, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507606\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/201/#p209\">\n    26 F.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, Levesque resides in Massachusetts and by bringing suit in that forum he is most likely to obtain convenient and effective relief. In fact, because this Court has jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims against SIMNA, effective resolution of the case renders the forum state suitable. Finally, litigation of the suit does not impugn the common interests of all sovereigns with respect to promoting social policies. Thus, on balance, the Court finds that Levesque has alleged facts establishing that Dasher had minimum contacts with Massachusetts such that maintenance of the suit in this forum would not \"offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\".\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    90 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Levesque brought this action in his home state and alleges multiple violations of the Massachusetts Wage Act arising out of a contract negotiated and signed, at least in part, in Massachusetts. The fact that defendants' records are located in New York is an insufficient ground for transferring this case.\n   <em>\n    Blu Homes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kaufmann\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-11418-DJC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203290362\">\n    2011 WL 3290362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D. Mass. July 29, 2011). Finally, unlike\n   <em>\n    Avci\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff was not a resident of Massachusetts and there was little connection between the claim and the forum state, Levesque is a resident of the Commonwealth who conducted most of his SIMNA-related business in this state.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avci\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268389\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/216/#p220\">\n    232 F.Supp.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (D.

Breach of Contract Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants claim that Levesque has no contract claim with respect to the $ 250,000 management bonus because that amount is not reflected in the 2008 Employment Agreement or any subsequent writing, including the internal email that documents the parties' oral conversation regarding his annual, discretionary management bonus. Moreover, defendants argue that there is no viable contract claim for a bonus that is discretionary. Plaintiff responds that SIMNA failed to pay all commissions due under the 2013 Plan and the 2016 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In limiting his claims to compensation that stem from the 2013 Plan and the 2016 Agreement, plaintiff effectively concedes his breach of contract claim with respect to his $ 250,000 management and $ 300,000 qualitative bonuses. As defendants aver, the 2013 Plan, which governs the contract action 1) was signed by all parties, 2) states that it supersedes any prior agreement with respect to sales incentive compensation and 3) permits only written modifications. Plaintiff has produced no evidence of written modifications to the contrary, partial performance or estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Tierney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Capricorn Inv'rs, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1110585\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/189/629/\">\n    189 A.D.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20N.Y.S.2d%20700\">\n    592 N.Y.S.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (holding that when a written contract provides that it can be amended only in writing, an oral modification of that agreement, such as is alleged here, is unenforceable absent partial performance or estoppel).

Assuming that the award at issue is a protected \"commission\" under the Act (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the award was \"earned\"), the Court finds that the prescribed withholding of earned commissions constitutes a special contract in violation of the Act.\n   <em>\n    Stanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226901\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/621/5/#p14\">\n    621 F.Supp.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, that contractual term contradicts the terms of Para. 8.1 of the 2013 Plan which provides that an employee who is not terminated for good cause will be paid his\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Individual Quantitative Bonus Award for any complete quarter of the Plan Year ... and shall be entitled to any pro rata Individual Quantitative Bonus Award for any partial quarter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, assuming, as plaintiff contends, that sales-related pay was calculable based on his percentage of sales for work performed in 2016, such compensation falls within the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that similar to the claims in\n   <em>\n    Israel\n   </em>\n   , Levesque has sufficiently pled that he earned commissions on sales that occurred in 2017, prior to his termination.\n   <em>\n    Israel\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-11914-ADB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201026416\">\n    2017 WL 1026416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (finding that a delay in the final calculation of commissions does not mean that they fall outside the scope of the Wage Act). Thus, the fact that the calculation for payment may have occurred in a quarter after Levesque left defendants' employment is immaterial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201026416\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, the motion to dismiss will be allowed except as it relates to the $ 367,000 and $ 732,000 quantitative awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants contend that there is no evidence that they knew plaintiff was asserting his rights under the Wage Act. The Court disagrees. Plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to infer that SIMNA was on notice of his claim for compensation as soon as he complained to CEO Dasher, his direct supervisor, the chief of staff for the Asset Management Group and the Head of Human Resources of the Group, prior to his termination. Moreover, defendants' argument that causation cannot be inferred based on the temporal proximity between the alleged complaints and the ultimate\n   termination under\n   <em>\n    Mole\n   </em>\n   is unavailing.\n   <em>\n    Mole\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183073\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/442/582/\">\n    442 Mass. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=814%20N.E.2d%20329\">\n    814 N.E.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Notwithstanding the fact that the retaliation claim in\n   <em>\n    Mole\n   </em>\n   did not arise under the Wage Act, plaintiff has met his burden.

He alleges that 1) he was 60 years of age at the time of his termination, 2) he was qualified for his position as one of the top two performing salespersons in his organization, 3) he was actually terminated and 4) at the time of his termination, his performance was better than or equal to the performance of younger employees who were retained and now perform his job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Del Valle-Santa\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Servicios Legas De Puerto Rico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357094\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/127/#p129\">\n    804 F.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 129 (1st Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Coogan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    FMR, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265401\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/296/#p304\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (D.

They have not, however, demonstrated that Levesque must identify specific individuals who were retained to satisfy this prong, and thus, plaintiff's age discrimination claim survives defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caputy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Quad/Graphics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 14-14159-FDS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202208825\">\n    2015 WL 2208825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Mass. May 11, 2015) (finding that the fact that the hospital retained all women nursing supervisors and discharged the only man is sufficient, by itself, to raise a reasonable inference that the hospital discharged the man because of his sex) (internal citations omitted). Rather, Levesque's allegation that younger employees were retained post-reorganization to perform his duties is sufficient to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202208825\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, to the extent that defendants refer to their legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination, the Court notes that the burden shifting\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   framework in an ADEA claim is generally applied at summary judgment, not at the motion to dismiss stage. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Levesque has elucidated specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a pretext, but a pretext intended to cover up the employer's real motive: age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Mesnick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    General Elec.

Specifically, the assertions that 1) SIMNA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   superiors raised his age as an issue at least five times, 2) Levesque was the only individual terminated as a result of the reorganization and 3) Levesque was told to tell co-workers that he intended to retire, all imply age-based discrimination, even at the final stage of burden shifting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the ADEA and the related state law claims will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendants' motion to dismiss (Docket No. 25) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to 1) dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction, 2) transfer and 3) change of venue, but is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to 1) all contract claims, except for the $ 367,000 quantitative award, 2) the quasi-contractual claims and 3) the Massachusetts Wage Act claims, except as it relates to the quantitative awards of $ 367,000 and $ 732,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
