To receive the visa, Svelte has the burden of proving \"the intended United States operation, within one year of the approval of the petition, will support an executive or managerial position.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l)(3)(v)(C). Both parties have moved for summary judgment. Because there are insufficiently specific facts to prove Ufo would be primarily serving in an executive or managerial capacity, the Court grants the Defendants' motion and denies the Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Svelte is registered as a limited liability company in Minnesota. [ECF No. 17-1 (\"Admin. Rec.\") at 69.] Svelte claims to be a subsidiary of Svelte Construction Limited (\"Svelte Nigeria\"), a Nigerian civil and building construction company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 14 at 2.] In January 2018, Svelte filed a Form I-129 for an L-1A nonimmigrant visa to allow Ufo to be employed within the United States as Svelte's Chief Executive Officer for one year. (Admin. Rec. at 2.) In the petition, Svelte indicated its type of business as \"Civil and Building [C]onstruction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) It also stated it currently has zero employees within the United States and that its address is 222 South 9th Street, Ste. 1600, Minneapolis, MN 55402. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Svelte submitted its petition, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") issued a Request for Evidence (\"RFE\"), asking Svelte to provide additional documentation to show that its office will support Ufo in a primarily managerial or executive position within one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 213-17.) Svelte submitted a response in March 2018, and a week later USCIS issued a decision denying the petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 218-447; 2-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Svelte then brought this action, seeking a declaratory judgment under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 USC \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that Ufo is entitled to the nonimmigrant visa. [ECF No. 1.] Both parties brought motions for summary judgment which are now before this Court. [ECF No. 12, 18.] At the hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, held on December 17, 2018, the Court requested supplemental briefing on the issue of whether it had subject matter jurisdiction to review USCIS's decision. Both Svelte and USCIS provided the Court with the requested briefing. [ECF No. 38, 41.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As these cases note, the language of \u00a7 1184(c)(1) appears simply to be instructing the Attorney General to establish regulations; it does not appear to be giving the Attorney General sole discretion to evaluate petitions.

Duties of the Beneficiary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   USCIS denied Svelte's petition for two main reasons. First, it determined Ufo's proposed duties of \"budgeting,\" \"providing reports,\" and \"managing financial growth\" were not \"consistent with those typically performed by someone in a managerial or executive position.\" (Admin. Rec. at 5). USCIS explained that \"[t]he duties described are more indicative of an employee who will be performing the necessary tasks to provide a service or to produce a product\" and \"[a]n employee who primarily performs the tasks necessary to produce a product or provide services is not considered to be employed in a managerial or executive capacity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Svelte argues that USCIS ignored other job duties that were more consistent with an executive or managerial role-such as \"participate in development of the corporation's plans\" and \"define the vision of the company.\" [ECF No. 14 at 15.] Even if some of Ufo's duties were managerial or executive in nature, however, the petitioner must prove Ufo's duties as a whole would be\n   <em>\n    primarily\n   </em>\n   managerial or executive in nature. Courts have held that the \"express language of the regulations excludes workers whose job involves a mix of management and nonmanagement responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Shine's Ranch Corp. v.

The proposed duties of Svelte's subordinates included making calls, overseeing daily operations of the finance and accounting departments, and being responsible for day-to-day construction operations. (Admin. Rec. at 6.) These duties do not appear to be strictly professional in nature. And Svelte fails to provide any additional explanation as to why they are professional in nature.
