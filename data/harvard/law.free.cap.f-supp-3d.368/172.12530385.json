Accordingly, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Barbosa's motion to dismiss the indictment (Docket No. 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Barbosa is a citizen of Brazil. He entered the United States without inspection on October 22, 2003. He worked as a roofer for a year in Boston, Massachusetts and then in Pompano Beach, Florida. He lived and worked in Seattle, Washington for about six months before deciding to return to Boston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 9, 2008, as Barbosa was driving from Seattle to Boston, he was stopped near Fargo, North Dakota by the North Dakota Highway Patrol. He admitted he was in the country unlawfully and was taken into custody. The following day, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") served Barbosa with an NTA to initiate removal proceedings. The NTA stated that he was ordered to appear in immigration court in Bloomington, Minnesota \"on a date to be set at a time to be set.\" Dkt. No. 50-2 at 1. The NTA was translated into Portuguese for Barbosa. Barbosa requested an expedited removal hearing and waived his right to a ten-day period prior to appearing before an immigration judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Barbosa appeared in immigration court on December 18. He was represented by an attorney. After consulting with his attorney, Barbosa declined a continuance. He then conceded his removability and decided not to seek any relief from removal. The immigration judge ordered Barbosa removed to Brazil. Barbosa waived his right to appeal his removal order and was removed from the United States on January 12, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Barbosa reentered the United States at some point after his 2009 removal. On June 7, 2017, he was arrested in Framingham, Massachusetts for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The next day, ICE took him into custody and reinstated his 2008 removal order. Barbosa waived his right to contest the reinstatement before an ICE officer. Barbosa was also indicted for illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government dismissed the indictment when Barbosa was removed to Brazil on August 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Barbosa returned to the United States for a third time. He was arrested on an open warrant in Framingham, Massachusetts on December 6, 2017. On April 6, 2018, he was indicted for the second time with illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Barbosa moves to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his 2015 removal order was entered without jurisdiction because\n   the NTA filed with the immigration court did not include the date and time of his removal hearing. He relies on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , which held that an NTA without the date and time of the removal hearing was not a valid NTA under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and did not trigger the stop-time rule for cancellation of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because Barbosa's NTA did not include the date and time of his hearing, he contends it was invalid under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   and did not vest the immigration court with jurisdiction to order his removal.

There is no evidence that Barbosa received such a notice, although he did request an expedited removal hearing. However, the agency regulations do not tie the immigration court's jurisdiction to provision of the date and time of the removal hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court need not decide the difficult question of whether jurisdiction fails to vest in an immigration court where the\n   alien never receives written notice of the date and time of his removal hearing but he requests an expedited hearing for which he is actually present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/#p1158\">\n    913 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to address the jurisdictional consequences of a failure to send a Notice of Hearing).

This removal was based on a reinstatement of his 2008 removal order. \"Reinstatement orders do not exist independent and separate from their prior orders of removal but are instead explicitly premised on the prior order.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Charleswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3351921\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/347/#p352\">\n    456 F.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (3d Cir. 2006). Accordingly, \"a successful collateral attack on a removal order precludes reliance on a reinstatement of that same order in criminal proceedings for illegal reentry.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The focus of the \u00a7 1326(d) inquiry is therefore on his 2008 removal order, not the 2017 reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The record makes clear that Barbosa waived his right to appeal his 2008 removal order. A defendant who does so has not exhausted administrative remedies,\n   <em>\n    Soto-Mateo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339853\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/117/#p120\">\n    799 F.3d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or been deprived of judicial review,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Barbosa consulted with an attorney before waiving his right to appeal and provides no evidence that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, Barbosa has failed to demonstrate that the entry of his prior removal order was fundamentally unfair. He argues that his removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair because the absence of the date and time of the hearing on his NTA deprived the immigration court of jurisdiction. Even if the immigration court did lack jurisdiction, a failure to give the time and date in the NTA does not by itself render removal proceedings fundamentally unfair when the alien was actually present for his hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lopez-Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313876\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/225/#p230\">\n    313 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (5th Cir. 2002) (noting that \"[f]undamental fairness is a question of procedure\" that focuses on whether the defendant had notice, a hearing, and a fair opportunity to be heard). Barbosa had an attorney at his hearing and conceded his removability. Although there is no evidence he received advanced notice of the hearing, he requested an expedited hearing and declined a continuance after consulting with his attorney. The inability to adequately prepare a\n   defense due to a lack of sufficient advance notice may constitute fundamental unfairness in some circumstances, but Barbosa has not demonstrated that his defective NTA interfered with his ability to defend himself against removal, exhaust administrative remedies, or obtain judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Barbosa's motion to dismiss the indictment (Docket No. 49) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SO ORDERED\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The stop-time rule helps determine whether an alien has been continuously present in the United States long enough to be eligible for cancellation of removal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) ;\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 2110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Although a litigant cannot waive an argument about the subject matter jurisdiction of an Article III court,\n    <em>\n     Gonzalez v.
