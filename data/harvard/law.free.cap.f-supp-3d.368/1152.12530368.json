(\"AbbVie\"), Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. Inc. (\"TPUSA\"), and TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc. (\"TAP\") (collectively \"Defendants\") alleging strict products liability, strict products liability-failure to warn, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation. She also asserts fraudulent misrepresentation against Abbott. Currently before the Court are motions by Abbott [144], AbbVie [150], and TPUSA/TAP [147] to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. For the reasons explained below, Defendants' motions [144; 147; 150] are granted in part and denied in part. The motion to dismiss TAP as a Defendant pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5) is granted and TAP is dismissed from this action with prejudice. With regard to Defendants' motions under Rule 12(b)(6) : all Counts against TPUSA as successor in interest to TAP are dismissed with prejudice; all Counts but Count II against AbbVie are dismissed; and all claims but Counts II &amp; V against Abbott are dismissed. The Court sets this matter for further status on April 8, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. to set a schedule for limited discovery regarding: (1) when Plaintiff's claim accrued; (2) whether the second amended complaint as to AbbVie properly relates back under Rule 15(c)(3); and (3) the roles of the remaining defendants vis-\u00e0-vis the manufacturing and development of Lupron. The parties should submit a joint status report and a proposed schedule for limited discovery no later than April 4, 2019. Finally, as an administrative matter, the motion for Rule 11 Sanctions by AbbVie, Abbott, and TPUSA [153] is stricken without prejudice in light of the notice of withdrawal filed on October 30, 2018 [180].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The full background of this case is set forth in the Court's previous opinion, knowledge of which is assumed here. See [111 (\n   <em>\n    Paulsen v. Abbott Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n    2018 WL 1508532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1-4 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2018) ]. In brief, Plaintiff alleges that the Lupron injection that she received in 2004 to treat her endometriosis caused permanent damage to her bones and joints leading to her diagnosis of severe joint arthropathy in April 2008 and osteoporosis in May 2010. [143, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.] She also continues to suffer from chronic joint pain, muscle pain, and fatigue. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.] Critically, Plaintiff alleges that as early as 1990, Abbott and TAP\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   knew of the continued bone loss incurred by Lupron users and the risk that the medication therefore posed to patient's health, but took no corrective action, provided no additional warnings, and did not take the drug off the market. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.] In her second amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges that an Abbott drug detail person explicitly told her physician that Lupron was safe and effective and would not cause any long-term adverse effects. [143, \u00b6 50.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's quest to hold Defendants accountable for the harms allegedly caused by the Lupron that they purportedly designed, manufactured, packaged, marketed, etc. has spawned a veritable odyssey of litigation spanning almost a decade. Although the full saga is more fully laid out in the Court's previous opinion, see [\n   <em>\n    Paulsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n    2018 WL 1508532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4 ], the Court will provide a brief summary here as well. In April 2010, Plaintiff along with several\n   other individuals, filed suit against Abbott, TPNA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   TAP, and Takeda Inc. in the Eastern District of New York. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.] The case was then transferred to the Southern District of New York, before finally coming to rest in the Northern District of Illinois in July 2011 before Judge Gottschall. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The case proceeded into discovery-after Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in October 2011-until August 2013, when Plaintiff's then-counsel moved to withdraw from the case. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] After admonishing Plaintiff that her case would be dismissed for lack of prosecution unless she appeared, Judge Gottschall dismissed the case in October 2013 when Plaintiff failed to appear. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Although the case was briefly reinstated upon the request of Plaintiff's mother, in May 2014 Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After unsuccessfully attempting to reopen the previous case through newly-acquired counsel in April 2015, Plaintiff filed a new complaint against Abbott, TPNA, Takeda Inc., and TAP in the current action in May 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The complaint [1] asserted seven causes of action against all the defendants including various product liability, negligence, warranty, and misrepresentation claims. See generally [1]. The defendants moved to dismiss the action in July 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Paulsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n    2018 WL 1508532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.] The motions were dismissed without prejudice, however, until Judge Gottschall could determine whether the Illinois savings statute or Georgia statute of limitations period applied. [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ] That question turned on whether Abbott was a real party at interest to the litigation. [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After limited discovery, Judge Gottschall determined on a motion for summary judgment that there was a \"genuine issue of material fact as to whether Abbott's role in the distribution chain was sufficient to create liability.\" [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ] The Defendants then refiled their motions to dismiss to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5) and (b)(6), which this Court resolved in an opinion dated March 27, 2018. See generally [\n   <em>\n    Paulsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n    2018 WL 1508532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court granted the motions in part and denied them in part. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.] As to the Defendants' motions under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court dismissed all the claims against Takeda Inc. and Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. with prejudice, dismissed all the claims against TPNA without prejudice, and dismissed all but the strict liability claims against Abbott without prejudice. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Court also granted Defendants' motion to dismiss TAP as a defendant pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5)\"to the extent that Plaintiff is given until May 22, 2018 to serve an amended complaint upon a proper defendant (whether that is TAP or a proper successor to TAP).\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint, provided she could do so consistent with the opinion. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 6, 2018, Plaintiff filed her second amended complaint (the \"SAC\"), after filing a short-lived first amended complaint in April 2018. [143.] The SAC brings four causes of action against all Defendants-strict products liability (Counts I &amp; II), negligence (Count III), and negligent misrepresentation (Count V)-and one cause of action against Abbott alone-fraudulent misrepresentation (Count IV). Defendants have filed three motions to dismiss in response. See generally [144; 147; 150]. First, TAP moves to dismiss the claims against it with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5). [147.] The remaining Defendants move to dismiss the claims against them under Rule 12(b)(6). TPUSA asserts that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against it, because the facts as pled show that\n   TPUSA cannot be held liable as a successor in interest to TAP as Plaintiff claims. [147, at 3-5.] AbbVie, in turn, argues that all the claims against it are barred by the statute of limitations, and that in any case, Plaintiff has failed to state any plausible claims against it under Rule 8. See generally [150]. Finally, Abbott argues that the complaint fails to state a plausible claim against it under Rule 8 on Counts I-III and V and fails to plead fraudulent misrepresentation in Count IV with the specificity required by Rule 9(b). See generally [144]. Defendants also filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions [153], which later was withdrawn, see [180].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

That is not a correct reading. The Court simply intended to give Plaintiff time to effectuate service on whatever entity currently holds TAP's Lupron liabilities. See [111 at 17 (\"Of course it is unclear whether TAP should be served at all. Plaintiff has variously argued that TPNA and Abbott-both properly-served Defendants-currently hold TAP's Lupron liabilities, and Abbott argues that AbbVie holds these liabilities and would thus be the proper party to sue.\").]\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to TAP itself, as the Court previously explained, \"Plaintiff cannot effectively serve one corporation by serving a completely different corporation.\" [111, at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hurtado v. 7-Eleven, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148084\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/508/564/#p565\">\n    508 F.

Because Plaintiff has not effectuated service on TAP, the Court has no choice but to dismiss TAP from this suit. And, given Plaintiff's representations that she has no intention of serving TAP, that dismissal is with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Defendant TPUSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the SAC, Plaintiff again alleges that TPUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. (\"Takeda Ltd.\") and now asserts that TPUSA is liable as a successor in interest to TAP. [143, \u00b6 4.] She further alleges that when TAP dissolved in 2008, Abbott acquired all the assets, employees, and liabilities related to Lupron.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.] In fact, \"Abbott exchanged its 50 percent equity interest in TAP for the assets, liabilities and employees related to TAP's Lupron business.\" [148-2, at 3.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, in July 2008, TAP's remaining assets were merged into TPUSA after which TAP dissolved as a corporation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.] In light of these transfers, TPUSA argues that it cannot be the successor in interest to Plaintiff's claims against TAP because Abbott, and now AbbVie, received all of TAP's assets, employees, and liabilities related to Lupron. The Court agrees with TPUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff argues that TPUSA may be held liable as a successor in interest pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Perimeter Realty v. GAPI, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"558338\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/243/584/\">\n    243 Ga.App. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"558338\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/243/584/\">\n    533 S.E.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).\n   <em>\n    Perimeter\n   </em>\n   provides four circumstances in which a company purchasing another corporation's assets may be considered a successor in interest: \"(i) there is an express agreement to assume the liabilities; (ii) the transaction is a fraudulent attempt to avoid liability; (iii) the purchaser is a mere continuation of the predecessor corporation; or (iv) the transaction is, in fact, a merger * * *.\" See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"558338\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/243/584/\">\n    533 S.E.2d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiff has alleged that Abbott, and then AbbVie, expressly assumed the liabilities associated with Lupron when it purchased those assets from TAP. Consequently, only AbbVie appears to be the proper successor in interest to TPA. Nonetheless, Plaintiff argues that TPUSA may also be held liable as a successor in interest to TPA given the alleged de facto merger between TPA and TPNA, now TPUSA. However, Plaintiff has provided neither argument nor authority for the notion that a plaintiff may sue both TPUSA and AbbVie as successors in interest when only one of them expressly assumed the liabilities related to the product that\n   allegedly harmed her. Nor does the Court believe she could. Consequently, the Court grants TPUSA's motion to dismiss it from the case because Plaintiff has not pled facts that show TPUSA can be held liable as a success in interest to TPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendant AbbVie\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   AbbVie moves to dismiss every cause of action in Plaintiff's complaint on two grounds: first, on the basis that the complaint is untimely and filed outside the applicable statute of limitations; and second, for failure to state a claim. In support of the latter argument, AbbVie incorporates by reference Section II of Abbott's memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss [145] and Sections II &amp; III of TPUSA and TAP's memorandum of law in support of those defendants' motion to dismiss [148].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    a. Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   AbbVie asserts that Plaintiff's allegations in the SAC establish that the claim against it falls outside the statute of limitations. Plaintiff retorts that because it timely filed against TAP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and only seeks to proceed against AbbVie as the successor in interest to TAP, its claims are not untimely. The parties' briefing raises two questions: first, does filing a timely suit against a defendant's predecessor in interest toll the statute of limitations such that the otherwise untimely later substitution or addition of the successor in interest should be treated as timely? And, if not, should the Court treat the current complaint as relating back under Rule 15(c)?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although not cited by the parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the decision in\n   <em>\n    Affleck v. Hannah Marine Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%201417\">\n    1986 WL 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Jan. 13, 1986), directly contradicts Plaintiff's contention that simply naming a party's\n   predecessor in interest is sufficient to toll the statute of limitations as to that party. Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Affleck\n   </em>\n   confronted a remarkably similar situation to the case at bar. As that court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In the two years since this case was originally filed (as Case No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Cow.%209028\">\n    83 C 9028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the parties and the court have spent most of their efforts trying to unearth the proper defendants. Affleck originally brought this suit against Cities Services Corporation (Cities Services) and Hannah Marine Corporation (Hannah Marine). In his First Amended Complaint, plaintiff added Socony Vacuum Oil Co. (Socony) as a defendant. In the Second Amended Complaint, plaintiff substituted Gulf Oil Corporation (Gulf) for Socony on the basis that Gulf was the successor in interest to Socony. * * * It later became clear that Gulf was not a successor in interest to Socony, and therefore, the court granted Gulf's summary judgment motion and dismissed it from the case. The Third Amended Complaint named Mobil Oil Corporation (Mobil), the true successor in interest to Socony, as a defendant. * * * the court [subsequently] dismissed plaintiff's claim against Mobil for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. * * * Plaintiff then filed a negligence case against Mobil in state court, (\n   <em>\n    Affleck v. Mobil Oil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20Lans.%20Ch.%2016706\">\n    85 L 16706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). On Mobil's petition the case was removed, and Mobil moves to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for a number of reasons [, including the statute of limitations].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%201417\">\n    1986 WL 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Addressing Mobil's argument, the court first explained that Illinois's savings statute, 735 ILCS 5/13-217, could not save an action that was barred by the statute of limitations when it was commenced in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Because Affleck had not named Mobil as a defendant until after the expiration of the statute of limitations, the only way he could save his case is if the complaint related back under Rule 15(c) to the complaint in which Socony was named as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Affleck\n   </em>\n   is not controlling, this Court finds it persuasive and is inclined to follow its rationale. Consequently, the Court must determine whether the current complaint relates back to Plaintiff's first complaint in\n   <em>\n    Cardenas &amp; Paulsen v. Abbott Labs. et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-1745, ECF No. 1 (E.D.N.Y. April 20, 2010). AbbVie asserts that Plaintiff waived this argument by failing to respond to AbbVie's Rule 15(c) arguments. [179, at 3.] However, the Court concludes that the most logical way to read Plaintiff's argument is that as TAP's successor in interest, claims against AbbVie clearly relate back to the original complaint under Rule 15(c). Plaintiff's assertion that proceeding in this manner would be inappropriate because it \"treats the Second Amended Complaint as if it is an independent direct claim against AbbVie, not a claim as a successor in interest\" is simply unpersuasive. [163, at 6.] First, Plaintiff has again failed to provide any support whatsoever for this argument, and the argument seems directly contrary to\n   <em>\n    Affleck\n   </em>\n   above. But lack of precedent aside, as the Court has already explained, the mere fact that a corporation is sued as a successor in interest does not waive all the normal procedural and substantive requirements of federal litigation. Consequently, the Court will follow\n   <em>\n    Affleck\n   </em>\n   's example and determine whether Plaintiff's complaint relates back under Rule 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rule 15(c)(1) provides that \"an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within 120 days as provided by Rule 4(m),\n   the party to be brought in by amendment (1) received notice of the action so that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits and (2) knew or should have known the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the party's identity.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   AbbVie first argues that Plaintiff did not make a mistake in failing to name AbbVie until now, and that as a result the Court should not allow the complaint to relate back. The fact that Plaintiff now claims that Abbott, TPUSA, and AbbVie are each liable as the successor in interest to TAP's liabilities, according to AbbVie, demonstrates that Plaintiff simply does not know which of the three companies she wants to hold liable for alleged injuries, not that she made a \"mistake\" as contemplated by Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, the line of cases cited by AbbVie predates the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Krupski v. Costa Crociere S.p.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    560 U.S. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). For many years, the Seventh Circuit adhered to the \"John Doe rule,\" pursuant to which a plaintiff's lack of knowledge about a defendant's identity was not considered a \"mistake\" within the meaning of Rule 15(c) such that a plaintiff could amend his complaint and take advantage of the relation-back doctrine. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Norfolk S.

Finally, at summary judgment, the facts presented conclusively demonstrated that Krupski had not sued the right defendant and that the proper defendant was Costa Crociere.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    560 U.S. at 542-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Brazil II\n   </em>\n   for example, the court found the complaint sufficient where plaintiff had alleged some facts showing that shortly after the drug was released, numerous reports of adverse reactions were announced and that the defendants had actually warned against using the drug in question in certain patients, possibly showing they were aware of the adverse relationship.

[143, \u00b6 15.] Plaintiff also points to an April 1998 report that TAP submitted to the FDA in which researchers disclosed that more than a third of the women in their study who had taken Lupron\"did not 'demonstrate either partial reversibility' or 'a trend toward return' of bone mass in the six months after they stopped taking the drug.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.] Finally, Plaintiff points to the fact that in 2001 the FDA approved a \"Lupron 'add-back therapy,' designed to counteract the harmful bone-depleting effects of Lupron.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15]. Although, as in\n   <em>\n    Brazil II\n   </em>\n   , the question is close, the Court concludes that these facts are sufficient to show that TAP/Abbott knew that there was a substantial risk of bone depletion with Lupron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With regard to the latter two elements, Plaintiff has alleged that \"the warnings and information which were given to the medical community and women consumers did not accurately reflect the severity and permanence of symptoms, duration, scope, or severity of the potential side effects, health concerns, and risks of Lupron.\" [143, \u00b6 35.] \"Had adequate warnings or instructions regarding permanent bone loss side effects been provided, Plaintiff would not have used, taken, or received administration of Lupron, and would not have suffered the harmful side effects, other injuries and damages described herein.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.] Plaintiff further alleges that an \"Abbott detail person, who visited [Plaintiff's physician's] office, characterized Lupron as appropriate, safe and effective for patients with her medical condition [ (endometriosis ) ].\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.] According to Plaintiff, \"neither she nor her physician were made aware, by Abbott or TAP, of the serious threat to her bone health posed by the use of Lupron for her endometriosis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff concludes that she would have never taken Lupron if she had been apprised of the risks involved. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.] The allegations suffice to plead a failure to warn claim.

However, given (1) the split of Georgia authority cited above and (2) the fact that Defendants did not raise this argument until a footnote in their reply brief.

Without allegations pointing to statements by TAP on which Plaintiff's physician relied before injecting Plaintiff with Lupron, Plaintiff's complaint does not provide AbbVie with notice of the basis for the negligent misrepresentation claims against it under Rule 8's pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendant Abbott\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Abbott moves to dismiss every cause of action in Plaintiff's complaint on two grounds: first, that it cannot be held liable\n   as the successor in interest to AbbVie; and second, for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    a. Liability as Successor in Interest and Failure to Plead Each Defendant's Actions Independently\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   First, Abbott moves to dismiss all the claims against it to the extent Plaintiff asserts that Abbott is liable as the successor in interest to TAP. As explained above, based on Plaintiff's amended complaint, the Court can only conclude that AbbVie is the proper successor in interest to TAP. Thus, Plaintiff may not state a claim against Abbott as the successor in interest to TAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Additionally, like AbbVie, Abbott moves to dismiss all the claims against it because Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled what each defendant allegedly did to harm her. But Plaintiff named both Abbott and TAP in nearly every one of her allegations of wrongdoing. Moreover, as explained above, even if the Court were inclined to dismiss the claims against Abbott on that ground, it would be with leave to replead. Rather than simply have Plaintiff duplicate each paragraph as to each defendant, the Court will look to see if Plaintiff has adequately pled facts that state a claim against Abbott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    b. Counts I &amp; III (Strict Liability - Design Defect &amp; Negligence)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Counts I and III fail against Abbott for the same reasons they failed against TAP (AbbVie). In Count I, Plaintiff has simply not alleged any facts to show a design defect. Likewise, in Count III, Plaintiff has not provided any more factual basis for the Court to conclude that Abbott acted negligently than she did with regard to TAP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, both Counts I &amp; III are dismissed as to Abbott as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    c. Count II (Strict Liability - Failure to Warn)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Although the Court has concluded that Plaintiff may proceed on Count II against AbbVie, whether she may proceed against Abbott is a much more difficult question. The question is whether Plaintiff has properly alleged facts such that the Court may treat Abbott as the manufacturer of Lupron. Unlike TAP-whose purpose under the joint venture agreement between Takeda Ltd. and Abbott was allegedly to develop, manufacture, market and sell products, including Lupron, [143, \u00b6 6]-Plaintiff merely alleges that Abbott and TAP, \"jointly, severally, acting in concert * * * manufactured, compounded, tested, distributed, recommended, marketed, labeled and packaged, merchandised,\n   advertised, promoted, [and ] sold\" the Lupron she was injected with, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25]. The question is whether the Court must, or may, take notice of additional information put forward by the parties in the previous motion for summary judgment, and in support and defense of the now withdrawn motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   First, Judge Gottschall concluded on a motion for summary judgment that there was a genuine issue of material fact whether Abbott was a proper party at interest in this lawsuit. See [95, at 12 (\"the court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Abbott's involvement Abbott's involvement in Lupron's distribution was sufficient\" for a finding of liability) ]. However, that ruling assumed Illinois strict liability law applied, and as this Court subsequently determined, Georgia law applies to the substantive claims in this case.\n   <em>\n    Paulsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201508532\">\n    2018 WL 1508532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11-13.

July 15, 2009). While Judge Gottschall previously determined that Abbott had a role in the distribution of TAP's product line and was thus subject to liability under Illinois law, she did not determine whether it could liable as a non-manufacturer under Georgia law. Thus, that decision does not provide the law of the case regarding the propriety of holding Abbott strictly liable as a manufacturer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The more difficult question is whether the Court should, or even may, take judicial notice of all the documents that Plaintiff submitted in response to Defendants' motion for sanctions.

If Plaintiff had attached the documents to her responses to the Defendants' motions to dismiss, the Court could easily consider them. However, the parties have not briefed the issue of whether documents submitted in response to a motion for sanctions may be considered\n   by the Court in its resolution of the motion to dismiss without converting the instant motion into a motion for summary judgment.

Although Abbott asserts that this holding stands for the proposition outlined above, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Quashie\n   </em>\n   court's real concern was with Quashie's \"group pleading\" given its prior comment that \"[b]ecause Plaintiff refers only to Defendants as a group, it is impossible to discern from the face of the Amended Complaint which Defendant allegedly breached what duty or committed what tortious act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525664\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/1329/#p1341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1341 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Brazil I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274414\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/1321/#p1337\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d at 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the Complaint generically states '[d]efendants * * *' \");\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274050\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/253/1168/#p1172\">\n    253 F.Supp.3d at 1171-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that plaintiff had failed to properly give the defendants notice of their alleged wrongdoing, but examining the substance of the claims nonetheless).

Thus, Plaintiff may only state a claim, if any, for negligent misrepresentation if (1) Abbott or its agents negligently supplied false information to Plaintiff's physician, (2) the physician reasonably relied on that representation when deciding whether to administer Lupron to Plaintiff, and (3) Plaintiff suffered an economic harm as a result of that reliance.

Thus, the Court must simply look to the allegations on their own merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   First, although the question is an extremely close one, the Court concludes that the Abbott agent's alleged representation that Lupron had no long-term adverse effects when as discussed above, Defendants knew or should have known of a significant risk of long-term, permanent bone depletion constitutes the negligent supply of false information. Plaintiff has also alleged that Plaintiff's physicians relied on that representation, among others, when deciding to treat Plaintiff with Lupron.

Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, Defendants request that any and all dismissals be with prejudice. In deciding whether to dismiss with prejudice (and foreclose any attempts to amend the complaint) this Court is mindful that the Court should \"freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" Fed.

Courts have broad discretion to deny amendment where there is undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to the defendants, or where the amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206547\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/867/#p871\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206547\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/867/#p871\">\n    at 871-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has now had three attempts to plead in this case, multiple opportunities in the previous case, and the opportunity to conduct at least some discovery\n   in the prosecution of the previous motion to dismiss. The Court has now twice concluded that she has alleged sufficient facts to proceed on at least some of her claims. At this point, the Court is convinced that any further repleading as to TPUSA would be futile, given that Plaintiff's allegations clearly show AbbVie to be TAP's only possible successor in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   With regard to Abbott and AbbVie, after three complaints the Court is convinced that another complaint and a further round of motions to dismiss would be a waste of judicial resources. The events at issue in this case occurred in 2004, were discovered in 2008, were first subject to suit in 2010, reasserted in a refiled suit in 2015, addressed in motion for summary judgment in 2017, a motion to dismiss in 2018, and now, finally, a second motion to dismiss in 2019. It is time to move this case forward. Consequently, the Court will not consider any motion for leave to file an amended complaint until the parties resolve the issues flagged by Defendants in this latest round of briefing that go to the heart of this action's viability, namely: (1) whether the entire suit is untimely; (2) whether the complaint as to AbbVie may relate back; and (3) the actual roles played by Abbott and TAP vis-\u00e0-vis the manufacturing, packaging, and distribution of Lupron. However, at the end of that discovery and the resolution of any motions for summary judgement, should Plaintiff discover facts that lead her to conclude that she should amend her complaint, she may file a motion seeking leave to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   For the reasons explained above, Defendants' motions [144; 147; 150] are granted in part and denied in part. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5), TAP is dismissed from this action with prejudice. With regard to Defendants' motions under Rule 12(b)(6), all Counts against TPUSA as successor in interest to TAP are dismissed with prejudice; all claims but Count II against AbbVie are dismissed; and all claims but Counts II &amp; V against Abbott are dismissed. The Court sets this matter for further status on April 8, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. to set a schedule for limited discovery regarding: (1) when Plaintiff's claim accrued; (2) whether the second amended complaint as to AbbVie properly relates back under Rule 15(c)(3) ; and (3) the roles of the remaining defendants vis-\u00e0-vis the manufacturing and development of Lupron. The parties should submit a joint status report and a proposed schedule for limited discovery no later than April 4, 2019. Finally, as an administrative matter, the motion for Rule 11 Sanctions by AbbVie, Abbott, and TPUSA [153] is stricken without prejudice in light of the notice of withdrawal filed on October 30, 2018 [180].\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    For purposes of the motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all of Platinum's well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in Platinum's favor.\n    <em>\n     Killingsworth v.

For example, the Court in\n    <em>\n     Dybala v.

However, because the \"successor in interest\" in\n    <em>\n     Patterson\n    </em>\n    was not the successor in interest to the original defendant, but the successor in interest of another party who plaintiff had not originally sued, the renewal statute did not save the lawsuit.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"649984\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/190/657/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is certainly satisfied here because the amended complaint simply seeks to hold AbbVie liable for the wrongful actions of TAP that she has complained of since first filing the suit in 2010.
