INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff United States of America (\"the government\") seeks forfeiture and civil money penalties from two foreign companies that have allegedly acted as fronts for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (\"North Korea\"). According to the government, these two companies-Velmur Management Pte. Ltd. (\"Velmur\") and Transatlantic Partners Pte. Ltd. (\"Transatlantic\")-made transactions on behalf of sanctioned North Korean entities, using the United States banking system, in contravention of federal law and United States sanctions on North Korea. Velmur failed to respond to the government's complaint, and the government\n   asks this Court to enter a default judgment against it. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that the government's factual allegations are sufficient to show that Velmur is liable for the offenses with which it is charged, that the government sent proper notice of this action to interested parties, and that the money the government claims under the forfeiture statute was involved in Velmur's offenses. However, the government's allegations support only a portion of the civil money penalty it seeks against Velmur. Thus, the Court grants the government's motion for default judgment in full with respect to the forfeiture, and in part with respect to civil money penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case began with an FBI investigation of Velmur and Transatlantic in connection with an alleged North Korean scheme to subvert international sanctions through the use of front companies. Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. According to the government: (1) North Korean banks directed Transatlantic and other front companies to send United States dollars to Velmur; (2) those front companies wired the money to Velmur, using United States banks as conduits; (3) Velmur then wired the money to a Russian gasoil supplier; which (4) shipped gasoil to North Korea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.

Although Velmur has not appeared to contest these claims, the Court must assure itself that the government has established Velmur's liability for both. Because the government has properly notified all interested parties and sufficiently alleged that Velmur's property is subject to forfeiture, the motion for default judgment is granted as it relates to the forfeiture.

The government, however, also seeks civil money penalties arising from additional Velmur transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, the government identifies eight wire transfers from Velmur to IPC between February and Aril 2017, each wire referencing payment \"[f]or Gasoil.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-78; Whitley Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.

Given Velmur's other money laundering activities and the government's allegation that both IPC and Velmur were operating under agreements with FTB, the government has plausibly alleged that Velmur's payments to IPC were made on behalf of an SDN without an OFAC license. Thus, the two entities transmitted money through the United States banking system \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,\" the IEEPA, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).

Compl. \u00b6 61; Whitley Decl. \u00b6 12. In September 2016, Velmur received a $ 230,000 wire transfer from Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material Company, which was subsequently found to have laundered money on behalf of North Korea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 61(a); Whitley Decl. \u00b6 12(a);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dandong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203233062\">\n    2017 WL 3233062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (finding probable cause that Dandong was a North Korean front company engaged in IEEPA violations, justifying the forfeiture of Dandong funds routed through United States banks). In July 2016, Velmur received $ 189,980 from Ruizhi Resources Limited, a company found to be a front for Dandong Zhicheng.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 61(b); Whitley Decl. \u00b6 12(b). Sometime in 2016, Velmur received \"more than $ 250,000\" from \"Company A,\" which a confidential source identified as an FTB front company that was directed by FTB to wire money to Velmur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 61(c); Whitley Decl. \u00b6 12(c).

Adding those funds to the $ 6,853,000 wired by Velmur to IPC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Whitley Decl. \u00b6 13, the government seeks civil money penalties of $ 21,691,187.30,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    \u00b6 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Aside from the specific transactions described above, however, the government provides no details on the thirty-five alleged illicit wire transfers.
