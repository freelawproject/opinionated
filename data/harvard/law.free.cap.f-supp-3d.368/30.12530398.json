Losing revenue from certain organizations or individuals is not necessarily against the economic interests of any of the Platforms. The Amended Complaint does not allege that the Platforms' overall\n   profitability decreased because of their actions. A loss of income from one source can be offset by larger gains in income from other sources.

Compl. 20, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, even if it can be read as alleging that Facebook or one of the other Platforms has tried to monopolize a market, the Amended Complaint offers only conclusory statements in support of this argument. It defines the relevant market as the \"market for media and news publications (and the submarket for political media and news publications).\" Am. Compl. 20.

And though the Amended Complaint states that \"59% of Twitter users get their news through the Twitter platform\" and that \"48% of all American adults [get] their news from Facebook,\" it offers no support for the notion that either firm has achieved or tried to achieve monopolization of the nationwide media and news publications market.

Nor do they contend that the Platforms were designated by the state to perform a governmental operation. Instead, the Amended Complaint focuses on the Platforms' alleged suppression of conservative political content. It details, for instance, the seemingly disparate treatment of conservative news publishers on Facebook and of conservative commentators on Twitter. Am. Compl. 4-5. But while selective censorship of the kind alleged by the Plaintiffs may be antithetical to the American tradition of freedom of speech, it is not actionable under the First Amendment unless perpetrated by a state actor.
