Importantly, the Fifth Circuit has interpreted the provision in the statute regarding \"the enforcement of immigration laws\" a way that broadly delineates a Border Patrol agent's authority.

In this case, the facts available to the Court are sparse. The parties have not put forward facts regarding the proximity to the border, characteristics of the area, Agent Young's experience, or several other relevant factors. The government contends that, in addition to \"making several hazardous lane changes,\" Defendant \"hit[ ] a guardrail.\" Resp. 1. Hitting a guardrail is an abnormal and erratic driving behavior, so it appears that Defendant's driving may have been erratic enough to support an inference that illegal activity was occurring. On the other hand, Defendant was driving alone, which would not support an inference that an immigration-related offense was occurring. However, based on the information provided to the Court, it is unclear whether Agent Young knew that Defendant was driving alone at the time that he stopped Defendant. If Agent Young was unable to ascertain how many occupants were in Defendant's vehicle prior to stopping the vehicle, then this fact would not impact a finding of reasonable suspicion because the determination is made based on the officer's vantage point at the time the stop occurred. Without more context, it is difficult to ascertain if a reasonable officer would have believed that Defendant may have been committing an immigration offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Whether a reasonable officer would believe a felony was occurring\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Reckless driving is not a felony in Texas; it is a misdemeanor offense. TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 545.401. Further, although driving while intoxicated is a felony in limited circumstances (for example, if the driver has prior similar convictions or a child in the car), driving while intoxicated is typically a misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEXAS PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 49.04, 49.045, 49.09. Thus, whether Agent Young had reason to believe that a driving-related felony was occurring is murky: although driving while intoxicated is typically not a felony in Texas, it may be in limited circumstances. Further, reasonable suspicion is a lower standard than probable cause, and it is certainly possible that a driving-related felony was occurring. The Court determines that it is unclear whether this possibility rises to the level of reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, whether Agent Young could have reasonably believed a felony or immigration-related offense was occurring appears to be a close question. Nonetheless, evidence of a defendant's identity and the information contained in his A-file are never suppressible, as is further discussed below in part III(A)(4). Thus, even if no reasonable suspicion existed, the evidence at issue in this case could not be suppressed.

Accordingly, this language from\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   casts no doubt on the admissibility of the evidence at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The evidence that Defendant seeks to suppress as a result of the traffic stop-fingerprints, A-file, and criminal and immigration history-is all evidence of identity or information that can be found in his A-file.

Thus, the Court must only analyze: (1) whether Defendant's statements were within the scope of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   protections, and (2) if asking Defendant about his immigration status violated the Fifth Amendment, what evidence-if any-should be suppressed as fruit of an illegal custodial interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Asking Defendant about his immigration status violated Defendant's\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Whether Defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were violated hinges on whether asking about his immigration status was a routine booking question. \"Routine booking questions\" fall outside of Miranda's scope; therefore, any answers to routine booking questions are not required to be suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

When Defendant was brought to the Paso Del Norte Center, he had completed serving the sentence imposed for driving while intoxicated, and the Border Patrol agents sought information specifically about his immigration status. Stated differently, Defendant was not being questioned about some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   offense unrelated to immigration. Instead, it appears that the Border Patrol agents were seeking to elicit responses that would reveal an immigration offense-i.e., the offense of illegal reentry, a crime with which Defendant has been charged and remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because the Court is of the opinion that questioning Defendant about his immigration status prior to providing the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings violated his Fifth Amendment rights, the Court also determines that Defendant's statements regarding his immigration status at the Paso Del Norte Center should be suppressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Although Defendant's statements are inadmissible, his fingerprints, A-file, and criminal and immigration history should not be suppressed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When a Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights are violated, illegally obtained statements\n   and the fruits of illegally obtained evidence may not generally be admitted into evidence.
