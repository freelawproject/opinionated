For the reasons stated below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 4) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Plaintiff, Elizabeth Timmerman Lugg (\"Plaintiff\"), is employed at Illinois State University as an Associate Professor of Education Law in the Educational Administration and Foundations Department within the College of Education. On October 2, 2018, she filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court of McLean County against Defendants alleging claims under the Illinois Ethics Act and Title VII. (Doc. 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In Count I of her Complaint, she alleges Sutton retaliated against her in violation of the Illinois Ethics Act (\"Ethics Act\"), 5 ILCS 430/15-10, after she complained of age and gender discrimination and assisted with a Title IX sexual misconduct claim. (Doc. 1-1, pp. 12-15). In Count II, she alleges the Board also retaliated against her in violation of the Ethics Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18. In Counts III and IV, she alleges the Board and the Board members, in their official capacities, discriminated and retaliated against her violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 18-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 9, 2018, Defendants filed a Notice of Removal, and the case was assigned to this Court. (Doc. 1). The case was removed to this Court because Plaintiff raised substantial federal issues in her Complaint, namely her claims of gender discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e. Accordingly, this Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 31, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and moved to partially dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1). This Opinion follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) authorizes dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1). Dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is proper if a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, which when accepted as true, states a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Count I (\"Ethics Act - Lenford Sutton\")\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Count I, Plaintiff alleges Sutton retaliated against her in violation of the Illinois Ethics Act, 5 ILCS 430/15-10 (the \"Ethics Act\"), after she engaged in \"protected activity\" by complaining of age and gender discrimination and by providing corroborating evidence in connection with a Title IX sexual misconduct claim. (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 51-67). Plaintiff's prayer for relief includes two times the amount of back pay, interest on back pay, emotional distress damages, costs, attorney and expert witness fees, punitive damages, and equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 4) and accompanying Memorandum (Doc. 5), Defendants argue Count I should be dismissed because it is unclear whether Plaintiff brought Count I against Sutton in his\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    official\n   </em>\n   capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue suing Sutton in his individual capacity is improper because he cannot implement the equitable relief Plaintiff seeks. (Doc. 5, p. 5). Sutton, in his individual capacity, lacks the authority to reinstate Plaintiff's classes and provide back pay. Such actions could only be taken in his official capacity as Chair of the Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Count I because they claim it does not meet the pleading requirements in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff argues she brought Count I against Sutton, individually and in his official capacity, under the portion of the Ethics Act, 5 ILCS 430/15-10, allowing for individual liability for monetary damages. (Doc. 7, p. 3; Doc. 1-1, p. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55). She also seeks equitable remedies. Specifically, she asks Sutton, as Chair of the Department, to reinstate her full class load during the school year and her summer classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court finds Count I meets the pleading requirements under Rule 8. FED. R. CIV. P. 8 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2007). Specifically, paragraph 4 names Sutton as a Defendant \"in both his individual capacity and in his capacity as agent and representative of Illinois State University\" and paragraphs 54-55 state Count I is brought against Sutton under the individual liability provisions in Section 15-10. (Doc. 1-1, p. 3, \u00b6 4; p. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But the question remains whether it is proper for Plaintiff to bring an individual\n   cause of action against Sutton under the Ethics Act. Plaintiff argues the plain meaning of Section 15-10 of the Ethics Act allows her to bring an action against an individual State employee. 5 ILCS \u00a7 430/15-10. Section 15-10 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00a7 15-10. Protected activity. An officer, a member, a\n   <strong>\n    State employee\n   </strong>\n   , or a\n   <strong>\n    State agency\n   </strong>\n   shall not take any retaliatory action against a State employee because the State employee does any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Discloses or threatens to disclose to a\n   <strong>\n    supervisor\n   </strong>\n   or to a\n   <strong>\n    public body\n   </strong>\n   an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency, or other State employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   5 ILCS 430/15-10 (emphasis added). Plaintiff argues the inclusion of individuals (officer, member, or State employee), including the addition of \"State employee,\" suggests that the Illinois legislature intended to allow for individual liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff alleges Sutton was her \"supervisor\" as that term is used in the Ethics Act. She also alleges he had the authority to direct and control her work and the power to take corrective action regarding an alleged violation of law. (Doc. 1-1, p. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7). Section 15-5 of the Ethics Act defines \"public body\" and \"supervisor\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Public body\" means (1) any officer, member, or\n   <strong>\n    State agency\n   </strong>\n   ; (2) the federal government; (3) any local law enforcement agency or prosecutorial office; (4) any federal or State judiciary, grand or petit jury, law enforcement agency, or prosecutorial office; and (5)\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   officer,\n   <strong>\n    employee\n   </strong>\n   , department, agency, or other division of any of the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Supervisor\" means an officer, a member, or a\n   <strong>\n    State employee\n   </strong>\n   who has the authority to direct and control the work performance of a State employee or who has authority to take corrective action regarding any violation of a law, rule, or regulation of which the State employee complains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   5 ILCS 430/15-10 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff also argues the case law interpreting the Ethics Act holds that individual liability is allowed. Existing case law provides little guidance, but courts addressing the issue have held that the legislature intended to allow for individual liability. In\n   <em>\n    Maes v. Folberg\n   </em>\n   , the Northern District of Illinois stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Without any guidance from the Illinois courts on the Ethics Act, we are flying a bit blind. The sole case citing the whistleblowing provision of the Ethics Act,\n   <em>\n    Combs-Hartshorn v. Budz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20844582\">\n    2007 WL 844582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.Ill.2007), sheds little light. Therein, Judge Darrah did not specifically address the question of whether the Ethics Act claim could be instituted against an individual, rather than solely a government entity, but did allow plaintiff's Ethics Act claim to proceed against three named defendants. We also note that the statute states that \"[a]n officer, a member, a State employee, or a State agency shall not take any retaliatory action against a State employee ....\" 5 ILCS \u00a7 430/15-10. The statute was amended in 2003, including the addition of the phrase \"a State employee\" in that introductory paragraph. The inclusion of individuals (officer, member, or State\n   employee), including the specific addition of \"State employee,\" suggests to us that\n   <strong>\n    the Illinois legislature intended to allow for individual liability.\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, we decline to dismiss Folberg in his individual capacity from plaintiff's Ethics Act claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Maes v.

And a Constitution that permitted States to follow their litigation interests by freely asserting both claims in the same case could generate seriously unfair results. Thus, it is not surprising that more than century ago this Court indicated that\n   <strong>\n    a State's voluntary appearance in federal court amounted to a waiver of its Eleventh Amendment immunity\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Lapides\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353556\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/613/\">\n    535 U.S. at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353556\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/613/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This Court agrees with Plaintiff that \"it would be the height of unfairness\" for Defendants to both remove this case to federal court and then claim immunity by their own voluntary act of removal. (Doc. 7, p. 11). This Court finds that Defendants' removal of the action filed in state court constitutes a voluntary act which waived any Eleventh Amendment immunity. See\n   <em>\n    Omosegbon v.
