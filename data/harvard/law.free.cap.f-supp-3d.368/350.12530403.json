Vanessa L. Bryant, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a suit brought by Arch Insurance Company (\"Arch\" or \"Plaintiff\") to enforce certain indemnity agreements issued by Centerplan Construction Company, LLC (\"Centerplan\"), Center Earth, LLC (\"Center Earth\") and certain affiliates (collectively \"Defendants\"). The indemnity agreements were issued in consideration for Arch's issuance of certain surety bonds. The bonds were issued to assure Defendants' payment and performance obligations as a condition precedent to the award of the contract to Center plan to construct the minor league baseball stadium in Hartford, Connecticut (\"Hartford Stadium Project\" or \"Project\") and other construction projects undertaken by Defendants (collectively, \"Bonded Projects\"). Upon receiving and paying claims on a number of the bonds, including the Hartford Stadium Project bonds, Arch demanded Defendants honor the indemnity agreements. Arch believes that Defendants have\n   breached their obligations under the indemnity agreements by failing to comply with these demands, while Defendants dispute their and Arch's liability under the bonds and claim that Arch is not entitled to indemnification or collateral security because Arch has acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 16, 2016, Arch filed a complaint against Defendants seeking contractual indemnification, common law indemnification, contractual collateral security, common law exoneration,\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   , and disclosure of financial information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ]. Presently pending before this Court are two motions by Arch for summary judgment-a Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I and II (contractual and common law indemnification) and a second Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts III, IV, V, and VI (contractual collateral security, common law exoneration,\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   , and disclosure of financial information). Defendants oppose each motion. The Court addresses both of these motions in this opinion and order. For the reasons explained below, this Court finds that Arch is entitled to summary judgment on Counts I, III, and VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Arch is a Missouri corporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey, and it is authorized to write surety bonds in Connecticut. [Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 3]. The Defendants comprise various companies-Centerplan; Center Earth; Centerplan Development Company, LLC (\"Centerplan Development\"); RAL Investments, LLC (\"RAL Investments\"); Walnut Hill Chase, LLC (\"Walnut Hill\"); Tinker House, LLC (\"Tinker House\"); GH Development, Inc. (\"GH Development\"); and Centerplan Communities, LLC (\"Centerplan Communities\")-and Robert and Kelly Landino (the \"Landinos\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-13. Robert Landino is the owner of all Defendant companies and is the chief executive officer of Centerplan and Centerplan Development.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Kelly Landino is his spouse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Centerplan and Center Earth engage in the construction business and, as a result, require a surety to bond their construction projects and contracts from time to time. [Dkt. 82-1 (Pl.'s Rule 56(a)(1) Statement) at \u00b6 1]. Centerplan and Center Earth called on Arch to issue bonds on their behalf for a number of projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In consideration for Arch's issuance of the surety bonds, Centerplan and Center Earth, along with each of the additional defendants, executed General Indemnity Agreements in favor of Arch dated July 10, 2010, October 15, 2010, and January 26, 2016 (the \"Indemnity Agreements\" or \"Agreements\"). [Dkt. 90 (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Rule 56(a)(1) Statement) at \u00b6 2; Dkt. 82-5 (July 2010 Indemnity Agreement); Dkt. 82-6 (Oct. 2010 Indemnity Agreement); Dkt. 82-7 (Jan. 2016 Indemnity Agreement) ]. Each defendant is a party to at least one of the three Indemnity Agreements as Principal/Indemnitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each of the Indemnity Agreements includes a provision obligating the indemnitors to indemnify Arch for any losses and expenses sustained by reason of having executed the bonds. [Dkt. 82-5 at \u00b6 1; Dkt. 82-6 at \u00b6 1; Dkt. 82-7 at \u00b6 3]. The indemnity provisions also establish that the indemnitors will accept vouchers or other evidence of payments by Arch as\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of the fact and extent of liability of the indemnitors to Arch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, each indemnity agreement has a provision granting Arch the exclusive right to decide how to handle claims asserted under the bonds, including \"the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any claim, liability, suit or judgment made or brought ... shall or shall not be paid, compromised, resisted, defended, tried\n   or appealed.\" [Dkt. 82-5 at \u00b6 5; Dkt. 82-6 at \u00b6 5; Dkt. 82-7 at \u00b6 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In reliance on the Indemnity Agreements, Arch issued a large number of bonds between 2010 and 2016 with Centerplan or Center Earth as principal. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 12 Resp.]. These included a performance bond and a payment bond for the Hartford Stadium Project, as well as bonds for a number of other Bonded Projects, including the Storrs Center Phase 2 project, the Asnuntuk Community College Technology Center project, the Hawleyville Sewer Extension project, the Hammonassett Beach State Park Utility Replacement project, the Orchard Hill Elementary School project, the 39 Front Street - Sitework and Site Improvements project, the Harding High School project, and the Trumbull and Pleasant Streets Realignment project. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The penal sum of each of the two Hartford Stadium Project bonds (the \"Bonds\") was $ 47,050,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. The performance bond was conditioned on the faithful performance of Centerplan's Design-Build Agreement (\"DBA\"), the bonded contract. [Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 10 Resp.]. The payment bond was conditioned on the payment of all those who provided labor and materials in furtherance of the DBA and the Hartford Stadium Project. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 10; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 10 Resp.]. A Multiple Obligee Rider was executed and attached to the Hartford Stadium Project Bonds naming the City of Hartford (the \"City\") and the Hartford Stadium Authority (\"HSA\") as Obligees, in addition to DoNo Hartford, LLC (\"DoNo\"), the Owner of the bonded contract. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 10 n.2, \u00b6 11 Resp.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 6, 2015, Centerplan entered into the DBA with DoNo-the developer of the Hartford Stadium Project pursuant to a Development Services Agreement (\"DSA\") between it and the City-as Owner, and Centerplan as Design Builder agreeing to construct the Hartford Stadium Project. [Dkt. 82-10 (DBA); Dkt. 82-9 (DSA) ]. Under the DBA, Centerplan was obligated to achieve substantial completion of the work no later than March 11, 2016, and was to keep the cost of the Hartford Stadium Project at no more than $ 53,550,000. [Dkt. 82-10 at \u00a7\u00a7 3.3, 4.4.3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Centerplan, DoNo, and the City entered into the \"Direct Agreement\" on February 4, 2015, allowing the City to assume DoNo's position under the DBA \"but only upon an event that would cause or provide Design Builder with cause to terminate the same or termination of the Development Services Agreement by City for a Developer Default thereunder.\" [Dkt. 82-11 (Direct Agreement) at \u00a7 8(a) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The substantial completion date and cost of the Hartford Stadium Project in the DBA were amended by way of the \"Term Sheet\" on January 19, 2016. [Dkt. 90 at Add'l Fact \u00b6 11]. The substantial completion date was extended to May 17, 2016, and the maximum cost was increased by over $ 10,300,000 to account for a December 2015 change order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From fall of 2015 through 2017, Arch received claims on a number of payment bonds it had issued on behalf of Centerplan and Center Earth on various Bonded Projects. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 14]. These included claims from subcontractors and suppliers on the Hartford Stadium Project, the Storrs Center Phase 2 project, the Asnuntuk Community College Technology Center project, the Hawleyville Sewer Extension project, the Hammonassett Beach State Park Utility Replacement project, the Orchard Hill Elementary School project, the 39 Front Street project, the Harding High School project, and the Trumbull and Pleasant Streets Realignment\n   project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Additionally, Arch received payment bond claims and union wage and fringe benefit bond claims from labor unions which provided labor on the Bonded Projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. As of December 7, 2017, Arch had paid out a total of $ 20,500,963.60 in satisfaction of the payment bond claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 19, 2016, Howard Rifkin, Corporation Counsel for the City of Hartford, notified DoNo, Centerplan, and Jeffrey M. Donofrio, Esq., on behalf of the City and HSA, that DoNo failed to meet the substantial completion deadline and that DoNo was in default pursuant to the DSA and the Term Sheet Agreement from January 19, 2016. [Dkt. 70 (PJR Hr'g Pl. Ex. 9, Default Letter) at 1]. The letter indicated the City and HSA were entitled to immediate payment of $ 50,000 and $ 15,000 per day for each day thereafter until the Project reached substantial completion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Arch was copied to the letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. On the same day, the City declared DoNo to be in default of the DSA citing its failure to meet the extended May 17, 2016, substantial completion deadline and demanded payment of liquidated delay damages from DoNo and Centerplan. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 28 Resp.]. Soon after, by letter dated May 27, 2016, the City and HSA provided Arch with \"formal notice that [its] principal under the Performance Bond ..., [Centerplan] is in default of its Design Build Agreement for the Minor League Ballpark,\" citing Centerplan's failure to reach substantial completion by May 17, 2016, failure to pay liquidated damages, failure to post a letter of credit regarding said liquidated damages, and numerous construction deficiencies and code violations on the Project. [Dkt. 89-7 (May 27, 2016 Letter) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thereafter, on May 31, 2016, Arch attended a meeting at the City's office to discuss the default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89-7; Dkt. 117 (11.6.2017 PJR Hr'g\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr.) at 112:7-113:23]. Joel Beach, Arch's Assistant Vice President in the surety bond claim department, testified that representatives of DoNo, the City, and Centerplan were in attendance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The City requested that Arch become involved in the Project, to which Centerplan objected. [Dkt. 117 at 120:4-7]. Mr. Beach responded that Centerplan was the contractor of record, remained the contractor of record, and that Arch was not going to retain a consultant to oversee Centerplan's work on the job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:6-11. Mr. Beach testified that he did not tell anyone that the City had to terminate Centerplan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:12-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By letter dated June 6, 2016, the City terminated the DBA claiming \"continued defaults\" by Centerplan. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 30; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 30 Resp.; Dkt. 82-15 (June 6, 2016 City DBA Termination Letter) ]. By letter dated June 9, 2016, the City made formal demand on the Hartford Stadium Project performance bond to Arch. [Dkt. 82-16 (June 9, 2016 City Demand Letter) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Immediately after Centerplan's termination, Arch began an investigation into the Hartford Stadium Project regarding the allegations of default, which lasted from June through September. [Dkt. 134 (1.29.2018 PJR Hr'g Tr.) at 152:20-158:23; Dkt. 89-12 (Arch Rog. Resps.) at Rog. 14 Resp.]. Arch employed construction consultant Cashin, Spinelli and Ferretti, LLC (\"CSF\") to assist in its investigation of the claims. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; Dkt. 89-12 at\n   Rog. 7 Resp.; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6\u00b6 32-34]. In addition to CSF, Arch retained Attorney Matthew Horowitz to advise it on legal matters. [Dkt. 89-12 at Rog. 9 Resp.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a general matter, CSF was charged with investigating and assessing the claims, including reviewing the status of work (i.e., whether the work was performed in compliance with contract documents, what it would cost to finish, and how long it would take to finish). [Dkt. 134 at 152:20-158:23; Dkt. 89-12 at Rog. 7 Resp.]. CSF's investigation was extensive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 152:20-158:23; 187:7-23]. They did numerous walk-throughs of the Project site, evaluating room by room what work Centerplan had completed and what it had not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 155:5-15, 182:16-184:15]. CSF held meetings with representatives of the City, DoNo, and Centerplan both at the stadium and off-site.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 158:24-163:1, 164:9-167:8. They also inspected voluminous documents throughout the course of the investigation, including plans, specifications, requisitions, change orders, change directives, subcontracts, accounts payable, and correspondence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:20-158:23, 163:2-187:22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89-12 at Rog. 13 Resp.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Near the end, but before completing its investigation and submitting its report to Arch, CSF asked DoNo and Centerplan for their input. Both refused to assist CSF assess the claims on the Bonds made by the City and Project subcontractors. [Dkt. 134 at 187:9-22]. Although they were present during parts of the investigation, with one exception, neither DoNo or Centerplan challenged the claims. Centerplan objected to Arch paying a payment bond claim, arguing the \"pay if paid\" provision precluded it; Arch looked into the applicability and determined the \"pay if paid\" clause did not provide a defense for Arch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:17-83:11, 85:13-87:19. With the exception of this one instance, there is no evidence that Centerplan or DoNo asked Arch not to pay, compromise, resist, defend, litigate or otherwise challenge the claims; nor is there any evidence that Centerplan or DoNo posted collateral to secure any amount which may be due if Arch unsuccessfully challenged any claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CSF also conducted a careful review of the state of the Project financials, including the value of work completed and payments made by the City for that work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DBA and DSA established that Centerplan would submit monthly Applications for Payment, or Requisitions, to DoNo for review and approval, and ultimately submission in the form of a Draw Request to the City. [Dkt. 82-10 (DBA) at \u00a7 5.1; Dkt. 82-9 (DSA) at 7-8, \u00a7 3(e)(1) ]. Upon submission, HSA and the City would review and approve the Draw Request and pay DoNo the approved amount. [Dkt. 82-9 at 7, \u00a7 3(e)(1) ]. DoNo would then pay Centerplan usually within 30 days of submission of the Requisition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 82-10 at \u00a7 5.1.3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties agree, and the evidence shows, that Requisition 16, encompassing work done on the Project in April, as well as all prior requisitions submitted, were paid for by the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 64:13-21, 67:7-15, 188:7-18; Dkt. 117 at 138:9-17; Dkt. 118 at 65:2-4]. The parties further agree that Requisition 17, for work done in May, was not submitted to DoNo or the City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; [Dkt. 118 at 65:2-4]. The only version of Requisition 17 that Arch knew of during the investigation in 2016 was an unsigned, unsubmitted draft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 100:18-20, 101:22-25, 220:13-16]. All the information and documentation available to Arch at the time, and in the record before the Court, establish the City paid all requisitions submitted, and thus amounts due on the Project; and there is no evidence the City received and failed to pay any requisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 17, 2016, Arch entered into the \"Takeover Agreement\" with the City and HSA, agreeing to the complete construction of the Hartford Stadium Project. [Dkt. 82-17 (Oct. 17, 2016 Takeover Agreement) ]. As of December 7, 2017, Arch had made $ 16,269,435.81 in payments to complete work on the Hartford Stadium Project. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 37; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 37 Resp.]. Arch provided copies of the vouchers and other evidence of these payments to Defendants. [Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 40-42; Dkt. 90 at \u00b6 41 Resp.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In multiple letters dated August 5, 2016, Arch gave notice to Defendants of the claims on the Bonds and made demand upon Defendants to procure Arch's discharge from the Bonds issued on the Bonded Projects and hold harmless and indemnify Arch for its losses incurred and to be incurred as a result of having issued the Bonds. [Dkt. 81-22 (Aug. 5, 2016 Arch Demand Letters) ]. Additionally, in multiple letters dated August 19, 2016, Arch demanded collateral security in the amount of $ 18,807,737.47-Arch's estimated pending exposure under the Bonds issued to secure payment and performance on Bonded Projects-from Defendants under the Indemnity Agreements. [Dkt. 81-23 (Aug. 19, 2016 Arch Demand Letters) ]. Arch updated the demand on Defendants for collateral security-with Arch's pending exposure under the Bonds then estimated at $ 38,313,100.82-by letter dated October 13, 2017. [Dkt. 81-24 (Oct. 13, 2017 Arch Demand Letter) ]. Defendants argue that Arch has not incurred losses as a result of having issued the Bonds because Arch volunteered to settle claims and perform work for which they were not liable. Defendants have not provided collateral security or indemnified Arch as demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Arch filed its complaint against Defendants on November 16, 2016, seeking contractual indemnification (Count I), common law indemnification (Count II), contractual collateral security (Count III), common law exoneration (Count IV),\n   <em>\n    quia timet\n   </em>\n   (Count V), and disclosure of Defendants' financials under the Indemnity Agreements (Count VI).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ]. Defendants claim multiple defenses to Arch's demands for indemnification and collateral security, and brought counterclaims against Arch alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, surety bad faith, tortious interference with contractual relations, and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n    Conn.

In the event of any payment by the Surety the Indemnitors further agree that in any accounting between the Surety and the Indemnitors, the Surety shall be entitled to charge for any and all disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the matters herein contemplated by this Agreement under the belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to make such disbursements, whether or not such liability, necessity or expediency existed; and that the vouchers or other evidence of any such payments made by the Surety shall be\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of the fact and amount of the liability to the Surety. As used in this paragraph, \"good faith\" means honesty in fact and the absence of malice or fraud).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [Dkt. 82-7 at \u00b6 4]. Further, the 2010 Indemnity Agreements contain the following provision regarding the Surety's rights to settle claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Surety shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any claim, liability, suit or judgment made or brought against Surety on any Bond shall or shall not be paid, compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed, and Surety's decision thereon shall be final and binding upon the Indemnitors.... [I]f Principal or Indemnitors desire that the Surety litigate such claim or demand, or defend such suit or appeal from such judgment, they shall deposit with the Surety, at the time of such request, cash or collateral satisfactory to the Surety in kind and amount to be used in paying any judgment or judgments rendered, or which might be rendered, against the Surety, together with interest, costs and attorneys [sic] fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [Dkt. 82-5 at 3; Dkt. 82-6 at 3]. The 2016 Indemnity Agreement includes the exact same provision, except it specifies that\n   <em>\n    only the surety\n   </em>\n   has the right to decide how to handle claims. [Dkt. 82-7 at 5 (\"Surety shall have the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   and exclusive right ...\") (emphasis added) ]. The 2016 Indemnity Agreement was entered into around the time the DBA was amended by the \"Term Sheet\" to extend the substantial completion date and increase the cost of the Hartford Stadium Project beyond the date and amount originally agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on these provisions, Arch argues that it is entitled, as a matter of law, to indemnification for any and all disbursements made in good faith regardless of the actual liability of Arch or the principal, and that the evidence it has provided proves the fact and amount of Defendants' liability under the express terms of the 2016\n   Indemnity Agreement. [Dkt. 82-2 (Mem. to Mot. Summ. J. Counts I &amp; II) at 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants do not argue that the contractual provisions are ambiguous. Rather, they argue that the Indemnity Agreements must be construed in connection with the Bonds (and any incorporated contracts) to which they relate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89 (Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. Counts I &amp; II) at 11]. Defendants contend that Arch must be held to the terms of the Bonds it issued, and further argue that the Bonds incorporate the DBA such that the terms of the DBA are at play as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. They suggest that the interplay of the Bonds, the Indemnity Agreements, and the DBA created a complex and contradictory set of rights and obligations which, had Arch bothered to look, would show that the City and certain subcontractors were not entitled to make claims on the Bonds, and therefore, Arch should not have made payments or performed on the Bonds. [Dkt. 89 at 13-15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In particular, Defendants invoke the Multiple Obligee Rider, which was executed and attached to the Bonds on February 4, 2015, and which states: \"there shall be no liability on the part of the Principal or Surety under this Bond to the Obligees ... unless the Obligees ... shall make payments ... and shall perform all the other obligations required to be performed under said Contract at the time and in the manner therein set forth.\" [Dkt. 82-12 (Hartford Stadium Performance and Payment Bonds and Dual Obligee Rider) at 8]. Defendants argue that the City failed to pay Centerplan for work completed in May 2016 as required by the DBA, or at least failed to assure Defendants that it would be able to pay, and, as a result, neither Centerplan nor Arch were liable to the City under the Multiple Obligee Rider. [Dkt. 89 at 14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   But the terms of the Bonds do not govern Arch's right to indemnification; the Indemnity Agreements do, and specifically the latest Indemnity Agreement. This is because the parties entered into express contracts with clear and unambiguous terms governing indemnification, with the latest being executed on February 1, 2016. \"[W]hen the parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing, in such terms as import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagement, it is conclusively presumed, that the whole engagement of the parties, and the extent and manner of their understanding, was reduced to writing.\"\n   <em>\n    Tallmadge Bros. v.

This Court does not discern a difference between evidence of owner/obligee default versus contractor/principal default such that a departure from the express terms of the Indemnity Agreements, as well as from case law, is warranted based on the distinguishable facts here. Either way, Defendants executed express Indemnity Agreements in favor of Arch obligating them to provide indemnification when Arch settled claims in good faith. In the beginning of 2016, when it was becoming clear that Centerplan would not meet the terms of the DBA, as evidenced by the need for the Term Sheet, Arch had seven of the Indemnitor Defendants execute the 2016 Indemnity Agreement with even stronger and more clear language as to Arch's right to indemnification.

Even more important, as the majority of courts have explained, defenses to actual liability do not impact a surety's\n   right to indemnification under an indemnity agreement other than as a consideration of whether the surety acted in bad faith.

These cases are inapposite because the Indemnity Agreements gave Arch the discretion to compromise and determine when to pay claims. Indeed, this discretion was the dispositive fact in\n   <em>\n    Suntech\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suntech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%201113\">\n    72 A.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither case held a surety with authority to compromise\n   claims was obligated to reject claims where reason dictated the claims be paid. Thus, the issue is whether Arch paid the claims in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Here, Arch presented ample evidence to suggest that it settled the payment bond claims in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 247:2-22, 249:2-250:2]. Mr. Beach and Michael Spinelli, of CSF, both testified at the PJR hearing that Arch and CSF investigated the impact of the pay if paid provisions and concluded that they were not a viable defense to liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:21-86:19, 247:2-22, 249:2-250:2. Part of this assessment was based on the fact that, while the City had paid Centerplan for Requisition 16, Centerplan had not used that money to fully compensate its subcontractors for the Requisition 16 work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:15-85:24. Thus, for some work, the City paid Centerplan, but Centerplan did not pay its subcontractors, eliminating the viability of the pay if paid defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, they found that the best way to finish the project was to pay, and then continue using, the existing contractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:19-71:8, 247:2-250:2. Arch reached this conclusion because of the inchoate state of work.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 182:23-184:15. Subcontractor work was not only incomplete, but also concealed behind walls and other building elements such that only the subcontractors could quickly and accurately assess the work remaining to be done.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, Arch had no authority to demand or leverage to induce subcontractors which Defendants had not paid to continue working on the Stadium Project unless it agreed to pay them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 247:7-248:25, 249:16-250:2. Arch concluded the safest and most expedient course was to keep the existing subcontractors on the Stadium Project, even at a marginally greater cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the evidence suggests that Arch exercised its discretion under the 2016 Indemnity Agreement to compromise claims to avoid construction defects and mitigate the damage of further delay in the completion of the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants offer and there is no other evidence on the record suggesting Arch had an impermissible motive. Defendants neither allege or present evidence to so little as suggest Arch derived or was promised any benefit from paying the subcontractors, aside from mitigating the risk of further delay and construction defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants claim to have notified Arch on numerous occasions that Arch should not pay subcontractors' claims because the City had not yet paid Centerplan and Arch's decision to go ahead and settle those claims evidences bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89-2 \u00b6 114; Dkt. 89-10 (Oct. 3, 2016 Letter from Centerplan to Arch) ]. First, Mr. Landino's affidavit asserts legal conclusions not facts; and, critically, Defendants do not provide any evidence to show that they requested Arch litigate these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 82-5 \u00b6 5; Dkt. 82-6 \u00b6 5; Dkt. 82-7 \u00b6 8]. Moreover, they failed to post the collateral to cover the cost of any judgment that might result from that litigation as required by the Indemnity Agreements to transfer the discretion to compromise claims from Arch to Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Indemnity Agreements state, \"if Principal or Indemnitors desire that the Surety litigate such claim or demand, or defend such suit, or appeal from such judgment, they shall deposit with the Surety, at the time of such request, cash or collateral satisfactory to the Surety in kind and amount to be used in paying any judgment or judgments rendered, or which might be rendered, against the Surety, together with interest, costs and attorneys [sic] fees.\" [Dkt. 82-5 at 3; Dkt. 82-6 at 3; Dkt. 82-7 at 5]. Defendants do not claim to have told Arch to challenge the subcontractors' claims. Nor do they claim to have posted cash or collateral for the cost and\n   potential judgment associated with making such a challenge, as required by the Indemnity Agreements' right to settle claims provisions. Thus, Defendant's protests do not oblige Arch to defer to their judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Courts have found that this weighs against, and can even defeat, a claim that the fact of a surety's settlement evidences bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Feibus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684564\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/579/#p583\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Courts have held that a principal's failure to deposit collateral security, in violation of a surety agreement, weighs against a finding that the surety acted in bad faith in settling claims.\");\n   <em>\n    Merritt-Meridian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11901597\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/975/511/\">\n    975 F.Supp. at 517-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding surety entitled to summary judgment because defendant did not deposit collateral security and request surety defend against claims and because there was no evidence of bad faith);\n   <em>\n    Able Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391979\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/749/1100/#p1102\">\n    749 F.Supp. at 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that argument that payments on claims made in order to forego litigation evidenced bad faith could not withstand indemnitor's failure to request that surety litigate or defend against claim and post collateral for expenses and potential losses).

As such, the fact that Arch made a payment where a potential defense existed is not evidence of bad faith on its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   While Centerplan claims to have had viable defenses to liability on the contractors' payment bond claims, it does not allege, and there is nothing on the record to indicate, that they raised with Arch those defenses in a manner and at a time which rendered Arch's act of settling those claims in bad faith. The fact that they may have had defenses does not mean that Arch's payments were in bad faith, especially in light of the evidence to the contrary and Defendants' failure to produce evidence beyond the payments themselves. Thus, Defendants have failed to raise an issue of material fact as to whether Arch acted in bad faith in settling claims on the payment bonds due to the pay if paid provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   ii. Alleged self-interested actions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that evidence of alleged self-interested actions established a factual basis upon which a reasonable jury could conclude Arch acted in bad faith. In support, they argue that Arch's admission that settling certain payment bond claims was \"expedient\" evidences self-interested settlement and bad faith. [Dkt. 89 at 24]. Additionally, Defendants argue that Arch's refusal to take any action pursuant to the performance bond until the City terminated Centerplan and its subsequent engagement in the Takeover Agreement to complete performance of the DBA were in bad faith. [Dkt. 89 at 25-27].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Notably, as the Connecticut Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    PSE Consulting\n   </em>\n   , \"even though motives of self-interest\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   constitute bad faith under some circumstances, it does not follow that the self-interested exercise of rights under a contract\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   constitutes a per se violation of the implied covenant of good faith\n   and fair dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    PSE Consulting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=838%20A.2d%20135\">\n    838 A.2d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Further, as discussed above, Defendants did not request that Arch litigate the claims and post collateral, even further reducing the merit to any claim of bad faith by Arch in not doing so. In addition, the testimony evidences Arch's good faith in settling the payment bond claims, having concluded that they would save money, complete the project faster, and avoid construction defects, thereby mitigating damages, by bringing the original subcontractors back on the job. [Dkt. 134 at 247:2-250:2]. As noted above, Defendants have presented no evidence that Arch was motivated by any objective other than mitigating further delay, construction defects and attendant costs or damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendants also suggest that Arch's actions in settling the City's performance bond claim-declining to step in while Centerplan was still engaged and later entering into the Takeover Agreement-were self-interested and in bad faith. [Dkt. 89 at 25]. Mr. Landino claims that, at a meeting between the City, Arch, DoNo, and Centerplan, Mr. Beach told the City that Arch would only step in and serve as contractor if the City terminated Centerplan, the DBA, and the DSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684564\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/579/#p583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6 83]. Defendants further claim that Arch entered into the Takeover Agreement for the project in its own unspecified interest after failing to investigate the City's conduct and claim of Centerplan's default, as well as Centerplan's allegations that it was the City that was in default. [Dkt. 89 at 25; Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 112, 118-19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants offer no actual evidence that any of these actions were beneficial to Arch. They assert only labels and conclusions that Arch took these actions in bad faith. Mr. Landino's affidavit includes conclusory allegations of insufficient investigation and bad faith by Arch, but provides very little detail and no sources for these claims, and no supporting testimony or documentary evidence. The contracts Defendants invoke and Arch's actions on their own do not show any improper motive or dishonest purpose. Absent admissible evidence of any motive other than to complete the long-delayed Stadium Project while minimizing the risk of construction defects, much less an improper motive, the Court finds no issue of fact for a jury to decide. On the contrary, the record facts point in the other direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For instance, the Direct Agreement executed by Centerplan, DoNo, and the City corroborates Arch's statement that it could not act while the DSA and DBA were still operative is consistent with Section 8 of the Direct Agreement which provides that the City may step into DoNo's shoes as Owner of the bonded contract (the DBA) \"but only upon ... termination of the [DSA] by the City for a [DoNo] Default thereunder.\" [Dkt. 82-11 (Direct Agreement) at 7]. Thus, under the Direct Agreement, the City would only have rights under the DBA, including the right to make a claim upon the bond, if it terminated the DSA. Therefore, Arch's statement that it could not act on the City's claim of default and demand on the bond until there was a termination does not seem to have been a misrepresentation or in bad faith, but rather,\n   a necessity. Defendant's offer no evidence to refute the reasonableness of Arch's interpretation and no evidence of an ulterior motive for what appears to be a reasonable interpretation of the operative agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Additionally, even if Arch could, it makes sense that Arch would decline to step in and supervise the stadium project while Centerplan was still contractor of record. Arch was not unreasonable in deciding not to usurp the role of its principal while the principal was still performing under the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 117 at 184:22-185:12]. The decision was also consistent with Centerplan's position, its representative having told Mr. Beach at the meeting that Arch should decline the request to become involved in the Project because doing so would validate the City's position that Centerplan was in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120:4-121:3, 184:5-11. Thus, there is no evidence that Arch's statements were made in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As for the Takeover Agreement, Arch negotiated the preservation of Centerplan's and DoNo's rights and defenses in consideration for taking over the completion of the Stadium Project. The Takeover Agreement specifically reserves all rights of Centerplan and DoNo against the City, including but not limited to claims and defenses under the DBA and the performance bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 82-17 (Takeover Agreement) at 6]. Further, it provided an avenue for Arch and the City to move forward with completing the Project rather than letting the situation continue to deteriorate and potential damages continue to build, mitigating damages for which Defendants would be liable as well. The fact that it also included a release provision for Arch does not mean that it was entered into in bad faith. Sureties must be able to engage in logical and efficient business practices while also protecting their own interests without an automatic conclusion of bad faith. Defendants have provided no evidence outside the Takeover Agreement-which in and of itself does not show bad faith-that Arch entered into the agreement with an improper motive or dishonest purpose. And \"[c]onclusory allegations of bad faith are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment in favor of a surety seeking to enforce an indemnification agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Merritt-Meridian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11901597\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/975/511/\">\n    975 F.Supp. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   iii. Arguments of deficient investigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that Arch acted in bad faith by not investigating certain of the claims, failing to use a construction consultant to review each claim, and failing to ask Centerplan or Center Earth about each and every claim. [Dkt. 89 at 24; Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 113-15]. Additionally, as noted\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , Defendants contend that Arch failed to investigate the City's termination of the DBA and declaration of default against Centerplan, as well as the City's own potential default status. [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 112; Dkt. 90 at 15-16]. These facts and arguments also fail to raise an issue of material fact as to whether Arch acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A surety is under an obligation to conduct a proper investigation and a deficient investigation, along with other evidence of improper motive, may evidence a surety's bad faith.\n   <em>\n    PSE Consulting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=838%20A.2d%20135\">\n    838 A.2d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Dkt. 82-1 at \u00b6 17]. Arch has provided evidence that, with the assistance of construction consultant CSF, it investigated the claims made on the bonds, asked Centerplan for their position on the claims, and then determined if it had liability for each claim. [Dkt. 82-4 (Beach Aff.) at \u00b6\u00b6 51-54]. In correspondence from Arch to Defendants dated August 19, 2016, Arch explained that its investigation of the claims on the Hartford Stadium Project Bonds \"has focused substantially on determining the financial status of the contract funds, the financial status of each of the subcontracts and the remaining work scope of each subcontractor, and the scope of work and the costs necessary to complete the Stadium Project.\" [Dkt. 81-23 (Aug. 19, 2016 Demand Letter) at 4-5]. Arch further explained that it had \"attempted to investigate the financial condition of [Centerplan], the status of the other Bonded Projects and the merits of [the City's] termination decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   At the Hearing on Arch's Motion for PJR, Mr. Spinelli testified that CSF was tasked with investigating and evaluating the claims, including looking into whether the work was performed in compliance with contract documents, what it would cost to finish, and how long it would take to finish. [Dkt. 134 at 154:9-155:23]. He further testified that CSF inspected voluminous documents throughout the course of the investigation, including plans, specifications, requisitions, agreements, change orders, change directives, correspondence, subcontracts to requisitions, accounts payable, and the cost to complete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:20-158:23, 163:2-187:22. CSF also held meetings with representatives of the City, DoNo, and Centerplan both at the stadium and off-site.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1158:24-163:1, 164:9-167:8. Even further, CSF asked them, but DoNo and Centerplan refused to help it assess the claims made by the City and Stadium Project subcontractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187:9-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To combat this evidence of good faith investigation regarding payment bond claims, Defendants merely provide vague and conclusory statements in the affidavit of Mr. Landino claiming Arch did not take such steps with respect to each and every claim, without any evidentiary support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6 113-15]. Even if Defendants presented facts tending to show Arch failed to present some claims to Defendants, this would only indicate negligence but would not amount to evidence of bad faith on its own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feibus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684564\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/579/#p583\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The fact that a surety makes payments without giving notice to the principal is not evidence of bad faith.\"). Further, Defendants have not provided any evidence that Arch's failure to present some claims was based on an improper motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   With regard to the performance bond claim, Defendants rely on a review of the performance bond, the DBA, and the work that Arch ultimately did to complete the Hartford Stadium Project as compared with what Centerplan believes was necessary, as well as Mr. Landino's affidavit, in arguing that Arch either did not conduct a sufficient investigation or knowingly elected to perform work that wasn't covered by the DBA. [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6 101, 94-100]. Again, Defendants argue that Arch had no obligation to act under the performance bond because of the City's own default and\n   alleged inability to pay and that Arch completed the project, executing substantial work outside the DBA, without regard for potential defenses to liability, such as the exclusion of liability for costs/work covered by professional liability insurance. [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 100-103].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   These arguments fail for multiple reasons. First, evidence on the record refutes Defendants' claims. Second, Mr. Landino's opinion unsupported by any facts is not evidence of Arch's bad faith; it is merely a conclusory label devoid of factual content insufficient to surmount summary judgment. Third, Mr. Landino ceded total discretion to compromise claims to Arch in the 2016 Indemnity Agreement. Finally, a difference of professional judgment or opinion as to a course of action alone does not constitute bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Regarding the City's inability or failure to pay, Mr. Landino asserts that \"[a]s of June 5, 2016, Centerplan was owed millions of dollars based on the accounting on Requisition 17\" and that \"Centerplan also had claims for additional compensation to cover the Change Order work and CCD work which for the most part was underway or committed and not reflected in the requisition.\" [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6 86]. Additionally, Mr. Landino claims that \"[a]s of June 6, 2016, the City had advised Centerplan and the Surety that it did not have enough funds on hand to pay for the changes it had ordered and specifically did not have the money to pay the May requisition which had been approved by the Architects and the City's Owners Representatives and was in process to be approved the following day at the scheduled HSA meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Accordingly, Defendants claim that the City had failed to pay Centerplan for the \"outstanding requisitions, changes, and the remaining work,\" [Dkt. 89 at 15], and that \"Arch should have known that the City did not have the funds.\" [Dkt. 89-2 \u00b6 97]. Defendants contend that Arch's performance under these circumstances constitutes bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112. Despite these conclusory claims, the actual evidence and relevant contracts show that the City had made payments for all requisitions that were submitted as required by the contracts and the Multiple Obligee Rider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The DBA establishes that DoNo will make progress payments to Centerplan based upon \"Applications for Payment\" covering one calendar month. [Dkt. 82-10 (DBA) at \u00a7 5.1]. Centerplan is to submit to DoNo the itemized \"Application for Payment,\" notarized and supported by data substantiating the requested payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 A.9.3.1. The DSA establishes that DoNo is \"responsible for reviewing, approving, and submitting Draw Requests\" to be paid out to Centerplan for work done on the Project. [Dkt. 82-9 (DSA) at 7, \u00a7 3(e)(1) ]. Under the DBA, DoNo \"shall, within seven days after receipt of [Centerplan's] Application for Payment, issue to [Centerplan] a written acknowledgement of receipt ... indicating the amount [DoNo] has determined to be properly due and, if applicable, the reasons for withholding payment in whole or in part.\" [Dkt. 82-10 at \u00a7 A.9.4.1]. DoNo must submit the Draw Request associated with the Application \"for review and approval of the Executive Director of the Hartford Stadium Authority (the 'HSA Director') and the City's Representative.\" [Dkt. 82-9 at 7, \u00a7 3(e)(1) ]. If DoNo receives an Application for Payment by the 10th day of the month, DoNo will pay Centerplan by the 10th day of the following month, and if received after the 10th day of the month, DoNo will pay Centerplan within 30 days of receipt of the Application. [Dkt. 82-10 at \u00a7 5.1.3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The parties agree that Requisition 16, for work done on the Project in April, as\n   well as all prior requisitions, were affirmed and paid for by the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 (1.29.18 PJR Hr'g Tr.) at 64:13-21, 67:7-15, 188:7-18; Dkt. 117 (11.06.17 PJR Hr'g Tr.) at 138:9-17; Dkt. 118 (2.15.18 PJR Hr'g Tr.) at 65:2-4]. There is no evidence that any requisition was submitted to the City after Requisition 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As for Requisition 17, for the work done on the Project in May, Mr. Landino testified at the PJR Hearing that Centerplan never submitted it to DoNo, [Dkt. 118 at 65:2-4], and thus DoNo never submitted a Draw Request for Requisition 17 to the City for payment. The version of Requisition 17 submitted by Defendants in opposition to Arch's motions for summary judgment corroborates Mr. Landino's testimony. In addition, that version was not in the form required for submission for payment. That version does not include the Architect's signature certifying the requested payment, as the form appears to require.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   It also impeached Mr. Landino's testimony suggesting it was submitted to the City for payment because it was signed by Centerplan's representative on June 22, 2016, see [Dkt. 89-6 (Requisition 17 Draft) at PDF p. 2], more than two weeks after Mr. Landino claims the Architects and the City's Owners Representatives had approved the Requisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   There is no evidence in the record that Centerplan submitted a fully executed version of Requisition 17 to DoNo-there is no notice of receipt as called for by the DBA or other transmittal documentation. There is no evidence that it was approved by DoNo, sent to the City, and approved by the Architects, the City, and HSA as required by the contracts. And there is no evidence whatsoever that the City received the Requisition and declined or withheld payment. Nor do Defendants go so far as to allege that these events took place; no doubt because they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Prior to the PJR Hearing, Arch representatives had knowledge only of an unsigned draft Requisition 17, and saw the incomplete version signed by Centrplan alone only days before the hearing on January 29, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 100:18-20, 101:22-25, 220:13-16]. The only evidence that Arch had during the summer of 2016, and indeed that the Court has now, is that the City paid all Requisitions submitted for payment by Defendants. Arch cannot be held responsible for failing to take into account non-payment by the City when evidence of said non-payment did and does not exist. Not only is there no evidence that Arch failed to adequately investigate the City's default, but there also is no evidence that the City was in default by failing to make payments to Centerplan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants also seem to suggest that Arch acted in bad faith by performing despite the City's representation of its inability to pay for the changes it ordered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89-2 at \u00b6 90]. But no contract required the City to affirm its ability to pay future Draw Requests. The contracts required the City to pay the amounts reviewed, approved, and requested by DoNo, which the City faithfully did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Arch, through CSF, reviewed the change orders and CCDs extensively as part of its investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 189:11-14, 190:8-23, 198:23-203:21]. CSF looked at each line item to determine the nature of the change, concluding that the majority of the changes were the result of building code compliance issues and design errors and omissions, with few owner add-on items.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163:6-164:8. The City paid for the work associated with these change directives which had already been reported in a requisition and submitted to the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 134 at 64:13-21, 67:7-15, 188:7-18; Dkt. 117 at 138:9-17; Dkt. 118 at 65:2-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants do not suggest that the City failed to pay for the work associated with the changes, only that the City represented that it did not have the money to pay. Until Centerplan submitted a Requisition / Application for Payment, with respect to the change directive work or otherwise, which the City failed to pay-which never occurred-Arch could not have been expected to find the City in default or failure to satisfy conditions precedent to making a demand on the performance bond. Nor could Arch reasonably come to such a conclusion based on the fact that the City had not affirmatively stated that it would be able to pay future Draw Requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Further, Arch's ultimate determination that entering into the Takeover Agreement and completing the project for around $ 16,000,000 made more sense than litigating the claim and allowing the incomplete project to continue to decline with potential damages climbing towards the penal sum of $ 47,050,000 was not unreasonable. \"[E]vidence that a surety paid claims to lessen its own liability does not support a finding of bad faith\" on its own.\n   <em>\n    Feibus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684564\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/579/#p583\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants again cite\n   <em>\n    K. Capolino\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dinow\n   </em>\n   in arguing that the Court must consider the related contracts and the liability of the surety and principal thereunder. For the same reasons the Court explained\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at Section I.A., this Court does not find either case persuasive. Even more importantly, those cases analyzed indemnification provisions, rather than collateral security provisions. As such, their analysis is not on point here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v.

But success of this argument would controvert the purpose of collateral security. Collateral security is an interim remedy meant to provide protection to a surety guarantor in the face of anticipated exposure as a result of bonds issued on behalf of the principal. A surety is entitled to such protection because its obligation is always secondary to the principal's. Refusing to provide security until after liability is litigated would defeat the very purpose of it.

As a result, Arch's motion for preliminary injunction is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court GRANTS Arch's motion for summary judgment as to Counts I, III, and VI and DISMISSES Counts II, IV, and V, and DENIES as moot the motion for preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Defendants are ORDERED to serve on Plaintiff the financial disclosures outlined in Exhibit R of Arch's Motion for Summary Judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 82-20], within 14 days of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Based on the preceding, the Court holds that Arch is entitled to indemnification for all Loss, totaling $ 39,107,334.47. This includes all of those losses listed in Arch's Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I and II Exhibit K, Summary List of all the losses incurred by Arch under the Centerplan and Center Earth Payment Bond Claims, in the amount of $ 20,500,963.60; Exhibit P, Summary List of all the losses incurred by Arch under the Hartford Stadium Performance Bond Claim, in the amount of $ 16,269,435.81; and Exhibit Q, Summary List of all the attorney's fees and consultant fees incurred by Arch under the Payment Bond Claims and the Hartford Stadium Performance Bond Claim, in the amount of $ 2,336,935.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Defendants suggest in Mr. Landino's Affidavit and their Statement of Facts in Opposition that Arch has not provided copies of all the checks and wire transfers for which Arch now claims indemnification.
