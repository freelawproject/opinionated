(\"ARCO\") brings this action against Defendant CDM International Inc. (\"CDM International\") in connection with construction projects sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (\"USAID\") to rebuild schools and a health clinic in El Salvador after Tropical Storm Ida. Pursuant to separate contracts with USAID, CDM International assessed the sites and created preliminary designs for the projects, while ARCO used those preliminary designs to prepare final designs and then reconstruct the buildings. ARCO alleges that the site assessments and preliminary designs CDM International produced were defective and did not fulfill the company's obligations under its contract with USAID, causing ARCO to incur significant costs to complete its own contractual obligations to USAID. One of the seven claims ARCO brings against CDM International is for breach of contract (Count I). ARCO alleges it is a third-party beneficiary of CDM International's promise to USAID to conduct adequate site assessments and prepare preliminary designs for the school and clinic projects. CDM International has moved to dismiss Count I under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   CDM International's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following factual background comes from the complaint and must be taken as true at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foley v.

Founded in 1950, it is the oldest and one of the largest construction companies currently operating in El Salvador. It has completed major design and construction projections for the U.S. military and public and private entities in El Salvador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CDM International is a Massachusetts corporation operating out of Boston, Massachusetts. On September 29, 2008, CDM International entered into a master contract with USAID to serve as the architect and engineering firm (\"A/E\") for USAID projects worldwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Ida Reconstruction Project\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2009, Tropical Storm Ida hit El Salvador, causing flooding, landslides, and the destruction of homes, roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, and other infrastructure. USAID provided $ 25 million in funding to rebuild damaged infrastructure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 8, 2011, CDM International entered into Task Order No. AID-519-TO-12-00001 with USAID (\"CDM Task Order\"),\n   which specified its duties as the A/E for these reconstruction projects. It required CDM International to conduct studies and assessments of each project site and create preliminary designs and technical specifications. These preliminary designs had to constitute at least thirty percent of the final designs for each facility. The CDM Task Order also required CDM International to participate in the procurement process for design-build contractors, who would use the preliminary designs to create final designs and then actually reconstruct the facilities. Finally, CDM International had to supervise the work of the design-build contractors. Between 2011 and 2014, CDM International made numerous statements in public documents that it was completing preliminary designs of at least thirty percent of the final designs to assist the design-build contractors in making bids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In late 2013 and early 2014, USAID issued requests for proposals from design-build contractors for eight schools and one health clinic. In its solicitation documents, USAID explained that the final designs had to be based on CDM International's preliminary designs. ARCO only bid for these projects after USAID encouraged it to do so. In submitting its bids, ARCO relied on the preliminary designs and on representations by USAID and CDM International that these designs constituted at least thirty percent of the final designs for each project. USAID accepted both of ARCO's bids, and USAID and ARCO entered into contracts in late 2014 for the projects. Both contracts included CDM International's preliminary designs and repeated the promise that they constituted at least thirty percent of the final designs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Construction Problems and Delays\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After starting work on the projects, ARCO realized that CDM International's preliminary designs contained numerous defects and constituted substantially less than thirty percent of the final designs. For example, the designs for the schools failed to follow building-code requirements and did not account for soil-condition and subsurface issues. The designs for the health clinic failed to address flooding requirements, lacked a plan for bio-infectious waste disposal, and did not identify that the annex to the clinic was structurally unsound. Because of these errors, ARCO spent significant time and resources redrawing the designs; obtaining new permits; conducting additional excavation, soil compaction, and hydrogeological studies; and demolishing more structures than planned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ARCO also alleges that CDM International and USAID interfered with its work in other ways. USAID and CDM International delayed in responding to its concerns about the preliminary designs. CDM International failed to approve technical documents in a timely manner and maintain a proper document control system, used outdated technical specifications, utilized its supervisory role to prevent ARCO from executing its final designs, and caused numerous other delays. ARCO alleges that CDM International and USAID conspired to hide the problems with the preliminary designs and shifted blame to ARCO. Finally, ARCO contends that they avoided paying it for its work by determining that it had not substantially completed the projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because of these delays, USAID has withheld progress payments to ARCO and assessed liquidated damages. ARCO has also incurred additional costs due to these delays. In total, ARCO has not received almost $ 9 million it believes USAID owes for its work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ARCO filed suit against CDM International on November 9, 2018. Invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction, ARCO asserts seven causes of action: breach of contract, tortious inference with contractual relations, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy (concerted action), civil conspiracy (coercion), and unjust enrichment. In its breach of contract claim (Count I), ARCO alleges that it is an intended beneficiary of the CDM Task Order with USAID and suffered damages due to CDM International's deficient preliminary designs. On December 18, 2018, CDM International moved to dismiss only the breach of contract claim (Count I) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In analyzing whether a complaint states a claim sufficient to satisfy Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court must set aside any statements that are merely conclusory and examine only the pleader's factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

CDM International asks the Court to consider the CDM Task Order in evaluating whether ARCO states a claim for breach of contract.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   standard, such a conclusory allegation alone does not surpass the hurdle of a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bos. Exec.

Mass. 2016) (dismissing a third-party beneficiary claim where the complaint contained only a \"bald and unsupported assertion\" that the plaintiff was a third-party beneficiary of the contract).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The language of the CDM Task Order does not indicate that USAID and CDM International intended to benefit the design-build contractor for the school and clinic projects. The express purpose of the CDM Task Order is for CDM International to \"provide professional architecture and engineering (A/E) services for the technical tasks associated with USAID's Tropical Storm Ida Reconstruction Project.\" Dkt. No. 15-2 \u00b6 B.1. Nothing in this language suggests that the parties intended any benefit to ARCO. The CDM Task Order requires CDM International to conduct studies and assessments, create preliminary designs for the schools and clinics, assist with the bidding process for design-builder contractors, and then supervise the chosen design-build contractors. All of these tasks serve to benefit USAID and its reconstruction project. Although ARCO incidentally benefited from the studies and preliminary designs, there is no indication USAID and CDM International entered into this agreement with this benefit in mind. The lack of intent to benefit ARCO is even clearer in light of CDM International's supervisory role over the design-build contractor, as USAID entered into the CDM Task Order at least in part to oversee the contractor's performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley Landscape Co. v. Rolland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2130567\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/218/257/\">\n    218 Va. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=237%20S.E.2d%20120\">\n    237 S.E.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if the language of the CDM Task Order were ambiguous about the parties' intent, none of the facts alleged in the complaint plausibly supports an inference that it was meant to benefit ARCO. ARCO relies on statements by USAID and CDM International that CDM International would complete preliminary designs that the design-build contractors would use to bid and complete the reconstruction. These statements indicate that the parties intended for the design-build contractor to use CDM International's preliminary designs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   They do not, however, show that the purpose of the CDM Task Order was to benefit the design-build contractor rather than help USAID in its reconstruction efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The caselaw on point from other jurisdictions does not support third-party beneficiary status in the construction context without a clear indication of intent. This is because significant construction projects generally involve multiple contracts that are \"inevitably intertwined\" to ensure the project is completed in a timely manner according to the agreed-upon specifications.\n   <em>\n    E.C.
