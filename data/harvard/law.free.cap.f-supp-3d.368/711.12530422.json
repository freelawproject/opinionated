(\"Televisa\"), Emilio Fernando Azc\u00e1rraga Jean III (\"Azc\u00e1rraga\"), and Salvi Rafael Folch Viadero (\"Folch\") move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for Violation of the Federal Securities Laws (Dkt. No. 32) (the \"complaint\") under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4. For the following reasons, the motion (Dkt. No. 37) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lead plaintiff is the College of Applied Arts &amp; Technology Pension Plan, a pension plan that purchased 146,400 Televisa American Depository Receipts (\"ADRs\") and has suffered nearly a million dollars in losses due to defendants' alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants are Televisa - a multinational media conglomerate based in Mexico, and two of its executives, Azc\u00e1rraga and Folch. Azc\u00e1rraga is Televisa's former CEO, and its current controlling shareholder and executive chairman. Folch is Televisa's former CFO, and currently serves as head of its cable division and on the board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Televisa is the largest mass media company in the Spanish-speaking world. Its media business includes television production and broadcasting, programming, direct-to-home satellite services, publishing and publishing distribution, cable television, radio production, show business, feature films, and Internet portals. It has long touted its coveted broadcasting rights to the World Cup, stating that they are \"crucial\" to \"the company's competitive position.\" Those rights have enabled Televisa to hit financial targets across its platforms during tournament years and explain away disappointing results in off years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lead plaintiff asserts two claims: one for a violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and one for violation of \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FIFA Bribery Scheme\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case arises out of a sprawling investigation into bribery and corruption involving broadcast rights to several World Cup soccer matches granted by the Federation Internationale de Football Association (\"FIFA\"). The complaint alleges that Televisa participated in the bribery scheme by using its wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Mountrigi Management Group Ltd. (\"Mountrigi\") to bribe FIFA officials in exchange for broadcasting rights to the 2018, 2022, 2016, and 2030 FIFA World Cup tournaments. It further alleges that Televisa's internal controls over financial reporting were so inadequately designed that Televisa was able to avoid publicly disclosing the payments to FIFA, and that Azc\u00e1rraga and Folch knew or recklessly disregarded that millions of dollars were being misspent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The wide-ranging FIFA corruption probe became public in 2015, when Swiss officers arrested six FIFA officials gathered at a hotel in Zurich for an annual meeting. Since then, at least two dozen individuals and entities have been indicted by United States authorities in connection with the investigation. Several people have pled guilty or been convicted of related crimes, as recently as July 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One of the people who pled guilty to crimes relating to the investigation was Alejandro Burzaco (\"Burzaco\"), the former CEO of Torneos y Competencias SA (\"Torneos\"), an Argentine marketing company. Burzaco pled guilty on November 16, 2015 in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Juan Angel Napout, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 Cr. 252 (PKC) (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 13, 2016, Torneos entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Torneos y Competencias S.A.\n   </em>\n   , No 16 Cr. 634 (PKC) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2016). In the criminal information filed in\n   <em>\n    Torneos\n   </em>\n   that day, the government referred to Mountrigi as \"Broadcasting Company Affiliate A, an affiliate of a major broadcasting company headquartered in Latin America, which obtained from FIFA rights to broadcast the 2018, 2022, 2026, and 2030 editions of the World Cup in certain territories in Latin America.\"\n   <em>\n    Torneos\n   </em>\n   , Information (Dkt.

He testified that Televisa paid bribes in exchange for broadcasting rights:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q Have you ever worked in partnership with other sports media marketing companies?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q What are some examples of companies you worked with?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A We had many partners in different parts of the world, such as Fox Sports in the U.S.; Televisa from Mexico; Media Pro from Spain; TV Globo from Brazil; Full Play from Buenos Aires, Argentina; Traffic, which is based in Brazil, but was with a branch in Miami.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We were partners with Grupo Clarin in Argentina.

Eladio Rodriguez, a former Torneos employee who maintained the ledger, testified that heading of the ledger document was \"Iluminados,\" which \"means bribes,\"\n   <em>\n    Napout\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. at 2170:13-18 (Nov. 29, 2017), and that the ledger included \"legitimate payments and transactions\" in addition to bribes,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2173:19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On November 14, 2017, upon news that Televisa was named in the\n   <em>\n    Napout\n   </em>\n   trial as a participant in the FIFA bribery scheme, the price of Televisa ADRs dropped 2.4%, to close at $ 19.50 per share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Televisa's Reporting and Internal Controls\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    False or Misleading Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The complaint alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements in Televisa's SEC filings, earnings calls, and other public statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Form 20-F Filings.\n   </strong>\n   Televisa did not make certain required disclosures in their Form 20-F filings for 2012 through 2017.

The statements regarding Televisa's business operations and internal controls did not disclose that Televisa's internal controls were so inadequately designed or inefficient that Televisa and Mountrigi employees were able to engage in an unlawful bribery scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Earnings Conference Calls.\n   </strong>\n   Televisa executives boasted about the company's World Cup broadcasting rights during quarterly earnings conference calls between 2013 and 2017. For example, during Televisa's Q4 2012 Earnings Conference Call on February 26, 2013, Televisa's then-Executive Vice President, Alfonso de Angoitia, reported that \"we also will transmit many matches of the World Cup, also on an exclusive basis.\" Am.

During the April 26, 2013 earnings call, de Angoitia assured investors that, despite increasing competition for sports content, \"we hold the rights to the next three soccer World Cup's that are extremely relevant for Mexico.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. None of those statements indicated that Televisa obtained any of the World Cup broadcasting rights through bribery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Other Public Statement.\n   </strong>\n   On November 15, 2017, after Burzaco testified in\n   <em>\n    Napout\n   </em>\n   , a Televisa spokesperson, Alejandro Olmos, stated that \"Grupo Televisa in no way knew of, or condoned, any bribe or other improper conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Code of Ethics.\n   </strong>\n   Televisa adopted a code of ethics, which provides, \"Every person must act in accordance with this Code and with the applicable laws in Mexico and in any other jurisdictions in which the Group\n   carries out activities.\" Code of Ethics, at 1.

Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419372\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/600/#p632\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632-33 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    False or Misleading Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Likewise, the complaint pleads with particularity facts about defendants' false or misleading statements concerning Televisa's World Cup rights and internal controls. It alleges that defendants made misleading statements in earnings calls, public statements, and SEC filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   First, it alleges that Televisa representatives like de Angoitia made statements during earnings calls such as \"we hold the rights to the next three soccer World Cup's that are extremely relevant for Mexico,\" which implied that Televisa obtained its valuable World Cup broadcasting rights legally. Second, it alleges that Olmos, a Televisa spokesperson, insisted after Burzaco's testimony in\n   <em>\n    Napout\n   </em>\n   that \"Grupo Televisa in no way knew of, or condoned, any bribe or other improper conduct,\" which may be proved to be factually false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The complaint also pleads with particularity facts about Televisa's internal controls which, when viewed in the context of the complaint's other allegations, state a claim that the weak internal controls hid the bribery scheme until PwC discovered the skimming scheme in late 2017 after the\n   <em>\n    Napout\n   </em>\n   trial testimony and ledgers came to light. Televisa's Form 20-F filings and accompanying Sarbanes-Oxley certifications stated that the company's internal controls were adequate, despite - what its subsequent disclosure revealed - PwC's conclusion that \"certain material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2016.\" Although Televisa asserted in its 2017 Form 20-F that the material weaknesses did not result \"in improper activities or inaccuracies in or adjustments to our previously filed financial statements,\" the complaint's remaining factual allegations are nevertheless particularized enough to allege that Televisa's statements were misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Misstatements made in its certifications concerning the design and efficacy of internal controls are actionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras Securities Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362871\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/116/368/#p380\">\n    116 F.Supp.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380-81 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (allegations that \"the Company's management\n   was professing its opinion that the company's internal controls were effective, that same management was well aware of the extensive corruption in the Company's procurement activities ... are sufficient to infer that the Company disbelieved the alleged statements at the time they were made\"). The complaint alleges that the internal control deficiencies could only have resulted from deliberate design, and not from oversight, incompetence, or mistake. It alleges further that Televisa's suspension of internal controls allowed it to employ a \"skimming\" scheme to pay bribes, a process by which cash would be removed from Televisa before it entered the accounting system. Am. Compl. \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Duty to Disclose and Materiality\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The complaint adequately alleges that Televisa's failure to disclose the payment of bribes to FIFA officials rendered the statements discussed above misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Televisa, through its representatives, made statements that \"Grupo Televisa in no way knew of, or condoned, any bribe or other improper conduct,\" and that \"we hold the rights to the next three soccer World Cup's that are extremely relevant for Mexico.\" Even if Televisa was not otherwise obligated to disclose that it or its subsidiary participated in bribing FIFA officials, speaking about the issue imposed a duty to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

Mar. 30, 2017). If the revenue generated by the World Cup broadcasting rights was partly attributable to bribery, Televisa's statements about its World Cup broadcasting rights were plausibly materially misleading. Because those statements \"put its source of revenue at issue,\" they \"gave rise to Section 10(b) liability because the company failed to disclose the illegal conduct that generated the revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Virtus Inv. Partners, Inc. Sec.

Even if a reasonable investor did not consider $ 7.25 million a large sum, participation in the years-long bribery scheme is material because it exposed Televisa to potential civil and criminal liability, and imperiled its advertising revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Code of Ethics\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The representations made in Televisa's code of ethics are actionable as well. \"While generalized, open-ended or aspirational statements do not give rise to securities fraud (as mere puffery), statements contained in a code of conduct are actionable where they are directly at odds with the conduct alleged in a complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Signet Jewelers Ltd.

Nov. 26, 2018) (citation omitted). As the court held in\n   <em>\n    In re Electrobras Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   , \"when (as here alleged) the statements were made repeatedly in an effort to reassure the investing about the Company's integrity, a reasonable investor could rely on them as reflective of the true state of affairs at the Company.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274714\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/450/#p464\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Defendants' numerous statements here proclaimed the concrete steps Televisa was taking to ensure that its executives and employees did not violate the prohibition on bribery: it required board members and employees to sign and deliver to human resources an adherence letter, and to renew their acceptance of the code twice a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Scienter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The complaint pleads facts that give rise to a cogent inference that Televisa acted with scienter in making false and misleading statements regarding its participation in the FIFA bribery scheme. Burzaco's testimony that Televisa agreed to and bribed Grondona is corroborated by the Torneos ledger, which shows that Mountrigi made a $ 7.25 million payment for the 2026 and 2030 World Cup rights in a bank sub-account dedicated to Grondona. It is also corroborated by the criminal information filed in the Torneos case, which refers to Mountrigi as \"Broadcasting Company Affiliate A\" and alleges that it paid millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to a high-ranking FIFA official. Am. Compl. \u00b6 50. Engaging in deliberately illegal behavior, as well as admitting that there are material weaknesses in internal reporting, is probative of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Moreover, a subsidiary's (Mountrigi's) scienter may be imputed to the parent company (Televisa), particularly where the subsidiary is at the center of the alleged fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marsh &amp; Mclennan Companies, Inc.
