Addendum to Pet. \u00b6 15. The petitioner moved that court to withdraw his guilty plea on November 10, 1998, asserting that he was innocent, that he was coerced into pleading guilty, and that his lawyer rendered ineffective assistance in handling his criminal case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; Pet. Ex. 11 at 81-82. On that same day, the court denied the petitioner's motion without holding an evidentiary hearing and sentenced him to twenty-five years to life in prison.

Addendum to Pet. \u00b6 20.

The petitioner then applied for leave to appeal to the New York State Court of Appeals and his application was also denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207812677\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner has now filed a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition in this Court in which he challenges the state trial court's denial of his CPL \u00a7 440.10 motion on\n   grounds of actual innocence,\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and due process violations, and ineffective assistance of counsel. Pet. at 3. The respondent has moved to transfer this petition to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals as an unauthorized second or successive habeas petition because it challenges the same judgment of conviction that the petitioner collaterally attacked in the \u00a7 2254 petition he filed on August 6, 2002. The petitioner contends that the current petition is not a second or successive petition because (1) the current petition challenges the state court's CPL \u00a7 440.10 decision rather than his judgment of conviction, (2) the \u00a7 2254 petition he filed in 2002 failed to raise a constitutional violation and therefore was not adjudicated on the merits, and (3) the current petition raises federal claims not raised in the prior petition. The petitioner requests that, if the respondent's motion is granted, this Court nonetheless not stay this habeas proceeding and continue to decide matters related to his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A habeas petition is considered second or successive if, \"in a broad sense,\" it attacks the same judgment as a prior habeas petition.\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v.

In this case, the petitioner challenges the same judgment that he collaterally attacked in the \u00a7 2254 petition he filed in 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. at 2. That the petitioner does so by challenging the state-court decision denying his CPL \u00a7 440.10 motion, rather than challenging the 1998 judgment of conviction itself, is of no moment. The decision denying his CPL \u00a7 440.10 motion does not constitute a new \"judgment\" for habeas purposes; the relevant judgment - and the one which the petitioner actually attacks and seeks to vacate - is the 1998 judgment of conviction that sentences him to a term of twenty-five years to life imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burton v.
