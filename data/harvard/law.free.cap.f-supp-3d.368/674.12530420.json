The Court also noted that Petitioner described Tucker as a \"colleague,\" stated that Tucker was a partner at his firm with whom he had spoken \"on many, many, many, many, many occasions,\" and admitted that the two had had a business relationship for at least a decade. Dkt. No. 35 at 56. Taken together, this was sufficient evidence of \"a relationship between [Petitioner] and [Tucker] that suggests a\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    from the latter, or an intention to benefit the latter.\"\n    <em>\n     Martoma\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517513\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/64/#p79\">\n     894 F.3d at 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Petitioner argues that the facts in the record \"would not foreclose the possibility of a properly instructed jury acquitting Mr. Marshall.\" Dkt. No. 38 at 7-8.

Dkt. No. 37. In brief, from 2000 until 2008, Petitioner served as a member of the Board of Directors of the International Securities Exchange (\"ISE\"), in addition to running his financial consulting firm, Marshall, Tucker &amp; Associates, LLC. Dkt. No. 4, Ex. A at 20:2-5; Dkt. No. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. As an ISE board member, Petitioner learned material, non-public information related to discussions about a potential merger. Dkt. No. 22, Ex. C \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7. Petitioner provided this information to his business partner, Alan Tucker, who traded on the basis of the information and \"made a significant profit.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 7. The Government filed a complaint against Petitioner, Tucker, and one other defendant on March 13, 2008. Dkt. No. 4, Ex. B. Petitioner pled guilty on September 25, 2008, to a one count Information charging him with conspiracy to commit securities fraud in violation of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Dkt. No. 4, Ex. A. In his plea allocution, Petitioner stated that he \"gave hints about [the] merger discussions to a colleague with the knowledge that he would likely trade on that information.\" Dkt. No. 4, Ex. A at 20:5-10. Petitioner also confirmed that he had an agreement or understanding with Tucker.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n      at 23-24\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

No. 5 \u00b6 2.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     On April 24, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition in this Court for a writ of error coram nobis on the grounds of actual innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel. Dkt. No. 1. Petitioner's primary argument was that he is innocent as a matter of law because \"he never received or expected to receive any benefit of any kind in exchange for the informational tip he gave to Alan Tucker.\" Dkt. No. 1 at 5-6. In addition, the petition argues that Petitioner's trial counsel rendered constitutionally defective representation because he failed to raise the lack of an expected or actual benefit \"in connection with plea discussions, the acceptance of the plea agreement or otherwise during counsel's representation of Mr. Marshall.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n      at 1\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . On June 20, 2017 the Court denied the petition for a writ of error coram nobis on the grounds that there was \"sufficient evidence\" to support \"Petitioner's conviction for conspiracy to commit securities fraud.\" Dkt.

No. 38. As discussed below, neither the amended\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     opinion nor the factual allegations in the affidavit might have reasonably altered the result before the court, nor has Petitioner demonstrated \"the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n     <em>\n      Herschaft\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100128\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/139/282/#p284\">\n      139 F.Supp.2d at 284\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     Petitioner argues that the Court's Order should be amended because it relies on \"the now withdrawn\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     decision\" in determining that the personal benefit element was met. Dkt. No. 38 at 6-7. The Order cited the first\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     opinion's statement that \"a corporate insider personally benefits 'whenever he disclos[es] inside information as a gift ... with the expectation that [the recipient] would trade' on the basis of such information.\" Dkt. No. 35 at 5 (quoting\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263778\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/58/\">\n      869 F.3d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     69 ) (alterations original). Based in part on this formulation, the Court assessed Petitioner's admission that he provided information to Tucker with the expectation that Tucker would trade on it as evidence that he received a personal benefit.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263778\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/58/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Though the Court cited the then-operative opinion, its reasoning is equally permissible under the amended\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     opinion, which states that a jury can \"often infer that a corporate insider receives a personal benefit ... from deliberately disclosing valuable, confidential information without a corporate purpose and with the expectation that the tippee will trade on it.\"\n     <em>\n      United States v. Martoma\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517513\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/64/#p79\">\n      894 F.3d 64\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 79 (2d Cir. 2017). Although the law as articulated in the amended\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     opinion does not\n     <em>\n      require\n     </em>\n     a finding that the personal benefit element is met when the tipper expects the tippee will trade, an admission of that expectation is nonetheless relevant evidence.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     In addition, Petitioner contends that the Court failed to address his argument that his plea allocution was insufficient, but he points to no authority for the proposition that insufficiency of a plea allocution alone is a circumstance compelling the extraordinary relief he requests.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Dkt. No. 38 at 6. Indeed, courts routinely look to the totality of the record to determine whether a petitioner seeking a writ of error coram nobis has sufficiently shown actual innocence.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Barnetson v.

May 6, 2016) (\"The record on collateral review is not limited to the Petitioner's allocution, but includes materials such as the Information, the plea agreement, and the Presentence Report.\"). As discussed above, the amendments in\n     <em>\n      Martoma\n     </em>\n     do not alter the Court's conclusion that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support Petitioner's conviction.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     <strong>\n      B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     Petitioner also argues that the Court erred in its ineffective assistance of counsel analysis by overlooking his trial counsel's affidavit, in which Mr. Iason, his former lawyer, admits that he does \"not think it is likely that [he] would have discussed [the] legal issue\" of the personal benefit element with his client. Dkt. No. 20, Ex. A, at 2. The Court's June 20, 2017 Order does not specifically reference this affidavit.\n     <em>\n      See generally\n     </em>\n     Dkt. No. 35. Instead, the Order addresses Petitioner's argument as formulated in the Petition: that \"his lawyer's failure to recognize Mr. Marshall's innocence deprived Mr. Marshall of the effective assistance of counsel.\" Dkt. No. 1, at 9. This formulation of the ineffective assistance of counsel argument necessarily fails because, as explained in the Court's Order, Petitioner fails to establish actual innocence. Dkt. No. 35 at 6-7.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     To the extent that Petitioner raises a broader ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it is true that a showing of actual innocence is not required. It is well settled that the elements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim are that \"(1) defense\n     counsel's performance was objectively unreasonable; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\"\n     <em>\n      Kovacs v.
