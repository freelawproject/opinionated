Myers, deceased)'s Motion to Remand to State Court,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the Circuit Court of Franklin County, Mississippi\n   <strong>\n    (docket entry 13)\n   </strong>\n   . Myers asserts that the health insurance plan at issue in this case gives him the unrestricted right to litigate his claim in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In support of his motion, Myers shows that Pattie M. Myers was employed by United Mississippi Bank in Franklin County, Mississippi, and was insured under a health insurance policy or plan obtained through her employment. The plan was captioned \"Mississippi Bankers Association\n   Plan III\" and was underwritten, issued, insured, and administered by Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mississippi (\"BCBS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mrs. Myers was hospitalized at New Iberia Medical Center in New Iberia, Louisiana, from February 10, 2015, until her death on March 14, 2015. The hospital submitted a bill to BCBS for Mrs. Myers' final medical expenses in the total amount of $ 556,682. BCBS denied payment of the hospital bill on the basis that it was \"not a covered service\" under the plan in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mrs. Myers's husband, Marvin Myers, filed suit against BCBS in the Circuit Court of Franklin County, Mississippi for recovery of benefits due under the plan and for bad faith denial of benefits. BCBS removed the case to this Court, invoking federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . BCBS contends that the health plan is governed by ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq\n   </em>\n   , and that enforcement of ERISA raises a federal question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the telephonic case management conference, plaintiff's counsel raised the issue that the plan gave the plaintiff the choice of filing the case in state or federal court. Counsel for plaintiff told Magistrate Judge Parker that the plaintiff anticipated filing a motion to remand to enforce his right to choose state court as a forum. Magistrate Judge Parker, therefore, entered an order deferring entry of a case management order and directed the plaintiff to file a motion regarding the appropriate forum for this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel argues that the health plan in question is not subject to ERISA and does not implicate a federal question. Moreover, counsel insists that this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction. On November 19, 2018, the plaintiff filed a Motion to Remand (docket entry 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BCBS insists that its removal to this Court was proper, and that the Plan language relied upon by the plaintiff merely informs beneficiaries of their right under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , to file suit in state or federal court, a disclosure required by ERISA. It does not constitute a waiver of BCBS's statutory right to remove this action to federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 9, 2015, Mrs. Myers was admitted to New Iberia Surgery Center in New Iberia, Louisiana, to undergo a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a type of bariatric or weight loss surgery for treatment of morbid obesity. (Docket entry 1-1, Complaint at \u00b6 13). On February 10, 2015, following the surgery and after being discharged, Mrs. Myers began experiencing complications and was admitted to Iberia Medical Center, where she continued to suffer complications from the initial surgery until her death on March 14, 2015 (the \"Hospitalization\"). (Docket entry 1-1, Complaint at \u00b6 8). Mrs. Myers had health care coverage under a health and wellness benefit plan (\"the Plan\") with BCBS through her employer, United Mississippi Bank. (Docket entry 1-1, Complaint at \u00b6 5). Under the Plan, \"[w]eight reduction programs and treatments for obesity including any Surgery for morbid obesity\" and complications from such treatments are not covered, regardless of the reasons for and/or medical necessity of the surgery or services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A, Plan Excerpt, Article XIV, Paragraphs (A)(30) and (A)(61), at BCBSMS 67, 69. Therefore, claims for Mrs. Myers's Hospitalization were denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff filed this lawsuit on May 17, 2018, asserting claims against BCBS arising from the denial of hospital benefits for Mrs. Myers's Hospitalization. [Dkt. 1-1]. Blue Cross was served with process on June 26, 2018, and timely removed the case on July 24, 2018, on the basis of federal question jurisdiction under ERISA. Mrs. Myers's health care coverage under the Plan through her employer is an \"employee welfare benefit plan\" as defined under and subject to ERISA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the plaintiff's claim for benefits arises under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), and is completely preempted by that act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 19, 2018, the plaintiff filed his Motion to Remand and supporting memorandum, asserting that under the terms of the Plan he was permitted to choose between state and federal court, and asserting that Blue Cross waived its right to remove claims arising out of the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket entries 13 and 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   BCBS responded, contending that the plaintiff's arguments are without merit and that the Motion to Remand should be denied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket entries 16, 17 and 20). Myers has filed a rebuttal, insisting that he has the right to select the state court forum. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket entry 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   State and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over ERISA claims brought by employees to recover benefits, enforce rights, or clarify rights under employee benefit plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Thus, the plaintiff's suit to recover benefits from Mrs. Myers's Plan is the type of suit that may be filed in either state or federal court. It is also the type of suit that can be removed from state court to federal court at the defendant's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (stating defendants may remove civil actions filed in state court to federal\n   district court if the district court had original jurisdiction over the cause of action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In support of his Motion to Remand, the plaintiff argues that BCBS waived its right to remove this case to federal court because the summary plan description in the Plan states, in part: \"Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above [ERISA] rights.... If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A, Plan Excerpt at BCBSMS 6-7. Numerous courts have rejected the plaintiff's argument, holding that the phrase \"you may file suit in a state or federal court\" is a statutorily mandated disclosure of ERISA rights rather than a forum selection clause, and that \"[t]he right to file suit in a particular forum is not equivalent to the right to avoid removal from that forum.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruthis v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785294\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/816/#p818\">\n    356 F.3d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818-19 (7th Cir. 2004). The Fifth Circuit has indicated that it agrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ballew v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049348\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/777/\">\n    668 F.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 n.8 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   and stating \"we find our sister circuit's construction of ERISA persuasive\"). The language relied upon by the plaintiff is required under ERISA and does not constitute a waiver of Blue Cross's right to remove this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under ERISA, a summary plan description must notify employees of the \"remedies available under the plan for the redress of claims which are denied in whole or in part.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201022\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Plan language cited and relied upon by the plaintiff (\"If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court ...\") is the result of Blue Cross complying with federal law by informing Mrs. Myers of her right under ERISA to initiate suit in either state or federal court. In fact, the Code of Federal Regulations sets forth a \"model statement\" for plan drafters to use to ensure their summary plan descriptions comply with ERISA's disclosure requirements. The model statement reads, in part: \"If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202520.102-3\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2520.102-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (t)(2). The language in Mrs. Myers's Plan is taken verbatim from the \"model statement\" and simply informs an employee of his or her rights under ERISA and where he or she may file suit. This is further demonstrated by the fact that the relevant section in the Plan begins with the sentence \"As a participant in the Benefit Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA ... [,]\" and the first sentence of the relevant paragraph states that \"[u]nder ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A, Plan Excerpt at BCBSMS 6-7 (emphasis added). Therefore, the plain language of the statement in question indicates it is a disclosure of applicable law rather than a substantive contract provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785294\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/816/#p818\">\n    356 F.3d at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Furthermore, there is no evidence the drafters of ERISA intended this disclosure statement to act as a substantive contract provision and eliminate the right of removal provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785294\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/816/#p818\">\n    356 F.3d at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Seventh Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   , \"ERISA contains no express provision against removal,\" and there \"is also no indication in ERISA's legislative history that Congress intended to prevent removal of employee actions filed in state courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785294\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/816/#p818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Clorox Co. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   court further stated: \"If this Court interprets the phrase, 'you may file suit in a state or\n   federal court' as a waiver of the right to remove, it would result in the virtual elimination of removal in ERISA cases because every employer covered by ERISA is required to make such a disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785294\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/816/#p818\">\n    356 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   819 (citing\n   <em>\n    Clorox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539692\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/517/#p521\">\n    779 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   521 ).

The Plan language at issue in this case, on the other hand, simply provides, per ERISA, a general forum where suit may be filed. The alleged forum selection clause is not mandatory. Consistent with the applicable case law, the federally mandated Plan language cannot be interpreted as a waiver of the right to removal. In fact, in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , a case which involved plan language identical to that at issue here, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana rejected a plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Rose City\n   </em>\n   , stating: \"In [\n   <em>\n    Rose City\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ]\n   </em>\n   , the contract stated that 'we, at your request agree to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of Competent jurisdiction....' ... The plan[ ] in [\n   <em>\n    Rose City\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ]\n   </em>\n   clearly gave the insured a choice. However, the same cannot be said for the defendant's plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201223598\">\n    2001 WL 1223598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiff argues that if BCBS wanted to reserve its right to remove, it could have said so explicitly in the Plan. However, since there is no language in the Plan suggesting BCBS was waiving its right to remove in the first place, an explicit reservation of that right was unnecessary. BCBS had no reason or need to explicitly reserve the right to remove as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, this Court joins those courts which \"have addressed this issue by holding that the phrase, \"you may file suit in a state or federal court\" is a statutorily required disclosure of an employee's ERISA rights rather than a forum selection clause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cruthis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785294\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/816/#p818\">\n    356 F.3d at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing the district court's finding that this statement was a forum selection clause)(citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court finds further support for its position in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

The plaintiff contended that this language amounted to a forum selection clause and therefore precluded the defendant from removing the case to federal court. The defendant asserted that this was nothing more than boilerplate language mandated by ERISA that employers give employees summary descriptions of plan benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [i]t is the established rule that \" '[a]n intent to waive the right to remove to federal court and submit to the jurisdiction of state court must be clear and unequivocal....' \"\n   <em>\n    Biggers v.

Section 1447(c) provides, in relevant part: \"A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).\" In the context of a motion to remand based on an alleged forum selection clause, at least one district court in the Fifth Circuit has held that the failure to seek remand to state court within thirty days, allegedly to enforce a forum selection clause, constitutes a waiver and remand should be denied.\n   <em>\n    Alvarez v.

Although several other federal courts have held that a forum selection clause is not a \"defect\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1447(c) and that the thirty-day statutory time limit does not apply to a motion to remand based on a forum\n   selection clause, \"[t]his is not to say ... that a district court lacks the discretion to deny such a motion if it is not raised on a timely basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Kamm v.

Therefore, if not at the outset of the litigation, the plaintiff was, or should have been, aware of the alleged forum selection clause at least three weeks after the case was removed.
