The Court conditionally certified this Fair Labor Standards Act suit as a collective action by the entry of an agreed conditional certification order (\"the Certification Order\") on May 15, 2018. On May 14, 2018, the day prior to the entry of the Certification Order, the Plaintiff filed the pending motion for equitable tolling. In the motion, the Plaintiff asks the Court to equitably toll the applicable statute of limitations from March 20, 2018 - the date the parties moved for the Court's approval of their stipulation of conditional certification - to May 15, 2018, the date on which the Court entered the Certification Order. (Pl.'s Mot. 1, ECF No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A general claim for a FLSA violation is subject to a two-year statute of limitations which is extended one additional year for claims involving a \"willful\" violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Alarm Security Group, LLC.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Shidler\n   </em>\n   , the district court granted a FLSA collective action plaintiff's motion for equitable tolling of the statute of limitations where an agreed motion for conditional certification was pending for seven months.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306511\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/827/#p831\">\n    919 F.Supp.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (S.D. Tex. 2012). In granting the motion for equitable tolling, the\n   <em>\n    Shidler\n   </em>\n   Court noted that the plaintiff had been diligent in pursing his rights: he sought certification of the collective action shortly after the defendant answered, the parties quickly thereafter provided the Court with an agreement concerning conditional certification, and the delay between submitting the agreement and obtaining court approval was attributable to the need to obtain more information about the corporate structure of the defendant which was entirely beyond the plaintiff's control.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306511\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/827/#p831\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306511\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/827/#p831\">\n    at 829-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these reasons, the\n   <em>\n    Shidler\n   </em>\n   Court was willing to conclude that the situation presented was sufficiently unique to warrant equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306511\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/827/#p831\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306511\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/827/#p831\">\n    at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the District Court in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. Texas Farm Bureau\n   </em>\n   partially granted a motion to equitably toll the FLSA limitations period to account for the time lapse between the issuance of a report and recommendation on a motion for conditional certification to the date the district court issued its order adopting the recommendation and formally certifying the collective action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524936\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/577/#p581\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (W.D. Tex. 2018). In granting that request for relief, the Court reasoned that once the decision concerning certification of the collective action was solely in its hands, it was beyond the plaintiffs' control and they should not be penalized for time spent awaiting a signed order.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524936\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/577/#p581\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

LEXIS 121617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Tex. June 2, 2008) (unpublished) (tolling FLSA limitations period for entire pendency of motion to certify collective action as time pending was not attributable to the parties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Drawing guidance from decisions made in similar circumstances, the Court concludes that it is appropriate to equitably toll the limitations period from the date the parties submitted their stipulation on conditional certification through the date the Court signed the Certification Order. Significantly, the Plaintiff has been diligent in pursuing his request. He initially moved for conditional certification approximately 30 days after the Defendant answered and arrived at an agreement on certification with the Defendant approximately two weeks later. The parties formally filed their stipulation 11 days later on March 20, 2018. Once the stipulation was submitted for the Court's consideration, the issue was beyond the Plaintiff's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The arguments the Defendant makes in opposition to the Plaintiff's request are that there is nothing \"rare and exceptional\" about the time that passed between when the parties submitted their stipulation and obtained the Certification Order, and that\n   <em>\n    Shidler\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable because the defendant in that case bore some responsibility for the time it took to obtain the information that the Court required to make its certification\n   decision. (Def.'s Resp. 2-3, ECF No. 27.) These arguments are not persuasive however because the Defendant has not directed the Court's attention to any factually apposite decisions while the Plaintiffs have, and courts must consider decisions made in other similar cases for guidance when deciding whether to equitably toll a limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Palacios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065523\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/600/#p605\">\n    723 F.3d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in the Court's view, exercising the power to equitably toll the limitations period in this suit is consistent with the admonition that it be used \"sparingly.\" Accordingly, the Plaintiff's Opposed Motion for Equitable Tolling of Statutes of Limitation on Claims of Putative Collective Action Members [ECF No. 24] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the limitations period applicable to the collective action Plaintiffs' claims is tolled for 56 days from March 20, 2018, through May 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
