Plaintiffs-the City of Council Bluffs, Iowa, joined by Intervenor-Plaintiffs the State of Nebraska and the State of Iowa-challenge a November 13, 2017 decision by the National Indian Gaming Commission (\"NIGC\" or the \"Commission\") to approve the Tribe's site-specific gaming ordinance involving that land.

The opinion contrasted the PRA with provisions from various other statutes in which Congress expressly limited the Secretary's ability to acquire land in trust for Native American tribes or the ability of the tribes to conduct gaming on trust lands.

The Commission highlighted statements to that effect in an October 2005 letter to the NIGC, subsequent letters to the NIGC in June and July 2006, and resolutions by the Tribal Council in August 2006 and April 2007 stating that the Tribe was neither aware of, nor approved, the language added to the Corrected Notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.11\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26- 27.

Cl. 1981), the NIGC found that the repudiation was timely. It reasoned that the State of Iowa had not expended resources in reliance on the 2002 Agreement; no tribunal had been burdened by it; and the State of Iowa was not otherwise prejudiced because it could have still filed a timely legal challenge to\n   the IBIA Trust Decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.

It then considered whether to apply the Part 292 Regulations when conducting its restored lands analysis. The Commission found the Part 292 Regulations were inapplicable because of the regulations' grandfather provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. The Commission observed that the regulations \"do not alter\" final agency decisions made before the Part 292 Regulations came into effect in June 2008, and the 2007 Final Order was issued on December 31, 2007.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission added that, although the district court vacated that decision on judicial review, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court and remanded the case back to the NIGC for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This, the NIGC reasoned, preserved the \"final\" status of the 2007 Final Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As to the grandfather provision's clause pertaining to matters involving written opinions issued before the Part 292 Regulations went into effect, the NIGC found it was applicable because the Gross Memorandum was issued alongside the Chairman's Decision denying the Tribe's application for a site-specific gaming ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. The Commission determined that the Gross Memorandum \"continues in effect, subject to 'full discretion to qualify, withdraw or modify such opinion[ ].' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.26\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the Commission evaluated the\n   <em>\n    Grand Traverse II\n   </em>\n   factors-the temporal, geographic, and factual circumstances surrounding the trust acquisition-and determined that the Carter Lake Parcel was restored lands.

It found that Mason lacked the requisite authority to bind the Tribe to the agreement and that the State of Iowa failed to satisfy its burden to show that it took the necessary steps to ensure that he had such authority. However, the NIGC found that the Tribe subsequently ratified the agreement, and, through various actions and statements from 2005 to 2007, repudiated the agreement. As part of its repudiation analysis, the NIGC found the State of Iowa did not suffer detrimental reliance on the 2002 Agreement because, at the time the Tribe sought to repudiate the agreement, the State of Iowa could still seek judicial review of the IBIA Trust Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs only challenge the Commission's finding that the 2002 Agreement was timely repudiated, specifically that the State of Iowa suffered no detrimental reliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF Nos. 22-1 at 36-37; 50 at 18].

But that is not true.

They argue that, both in 2002 and when the agreement was purportedly repudiated in 2005-2007, it was widely understood that the Quiet Title Act barred APA review of the DOI's decision to acquire land in trust for a Native American tribe once the land was formally acquired. This belief stems from language in the Quiet Title Act's limited waiver of sovereign immunity. It states, in relevant part, \"[t]he United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest .... This section does not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' claims, it was not settled law that the Quiet Title Act barred APA review of DOI trust decisions, especially in the Eighth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly, the Government took this view because, as discussed above, federal regulations required the DOI to post notice of a decision to acquire land in trust for a Native American tribe and wait thirty days for potential litigants to seek judicial review before accepting title to the land.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018082\">\n    61 Fed.

It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The Secretary shall accept not more than 1,500 acres of any real property located in Knox or Boyd Counties, Nebraska, that is transferred to the Secretary for the benefit of the Tribe. Such real property shall be accepted by the Secretary ... in the name of the United States in trust for the benefit of the Tribe .... The Secretary may accept any additional acreage in Knox or Boyd Counties pursuant to his authority under the [IRA]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   25 U.S.C. \u00a7 983b. Looking solely at the statutory language, this provision requires the Secretary to accept the transfer of land in Knox or Boyd Counties, Nebraska, for the benefit of the Tribe. The Secretary is only required to accept 1,500 acres of such land. The Secretary need not actively acquire the land, but he must accept it if offered. The Secretary may, but need not, accept more land in these counties pursuant to his authority under the IRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As is immediately apparent, section 4(c) makes no reference to restored lands. The term does not appear in the Act. The term is incorporated-indirectly-via section three of the Act, which reads, \"[a]ll Federal laws of general application to Indians and Indian tribes (including the [IRA] ) shall apply with respect to the Tribe and to the members.\" 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 983a. The parties do not dispute that the IGRA is a\n   \"Federal law[ ] of general application to Indians and Indian tribes.\" However, although the IGRA both prohibits gaming activities on Native American trust lands acquired after October 17, 1988, and allows for the Restored Lands Exception, it does not set out a test for determining when the exception applies, nor does it otherwise define restored lands. Thus, the Act's reference to the IGRA does not clarify Congress's intent as to whether the Act limits restored lands to property in Knox and Boyd Counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The legislative history is similarly unhelpful. It does, however, signal that Congress's key concern in requiring the Secretary to accept land in Knox and Boyd Counties was twofold: (1) to ensure that a minimum amount of land was set aside for the Tribe while; (2) preserving generally the Secretary's discretion over trust lands. The Act first emerged from the Senate, where section 4(c) required the Secretary \"to accept\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   land transferred to the Secretary in trust in the name of the United States for the benefit of the Tribe.\" S. Rep. No. 101-330 at 3 (1990) (emphasis added). At the recommendation of the DOI, the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs struck that language and added the provisions in section 4(c) requiring the Secretary to accept in trust 1,500 acres in Knox and Boyd Counties, and reiterating the Secretary's discretion to take additional lands into trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In explaining those respective amendments, the committee reported that the first amendment \"limits the geographical area within which the Secretary can accept land in trust to two Nebraska counties. It also limits the acreage to 1,500 acres. The second amendment makes it clear that, after the 1,500 acres are taken in trust, the Secretary has the discretion to take additional land in trust for the Tribe.\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-776, at 4 (1990). This tension between mandatory trust lands and the Secretary's discretion is also reflected elsewhere in the congressional record. In advocating for the passage of the Act, Doug Bereuter, former representative of Nebraska's first congressional district, explained that, in lieu of reservation status for lands acquired in trust for the Tribe, the Act \"permits the tribe to acquire 1,500 acres of land for economic development, agricultural, and ceremonial and tribal purposes.\" 136 Cong. Rec. 9,279 (1990). He added, \"[b]eyond that, the Secretary of the Interior will have the discretion, as he does currently for all other federally recognized tribes, to acquire additional lands to be designated as trust lands on behalf of the tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/#p980\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As it appears Congress did not intend to limit the Secretary's ability to acquire additional lands in trust for the Tribe, it is notable that the Act articulates only one limitation on the rights that accrue to the Tribe by virtue of those lands being held in trust-such lands shall not be granted reservation status. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 983b(e). It seems unlikely that Congress would have intended additional limitations of such rights without expressly stating them. This observation is bolstered when considering the restoration acts of other Native American tribes, pre-dating the PRA, in which Congress expressly limited the lands the Secretary could take into trust or prohibited gaming on them unless otherwise allowed under applicable state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grand Ronde Restoration Act, Pub.

It is not necessary to detail those discussions here, but they stand in stark contrast to Congress's silence on gaming and restored lands status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Given the Act's broad incorporation of \"Federal laws of general application to Indians and Indian tribes,\" and Congress's clear intent to encroach only minimally on the Secretary's discretion in dealing with Native American tribes, the reasonable conclusion is that Congress was content to let the Secretary deal with the issue of restored lands if it ever arose. However, the Court's task in the first step of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis is to determine whether the plain language of the Act shows Congress's clear intent to limit restored lands to those held in trust for the Tribe in Knox and Boyd Counties. For the reasons set out above, the Court finds it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Turning to the second part of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Court considers whether the NIGC's interpretation of the Act was \"reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Brand X Internet Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/#p980\">\n    545 U.S. at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/#p980\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In making that determination, the NIGC adopted the PRA Opinion, which reached the same conclusion after a detailed analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/#p980\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a matter of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference, and for the reasons summarized in the preceding paragraph, the Court finds the NIGC's interpretation is entirely reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs object, however, to the procedure whereby the Commission interpreted the PRA. They argue the NIGC's interpretation was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider the persuasive effect of the Part 292 Regulations. Those regulations set out factors the DOI and NIGC presently consider in a restored lands analysis. Plaintiffs believe the NIGC's determination that the PRA does not limit restored lands to property in Knox and Boyd Counties conflicts with those regulations. The pertinent regulation states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (a) If the tribe was restored by a Congressional enactment of legislation recognizing, acknowledging, affirming, reaffirming, or restoring the government-to-government relationship between the United States and the tribe, the tribe must show that either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (1) The legislation requires or authorizes the Secretary to take land into trust for the benefit of the tribe within a specific geographic area and the lands are within the specific geographic area; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (2) If the legislation does not provide a specific geographic area for the restoration of lands, the tribe must meet the requirements of \u00a7 292.12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.11\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to public comments during the rule-making process, the DOI explained, \"[t]he regulations include a contingency for legislation that requires or authorizes the Secretary to take land into trust for the benefit of a tribe within a specific geographic area because in such scenarios, Congress has made a determination which lands are restored.\" Gaming on Trust Lands Acquired after October 17, 1988,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029354\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. 29354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01, at 29364 (May 20, 2008). Plaintiffs interpret \u00a7 292.11 as requiring the DOI to find that the Tribe's restored lands are limited to those the PRA \"requires or authorizes\" the Secretary to take into trust, namely those in Knox and Boyd Counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court stresses that \u00a7 292.11 interprets the IGRA, not the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court must consider whether \u00a7 292.11 was a relevant factor that the NIGC should have considered when interpreting the PRA. Through incorporation of the PRA Opinion, the NIGC considered numerous factors that are well-established tools of statutory construction, including: (1) the text of the PRA; (2) its legislative history; (3) the purposes of the statute; (4) the interaction between section 4(c) and other provisions of the Act; and (5) relevant language, for the purposes of comparison, in similar statutes. Plaintiffs do not cite, and the Court is not aware of, any authority that would include among these tools an agency's interpretation of a different statute or, more specifically, an agency rule that purports to impose a particular approach to statutory construction regardless of the specific text and circumstances of the statute in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Even if agency rules or interpretations should be added to the canons of statutory construction in this manner, \u00a7 292.11 is a poor candidate. If Plaintiffs' reading of the regulation is correct, it would impose a determination as to the meaning of a statute based on one provision only-a provision authorizing or requiring the Secretary to take specified lands into trust for a tribe. As persuasive authority, the regulation would give outsize importance to that provision because of an agency's\n   <em>\n    approach\n   </em>\n   , rather than the statutory text or other factors indicating Congress's intent. It is not clear what bearing an agency's approach, in the abstract, has on the meaning of a statute drafted by Congress. Accordingly, the NIGC correctly disregarded \u00a7 292.11 when interpreting the PRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    C.

As was customary prior to the implementation of those regulations, the NIGC analyzed the\n   <em>\n    Grand Traverse II\n   </em>\n   factors: (1) the factual circumstances of the trust acquisition; (2) the location of the acquisition; and (3) the temporal relationship between the acquisition and the tribe's restoration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In deciding to apply the common law, rather than the Part 292 Regulations, the NIGC analyzed and applied the regulations' grandfather provision.

The regulations do not define \"final agency decisions\" or \"written opinion\" such that the terms dictate the correct approach. The Court finds the grandfather provision is ambiguous as to remanded decisions. The Secretary has effectively admitted this by applying both the common law restoration test\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Part 292 Regulations in a case where this situation arose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butte Cty. v.

Regarding the grandfather provision, the DOI explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   During the course of implementing IGRA section 20, the Department and the NIGC have issued a number of legal opinions to address the ambiguities left by Congress and provide legal advice for agency decisionmakers, or in some cases, for the interested parties facing an unresolved legal issue. These legal opinions typically have been issued by the Department's Office of the Solicitor or the NIGC's Office of General Counsel. In some cases, the Department or the NIGC subsequently relied on the legal opinion to take some final agency action. In those cases, section 292.26(a) makes clear that these regulations will have no retroactive effect to alter any final agency decision made prior to the effective date of these regulations. In other cases, however, the Department or the NIGC may have issued a legal opinion without any subsequent final agency action. It is expected that in those cases, the tribe and perhaps other parties may have relied on the legal opinion to make investments into the subject property or taken some other actions that were based on their understanding that the land was eligible for gaming. Therefore, section 292.26(b) states that these regulations also shall not apply to applicable agency actions taken after the effective date of these regulations when the Department or the NIGC has issued a written opinion regarding the applicability of 25 U.S.C. 2719 before the effective date of these regulations. In this way, the Federal Government may be able to follow through with its prior legal opinions and take final agency actions consistent with those opinions, even if these regulations now have created a conflict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029354\">\n    73 Fed.

Section 292.26 states that the Part 292 Regulations will not \"alter final agency decisions made ... before the date of enactment of these regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.26\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

However, Plaintiffs argue it cannot qualify as a \"written opinion\" under the grandfather provision because it determined the Carter Lake Parcel did not qualify as restored lands. That is a narrow reading of \u00a7 292.26, and the Commission did not err in taking a broader view. The Gross Memorandum was based on the law pre-dating the Part 292 Regulations, and the instant lawsuit is the continuation of a dispute over that opinion's accuracy. During that dispute, the Commission has twice approved the Tribe's site-specific ordinance, on which the Tribe and others could rely (notwithstanding judicial challenges). Further, as is evident from the Amended Final Order, the Commission continued to exercise its \"full discretion to qualify, withdraw or modify\" the conclusions in the Gross Memorandum. The Commission's finding that the Gross Memorandum is a \"written opinion\" was consistent with the text and aims of the grandfather provision,\n   not otherwise inconsistent with \u00a7 292.26, and not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In sum, the Court finds the NIGC did not violate the APA when it determined that the Part 292 Regulations were inapplicable to the present dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   2. 2002 Agreement as a factual circumstance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue the NIGC erred when it failed to consider the 2002 Agreement as a \"factual circumstance[ ] of the [trust] acquisition\" when conducting its restored lands analysis.\n   <em>\n    Grand Traverse II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434796\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/198/920/#p935\">\n    198 F.Supp.2d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In light of this request, the Eighth Circuit framed the ultimate issue as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   whether the NIGC's decision that the Carter Lake land constitutes \"restored lands\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(iii) is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law. But the DOI and NIGC have further narrowed the appeal by expressly declining to contest the district court's holding that the NIGC Commission improperly excluded from consideration the purported agreement between the Tribe and State of Iowa as set forth in the Corrected Notice. According to the DOI and NIGC, such a holding does not resolve the issue of whether the Carter Lake land is eligible for gaming under the IGRA's restored lands exception\n   <em>\n    because the NIGC, in consultation with the DOI, must determine what legal effect and weight to give the purported agreement and Corrected Notice.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). It is clear from this framing that the Eighth Circuit viewed the validity and effect the 2002 Agreement and Corrected Notice as factors to be considered in a restored lands analysis. As further proof of this, the Eighth Circuit discussed the\n   <em>\n    Grand Traverse II\n   </em>\n   factors before turning to \"the only remaining question\" of \"whether a remand is necessary in light of the DOI and NIGC's concession that the NIGC improperly excluded from consideration the purported agreement between the Tribe and the State of Iowa referenced in the Corrected Notice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Eighth Circuit concluded \"that the absence of a determination on the record as to the validity of the agreement entered into between the State of Iowa and the Tribe necessitates remand.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court declined to address the issue itself, finding that \"the record [was] inadequate to make a conclusive determination as to the Corrected Notice's validity as an agreement and its legal effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Eighth Circuit then gave a specific instruction that appears to have caused the present confusion: \"[i]f the NIGC concludes that no valid agreement exists estopping the Tribe from raising the 'restored lands' exception, then it may proceed to reexamine whether the Carter\n   Lake land is eligible for gaming under the IGRA's 'restored lands' exception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted). The NIGC appears to have focused exclusively on this instruction. When describing its task on remand, the NIGC said, \"we must determine whether the agreement is valid. If it is, we must assess the impact of the agreement for purposes of the factual circumstances factor of the restored lands analysis.\" [ECF No. 18-3 at 9-10] (footnote omitted). As already discussed, the NIGC concluded that the agreement was not valid and the Tribe was not estopped from asserting restored lands status over the Carter Lake Parcel. The parties agree that the NIGC did not consider the 2002 Agreement in its restored lands analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court cannot fault the NIGC for treating estoppel as a threshold issue. That instruction was clear. However, focusing solely on that instruction distorts the Eighth Circuit's consideration of the NIGC's restored lands analysis, particularly in the context of the agencies' concessions on appeal. The Eighth Circuit's estoppel instruction speaks to the possibility that a restored lands analysis would be unnecessary if the Tribe was estopped from asserting the Restored Lands Exception. The Eighth Circuit gave no express guidance as to what should be included in a restored lands analysis should it be necessary. In that regard, the Eighth Circuit instructed only that the NIGC \"reconsider[ ] ... its restored lands analysis in accordance with this opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court drew a sharp contrast between the Gross Memorandum, which weighed the 2002 Agreement in its analysis, and the 2007 Final Order. It considered the Gross Memorandum to be \"well-reasoned\" and \"very well documented.\"\n   <em>\n    Nebraska I\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 9-10 (Nov. 28, 2008), ECF No. 56. On the other hand, the district court found that \"[t]he three NIGC Commissioners' decision rejected counsel's and its Chairman's initial conclusion about the facts surrounding the Carter Lake conveyance in trust, holding without adequate explanation that 'the Chairman erred in relying on events that occurred after DOI's decision was final.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Eighth Circuit agreed. Thus, although the NIGC was required to consider the validity of the 2002 Agreement in the context of estoppel, the Commission was also still required to conduct the analysis that it failed to do in 2007. Here, having failed to consider relevant factors in its restored lands analysis, the NIGC's conclusion based on that analysis is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Because the NIGC has still not determined, on the record, the impact of the 2002 Agreement and Corrected Notice on the Carter Lake Parcel's status as restored\n   lands, this matter must be remanded to the Commission for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nebraska II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799220\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/501/#p512\">\n    625 F.3d at 511-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the \"absence of a determination on the record\" as to the validity of the 2002 Agreement necessitates remand);\n   <em>\n    Mayo v.

On remand, rather than such broad concepts touching on the agreement itself, the NIGC must consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the agreement as part of its restored lands analysis. As the district court found in\n   <em>\n    Nebraska I\n   </em>\n   -and Defendants conceded on appeal-\"those events were crucial to the completion of the conveyance\" of the Carter Lake Parcel. As to how crucial they were, and how they balance against other factual, temporal, and geographic factors, the Court leaves that determination to the NIGC. To the extent the Commission needs a clearer guide as to what must be considered on remand, it need look no further than the Gross Memorandum. There, Associate General Counsel Gross considered numerous factual circumstances surrounding the 2002 Agreement. The NIGC is not bound by his conclusions, and it may consider additional factors regarding the agreement that it considers relevant. To the extent those factors include conclusions the NIGC reached in its estoppel analysis in the Amended Final Order, the Commission need not repeat the analysis it undertook to reach those conclusions; instead, it is enough to explain why those factors are or are not relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   IV.

It cannot be said, however, that this was a uniform approach.

The Eighth Circuit appears to have only considered the Quiet Title Act's waiver of sovereign immunity in the context of quiet title actions.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Ducheneaux v.

It was not, as Plaintiffs maintain, required to explain why it did not take some alternative course of action.
