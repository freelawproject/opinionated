The suit is brought on behalf of Capital One consumers in the United States (\"National Class\") for a claim of breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and in Massachusetts (\"Massachusetts Subclass\") on a third claim alleging unfair or deceptive acts or practices violating M.G.L.A. chapter 93A \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9. Plaintiff claims Defendant breached their credit card contract by charging interest to her and members of the class on amounts that were paid in full before the due date, an alleged express violation of their terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 25, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), when only a couple months earlier, Plaintiff's husband brought forth a nearly identical lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia. That case was dismissed by the Plaintiff eleven days after it was filed and before there was any substantive action taken. Plaintiffs oppose the motion to transfer. For the reasons described below, the motion to transfer is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Mrs. Dress, a citizen of Massachusetts who works and lives in the Commonwealth, opened a credit card account with Capital One, which is headquartered in McLean, Virginia in the Eastern District of Virginia. The credit card came with an annual fee and no rewards program. Sometime around 2017 and at Mrs. Dress' request, Capital One provided her with an upgraded Quicksilver Platinum MasterCard credit card with no annual fee and a rewards program. The upgraded credit card's agreement specifically prohibited the assessment of residual interest charges by promising an interest-free grace period on purchases paid off before the due date. Mrs. Dress, however, noticed that she was charged interest on all new purchases even though she had paid off her entire statement balance before the due date. Mrs. Dress claims this charge violates the credit card agreement, which specifically states that Capital One, \"would not charge you interest on any new transactions ... if you paid the total balance across all Segments of your Account in full by the due date on your statement each month.\" Plaintiff alleges that without notifying customers, Capital One eliminates the grace period for all new purchases if a consumer does not pay off her entire statement balance in a given month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff files this action on behalf of herself and the national class alleging Capital One affirmatively misrepresented and omitted in its contracts that if a consumer fails to pay off his or her entire balance by the statement due date, Capital One will revoke the interest-free grace period on all future purchases and collect residual interest. Plaintiff claims breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing on behalf of herself and the national class. On behalf of herself and the Massachusetts subclass, Plaintiff alleges a violation of M.G.L.A. c. 93A \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9. Section 2 prohibits \"unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\" and \u00a7 9 permits any consumer injured by a violation of M.G.L.A. c. 93A \u00a7 2 to bring a civil action for damages and injunctive relief. Mrs. Dress brought this\n   action in this Court. The credit card agreement signed by Mrs. Dress contains a Virginia choice of law provision, stating that all claims asserted on behalf of a putative nationwide class will be governed by Virginia law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This action is nearly identical to the action Plaintiff's husband, David Dress, brought in the Eastern District of Virginia before this case was filed. Mr. Dress filed a putative class action lawsuit against Capital One in the Eastern District of Virginia, claiming breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith. Eleven days after filing it and after a judge was assigned to the case, Mr. Dress dismissed his complaint. Two months later and represented by the same counsel, Mrs. Dress filed her suit against Capital One alleging the same claims in a complaint nearly verbatim to that of her husband. Defendant then filed this motion to transfer, claiming the private and public factors, including allegations of forum-shopping, make the Eastern District of Virginia the more convenient and proper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses, a federal district court may transfer a case to a different judicial district where that case may have been brought.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

It is undisputed that jurisdiction in either the Eastern District of Virginia or the District of Massachusetts is proper.

As a Massachusetts citizen and resident, Plaintiff has a legitimate interest in litigating her claims in her home district. In putative class action suits, however, the plaintiff's choice of forum deserves considerably less weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. N.Y. Life Ins.

However, the weight accorded to a plaintiff's choice of forum varies with the circumstances of the case.

Though Mrs. Dress is a Massachusetts resident, she filed this suit on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated throughout the United States, in addition to a Massachusetts subclass. Therefore, Plaintiff's choice of forum is given considerably less weight because she brings a putative class action suit on behalf of persons across the country.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vass,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202226260\">\n    2015 WL 2226260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (denying a motion to transfer to California from Massachusetts in part because plaintiff brought a class action suit limited only to Massachusetts residents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Another factor to consider is the convenience and location of the parties, material witnesses, and documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenthal v.

Mass. 2018). Here, Plaintiff, one of potentially many witnesses nationwide, resides in Massachusetts, and Defendant's headquarters are in the Eastern District of Virginia. Plaintiff contends that since Capital One previously litigated small claims cases in Massachusetts, litigating in this district is not inconvenient. However, Defendant asserts that no material witnesses in this case reside in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court must also consider the financial burden that transfer may impose on either party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sigros v.

Mass. 2001) (\"The balance of convenience focuses on the comparative financial abilities of the parties and the cost of litigation should be borne by the party in the best position to absorb and spread it.\"). Here, Mrs. Dress asserts she is a woman of modest means and less able to absorb the costs and difficulty of litigating in a distant forum. On the other hand, Capital One is a multi-national corporation which can more easily bear the cost of litigation in Massachusetts, as it has done in small claims cases in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sigros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11130987\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/129/56/#p71\">\n    129 F.Supp.2d at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant states that no relevant Capital One employees live in Massachusetts. In fact, Defendant asserts that Mrs. Dress is the only relevant witness from Massachusetts. Even though this factor favors the Defendant, the court must also consider whether the employees can be compelled to testify. \"If, however, a court order or the persuasion of an employer who is a party to the action can secure the appearance of witnesses regardless of the location of forum, that factor diminishes in importance.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sigros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11130987\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/129/56/#p71\">\n    129 F.Supp.2d at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

Additionally, both Mr. and Mrs. Dress are represented by the same counsel. Where there is such suspicion of forum shopping, the plaintiff's choice of forum does not have the same weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201003432\">\n    2013 WL 1003432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"In addition, where, as here, the same counsel has filed class actions asserting the same federal claim in two different districts, and the second claim was filed after the federal claim was dismissed in the first-filed case, the usual weight given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is not justified. Rather, to give it such weight would abet a form of forum shopping that should not be encouraged.\"). This Court can consider the factual circumstances basing the allegations of forum-shopping in determining the weight to give Plaintiff's choice of forum without ruling that Plaintiff did in fact forum shop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood v.
