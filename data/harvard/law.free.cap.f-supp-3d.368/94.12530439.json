Defendant GlaxoSmithKline LLC (\"GSK\") has moved for summary judgment based on federal preemption-in substance, that state-law claims of failure to provide an adequate warning label are preempted by federal law. For the following reasons, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Zofran is an anti-emetic-that is, a drug that prevents or treats nausea or vomiting. It was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1991 for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy or radiation therapy and post-operative nausea and vomiting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Zofran was not approved, and never has been approved, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Nonetheless, Zofran has been prescribed off-label to pregnant women for many years. According to plaintiffs, that widespread practice was due in large part to unlawful marketing practices by GSK that sought to promote off-label usage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some point, the FDA became aware that Zofran was being prescribed to pregnant women in significant numbers. In 2010, the FDA requested that the GSK provide supplemental information concerning the safety of Zofran when used during pregnancy. In response, GSK provided an analysis of the then-available safety data. The FDA did not require any labeling changes. In 2013, a citizen petition requested that the FDA revise the Zofran label to indicate an increased risk to fetal safety if ingested during pregnancy. The FDA rejected that request. In 2015, the current manufacturer of Zofran, Novartis, submitted a proposed label change to provide, among other things, a warning that use in pregnancy could cause harm to the fetus and is not recommended. That, too, was rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In short, whether Zofran poses a risk to fetal safety has been considered, and rejected, by the FDA on multiple occasions since the drug's initial approval. Even today, it is not contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and its label contains no enhanced form of warning for such use. Indeed, the current label states that \"[a]vailable data do not reliably inform the association of Zofran and adverse fetal outcomes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs nonetheless contend that ingestion of Zofran during pregnancy in fact causes birth defects, that the label should contain such a warning, and that GSK's failure to provide such a warning should result in tort liability under state law. Plaintiffs contend that the FDA's initial approval of Zofran in 1991, and its subsequent rejection of label changes, were based on incomplete information-essentially, because GSK withheld certain data\n   from the FDA and made material misrepresentations. GSK denies that it withheld information and contends that any state-law failure-to-warn claims are preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The potential preemption issue arises out of a clash between federal regulation of prescription drugs and state-law product-liability principles. By federal law, the FDA closely regulates the labeling of drugs, including warning labels; as a general matter, a drug label may only be created or changed with FDA approval. That creates an obvious tension with state laws, which generally permit recovery for failure to provide an adequate warning, but which assume that a manufacturer is free to provide such warnings as it sees fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There is, however, a process under federal law-called the \"changes being effected,\" or \"CBE,\" process-that permits a drug company to change a label unilaterally, based on certain \"newly acquired information\" concerning its safety, subject to later FDA approval. Because of the existence of the CBE process, the Supreme Court has held that a drug company can in fact add safety information to its label without FDA approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v. Levine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p570\">\n    555 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570-71,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p570\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p570\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). As a result, a drug company may prove that federal law preempts state law only if it can show by \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would have rejected the warning that plaintiffs contend state law required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p570\">\n    at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p570\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, there is little doubt that the FDA\n   <em>\n    would have\n   </em>\n   rejected plaintiffs' proposed warning: it in fact\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   reject it, at least in substance. But plaintiffs contend that GSK's failure to make complete disclosures to the FDA means that the agency's decisions were not fully informed, and therefore a finding of federal preemption is precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The legal framework for considering preemption claims is muddy at best. Among other things, there is considerable debate as to such basic matters as the required standard of proof and the appropriate roles of the judge and jury. The United States Supreme Court recently granted a writ of certiorari in an FDA preemption case, presumably to clarify some of those issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fosamax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277195\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/268/\">\n    852 F.3d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2017),\n   <em>\n    cert. granted sub nom.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp. v.

Under the existing legal framework, as this Court understands and interprets it, the basic factual question underlying preemption-that is, whether the FDA would have rejected the label had it been presented with the evidence plaintiffs contend was withheld-must be resolved by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, and for the following reasons, the motion of GSK for summary judgment based on preemption will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Regulatory Framework\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Labeling Requirements Generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under federal law, a drug company may not market or sell a new pharmaceutical drug without the approval of the Food and Drug Administration.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17). The FDA noted that ondansetron had not been approved for the treatment of NVP, but that it was \"aware of the unapproved use of oral and injectable ondansetron for the treatment of NVP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In the conclusion section of the document, Novartis stated that while a review of the science did not offer \"consistent or compelling evidence that exposure to ondansetron in early pregnancy causes major birth defects, including congenital cardiac defects,\" the FDA should nevertheless accept its labeling changes that inform prescribers and patients \"of the potential risk of fetal harm during treatment in pregnancy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2309).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In November 2015, the FDA rejected that request. It deleted the paragraph that included the sentence \"[i]t is possible that ZOFRAN can cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 23 at 3945). It also deleted the subsection concerning \"[f]emales and males of reproductive potential\" in its entirety, stating that \"the available human data do not support a clear conclusion on an increased risk of major congenital malformations,\" and therefore it did \"not agree with recommendations for pregnancy testing and contraception use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3947).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In December 2015, Novartis submitted a new round of proposed changes to the pregnancy labeling.

And in an effort to \"provide conservative guidance due to the potential off label use and the data available,\" it again suggested including a warning that \"[t]he safety of ondansetron for use in human pregnancy has not been established.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2611). In light of reported off-label use, it also requested a new \"Limitations of Use\" section stating that \"Zofran has not been studied in pregnant women for the prevention of nausea and vomiting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2604).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The FDA responded in April 2015, again rejecting proposed language that the \"use of ondansetron in pregnancy is not recommended.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 23, 25, 27-28). The FDA stated that a \"limitations on use\" statement is \"not intended to prohibit off-label use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 25 at 4045). Rather, such a statement is proper only when \"there is a known risk that outweighs the therapeutic benefits in a certain clinical situation,\" and the FDA could not draw that conclusion for the use of Zofran to treat NVP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Eventually, in September 2016, Novartis and the FDA agreed upon a revised label. In the communications leading up to the revision, the FDA made the following statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022 \"We do not agree with keeping [the phrase 'Animal studies are not always predictive of human response, therefore, the use of ondansetron in pregnancy is not recommended'] in labeling based on the available human information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 23 at 3945).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 \"Based on the Agency's review, the available human data do not support a clear conclusion on an increased risk of major congenital malformation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3947)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 \"Based on review of the submitted pharmacovigilance database and the literature, we did not conclude that there is a basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the congenital malformations and the use of ondansetron.

CMF \u00b6 2). GSK notes that Dr. Danielsson himself acknowledged that there was not a single external malformation observed in the study. (Jenner Decl. Ex. A (Danielsson Report) at 48-49). It further contends that the study investigators concluded the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   In the observation of fetuses (F1), there were no significant differences between the [Zofran ] groups and the control group in either the number of live fetuses or dead implants ratio, indicating no fetal lethal effect of [Zofran ] .... No external abnormalities were observed, but skeletal and visceral anomalies or variations were observed with low incidences in [the Zofran groups]. However these incidences had no dose-dependency, and all of the changes were well known to occur spontaneously in rats. Consequently, [Zofran ] was observed to have no teratogenicity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (Hill Decl. Ex. 34, NTX/99/001 at 584).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs characterize Study No. 100441 as having \"reported an increase in some skeletal defects, among others in the 2.5 and 10 mg/kg oral Zofran-treated groups of rabbits compared to untreated controls.\" (Pls. CMF \u00b6 2). GSK notes Dr. Danielsson's statement that 100441's observations were \"likely to be related to the\n   observed decreased maternal body weight gain and absolute decreases in body weight, under certain periods in these studies, and not directly related to ondansetron exposure.\" (Jenner Decl. Ex. A (Danielsson Report) at 56). It further contends that the study investigators concluded that \"[t]he effects of [Zofran ] were not observed in the incidences of external, visceral or skeletal anomalies and variations in fetuses, and there were no findings indicating the teratogenicity of [Zofran ].\" (Hill Decl. Ex. 33, NTX/99/000 at 415).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     GSK's Disclosure of the Studies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that GSK withheld the three Japanese animal studies from the FDA, and thus withheld animal reproduction data allegedly showing adverse effects on the fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As noted, Zofran was initially approved on January 4, 1991. In 1992, seven Japanese-language reproductive toxicology studies of Zofran were published. The publication had English-language tables, data provided in Arabic-numeral format, and (for six of the seven) English-language abstracts. Two of the three studies at issue were among that group. (Hill Decl. Exs. 37-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   It is undisputed that GSK at least partly disclosed to the FDA the existence of Study Nos. 100423, 100424, and 100441 in its December 23, 1993 \"Annual Report\" letter. (Jenner Decl. Ex. B at 819-20). The Annual Report, submitted to the FDA pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20312.33\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provided the name and study number for each of the three studies, among other reproduction studies conducted on Zofran in Japan. The disclosure was made under a sub-heading entitled \"Studies performed specifically to satisfy Japanese regulatory requirements. These studies are either repetitive or provide no new significant safety information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). GSK did not provide the FDA with copies of the studies themselves, which were only available in Japanese at that time. (Def. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In a September 11, 1997 pharmacology review, the FDA, having reviewed Study No. 100424, concluded that Zofran \"was not teratogenic in the F0 generation. Furthermore, there were no treatment-related effects on the reproductive performance of the F1 generation.\" (Hill Decl. Ex. 40 at 191).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   On October 29, 2014, in connection with a request for GSK to update the pregnancy section of the Zofran label to conform with the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR) format, the FDA requested that GSK \"provide full details of animal reproduction studies\" of Zofran. (Jenner Decl. Ex. M at 074).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   GSK responded to that request on March 3, 2015, stating that it was providing \"full details of animal production studies as requested.\" (Jenner Decl. Ex. N at 712). GSK's response described animal reproduction studies, identified individual study report numbers, and explained that \"[t]hese reports were contained in [an October 12, 1989 NDA submission].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs contend that the response failed to disclose any information about the three Japanese animal studies, which were \"animal reproduction studies\" that fell within the scope of the October 29, 2014 information request. (Pls. CMF \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In its October 27, 2015 denial of the Reichmann citizen petition, the FDA noted that Zofran animal reproduction studies conducted as part of GSK's safety evaluation of Zofran were \"relevant to this Petition.\" (Hill Decl. Ex. 17 at 12). The denial specifically cited a summary of data written in 1989 by Dr. Tucker, a GSK employee. (Jenner Decl. Ex. O at 751). The summary did not include a discussion of Japanese animal studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to GSK, the Tucker paper was just one of\n   a number of sources of information the FDA specifically considered before denying the petition, including one case-control study, four cohort studies (including a 2014 paper co-authored by Dr. Danielsson), and one case series. (Hill Decl. Ex. 17 at 7-12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs contend, however, that GSK was aware of the citizen petition, but failed to provide any information to the FDA about the Japanese reproduction studies in response. (Pls. CMF \u00b6 27). GSK counters that it was not obligated to respond (and therefore did not do so), as the FDA never contacted them in connection with the citizen petition. (Def. Resp. \u00b6 27, citing Rebar Dep. Ex. 42 at 313)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The results of the Japanese animal studies were not otherwise provided to the FDA by GSK or Novartis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Biological Mechanism of Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that GSK \"failed to disclose to [the] FDA an accurate description of Zofran's potential to cause embryonic arrhythmias with a resulting biological mechanism of teratogenicity.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 16, 19-21, 30-31, 34-36, 39-40). The disputed mechanism of action is alleged to cause fetal heart defects when Zofran\"inhibits hERG potassium channels\" and disrupts cardiac rhythm. (Pls. CMF \u00b6\u00b6 11-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that GSK became aware of the hERG channel mechanism by at least 2002, but failed to disclose or properly explain it to the FDA. GSK contends that the hERG channel mechanism is merely a hypothesis, is not supported by evidence, and, regardless, that the FDA considered evidence of the mechanism of action and still concluded there was insufficient data to support a pregnancy warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Evidence of the Mechanism of Action and GSK's Knowledge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In 1994, F.G. de Lorenzi\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   published a study in the British Journal of Pharmacology titled \"Block of the delayed rectifier current (IK) by the 5-HT3 antagonists ondansetron and granisetron in feline ventricular myocytes.\" (Jenner Decl. Ex. C). The study reported that Zofran inhibits hERG potassium channels, which is the mechanism of action by which Zofran can cause QT prolongation-a condition that plaintiffs characterize as a serious disturbance of the heart's rhythm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Other than the characterization of QT prolongation as a \"serious\" disturbance of the heart's rhythm, GSK does not directly dispute those findings. It contends, however, that the study did not specifically investigate hERG potassium channels and was not an investigation of the effects of Zofran on QT interval in humans. (Def. Resp. \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In 2000, Yuri Kuryshev\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   published a study in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics titled \"Interactions of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 antagonist class of antiemetic drugs with human cardiac ion channels.\" (Jenner Decl. Ex. D). That study similarly reported that Zofran was associated with QT prolongation due to its inhibition of hERG potassium channels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). GSK again does not directly dispute that finding, but nonetheless contends the study was not designed to examine the effect of Zofran on QT prolongation in humans. (Def. Resp. \u00b6 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In 2002, an internal GSK document reported that drugs that reduce the embryonic heart rate and produce heart rhythm abnormalities are likely to cause embryonic death that \"is likely to result from drug induced bradycardia which impairs circulation and leads to hypoxia causing embryonic malformations and death.\" (Jenner Decl. Ex. U at 669, 707). The document cited a 1994 paper co-authored by Dr. Danielsson. Plaintiffs contend that this explanation of the \"biological mechanism of teratogenicity arising from drug-induced bradycardia, i.e., arrhythmia,\" is \"virtually identical\" to the explanation provided by Dr. Danielsson with reference to Zofran in his expert report in this litigation, implying that GSK was aware of the mechanism in 2002. (Pls. CMF \u00b6 16; Jenner Decl. Ex. A (Danielsson Report) at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   GSK, however, contends that \"[t]he mechanism discussed [in the document] does not refer to ondansetron or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\" It contends that it \"never determined that Zofran could cause birth defects of any kind by the mechanism discussed\" in the document, and that \"no drug-induced embryolethality or teratogenicity was observed in the Zofran animal studies.\" (Def. Resp. \u00b6 16). Finally, it contends that Dr. Danielsson's mechanism is merely hypothetical, and that his opinions are not reliable, adequately supported, or admissible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In its September 2015 submission to the FDA, Novartis's clinical overview described, among other sources, two papers authored by Dr. Danielsson in 2007 and 2014. It characterized the 2014 paper as having found that \"hERG channel blockade could induce developmental toxicity generally due to embryonic heart arrhythmias leading to transient hypoxia and reperfusion injuries.\" (Jenner Decl. Ex. J at 307). However, after an extensive review of the literature, Novartis discounted the proposed mechanism based, at least in part, on its understanding at the time that the results of Zofran reproduction studies conducted in the United Kingdom did not indicate an increased risk of embryonic death or malformations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pls. CMF \u00b6 24; Def. Resp. \u00b6 24). The FDA ultimately rejected Novartis's request to add a pregnancy warning in 2016, based, in part, on the fact that it found \"no evidence, nonclinical or mechanism of action, that raises concerns for adverse fetal outcomes with Zofran.\" (Hill Decl. Ex. 27 at 451).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Adverse Event Data\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that beginning in 2005, GSK failed to disclose, or incorrectly coded, certain adverse event reports and failed to include those reports in the Zofran safety database, thereby excluding them from the data analysis provided to the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     GSK's 2005 Adverse Event Coding and 2014 Disproportionality Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Under FDA regulations, a drug manufacturer is required to fully disclose all \"adverse event\" data it receives about the use of the drug in humans, both during the NDA process and afterward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20314.50\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 314.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2) (\"The NDA is required to contain copies of individual case report forms for each patient who died during a clinical study or who did not complete the study because of an adverse event, whether believed to be drug related or not, including patients receiving reference drugs or placebo [ {unless this requirement is waived} ].\"); 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(B) (\"The applicant must ... update periodically its pending NDA with new safety information learned about the drug that may reasonably affect the statement of contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions in the draft labeling ....

(Jenner Decl. Ex. W).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that in a 2005 report summarizing pediatric events involving Zofran, GSK categorized cardiac-related congenital adverse events under six separate SOCs: (1) cardiac disorders; (2) congenital, familial, and genetic disorders; (3) general disorders and administration site concerns; (4) injury poisoning and procedural complications; (5) nervous system disorders; and (6) respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. (Pls. CMF \u00b6 29, citing Jenner Decl. Ex. Y at 511). They further contend that in 2014, GSK responded to an FDA request for data on Zofran use in pregnancy with a disproportionality analysis (\"DPA\") on only two SOCs: (1) cardiac disorders and (2) pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions. (Pls. CMF \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, citing Jenner Decl. Ex. Z at 129, 165). Plaintiffs allege this \"limited analysis necessarily undercount[ed] the reporting of congenital cardiac adverse events which were categorized under other SOCs,\" such that an increased risk of birth defects would not be detected in the summary provided to the FDA. (Pls. Mem. at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   GSK has responded to that claim in a number of ways. First, it denies that the adverse events reports in question were miscoded. Second, it disputes that the 2014 DPA was ever sent to the FDA. Third, it contends that it regularly supplied the FDA with detailed information about pregnancy-related events, not just coded lists and DPAs. Fourth, it contends that plaintiffs are unable to show that some other kind of coding would have demonstrated an increased risk. Finally, it contends that the FDA considered and rejected pregnancy warnings after discounting the value of adverse event reports, finding them not significant given the background incidence rate of heart defects.

The study, entitled \"The safety of ondansetron for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a prospective comparative study,\" was by Adrienne Einarson\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , and was published in September 2004. (Jenner Decl. Ex.

First, that burden-shifting framework does not appear to have been adopted by any appellate court. While district courts are frequently called upon to break new ground in dealing with legal issues, it is far from clear that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to do so. Perhaps more importantly, the\n   <em>\n    Utts\n   </em>\n   framework seems to suggest that a plaintiff in a failure-to-warn case against a brand-name manufacturer\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   establish, as a part of its affirmative case, that there was \"newly acquired information\" sufficient to support a labeling change under the CBE process. Does that mean all plaintiffs in such failure-to-warn cases must always assume that the manufacturer will raise an FDA preemption defense, and allege and prove facts sufficient to rebut it? Or is that requirement triggered only if\n   a manufacturer raises preemption as a defense? If the latter, does that mean the burden shifts multiple times: it begins with the manufacturer (to point to facts sufficient to raise a preemption defense), then shifts back to the plaintiff (to point to \"newly acquired information\" sufficient to show that the CBE process could be used), then back again to the manufacturer (to show by \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have approved the change)? That framework seems unduly cumbersome and unnecessary, and appears to run counter to First Circuit law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Celexa\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit observed that \"a necessary step in defeating [the manufacturer's] preemption defense is to establish that the complaint alleges a labeling deficiency that [the manufacturer] could have corrected using the CBE regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p37\">\n    779 F.3d at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then stated that the complaint in that case plainly alleged that the defendant was a brand-name manufacturer and the drug was a brand-name drug (and, therefore, the manufacturer could use the CBE process).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p37\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It then went on to state: \"So the question to which we now turn is whether the CBE regulation allows a brand name manufacturer to make the particular type of change that plaintiffs say [the manufacturer] needed to have made to avoid liability under [state] law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p37\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After reviewing the allegations of the complaint, the court concluded that it did not, because the complaint could not plausibly be read as relying on newly acquired information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p37\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p37\">\n    at 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Celexa\n   </em>\n   court thus did not employ a burden-shifting framework; rather, it treated preemption like any other affirmative defense. When an affirmative defense is raised, the burden does not shift to the plaintiff to disprove it. Nonetheless, a defendant can prevail on a motion to dismiss (if the allegations of the complaint are insufficient) or on summary judgment (if the undisputed evidence is insufficient). But the burden never shifts from the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Under the circumstances, and again without benefit of guidance from a higher court, it appears that FDA preemption is an affirmative defense, like any other, and that a burden-shifting framework is inappropriate. A manufacturer may prove that the CBE process was not available to implement changes unilaterally (because, for example, there was no \"newly acquired information\")\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that the FDA would not have approved the proposed label change. It can do so by pointing to shortcomings in the complaint (on a motion to dismiss) or the evidence (on a motion for summary judgment). In short, and in keeping with what seems to be the intent of the court in\n   <em>\n    Wyeth\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that preemption is an affirmative defense as to which defendant bears the burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Whether Preemption Presents a Question of Fact for the Jury\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The next question is whether the preemption issue is a question of law, to be resolved by the judge, or a question of fact, to be resolved by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under the circumstances, it appears at a minimum that there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether GSK properly disclosed the Japanese animal studies to the FDA, and whether those disclosures would have been material to a reasonable regulator at the agency. The Court therefore cannot conclude, on the present record, that the Japanese animal studies were not \"newly acquired information\" or would not have revealed \"risks of a different type or greater severity or frequency\" than previously included in submissions to the FDA, or that there is \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would have rejected plaintiffs' proposed label changes even if a more comprehensive disclosure had been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Adverse Event Data\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The parties further dispute whether GSK properly disclosed adverse\n   event data to the FDA, and whether that data would have affected the FDA's decision concerning the label.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   GSK does not seem to contend that it coded adverse event data appropriately in all respects. Rather, it contends that plaintiffs \"incorrectly suggest that the only information GSK provided to FDA about adverse events was in the form of coded lists or disproportionality analyses,\" and that in truth it \"provided far more detailed information to FDA about events reported to it, including pregnancy related events, on a regular basis, as required by the regulations.\" (Def.

GSK contends (1) that plaintiffs cannot show that some other kind of coding would have revealed an increased risk of birth defects, (2) that the adverse event data in question did not \"reveal risks of a different type or greater severity or frequency than previously included in submissions to [the] FDA,\" and therefore (3) that it had no obligation to use the CBE process to amend the label.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.3\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, GSK contends that the FDA \"wholly discounted the value of adverse events during the label change discussion between Novartis and FDA,\" stating that \"[i]t is not possible to rely on case reports of congenital abnormalities to determine drug attribution given that the background incidence of major congenital abnormalities is 2-4%.\" (Def.

It therefore concludes that there is clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a label change based on that data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Again, plaintiffs rely largely on Dr. Harvey's report, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   When assessing a drug's safety and making regulatory decisions, FDA considers adverse event reports as part of the totality of the evidence, including information reported on the mechanism of action, clinical studies, literature and preclinical studies.

Dr. Harvey's opinion simply states in general terms that GSK did not report \"all the information in its possession related to adverse event reports,\" and that GSK's analysis did not include \"all adverse events that GSK knew or should have known about.\" He does not, however, seem to opine that GSK miscoded adverse events in any specific instance, or that the FDA would have taken a different\n   position as to the label had the data been coded differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Nonetheless, whatever holes may exist in Dr. Harvey's report, it is not plaintiffs' burden to prove a lack of preemption; GSK has the burden of establishing that the requirements of the preemption defense\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   apply. Again, and at a minimum, it appears that there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether GSK properly coded and disclosed adverse event data to the FDA, and whether those disclosures would have been material to a reasonable regulator.

Mem. at 17). Plaintiffs essentially contend that GSK knew of the existence of the mechanism-of-action data and did not provide that information to the FDA. Plaintiffs further contend that (1) GSK's failure to disclose that information caused Novartis to discount Dr. Danielsson's evidence of the hERG channel mechanism in its 2015 FDA submission, and (2) a 2016 FDA statement about the lack of such evidence as a basis for rejecting Novartis's request to add a pregnancy warning, taken together, show that the failure to disclose was material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   GSK contends that the hERG channel mechanism proffered by Dr. Danielsson cannot constitute \"newly acquired information,\" because the FDA twice considered his evidence of the mechanism of action, as well as the two studies that he relied on to make his findings, and still concluded there was insufficient data to support a pregnancy warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The actual evidence in the record as to this issue is sparse.

The CBE regulation, however, existed long before the creation of the \"Use in Specific Populations\" addition and was not amended to then preclude changes made to that particular section.

The FDA did not intend to prohibit changes to that portion of the label concerning \"use in specific populations\" when it revised the regulation. That conclusion is bolstered by the common-sense view that it is highly unlikely that the FDA intended to prohibit a drug company from making voluntary changes to labels affecting specific vulnerable populations (such as pregnant women), if the company became aware of a risk after initial approval of the drug.

If the complaint satisfies the plausibility standard, the defendant may later move for summary judgment on the same ground. The plaintiff may defeat summary judgment by producing evidence sufficient to show a genuine issue of material fact as to timeliness (for example, that accrual of the action should be delayed by the discovery rule).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-269\">\n    As noted, Zofran was the subject of five NDAs, approved between 1991 and 1999.
