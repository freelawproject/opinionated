Plaintiff Arabian Support &amp; Services Co. (\"ASASCO\"), a Saudi Arabian company, brings this action against Defendant Textron Systems Corporation (\"Textron\" or \"TSC\"), a Massachusetts-based defense contractor, alleging that it is entitled to six percent of the value of TSC's sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia as compensation for its efforts to help TSC secure the contract. ASASCO seeks compensation from TSC based either on the promise of additional compensation for securing the sale of the cluster bombs or on the promised opportunity to provide offset services related to the sale. In the First Amended Complaint (Docket No. 107) (\"Compl.\"), ASASCO asserts claims of fraudulent inducement (Count I), intentional misrepresentation (Count II), negligent misrepresentation (Count III), quasi contract/implied contract/promissory estoppel (Count IV), quasi contract/unjust enrichment/quantum meruit (Count V), and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 93A (\"Chapter 93A\") (Count VI). The parties have engaged in extensive discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is TSC's motion for summary judgment on all counts (Docket No. 190) and three motions to strike certain witness statements and opinions (Docket Nos. 194, 196, and 221). TSC also renews its motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket No. 193).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   TSC's motion for summary judgment on all counts. The Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES AS MOOT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   all three motions to strike because resolution of the motion for summary judgment does not depend on any of the disputed testimony or expert opinions. The Court also\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   TSC's renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground the Court has ruled on the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Beginning of the TSC-ASASCO Relationship\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to sell munitions and other defense items to the government of Saudi Arabia, TSC needed a consultant in Saudi Arabia who could provide it with access to Saudi government officials and convince those officials to budget funding towards TSC-specific products. The relationship between TSC and ASASCO largely developed through interactions between Avedis (Avo) Boyamian, TSC's Director of Middle East Business Development, and Mansour Al-Tassan, ASASCO's President and founder. At the recommendation of General Abdullah Hamdan, considered the \"father\" of the modern Saudi Arabian air force, Boyamian and Al-Tassan began to discuss working together in 2001. By 2003, the men were discussing the market potential of selling cluster bombs to the Royal Saudi Air Force. In the spring of 2004, TSC began to discuss internally how best to structure a business relationship with ASASCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One key hurdle to the relationship was ensuring that any agreement and compensation scheme was lawful under U.S. and\n   Saudi law. To that end, Robert Kemp, TSC's General Counsel, sought legal advice from the International Law Firm in Riyadh on how to structure the relationship. On March 24, 2004, he emailed attorney Yusuf Giansiracusa, asking about the permissibility of engaging a marketing consultant on a fixed monthly fee basis and the feasibility of ASASCO's serving as a service center provider in Saudi Arabia. Giansiracusa advised that \"[e]mploying a marketing consultant for one or many different projects and/or products is, in general, permissible as a matter of Saudi law.\" Pl. Ex. 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he cautioned that if a consultant's \"fixed fee is merely a commission re-styled as a fixed fee, it will not be permissible if the commission would not be permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Giansiracusa approved of the idea of using ASASCO as a service center provider and suggested that there is \"no reason in principle that Asasco [sic] couldn't act as a marketing consultant as well as a Service Centre operator under separate contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, he noted that \"[a]s a lethal product, the SFW cannot be sold through an agent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 30, 2004, Boyamian forwarded a letter to ASASCO, which stated: \"The Textron Systems' management team would appreciate your advocacy support for the [Royal Saudi Air Force] procurement of SFW. In recognition of your advocacy, TSC is prepared to appoint ASASCO as a service center for support to the [Royal Saudi Air Force] SFW program.\" Pl. Ex. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kemp emailed Giansiracusa again on July 8, 2004 requesting advice on the possibility of paying ASASCO via a commission for securing the sale of the bombs. Kemp wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [W]e do not have a business case for a joint venture with ASASCO because of the nature of this weapon .... In addition, because of the potentially great expense of engaging a consultant on a fixed, periodic, non-contingent fee basis, we have been asked to determine whether it would be possible to engage an advocate of the type described above on a commission basis,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   with the amount of the payment based on the size of the ultimate order received and contingent upon the receipt of an order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Avo [Boyamian] has identified ASASCO as the likely advocate for Textron Systems, and he anticipates that they will expect a fee in the range of four percent (4%) of a sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pl. Ex. 37. On September 1, 2004, Vernon Cassin of the International Law Firm advised Kemp that the sale of munitions in Saudi Arabia is governed by the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 1275 (\"Resolution 1275\"). Resolution 1275 states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   No firm holding a contract with the Saudi Government for the supply of arms or equipment required by the Saudi Government may pay any sum as a commission to any intermediary, sales agent, representative or broker. This prohibition shall apply regardless of the nationality of the firm or the nationality of the intermediary, sales agent, representative or broker. It shall apply also whether the contract was concluded directly between the Saudi Government and the firm or through a third-party State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pl. Ex. 39. Cassin advised Kemp that the proposed TSC-ASASCO relationship had \"a significant risk of falling within the scope of the relationships prohibited under Resolution 1275.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 15, 2004, Boyamian emailed Al-Tassan, asking to meet in person to discuss the legal opinion provided by Cassin. When Boyamian and Al-Tassan met in Cairo a week later, Boyamian confirmed that TSC was prepared to pay ASASCO an amount equal up to five percent of the total value of the SFW contract, but that the agreement had to comply with U.S. and Saudi law. Boyamian told Al-Tassan that based on Resolution 1275, offsets were the \"only way\" ASASCO could receive such payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl. Ex. 3 at 330:5-9. In 2004, both TSC\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Al-Tassan believed that ASASCO could not receive a commission on the sale of SFWs under Saudi Arabian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Consulting Agreements (2005-2009)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   TSC and ASASCO executed four consulting agreements between 2005 and 2009. On November 10, 2004, Boyamian formally nominated ASASCO to be TSC's consultant in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on selling SFWs to the Royal Saudi Air Force. Boyamian explained in his nominating email to TSC leadership that \"[t]he use of commissioned representatives for sale of weapons in Saudi Arabia is not authorized under local Royal Decree. General consulting agreements to support foreign companies are acceptable.\" Pl. Ex. 44. In late February 2005, TSC and ASASCO executed the first consulting agreement. Al-Tassan understood at that time that ASASCO's role as a consultant was \"to advocate the SFW sale.\" Def. Ex. 1 at 45:14-17. ASASCO entered into this first consulting agreement (and all other consulting agreements) because of promises from TSC that ASASCO would receive additional compensation via the offset requirements for its efforts to assist TSC in selling SFWs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Al-Tassan negotiated, read, and understood the terms of the agreement before signing on behalf of ASASCO. The first agreement was for a year-long term during which ASASCO would be compensated\n   $ 10,000/month. Section 4(b) of the 2005 consulting agreement stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   It is expressly agreed by the parties hereto that any and all services rendered by [ASASCO] to [TSC] shall be deemed to have been given pursuant to this Agreement and no additional payments (with the exception of reimbursement for international travel approved in advance by [TSC] ) shall be due to or paid to [ASASCO].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Def. Ex. 4 \u00a7 4(b). Importantly, in \u00a7 4(c) of the agreement, the parties expressly agreed that ASASCO \"shall not receive any compensation or commission based in any manner whatsoever on the volume of sales of the [TSC] products and/or services procured or received under this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4(c). The agreement also contained a statement of work which remained, in all relevant respects, the same throughout the parties' business relationship. The statement of work included several tasks ASASCO was expected to complete as a consultant, including \"[a]dvocat[ing] at the Saudi [Ministry of Defense and Aviation] or at any other concerned Saudi Authority which is involved in approval of funds, to secure allocation of funds for [TSC's] potential programs.\" Def. Ex. 4 sched. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TSC and ASASCO periodically renewed and extended the consulting agreements. On January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2007, TSC and ASASCO executed the second and third consulting agreements, respectively. Each of these agreements contained substantially similar terms as the first consulting agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After three years of paying ASASCO $ 10,000 per month, TSC considered terminating the consulting relationship with ASASCO. On July 1, 2008, Tom Saling from TSC sent Al-Tassan a letter explaining that TSC would only extend the 2007 consulting agreement on its original terms of $ 10,000/month through August 31, 2008. Saling explained to TSC officials in July 2008 that, \"[TSC] will be terminating the consulting services of ASASCO of Saudi Arabia effective August 31, 2008. The ASASCO agreement was specifically structured to support the sale of SFW to the Kingdom. The sale of SFW to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is pending US Government export approval.\" Pl. Ex. 81. Boyamian followed-up with Al-Tassan on August 15, 2008, writing in part, \"[t]his is in ref to our recent telecom regarding the expiration of the Textron Systems-ASASCO consulting contract on August 31st, 2008 and I regret to confirm that TSC will not be able to renew the Contract beyond August 31st, 2008.\" Pl. Ex. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In early September 2008, Boyamian convinced TSC to renew its consulting agreement with ASASCO under a no-fee arrangement. Boyamian told Kemp that \"ASASCO [did] not expect to be compensated, even in 2009.\" Pl. Ex. 83. However, Kemp noted in an email to Saling and Boyamian that \"this is such a peculiar arrangement that ... it would make more sense to provide a small month [sic] fee in consideration for [ASASCO's] continuing availability to consult with [Boyamian].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 4, 2008, TSC and ASASCO executed an extension of the 2007 consulting agreement on a \"no-fee basis.\" The extension letter to Al-Tassan stated in part that \"[a]s you have previously discussed with Avo Boyamian, effective September 1, 2008, ASASCO will not receive the monthly consultancy fee for the extended term of the agreement.\" Def. Ex. 9. A few days later, Boyamian sent an email to colleagues at TSC explaining the no-fee arrangement: \"Effective September 1st, 2008, TSC stopped paying ASASCO the monthly consultancy fee because, TSC through Blenheim, an offset service provider\n   company based in UK, has an offset service providing agreement with ASASCO for TSC business offset requirements in Saudi Arabia.\" Pl. Ex. 93. Boyamian forwarded this email to Al-Tassan the next day. At the time, TSC, ASASCO, and Blenheim Capital Partners, Ltd. (\"Blenheim\") were still negotiating the terms of pending offset services agreements, discussed further below. The \"no-fee\" consulting agreement was extended through August 31, 2009, when TSC and ASASCO entered into a fourth consulting agreement. The fourth agreement was effective September 1, 2009 through August 31, 2011, and paid ASASCO a consulting fee of $ 500 per month as Kemp suggested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     The Separate Offset Agreements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Offsets in Saudi Arabia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to ASASCO's expert Leslie Janka,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Saudi Arabia generally requires offsets on foreign sales to the Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation. A defense contractor's offset requirement is set by establishing a percentage of the total value of the sale that must be earned in \"offset credits.\" For the relevant time period, the Saudi government required offsets of 35% of the total purchase price - until 2012 when it increased to 40% of the purchase price - for all defense contracts in excess of 400 million Saudi riyals (approximately US $ 104 million). Saudi regulations appear to require a defense contractor to have an approved offset plan in place before a supply contract can be signed. However, a defense contractor is not obligated to perform the offsets itself but can subcontract the obligation to a third-party offset services provider. The provider is obligated to develop and get approval for offset projects to earn the defense contractor the required offset credits. For reasons of expediency or politics, Saudi Arabia may waive an offset requirement. The waiver would usually occur through a written document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. TSC-ASASCO Offset Conversations (2006)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While executing the first consulting agreement, Boyamian and Al-Tassan continued to discuss additional compensation for ASASCO via offsets. Boyamian explained that by May 2006, TSC and ASASCO \"had a consultancy agreement, which is a standing alone agreement. Now, we were starting - [Al-Tassan] was talking about joint venture activities or offset-providing activities. That was a totally separate subject.\" Pl. Ex. 2 at 138:16-139:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In May, Al-Tassan emailed Boyamian a proposed structure for the offset arrangement and invited TSC to respond and comment. The proposal detailed how TSC would pay $ 35 million to Aerosource Inc., a company fully owned and operated by ASASCO. Aerosource would invest $ 5 million in economic offset projects in Saudi Arabia and retain the remaining $ 30 million as a \"consultancy fee.\" One of Al-Tassan's stated objectives of the proposal was \"[t]o facilitate consultancy fees to ASASCO.\" Pl. Ex. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   TSC responded to Al-Tassan's proposal shortly afterwards. TSC mentioned investing five percent of the value of the SFW contract into offset projects, but it noted that \"[a]ll such activity must result in Saudi Gov't approval of offset projects, grant credits/or waive requirement.\" Pl. Ex. 51. \"Next steps\" would be for TSC and ASASCO \"to review potential project portfolio\n   and develop strategy to gain Saudi approval as offset,\" and for TSC \"to provide ASASCO with 'offset provider' agreement as means to begin to solidify approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In June 2006, Boyamian emailed Al-Tassan a draft offset provider agreement between ASASCO and TSC. The agreement was prepared by Neil Rutter, TSC's Offset Manager. The draft provided that ASASCO would be \"entitled to receive a fee of X percent (X%) of the value of an Offset Waiver provided that TSC is satisfied that any potential Offset Obligation has been waived irrevocably.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl. Ex. 53 \u00a7 2.1. Alternatively, ASASCO would be \"entitled to receive a fee of X percent (X%) of the value of an Offset Credit obtained through successful execution of an Offset Project.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl. Ex. 53 \u00a7 3.1. For ASASCO to be compensated for any offset credits, the draft provided that TSC had to advise ASASCO in writing that it had approved the offset project. Pl. Ex. 53, \u00a7 3.2. This draft agreement was never finalized or signed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On June 26, 2006, Boyamian forwarded Al-Tassan an email chain containing a series of internal TSC emails discussing ASASCO as a consultant and an offset services provider. The email chain contained instructions for a compliance analyst at TSC to prepare \"two books: one for a new offset agreement with ASASCO, and one for a renewal of the consultant agreement.\" Pl. Ex. 54. Boyamian forwarded the emails to Al-Tassan to motivate him. Boyamian understood the consulting agreements and the proposed offset agreement as \"two separate things.\" Pl. Ex. 2 at 155:23-156:1. Al-Tassan also understood that any arrangement under which payment would be made for offset related services would be a separate fee from the fee paid to ASASCO under the consulting agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Blenheim Capital (2006-2007)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 12, 2006, Rutter advised TSC leadership that because of certain legal limitations on foreign military sales, TSC needed to engage a third party, Blenheim Capital, to manage the investing and coordination of offset services in Saudi Arabia. ASASCO would continue to develop offset projects, but Rutter noted that ASASCO did \"not ha[ve] much experience with offset [sic] in the Kingdom (or anywhere else).\" Pl. Ex. 56. Rutter suggested that TSC needed to \"[c]ome to an agreement with Blenheim Capital to support [TSC's] offset activities in the Kingdom, at a cost not to exceed 2%, with payments again being contingent on a sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later in September, Boyamian emailed Al-Tassan to request that Al-Tassan meet with a representative from Blenheim to further discuss offset projects. By June 2007, TSC had decided to create a TSC-Blenheim agreement and then a separate Blenheim-ASASCO agreement instead of directly contracting with ASASCO for offset services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D. TSC-Blenheim Offset Agreement (2008)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In February 2008, TSC entered into an Offset Services Agreement (\"OSA\") with\n   Blenheim. The agreement established a relationship between the companies in which Blenheim would help TSC either avoid any offset requirements or meet any formal offset obligations that arose from the sale of SFWs. The OSA provided that, in the event that Blenheim was able to acquire a waiver, TSC agreed to pay Blenheim a fee of two percent or six percent of the value of the SFW supply contract, depending on whether the sale was completed as a government-to-government sale or as a direct commercial sale, respectively. The OSA provided that if there was a waiver of the offset obligation, it must be completed within six months of the sale. In the event that TSC entered into an offset contract with Saudi Arabia, the OSA provided Blenheim would receive a fee of six percent of the value of the supply contract for any offset credits actually received. Blenheim could enter into a subcontract with ASASCO to fulfill its duties under the OSA but could not enter into a subcontract with any other third party without the written consent of TSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    E. ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement (2009)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   During the summer and fall of 2007, before the OSA between TSC and Blenheim was finalized, Al-Tassan continued to negotiate ASASCO's compensation under an offset agreement. Boyamian sent Al-Tassan a draft of the OSA between TSC and Blenheim on June 14, 2007. The OSA draft included a fee to Blenheim of six percent. On June 21, 2007, Al-Tassan met with Boyamian, Rutter, and Grant Rogan (from Blenheim) at the Paris Air Show to further discuss offsets. At that meeting, Al-Tassan alleges that Boyamian promised him ASASCO would receive six percent of the value of the supply contract for offset services, and Blenheim's fee would be two percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Throughout the fall of 2008 and spring of 2009, Al-Tassan continued to negotiate ASASCO's exact fee with TSC and Blenheim. On September 8, 2008, Al-Tassan emailed Boyamian with edits to the proposed Blenheim-ASASCO agreement. He stated: \"What is unacceptable is the fee structure.... To receive '75% of such fee paid by \"TSC\" to the Escrow Agreement' is not as we have agreed in Abu Dhabi and Paris.\" Pl. Ex. 91. Al-Tassan emailed Boyamian again on November 11, 2008 to get his input on the payment structure between the three companies. Boyamian replied that Al-Tassan should look back at the TSC-Blenheim agreement, but that it was his understanding that \"Textron will be paying 8% of the contract value\" to an escrow account with Blenheim to meet its offset obligations, of which ASASCO would be entitled to seven-eighths. Pl. Ex. 98. This understanding turned out to be incorrect. The final OSA signed between TSC and Blenheim, as stated above, provided that Blenheim would receive six percent of the value of the supply contract, contingent on providing credits or a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In early 2009, Al-Tassan emailed representatives from TSC and Blenheim twice asking for clarification about ASASCO's fee - essentially asking for confirmation that 75% of what Blenheim received from TSC equated to six percent of the value of the supply contract. Al-Tassan also indicated at that time he thought there were \"two parts of the fee\" - a fee for acquisition and a fee for offsets. Pl. Ex. 100. There is no record that anyone from TSC or Blenheim responded to either of these emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nevertheless, on April 6, 2009 Blenheim and ASASCO finalized and entered into a subcontract whereby ASASCO would assist Blenheim in its efforts to secure either an offset waiver or an offset contract with Saudi Arabia (hereinafter the \"ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement\"). Al-Tassan believed\n   that the ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement would be \"a vehicle to pay ASASCO\" a \"success fee.\" Def. Ex. 1 at 124:15-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The agreement provided, in part, that if TSC paid a fee into the escrow account pursuant to the OSA (between TSC and Blenheim), then ASASCO would be entitled to 75% of such fee. Additionally, if TSC entered into a formal offset obligation with Saudi Arabia, then ASASCO's fees would have to be used solely for the purpose of investment in offset credit projects approved by Saudi Arabia. Al-Tassan understood that ASASCO could only be paid under the ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement if there was a waiver of offset obligations or if offset credits were earned by an offset program approved by Saudi Arabia. The agreement defined its \"Termination Date\" as \"the date on which the Offset Services Agreement [OSA] is terminated for any reason.\" Pl. Ex. 104 (\"ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement\") \u00a7 1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     2011-2013\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Al-Tassan Leaves Saudi Arabia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In early 2011, Al-Tassan left Saudia Arabia for Bahrain and has, to date, never returned. Al-Tassan's decision to leave Saudi Arabia stemmed from a civil judgment entered against him in the General Court in Riyadh for the equivalent of $ 26.5 million. The judgment arose from a civil dispute involving the Bahraini Executive Air Services Company (\"Bexair\"), in which Al-Tassan owns shares and for which he serves as chairman. The judgment was entered against Al-Tassan on October 12, 2009. On June 22, 2010 the Riyadh police issued a civil arrest warrant for Al-Tassan pursuant to its debt collection procedures. In connection with the civil arrest warrant, an electronic order (\"travel ban\") prohibiting Al-Tassan from leaving Saudi Arabia was issued. Al-Tassan never informed TSC or Blenheim of the judgment, arrest warrant, travel ban, or his decision to leave Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Al-Tassan specifically hid the fact that he was not in Saudi Arabia from TSC officials. On at least one occasion after he fled Saudi Arabia, Al-Tassan asked his assistant, Dennis Shotwell, to draft an email with an excuse for not being able to meet TSC officials in Riyadh, which he ultimately sent to TSC officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When Al-Tassan left Saudi Arabia in early 2011, ASASCO was still a party to the consulting agreement and the ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement. ASASCO still arranged for meetings between TSC and Saudi government representatives, but ASASCO representatives did not attend a single in-person meeting with Saudi officials regarding TSC's business after Al-Tassan left the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. TSC Re-Evaluates the OSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On May 5, 2011, Stephen Fogarty, TSC's newly hired Director of Business Offsets, sent an email to officials at TSC saying it was \"imperative\" that the Blenheim OSA for Saudi SFWs be terminated for a variety of reasons. Pl. Ex. 121. Attached to the email was Fogarty's evaluation of the financial impact of the OSA. As part of Fogarty's evaluation, he noted that a \"6% fee based on full contract value is excessive\" in either the waiver or offset credit scenario.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He further noted that \"[b]ased on 35% Offset Obligation, the fee as a percentage of Offset Obligation is 17.1%,\" and that this was \"beyond any measure of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Besides terminating the OSA, Fogarty also recommended that TSC \"[d]evelop alternative offset projects in advance\" of Saudi Arabia signing a formal agreement with the United States to purchase SFWs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The next day, a TSC official forwarded Fogarty's evaluation to TSC leadership and recommended that TSC terminate the\n   OSA. The official noted that the OSA included a sub-agreement whereby ASASCO would receive \"2/3 of the fee\" which he described as \"[v]ery out of the ordinary.\" Pl. Ex. 122. He explained that TSC used ASASCO \"as a consultant on SFW and therefore we would be taking food off the table of our own consultant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. United States Announces Foreign Military Sale\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Meanwhile, the sale of SFWs was rapidly moving forward. In January 2011, Saudi Arabia sent a letter to the United States government officially requesting that it be allowed to buy 1,300 SFWs from the United States. On June 10, 2011, the Department of Defense provided statutorily required notice to Congress of a possible sale to Saudi Arabia of SFWs, associated equipment, parts, training, and logistical support for an estimated cost of $ 355 million. The notice stated that \"[t]he prime contractor will be Textron Systems Corporation of Wilmington, MA. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.\" Pl. Ex. 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D. TSC Discusses Offsets with Saudi Arabia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Before Saudi Arabia signed a final contract with the United States, TSC, as the SFW supplier, sought to finalize an offset arrangement with Saudi Arabia. On July 19, 2011, Tom Boyle from TSC sent an offset concept paper to Brigadier General Mohammad Al-Lomalen, the Assistant to the Secretary of the Saudi Economic Offset Committee, detailing a proposed offset project with Bexair-Saudi Arabia. Tom Boyle's email to General Al-Lomalen stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   After our meeting in Paris a few weeks ago and our discussions regarding the next steps to finalize the Textron Saudi Offset Contract, we have taken the steps to develop a Saudi Company that will work with us and the [Royal Saudi Air Force (\"RSAF\") ] on our Sensor Fused Weapon (SFW) contract and we will utilize as a direct offset project ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The attached concept paper details that we will work with Bexair-Saudi Arabia (www.bexair.com) in Riyadh to do the RSAF pilot training on the SFW program as part of our offset program.

One day later, General Al-Lomalen responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   EOS has analyzed your proposal, and has the following comments:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   1. The proposal does not meet the priorities set by the [Economic Offset Committee].

To avoid any embarrassment, we strongly recommend that you consult with the EOC before engaging any third party.

[It] is asking us to come up with a project to involve manufacturing.\" Pl. Ex. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   During the fall of 2011, TSC and Al-Tassan continued to exchange emails and have conversations around potential manufacturing projects that might meet with Saudi approval, including a project involving Rolls Royce and another involving manufacturing thermal batteries. By October 2011, Boyle believed that the Economic Offset Committee did not want to work with Al-Tassan. When asked why he did not tell Al-Tassan that the EOC expressed concerns about working with him, Boyle stated that he believed TSC could still develop a project with ASASCO and craft it in such a way that it would be viewed by Saudi Arabia as a TSC, and not an ASASCO, driven project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Fifth Consulting Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While continuing to discuss offset projects, TSC and ASASCO entered into a fifth consulting agreement, effective September 1, 2011. Under the agreement, ASASCO was paid $ 500 per month, the same amount as the last agreement, to continue consulting on the sale of SFWs. The fifth consulting agreement was materially the same as the prior four with one key difference. The fifth agreement also contained an integration provision which asserted that each party waived the right to assert any claim against the other \"based on any oral representations, statement, promise or agreement whether made before or after the date of this Agreement.\" Pl. Ex. 129 \u00a7 16. Al-Tassan read and initialed each page of the fifth consulting agreement. At the time Al-Tassan signed the fifth agreement, no one from TSC had told Al-Tassan that the company was contemplating terminating the OSA with Blenheim. Al-Tassan also did not tell anyone from TSC that he had fled from Saudi Arabia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    F. TSC Terminates the OSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In November 2011, TSC acted on Fogarty's recommendation to terminate the OSA with Blenheim. On November 28, 2011, Boyle from TSC emailed a letter to Blenheim representatives stating that \"[i]n recognition of recent changes to the offset guidelines in Saudi Arabia,\" TSC and Blenheim agreed to mutually terminate the OSA. Pl. Ex. 142; Def. Ex. 31. The letter was signed and accepted by Blenheim Capital on January 12, 2012. ASASCO does not dispute that by its terms, the Blenheim-ASASCO agreement also terminated when the OSA was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Saudi Arabia Signs the Letter of Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The United States government and Saudi Arabia executed a Letter of Agreement (\"LOA\") on December 24, 2011 whereby Saudi Arabia agreed to purchase SFWs from the United States. Boyamian emailed Al-Tassan to tell him the news about the agreement on January 3, 2012. The emailed stated: \"Dear Mansour, Our brothers in Saudi Arabia, signed the LOA on December 24, 2011 at the Christmas eve, as a Christmas gift to us. CONGRATULATIONS to all of us.\" Pl. Ex. 143. The agreement finalized the terms of the sale of SFWs between the United States government and Saudi Arabia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Al-Tassan Believes Blenheim is \"Out of the Picture\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties dispute whether TSC told Al-Tassan that TSC and Blenheim had terminated the OSA. Boyle asserts that he told Al-Tassan about the termination in approximately February 2012, when they ran into each other at the Intercontinental Hotel in Abu Dhabi. Al-Tassan asserts that no one told him anything with regards to the termination of the OSA until September 2013. Nonetheless, on May 30, 2012, Al-Tassan emailed his assistant regarding a document Boyamian had sent to Al-Tassan. The email stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   I have read the document and they have been advised in two options and I would push for the JV to make it more stronger for us. The issue of the SFW has not been resolved yet and I am still trying in many different ways carefully. If you recall our previous agreement calls for compensation - correct but through Blenheim, now Blenheim is out of the picture so, we don't know how to deal with it. Let's think how we can do it and satisfy both mutually.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Pl. Ex. 145; Def. Ex. 32. The same day, Shotwell responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The Memorandum ... provides Textron 2 options - the JV option and the TSO option....

Extension of the Consulting Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   ASASCO and TSC signed an extension of the fifth consulting agreement on August 16, 2012. The extension continued the terms of the agreement through August 31, 2013. Throughout the fall of 2012, Al-Tassan continued to provide services for TSC, including arranging meetings between Saudi officials and Textron's Chairman Scott Donnelly at Boyamian's request. In October 2012, Al-Tassan travelled to Wilmington, MA to meet with Boyamian and others at TSC to discuss, among other things, the SFW transaction. This was Al-Tassan's one in-person meeting with TSC representatives in Massachusetts during the course of the TSC-ASASCO business relationship. Neither party provides evidence of what was specifically said during this meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    J. The Final SFW Supply Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The U.S. Department of Defense announced on August 20, 2013, that Textron Defense Systems, an affiliate of TSC, had been awarded a final contract to provide \"1,300 cluster bomb units\" to Saudi Arabia at a total price of $ 640,786,442. Pl. Ex. 153; Def. Ex. 35. The contract included $ 89.2 million as \"Offset Execution\n   Costs\" - a portion of TSC's expected total offset obligations - on the understanding that TSC would be required to commit to a 40% offset obligation on the contract. Pl. Ex. 154; Def. Ex. 35; Pl. Ex. 8 at 185:14-188:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    K. TSC Does Not Renew Consulting Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   A few days later, on August 29, 2013, TSC notified ASASCO via email that TSC \"elected not to offer a renewal\" of the fifth consulting agreement, which was set to expire on August 31, 2013, and that TSC was \"not aware of any outstanding obligations between the parties.\" Pl. Ex. 155; Def. Ex. 34. Al-Tassan did not respond to this email. Instead, in September 2013, he travelled to Boston, MA where he had dinner with Boyamian. At that dinner, Al-Tassan alleges that he asked Boyamian about the status of the offset obligation, and Boyamian told him TSC had gotten rid of Blenheim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    L. Post-Script: TSC, Saudi Arabia, and Offsets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   On June 9, 2014, a little less than a year after Textron Defense Systems was awarded the final SFW supply contract, Saudi Arabia's Economic Offset Committee confirmed in a letter that TSC's offset commitment on the SFW sale would be 40% of the monetary value of the contract. The letter also stated that TSC's offset commitment of \"forty percent (40%) will be formally included in the Offset Memorandum of Agreement which will be signed by Textron and EOP when the new Economic Offset Guidelines are issued by the EOC.\" Pl. Ex. 158; Def. Ex. 36. Subsequently, a U.S. Air Force Contracting Officer sent a letter to TSC stating: \"The Government recognizes the agreement on the commitment rate of 40% and the U.S. Government will not be requesting a price adjustment concerning the offset value to the negotiated settlement on the subject contract.\" Pl. Ex. 159. Fogarty explained that this letter meant TSC would receive the full $ 640 million and would not have a downward adjustment in contract price due to any change in the assumed offset rate. To date, TSC and Saudi Arabia have not entered into an Offset Memorandum of Agreement. It is unclear whether TSC will ever have to fulfill an offset requirement for the SFW sale. TSC has retained the $ 89.2 million it received as part of the supply contract for offset costs - and has never paid it back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To date ASASCO has not obtained a waiver of TSC's offset requirements from Saudi Arabia. Additionally, ASASCO has not delivered an offset project that has been accepted by Saudi Arabia to satisfy TSC's offset requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   ASASCO filed its original complaint against TSC on July 15, 2015, alleging three counts: (1) breach of contract, (2) tortious interference, and (3) violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A (Docket No. 1). TSC filed a motion to dismiss (Docket No. 22), which the district court (Stearns, J.) converted into a motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 25).

Specifically, the consulting agreements provide ASASCO \"shall not receive any compensation or commission based in any manner whatsoever on the volume of sales of the [TSC] products and/or services procured or received under this Agreement.\" Def. Ex. 4 \u00a7 4(c);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Exs. 5, 6, 18, 30. This contractual provision is consistent with the parties' understanding at the time they entered into the first consulting agreement in 2005 that Saudi Resolution 1275 prohibited commissions on the sale of munitions. The provision undermines any reasonable reliance by ASASCO on any promise that the company would receive a six percent fee for securing the sale of SFWs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit concluded that under Massachusetts law, a \"plaintiff[ ] may not raise as fraudulent any prior oral assertion inconsistent with a contract provision that specifically addressed the particular point at issue\" when \"both parties were experienced in business and the contract was fully negotiated and voluntarily signed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1643477\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/90/#p96\">\n    809 F.2d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The First Circuit addressed this issue when it reversed the earlier grant of summary judgment, offering: \"Why Textron substantially reduced the consulting fee - and why ASASCO acquiesced to the reduction - also seem relevant, and potentially revealing, for ASASCO's claim that it was promised offset-related compensation outside of the consulting agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    ASASCO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276708\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1/#p6\">\n    855 F.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ASASCO claims it was then blindsided when it learned in 2013 that the OSA between TSC and Blenheim was terminated without its knowledge. ASASCO asserts that it continued to work to provide offsets and consulting services between January 12, 2012 and September 2013 in reliance on its belief that it would receive additional compensation via offsets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The flaw in ASASCO's argument is that there is no evidence in the record that Al-Tassan was promised compensation of six percent of the total SFW sale for offset services even if ASASCO did not acquire a waiver or offset credits. While ASASCO and TSC were discussing proposed offset projects in 2006, Tom Harrington wrote to Al-Tassan that TSC was considering investing 5% of the value of the SFW contract into offset projects, but that \"[a]ll such activity must result in Saudi Gov't approval of offset projects, grant credits/or waive requirement.\" Pl. Ex. 51. And while not finalized, the proposed TSC-ASASCO offset service provider agreement required ASASCO to provide either a waiver or credits to be compensated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The parties formalized this understanding through the tripartite offset agreements in 2008 and 2009. Under the OSA there were only two ways for Blenheim to be paid for offset services: (1) if it obtained an irrevocable waiver of TSC's offset requirements or (2) if it developed an offset project that was approved by Saudi Arabia and generated offset credits. Blenheim would receive six percent of the value of the SFW supply contract, on a pro-rata basis, as offset credits were received. With respect to the waiver, Blenheim would receive either 2% or 6% of the value of the SFW contract. Under the terms of the ASASCO-Blenheim Agreement, signed in April 2009, ASASCO would assist Blenheim in its efforts to either produce offset projects that were approved by Saudi Arabia to generate offset credits or help acquire an irrevocable waiver. Under either scenario, though, ASASCO would receive only 75% of any fee earned by Blenheim under the OSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   ASASCO argues that TSC made a number of false representations to ASASCO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   before, during, and after the companies entered into the OSA and ASASCO-Blenheim agreements as to the exact fee it would receive for assisting in offsets. Regardless, the exact amount of the promised percentage fee for offset work is immaterial since ASASCO never produced either an irrevocable waiver or offset credits for TSC. Again, there is no evidence that TSC promised any fees for offset services unless ASASCO produced offset credits or a waiver. And there is no evidence that, even though TSC terminated the OSA, it interfered with ASASCO's efforts and opportunities to provide offsets or acquire a waiver. Quite to the contrary, even while TSC was contemplating terminating the OSA with Blenheim, it still wrote to the Saudi Economic Offset Committee, proposing Bexair (an Al-Tassan company) as an in-country offset service provider for the SFW sale. While the First Circuit was concerned that TSC was denying ASASCO the \"opportunity\" to provide offset services, the ultimate decision maker on offsets is the Saudi government, not TSC. Whether TSC will have to provide offsets in the future is unknown. So there is no evidence TSC deprived ASASCO of the opportunity to provide offset services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment will be allowed on Counts I, II, III, and IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Chapter 93A (Count VI)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   ASASCO contends that the center of gravity of TSC's deceptive acts was in Massachusetts because it is where the \"entire course of misconduct and stringing along ... emanated from.\" Docket No. 207 at 31.

Usually, the purchasing country establishes policies that require a foreign defense contractor to invest some portion of the contract price back into the purchasing country to create jobs or develop industries. A defense supplier is usually permitted to build the price of offsets into the purchase price of the munitions, which has the effect of the foreign government purchaser ultimately paying for part of the investment. Offsets are categorized as \"direct\" or \"indirect.\" Direct offsets occur where the offset project is directly related to the defense item being sold. For example, establishing a local company which could build, service, and maintain aircrafts sold to the purchasing country. However, some defense items do not lend themselves well to direct offsets. Instead, the defense contractor may provide indirect offsets by investing in non-defense related industries.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    TSC moves to strike and exclude certain opinions of ASASCO's expert, Leslie Janka (Docket No. 196).

The motion to strike is therefore denied as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    The draft agreement defined \"Offset Waiver\" as \"a value, stated in dollars, by which TSC's actual Offset Obligation with respect to the Supply Contract is less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the value of the Supply Contract or the Offset Obligation[ ], whichever is higher.\" Pl.
