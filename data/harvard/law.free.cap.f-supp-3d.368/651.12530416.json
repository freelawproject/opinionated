(Opp. Mem. at 13-14.) The Court agrees with Defendants' suggestion. Mr. Simpson was not a partner during most of the time this case has been pending. He joined Beranbaum Menken in October 2015, with no prior experience in wage-and-hour cases, and started working on this case in January 2016. (Time records, ECF No. 195-3, at 12.)

The Court finds that Ms. Moore's hourly rate of $ 300 is high, given the fact that she was not admitted to practice law in the State of New York until September 13, 2017, and her relative lack of experience in wage-and-hour cases. For the period prior to September 13, 2017, the Court in its discretion reduces her hourly rate to $ 150, which is consistent with the hourly rate awarded by other courts in this district to law clerks or attorneys not yet admitted to the bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elisama v.

The Court finds that some hours billed by Mr. Menken at his $ 600 hourly rate during the pretrial phase of this case exceed what was \"necessary to litigate the case effectively.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bergerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759055\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/277/#p289\">\n    652 F.3d at 289-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The attorney who performed most of the work on this case was Mr. Simpson, who recorded 557.45 hours. (Simpson Decl. \u00b6 79.) In addition to Mr. Simpson's hours, Mr. Menken recorded 162.45 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the pretrial phase of the case, some of Mr. Menken's hours appear to the Court not to have been necessary for the effective representation of Plaintiffs. For example, on June 2, 2016, Mr. Menken spent 2.25 hours, at an hourly rate of $ 600, doing\n   legal research (a task more appropriately undertaken by an associate) and recording \"travel time.\" (Time records at 2.) Given Mr. Simpson's extensive work on the case, and his litigation experience (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Simpson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-61), the level of involvement of Mr. Menken as a senior partner seems to the Court to have been somewhat greater than necessary for effective representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the number of \"excessive\" hours of Mr. Menken is difficult to quantify, the Court takes these hours into consideration when determining the across-the-board percentage reduction that is discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Degree Of Success\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court also finds that adjustments need to be made to the hours spent by each of the three plaintiffs' attorneys based upon the outcome of the case, given that the \"most critical factor\" is \"the degree of success obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p437\">\n    461 U.S. at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p437\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Adjustments are required in two respects. First, the Court makes an adjustment based on the number of prevailing Plaintiffs, as compared to those who did not prevail. Second, the Court makes an adjustment based on the fact that even the prevailing Plaintiffs were not successful on all their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The docket in this case reflects a total of 38 Plaintiffs and opt-in Plaintiffs. Of those 38, 23 went to trial, and 17 of them (45% of the total group (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 17 out of 38) ) were prevailing parties. Pursuant to the FLSA and NYLL, recovery of attorneys' fees is available only to those 17. The Court finds it significant that, of the 17 prevailing parties, only 13 (34% of the total group (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 13 out of 38) ) recovered more than $ 300, inclusive of prejudgment interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2/22/19 Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 189, at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition, the prevailing Plaintiffs did not win on every claim they asserted. The Court ruled against Plaintiffs on their liquidated damages claims, and on their claims against Defendant Falk. The Court also ruled, in part, against those prevailing Plaintiffs who worked at both RMP and non-RMP sites (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Adrian Brown, Roger David, Michael Hurst, Jonathan Reece, Israel Rivera, Jose Vicent and Samuel Wright), given that the Court only ruled in favor of those Plaintiffs to the extent they worked at RMP sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also is notable that Plaintiffs dropped two of their claims based upon spread of hours and wage statements (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JPTO at 2), which is an additional indicator of Plaintiffs' limited degree of success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Across-The-Board Percentage Reduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It is impossible to say with any precision how much of the time spent by Beranbaum Menken attorneys was devoted\n   to the prevailing Plaintiffs, as opposed to those Plaintiffs who did not prevail. It also is impossible to say with any precision how much of the time spent by those attorneys was devoted to claims that the prevailing Plaintiffs lost or the claims that they dropped. Finally, as noted above, it is difficult to quantify the number of \"excessive\" hours of Mr. Menken. Thus, the Court finds it appropriate to employ an across-the-board percentage reduction in the hours expended by Plaintiffs' counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In making its determination of the percentage reduction to be used, the Court is guided by the principle of rough justice. \"[T]rial courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney's time.\"\n   <em>\n    Errant Gene Therapeutic, LLC v.

It was not until February 2017, after many hours already were billed by Plaintiffs' counsel, that any of the prevailing Plaintiffs formally became part of this lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2/17/17 Consents to Join Class, ECF Nos. 41-73.) And, as discussed earlier, only 45% of the overall Plaintiffs and opt-in Plaintiffs who appeared in this case prevailed (with only 34% recovering more than $ 300), and even then, did not prevail on all their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court recognizes, however, that some work done on behalf of the non-prevailing Plaintiffs was required for the prevailing Plaintiffs to win, including deposing Defendants' witnesses. And, the Court acknowledges Plaintiffs' point that certain of Defendants' conduct during discovery was less than exemplary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 8.) In May and June 2016, Defendant EPIC failed to timely comply with discovery demands, thereby increasing the hours required by Plaintiffs' counsel to pursue their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants argue in favor of a 90% reduction of Plaintiffs' legal fees on the premise, in part, that Plaintiffs' settlement position throughout the case had been \"excessive.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. Mem. at 9-11.) In support of this argument, Defendants submit to the Court evidence of settlement discussions between the parties. (Catina Decl., ECF No. 197, \u00b6\u00b6 3-6, 11-19 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Catina Decl., Exs. A &amp; B, ECF Nos. 197-1 &amp; 197-2.)
