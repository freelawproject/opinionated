(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Order to Show Cause (\"Proposed OSC\"), ECF No. 26, at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Plaintiff's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he acquired an interest in the Property by a Bargain and Sale Deed dated June 27, 2008. (Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1B, ECF No. 1-3 (Bargain and Sale Deed).) At the time, the Property was subject to a foreclosure action (the \"Foreclosure Action\") that Defendant Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in its capacity as Trustee for FFMLT Trust 2006-FF6, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-FF6 (\"Deutsche Bank\"), brought in in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Bronx County (the \"Bronx County Supreme Court\").

In his complaint in this action, Plaintiff describes himself as, among other things, a \"co-borrower\" and \"mortgage payment remitter.\" (Compl. at 1-2, 4.) However, Plaintiff is not a party to the note or the mortgage, and Plaintiff's complaint contains no allegations as to the dates or amounts of any mortgage payments that he made, nor has Plaintiff otherwise provided evidence of such payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1, ECF No. 1-1 (note and mortgage).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 20, 2010, the Bronx County Supreme Court issued a Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale (the \"Foreclosure Judgment\") directing the Referee appointed in the Foreclosure Action to conduct a public sale of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blaine Decl., Ex. G, ECF No. 19-7, at 2-3.) Plaintiff filed various motions as a non-party litigant in the Foreclosure Action, including a motion for an order vacating the sale. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blaine Decl., Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blaine Decl., Ex. K, ECF No. 19-11, at 3 (Bankruptcy Court docket).) On January 5, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court granted Deutsche Bank's motion.

Here, Plaintiff argues that he \"risks losing possession of the [Property]\" if an injunction is not granted. (Proposed OSC at 18.) But as explained above, Plaintiff may seek to invalidate the foreclosure sale in the Bankruptcy Court. Thus, Plaintiff has not identified any harm that he would suffer absent an injunction. Moreover, Plaintiff recognizes that the grant of an injunction would cause harm to Defendants by delaying the resolution of this action and that such a delay would harm Defendants. (Proposed OSC at 18.)
