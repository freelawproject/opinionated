Section 212(f) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Proclamation 9645 is titled \"Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or other Public-Safety Threats.\" It imposes certain immigration and travel restrictions on individuals from designated countries, including Yemen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 6(c) of the Proclamation, however, is a grandfather clause. It provides that \"[n]o immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the applicable effective date under section 7 of this proclamation shall be revoked pursuant to this proclamation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 3(c) of the Proclamation is a waiver provision.

Plaintiffs challenge defendants' delay in printing their visas after their interviews, the subsequent refusal of their visas based on the Proclamation, and defendants' refusal to provide plaintiffs a Proclamation waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs originally filed a complaint on behalf of 61 individuals who are members of 21 Yemeni families. Plaintiffs sought an order mandating that defendants immediately adjudicate their immigrant visa applications. The Court found that documentary and declaratory evidence suggested that 27 plaintiff-beneficiaries were issued approval notices after their consular interviews, construed those approval notices as issued visas under Section 6(c) of Proclamation 9645, and issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Government to complete any necessary security screenings for those plaintiffs and to issue visas to the individuals who cleared the assessments. Defendants complied with their obligations under the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, defendants represent that the Government has\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reconsidered or is in the process of reconsidering each plaintiff's visa or waiver refusal under Section 3(c) of Proclamation 9645. Most plaintiffs were issued immigrant visas as a result of this review, although some individuals were denied visas on substantive grounds of inadmissibility unrelated to Proclamation 9645, and some individuals have yet to be reconsidered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Once defendants complied with the terms of the preliminary injunction, they moved to dismiss the complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding additional plaintiffs and claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended complaint seeks an order mandating defendants to \"correctly adjudicate\" their immigrant visa applications, \"print and issue\" the visas, and provide plaintiffs with an\n   opportunity to submit a waiver to complete adjudication of their immigrant visa applications. The amended complaint also seeks monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Because plaintiffs believe that the Government has treated them according to a \"seemingly uniform policy,\" they argue that their allegations can be resolved with equal uniformity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge, however, that there are factual differences among them. Those differences include \"matters such as the basis upon which Plaintiff-beneficiaries were eligible for visas, when and how the visa approval was communicated to the beneficiary, and the details of the eventual assertion of a visa refusal or denial citing the Proclamation by an embassy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   These are not mere background differences between putative class members, as plaintiffs contend. These differences prohibit a common answer that would drive resolution of their claims. This in many respects is because immigration decisions are uniquely fact-based determinations that are dependent not only on the individualized history of each applicant but also on the law in place at the time of their application. Here, the most obvious barrier to commonality is plaintiffs' concession that the visa \"approvals\" were communicated in different ways and at different times to each plaintiff-beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   If a plaintiff-beneficiary did not receive one of the contested approval notices before the Proclamation became enforceable, then that individual is differently situated in a material way from the plaintiff-beneficiaries who did receive approval notices during the relevant time. That is because the Court must first determine whether the approval notice even constitutes an \"approval,\" or more precisely, an issued visa under Section 6(c) of the Proclamation, as plaintiffs argue it does, before those plaintiffs can proceed with this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, the amended complaint does not include any detailed factual allegations describing how any plaintiff or putative class member was approved for (and subsequently denied) a visa other than by receiving an approval notice and a refusal based on Proclamation 9645. Thus, any of the putative class members who did not receive such a notice - but who still claim to have been approved for a visa and subsequently refused that visa - would have suffered a qualitatively different injury than the plaintiffs who are named or referenced in the amended complaint. Plaintiffs have not shown that their injuries\n   <em>\n    inter se\n   </em>\n   are capable of the same resolution as the individuals who received an approval notice. Thus, the only individuals who might have questions common to them are those plaintiff-beneficiaries who received an approval notice from the Djibouti Embassy but subsequently had their visas refused based on Proclamation 9645, and those plaintiff-petitioners who applied for the immigrant visas on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   But that begs the question of whether the receipt of an approval notice is enough to establish commonality for the purpose of Rule 23(a). It is true that the threshold question of whether the issuance of the approval notice constitutes the issuance of an immigrant visa will resolve a question of law common to those individuals. For example, if the Court determines that an approval notice constitutes an issued visa under Section 6(c) of the Proclamation, then the Court could issue an injunction similar to the preliminary injunction previously issued in this case, directing defendants to conduct any necessary security screenings and print visas for those plaintiff-beneficiaries\n   who pass the assessments and otherwise meet the requirements to obtain a visa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants argue that because each named plaintiff and each putative class member will be differently situated with respect to these subsequent steps following the issuance of any injunction, including the necessary dispositive security assessments, there is no commonality among them. In other words, because each plaintiff cannot receive a visa - which is the ultimate form of relief sought in the amended complaint - without individualized scrutiny, and because some individuals might receive visas and others might not, there is no common answer appropriate to direct classwide relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court agrees with defendants - as it did during the preliminary injunction phase - that it cannot simply direct the Government to print visas for each plaintiff and class member, because each individual would require additional necessary security and vetting procedures before they can receive an immigrant visa and travel packet. For this reason, plaintiffs' ultimate request that the Court mandate that defendants print their visas without any further delay is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But the slightly different question of whether each plaintiff even gets to reach that security screening step is capable of classwide resolution. Indeed, it is the one primary (and dispositive) question that must be determined in the motion to dismiss discussed below. In other words, as plaintiffs even concede, the plaintiffs who received approval notices and were subsequently denied a visa pursuant to Proclamation 9645 have all either suffered an identical injury, or they have all failed to state a claim and cannot obtain any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this respect, plaintiffs' claims are unlike those raised in\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart v. Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, commonality was not established because to determine whether each putative class member was subject to discriminatory employment practices, which was the common injury alleged in the complaint, would have required individualized consideration of each plaintiff's claims to determine whether they suffered a violation of law. But here, whether the visa refusals based on Proclamation 9645 constitute a violation of law is a question that is identical for everyone who received a visa approval. In other words, plaintiffs' theory can be proved on a classwide basis because the individualized consideration that must be given to each plaintiff with respect to their visa eligibility would follow, not precede, any finding by the Court that a violation of law occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, the commonality prong is met, so long as the common question is viewed as whether the receipt of an approval notice constitutes the issuance of an immigrant visa under Section 6(c) of the Proclamation. Indeed, the common question must be viewed this way, because that is the only alleged injury that each plaintiff suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Plaintiffs' allegations that a majority of the named plaintiffs received such a notice does not compel the conclusion that anyone else did too. The fact that plaintiffs' counsel's research suggests that these hypothetical 800 individuals \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   fall into the class\" (emphasis added) is not nearly enough, especially considering that counsel did not put forward the results of that research for the Court or defendants to assess in determining the true scope of the putative class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Initial Pub.

Plaintiffs have failed to do that. Instead, it appears that the 800 number advanced by plaintiffs represents the number of individuals who may have interviewed for an immigrant visa at the Djibouti Embassy during the relevant time, not the number of individuals who are similarly situated to the named plaintiffs with respect to the relevant events that occurred after their interviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, plaintiffs have not advanced any evidence to suggest that any of the 800 or more putative class members received an approval notice from any other embassy besides the Djibouti Embassy. Although plaintiffs attach to the amended complaint what they contend are \"approval notices from around the world,\" there is no apparent connection between those documents and the putative class. As far as the Court can tell, these approval notices were allegedly issued by United States embassies in Mexico, El Salvador, Egypt, and China;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   but plaintiffs' allegations involve only the Djibouti Embassy. Plaintiffs have provided nothing other than the approval notices received by certain of the named plaintiffs from the Djibouti Embassy and the mere existence of four different approval notices issued by other embassies to suggest that any of the 800 or more members of the putative class received an approval notice from any United States embassy at any point. This is not enough to establish the existence of other class members under the numerosity prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, plaintiffs have not advanced any evidence to suggest that any of the 800 or more putative class members are from Syria, Iran, Somalia, or Libya. The fact that these countries do not have embassies with consular services - like Yemen - does not establish that individuals from these four countries are similarly situated to the named plaintiffs or the putative class. Nor does the fact that Proclamation 9645 imposes similar travel and immigration restrictions on individuals from these countries as those imposed on Yemeni nationals make individuals from those four countries more likely to have received an approval notice from either the Djibouti or any other embassy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument that \"[i]f the beneficiaries who are nationals of these four nations suffer conduct from Defendants that is more or less egregious than the conduct Plaintiffs named in the FAC suffer, then Defendants should explain how that could be\" is an entirely insufficient basis upon which to grant class certification. Plaintiffs' use of \"if\" - like the \"may\" with respect to the breadth of the putative class rejected above - implies a fishing expedition, which class certification is not. Plaintiffs did not request additional class discovery, and they have failed to meet their burden of showing that there are in fact other individuals who have suffered the same purported injury as those plaintiffs named in the amended complaint. A class cannot be certified on the speculation of plaintiffs' counsel. Rather, it must be certified on their proof, which plaintiffs have not supplied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs' further argument that the Government is in a better position to determine class membership is well-taken, but ultimately unpersuasive. First, plaintiffs' counsel has an office in Djibouti, through which they were already able to successfully identify over 100 individuals to name in this lawsuit (and purportedly research and ascertain the existence of 800 other individuals). Second, defendants represent that the only way the Government can identify an individual who received one of the contested approval notices is if they came forward and produced a copy of the notice. Although plaintiffs scoff at this assertion, finding it incredulous that the Government would not keep adequate records of this information, the Court will not assume the Government is misrepresenting its ability to determine who received an approval notice. This is especially true given that defendants have maintained throughout the pendency of this litigation that the approval notices were issued in error and their records indicate uniformly that each of the plaintiffs were originally denied an immigrant visa. Based on the information submitted with the motion for class certification, it does not appear that the Government can do anything more than plaintiffs' counsel to identify potential class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Thus, the putative class at best consists of a group of 136 individuals, who plaintiffs have specifically alleged or shown with documentary evidence to have received an approval notice. Although this number is greater than 40, plaintiffs cannot show that \"members of the alleged class are so numerous as to make it impracticable to\n   bring them all before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Demarco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2100220\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/390/836/#p845\">\n    390 F.2d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This analysis overlaps somewhat with both the commonality and numerosity prongs, because based on defendants' representations, there is no way to identify, unless they come forward, individuals who have received an approval notice or the immigration status of those individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, and most glaring, is that the approval notices are not official records of the Government. They are not dated, nor do they have any identifying or authenticating information on them. Once any individual comes forward with their approval notice, it would still require a mini-hearing on the merits of their claim before the parties and the Court could determine whether that individual is a putative class member. Defendants would have to review their records to determine whether that individual actually interviewed with the Djibouti Embassy, and when; whether they were refused pursuant to Proclamation 9645, on substantive grounds of inadmissibility, or not at all; and further, whether that individual received their approval notice before or after the Proclamation became effective; among other inquiries. The merits of each of their immigration statuses would also need to be vetted before they could be recognized as a member of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, as defendants point out, the immigration status of any potential class member could change over the course of the litigation. For example, those plaintiffs undergoing defendants'\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reconsideration of their visa waiver or refusals might be issued (or substantively refused)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   an immigrant visa before they would otherwise receive their requested relief in this case. Indeed, that has already happened, because some putative class members were issued visas and travel packets after having been previously refused under the Proclamation and other putative class members were denied visas based on substantive grounds of inadmissibility after having previously been refused under the Proclamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This shows that, at any point during the litigation, the Court and the parties might not know who in fact is in the class. This risk is untenable, because the class action would be impossible to manage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brecher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356934\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/22/#p24\">\n    806 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   25 n.3 (finding class certification inappropriate for lack of ascertainability where \"the identity of class members will remain fluid even following entry of judgment, since nothing in the new class definition freezes the class composition at any designated time\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although the Second Circuit has explicitly rejected the adoption of a \"freestanding administrative feasibility requirement\" in this analysis, ascertainability still requires that \"a class be defined using objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p264\">\n    862 F.3d at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is not simply that a class action would be unfeasible in this case; it is that at any given moment, the parties and the Court would have to assess the merits of every individual's claim to know whether their allegation of class membership is or remains viable.

That remains the case even if that provision covers a broad range of conduct and the general statutory citation does not indicate the specific subsection or conduct that precipitated the refusal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/#p2131\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Having received a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for their refusal, the Court cannot look beyond that reason under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, even if defendants' issuance of the approval notices constituted an approval or an issued visa, which was later refused on substantive inadmissibility grounds, the INA provides that a consular officer's decision to revoke a previously-issued visa is not subject to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). Thus, the Court simply cannot review these refusals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As a result, the following individuals' claims are dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction: Alya Mohammed Ali Ahmed, Jehan Fateh Musleh Al Najjar, Duaa Emad Abdulla Mugamal, Emad Abdulla Mohamed Mugamal, Mohamed Emad Abdulla Mugamal, Musleh Emad Abdulla Mugamal, Shahd Emad Abdulla Mugamal, Sultan Saleh Ali Obaid, Mona Saleh Ali Obaid, Yassin Mohamed Taher, and Mohamed Ahmed Taher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The plaintiffs reflected on Appendices E, F, and G, however, have not received immigrant visas nor were they rejected on substantive grounds of inadmissibility. These plaintiffs received an approval notice, but their visas were subsequently refused under Proclamation 9645, and their status has not changed since. Although these plaintiffs are currently undergoing the Government's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   case-by-case waiver analysis, the Court must determine whether their refusals\n   based on Proclamation 9645 were facially legitimate and bona fide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Under these circumstances, a refusal based on Proclamation 9645 could only be facially legitimate and bona fide if these plaintiffs were not issued visas before the effective date of the Proclamation. Otherwise, their visas could not be revoked under the Proclamation, pursuant to its grandfather clause. This turns on whether the issuance of the approval notices qualifies as an issuance of plaintiffs' visas under Section 6(c) of the Proclamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants maintain that the approval notices that plaintiffs received do not mean that their immigrant visas were issued for purpose of Proclamation 9645's grandfather clause. Plaintiffs, of course, assert that they do. The Court previously found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits and issued a preliminary injunction ordering defendants to conduct the necessary security screenings and print immigrant visas for plaintiffs who successfully cleared those security assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Although they do not say it explicitly, plaintiffs seem to rely on the Court's decision in issuing the preliminary injunction as law of the case, and demand that the Court issue a similar order for the additional plaintiffs named in the amended complaint. But plaintiffs have provided no reason why the Court should adhere to its preliminary decision, other than the bald assertions made in the amended complaint that defendants acted purposefully, with discriminatory animus, and in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   A district court's decision to grant a temporary or preliminary injunction \"does not constitute the law of the case and will not estop the parties nor the court as to the merits of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Sec. &amp; Exch.

With the benefit of complete briefing of the merits of plaintiffs' claims, the Court must now determine whether plaintiffs were \"issued\" immigrant visas for the purpose of Section 6(c) of Proclamation 9645.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   According to the amended complaint and the documents attached to it, following their immigrant interviews with a consular officer, plaintiffs were given a single sheet of paper informing them that their visas were approved but that they were not ready to be printed or picked up. This piece of paper did not bear an official insignia or stamp, it was not signed or dated, and it did not identify the alien or interviewing consular officer by name or provide any other identifying or biographical information (other than the alien's case number).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In other words, plaintiffs were given a sheet of paper that did not have on it any semblance of officiality or authority. But \"to issue\" means \"[t]o accrue,\" \"[t]o be put forth officially,\" or \"[t]o send out or distribute officially.\"\n   <em>\n    Issue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Although the notices indicated that their visas were approved, there was nothing \"official\" about them. As defendants point out, plaintiffs could not travel or enter the country with one of these approval notices. It is not a proxy for a visa, and it is apparent from each plaintiff's experience that it cannot be traded in for a visa at the Djibouti Embassy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The fact that the approval notice did not purport to be, or even resemble, an official document alone suggests that plaintiffs were not \"issued\" visas before Proclamation 9645's effective date for the purpose of the grandfather clause. This conclusion is further supported by the regulatory and statutory scheme pursuant to which a consular officer may issue or refuse an immigrant visa. At the preliminary injunction stage, the Court focused on the binary nature of a consular officer's decision to issue or refuse a visa following plaintiffs' immigrant interviews. Indeed, the instructions governing the consular officers' conduct are exacting on this point. As noted above, the FAM provides that \"[o]nce an application has been executed, [the consular officer] must either issue the visa or refuse it. [The consular officer] cannot temporarily refuse, suspend, or hold the visa for future action.\" There are no exceptions to this rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 FAM \u00a7 504.11-2(A)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Thus, if the consular officer decides to approve an immigrant visa, the officer must immediately issue it. Conversely, if a consular officer refuses an immigrant visa, the alien must be provided with a document that sets forth the reason or reasons for their refusal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 FAM \u00a7 504.9-2. As the Court said in its order issuing the preliminary injunction, there is no third option. The visa must be issued or refused. Because these duties are non-discretionary; because plaintiffs were not told their visa was refused or provided with a document that set forth the reason for that refusal; and because plaintiffs were provided with a document that said their visas were approved, the Court - for the purpose of a preliminary injunction only - construed the approval notices as issued visas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Upon complete merits briefing and additional consideration of the FAM, the Court gives greater weight to Chapter 9 Section 504.11-2(A)(a) of the FAM, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   [A]ny alien to whom a visa is not issued by the end of the working day on which the application is made, or by the end of the next working day if it is normal post procedure to issue visas to some or all applicants the following day, must be found ineligible under one or more provisions of INA 212(a), 212(e), or 221(g). (INA 221(g) is not to be used when a provision of INA 212(a) is applicable.) This requirement to find an applicant ineligible when a visa is not issued applies even when: (1) (U) A case is medically deferred; (2) (U) The post requests an advisory opinion from the Department; (3) (U) The post decides to make additional local inquiries or conduct a full investigation; or (4) (U) The only deficiency is a clearance from another post.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   When this section of the FAM is read in conjunction with Section 212(a) of the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which is cited in the FAM as a means through which an alien who was not issued a visa on the day of or day following their interview is ineligible for entry, it becomes clear that plaintiffs\n   were not issued visas vis-\u00e0-vis the approval notices that they received. Specifically, Section 212(a)(I) of the INA provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   [A]ny immigrant at the time of application for admission - (I) who is not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by this chapter, and a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or document of identity and nationality if such document is required under the regulations issued by the Attorney General under section 1181(a) of this title, or (II) whose visa has been issued without compliance with the provisions of section 1153 of this title, is inadmissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   If plaintiffs were in fact approved for immigrant visas, the consular officer would have been required under the FAM to issue their visas on the day of their interviews, or the following day. Because they were not issued visas, the INA mandates that plaintiffs are necessarily inadmissible. There are no exceptions to these rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The binary responsibilities of the consular officers - that is, to issue or refuse a visa - remain important. But rather than focusing on the lack of clear refusal, as the Court did during the preliminary injunction phase to construe the approval notices as issued visas, the lack of clear approval - as evidenced by the consular officers' failure to issue each plaintiff a visa on the day of or day following their interview - compels the Court to conclude that plaintiffs were not issued visas when they received these approval notices. Plaintiffs were never given an official document with which they can be deemed admissible under the INA and permissibly enter the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Even though there is a clear distinction between visa issuance and admissibility determinations under the INA, that fact does not change the outcome here. It is true that \"even if a consular officer issues a visa, entry into the United States is not guaranteed.\"\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2414\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2414,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2414\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Upon the alien's arrival in the United States, an immigration official can still determine that the alien is inadmissible under the INA, notwithstanding the fact that they have been issued an immigrant visa pursuant to the process described above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2414\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the fact that plaintiffs could not have used the approval notices to gain admission into the country has some merit with respect to plaintiffs' argument that they still could have been issued a visa before they were refused pursuant to the Proclamation. But this argument is ultimately unpersuasive, because the approval notice could never have been used in lieu of a visa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   These notices cannot be construed as conveying official or authoritative approval. They simply do not have any legal meaning. The approval notice would at best constitute a \"pending case,\" because the visa had not yet been issued. But as the FAM makes clear, \"[t]here is no such thing as an informal refusal or a pending case once a formal application has been made.\" 9 FAM \u00a7 504.11-2(A)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Although it appears that the consular officers in the Djibouti Embassy might not have adhered to their non-discretionary binary responsibilities, that does not mean plaintiffs must have been issued immigrant visas. Any failure by the consular officers to follow the FAM's binary directives cannot transform a visa refusal into a visa approval, nor can an approval notice with no legal import compel the issuance of an\n   immigrant visa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does it give rise to jurisdiction to review those refusals further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

First, it ensures that, consistent with Rule 8(a), a complaint includes \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , 556 U.S. at 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , 550 U.S. at 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). A motion to dismiss for a lack of plausibility argues that the plaintiff has not pled enough facts to give rise to an inference that he is entitled to relief, but instead, that the plaintiff has simply concluded that the elements of a specific violation of law are met and that the identified violation of law therefore occurred. In other words, the plaintiff must provide the defendant with sufficient facts to suggest that the specific violation of law actually happened, and how, such that the defendant has adequate notice of the claims against him. This requirement is known as a well-pled complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Separate from plausibility, however, Rule 12(b)(6) also requires even a well-pled complaint to state a legally cognizable claim for relief. A complaint could include a wealth of specific and particular facts, which would otherwise meet the standard for plausibility, but in some instances, no amount or combination of those facts could ever give rise to a violation of law. So, in addition to pleading plausible facts which give rise to an inference that the defendants are liable for the conduct alleged in the complaint, that alleged conduct must actually constitute a violation of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Portions of plaintiffs' amended complaint provide a perfect example of this latter purpose of Rule 12(b)(6). The amended complaint includes a substantial amount of facts and documents - including photographs - which describe the horrific conditions that plaintiff-beneficiaries fled in Yemen when they relocated to Djibouti. It leaves no doubt that these individuals have suffered greatly because of their circumstances. But the fact of their suffering is not by itself a legally cognizable claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Thus, the Court must look not only at the volume and detail of the facts alleged in the amended complaint; the Court must also consider whether those facts amount to a violation of law such that the Court may grant plaintiffs any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Count 3: Immigration and Nationality Act,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n      8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(1)(A)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that defendants' implementation of Proclamation 9645 violates their rights under the INA to be free from discrimination based on their ethnicity and national origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201152\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) (\"[N]o person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants have \"promulgated and enforced a program that delays adjudication of immigrant visa applications for Yemen[i] nationals\" and that defendants have also \"promulgated and enforced Presidential Proclamation 9645 which discriminates against Plaintiffs based on national origin ...

Indeed, there exists a well-defined, accessible, and regulated statutory procedure whereby relatives of United States citizens, lawful permanent residents, or asylees may apply for a visa. Although plaintiffs' visas were refused under that system, those refusals were based on a facially legitimate and bona fide reason. Because plaintiffs failed to make a sufficient affirmative showing of bad faith on the part of the consular officers, the Court cannot explore those decisions any further, either under Justice Scalia's or Justice Kennedy's opinions in\n   <em>\n    Kerry v.

Plaintiffs have included in the amended complaint only bare-boned and conclusory allegations with respect to the purported reason for the \"delays\" they experienced in this process. There is no question that there existed\n   a window of time between when plaintiffs received an approval notice and when they received a refusal based on Proclamation 9645 or otherwise. But the amended complaint does not even attempt to provide any facts as to why that window of time occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Instead, plaintiffs filled this gap in their factual allegations with speculation and conclusions - namely, that this window of time was a purposeful delay, and that the purported delay was due to defendants' invidious religious discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Court rejects these conclusions.

Although some legislative history supported the expansion in\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

It is palpably clear that the proponents of the Civil Rights Act did not envision that it would apply against the federal government, because through the Civil Rights Act the federal government was vindicating citizens' civil rights against discriminatory state (or arguably private) action. Federal officers (and federal soldiers) were the protectors and enforcers of those rights granted under the post-Civil War Amendments; the very notion that federal officers could have been violators of those rights would have seemed more than strange to the Reconstruction Congress. Thus, it would be equally as, if not more, inconsistent with the purpose of the legislation to apply it to federal officers acting under color of federal law than it would be to apply it to purely private conspiracies that have nothing to do with class-based discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   As a separate, and potentially more obvious matter, if \u00a7 1985(3) applied to federal officers, then it would render\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   actions superfluous. Indeed, one of reasons the Second Circuit, following remand from the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

Breckenridge\n   </em>\n   - that the federal agents who committed the Fourth Amendment violations in that case were not entitled to the absolute immunity from suit that federal officers generally enjoy precisely because \"[t]he Civil Rights Act does not [ ] apply to federal officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

Because those officers could not be sued under the Civil Rights Act (including, by definition, \u00a7 1985(3) ), then there would be no means through which the newfound\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   right of action could be enforced if the federal officers were immune from that suit. This finding reinforces the well-established dichotomy between claims under the Civil Rights Act - including \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 - which are brought against state officers (and to a limited extent, private actors, with respect to \u00a7 1985(3) ), and claims under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , which are brought against federal officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   District courts are split on this issue, although it appears that the weight of authority reads\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

It is well-established that a court will reject a plaintiff's legal conclusions stated in the complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v.

Thus, the Court replaces plaintiffs' \"approval\" characterization with the facts that underly that conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    The parties dispute the total number of plaintiffs covered by the amended complaint. Although plaintiffs state that there are 136 named plaintiffs, it appears that plaintiffs' counsel was less than careful in identifying the individuals in the amended complaint. Defendants have pointed to several instances in which a plaintiff appears in the body of the pleading, but not in the case caption, or vice versa. Plaintiffs' explanation that sometimes their names are spelled in different ways is insufficient to remedy this issue. Defendants are entitled to notice of the individuals who are bringing suit against them and the content and bases for each of their claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bell Atl.

To the extent a plaintiff's name can appear in multiple ways, the case caption should have included other iterations of their name using \"a/k/a.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    In an attempt to achieve clarity, defendants have provided the Court with appendices attached to their motion to dismiss, and updated appendices attached to their reply in support of their motion to dismiss, which identify the individual plaintiffs and the various procedural categories in which they fall (such as those plaintiffs who have received an immigrant visa subsequent to the filing of the amended complaint). Because these names come from defendants' records, and because plaintiffs' pleadings are neither clear nor up-to-date, the Court will rely on defendants' exhibits for the purpose of identifying individual plaintiffs with respect to these motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    This list includes the individuals named on Updated Appendix C attached to defendants' reply memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss. As explained above, because this list is based on defendants' official records and because plaintiffs' pleadings are less than clear as to who the individual plaintiffs are, the Court adopts updated Exhibit C as representative of the plaintiffs who have been issued an immigrant visa. To the extent any other plaintiffs have received an immigrant visa since defendants filed their reply in support of the motion to dismiss, this outcome applies to those plaintiffs as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    Although the Court could have addressed this merits issue in disposing of plaintiffs' motion for class certification,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wal-Mart\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     564 U.S. at 351\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , this presents a separate reason why class certification must be denied. Most of the individuals who plaintiffs sought to have serve as class representatives (which was each named plaintiff) would not have met the typicality or adequacy factors articulated in Rules 23(a)(3)-(4). These plaintiffs are clearly subject to unique claims and defenses, namely mootness, and, as a result, they would not have had an incentive to vigorously adjudicate the rights of those plaintiffs who have not received or were refused a visa, because they have already received the maximum amount of the primary form of relief sought in the amended complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    Plaintiffs did not explicitly allege that an approval notice constitutes an issued visa under Section 6(c) of the Proclamation. But under a literal reading of the grandfather clause, only visas which were\n    <em>\n     issued\n    </em>\n    before the effective date cannot be revoked under the Proclamation. It says nothing about revoking \"approved\" visas. Consistent with its obligation to construe the facts in the amended complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, however, the Court construes plaintiffs' allegations of \"approval\" as allegations of issued visas.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    The Second Circuit has intimated that the doctrine of consular nonreviewability does not mean that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction in the traditional sense. Rather, it has explained that \"the generally available federal question jurisdiction provided by section 1331 to adjudicate [federal] claims is withdrawn where the claim is based on a consular officer's denial of a visa, or that prudential considerations, perhaps arising from separation of powers concerns, counsel against exercising normally available jurisdiction.\"\n    <em>\n     Am.

This outcome also applies to any individual plaintiff whose visa has been refused on substantive grounds of inadmissibility since the filing of defendants' reply memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Nor can plaintiffs successfully argue that the Government is estopped from refusing their immigrant visas because plaintiffs were issued notices that erroneously informed them that their visas had been approved. Although the Supreme Court has not held that an estoppel claim could never succeed against the Government, the Supreme Court has recognized - because the Government is differently situated than a private litigant - that it has \"reversed every finding of estoppel [against the Government] that [it has] reviewed,\" and that it would \"know an estoppel when [it] see[s] one.\"\n    <em>\n     Office of Pers.

Although the argument and briefing schedule in that case has been suspended pending further order of the Court on the respondents' motion to dismiss as improvidently granted, the merits of the petition bring into question the underlying rationale of plaintiffs' claims - that the officials' motivations can be relevant to an otherwise objective record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    It is not clear that plaintiffs are entitled to a standard equal protection analysis in this realm.
