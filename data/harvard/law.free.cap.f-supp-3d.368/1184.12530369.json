Nor does it decide the legal merits of Plaintiffs' key claims. Instead, as with many rulings on motions to dismiss, this order merely clears away portions of the case that do not belong. As explained below, this Court grants in part, and denies in part, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. [48]. Specifically, Count VI is dismissed with prejudice as to Plaintiff Adelman, and without prejudice as to Plaintiffs Parks, Valencia, and Jurevis (subject to reassertion should their First Amendment claims ever become ripe). Plaintiffs' aesthetic and environmental harm theory, to the extent it is included in Count I, also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As to the remaining counts and legal theories, this Court makes no comment on the likelihood of success or failure, but this Court assures all involved that it will address what is left of the matter upon the dispositive motions to be filed at the close of discovery. If dispositive motions are granted in full, the case will end; and if they are denied, the parties will receive a short trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case remains set for a case management conference on February 27, 2019, at 10:30 a.m., in Courtroom 1203. At that hearing, this Court will rule on any discovery disputes, set a 45-day close of fact discovery, and calendar a firm six-week schedule for the final briefing and resolving of dispositive motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Complaint's Allegations\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This dispute arises out of the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District's efforts to bring the Obama Presidential Center (OPC) to the City's South Side.

(Parks) is a nonprofit park advocacy organization dedicated to preserving, protecting, and improving Chicago's parks and forest preserves. [91] \u00b6 18.

Defendant City of Chicago (City) is a body politic and municipal corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1869, the Illinois General Assembly passed \"An Act to Provide for the Location and Maintenance of a Park for the Towns of South Chicago, Hyde Park and Lake.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The statute provided for the formation of a board of public park commissioners to be known as the \"South Park Commissioners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Act authorized these commissioners to select certain lands, which, when acquired by said Commissioners \"shall be held, managed and controlled by them and their successors, as a public park, for the recreation, health and benefit of the public, and free to all persons forever.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to this authority, the commissioners acquired the land now known as Jackson Park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Illinois Legislature enacted the Park District Consolidation Act in 1934, which consolidated the existing park districts, including the South Park District, into the Chicago Park District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; 70 ILCS 1505/1. The Park District therefore holds Jackson Park in the public trust.

[49-2] at 77196; [49-8] (\"Report to the Planning Commission\") at 2. In addition to the various structures that will comprise the OPC, the site will include new parkland created by vacating portions of streets adjacent to existing parkland. [49-2] at 77195, 77198; [91-4] (\"Part Two: Character of the Proposal, VI. Narrative\") at 3. In total, the site will comprise 19.3 acres. [91] \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2015, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel introduced an ordinance authorizing the transfer of the relevant land in Jackson Park to the City for use by the Obama Foundation (Foundation) to build and operate the OPC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111; [91-2]. The Chicago Plan Commission and Chicago City Council reviewed the matter, held public hearings, and subsequently approved this inter-governmental land transfer. [91] \u00b6\u00b6 13, 111. As part of its approval, the City Council passed an \"Operating Ordinance\" allowing the City to accept title to the Jackson Park site from the Park District and to enter into agreements governing the Foundation's use of the site. [49-6]. One of the agreements authorized by the Operating Ordinance-the Use Agreement-sets the terms by which the Foundation\n   may use the Jackson Park site for the OPC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Exhibit D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 14, 2018, Plaintiffs brought this action, seeking to enjoin an alleged \"contrived collaboration\" among Defendants to construct the OPC on a specific site within Jackson Park. [91] \u00b6 1. In their six-count complaint, Plaintiffs assert: (1) a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of due process (Count I); (2) an Illinois state law claim for breach of the public trust (Count II); (3) an Illinois state law\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action claim (Count III); (4) an Illinois state law special legislation claim (Count V); and (5) a claim for violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count VI). [1]; [91]. The complaint also seeks declaratory judgment as to the Illinois Museum Act's applicability to the OPC (Count IV).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 21, 2018, Defendants moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; in the alternative, Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [48]. Various parties then filed amicus briefs for and against the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court's standing order regarding motions to dismiss states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   When a motion to dismiss is filed, the non-moving party has a right to amend its pleading once within 21 days.

First, with respect to the alleged annual tax, the Use Agreement between the City and Foundation expressly prohibits the Park District from enacting an annual tax to support the OPC. [49-6] (Exhibit D). The Agreement states that the Foundation \"shall, at its sole cost and expense, design and construct the Project Improvements\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859012\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/139/#p148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1. The City \"shall not be liable or otherwise responsible in any manner ... for any of the Total Construction Costs, [or] any of the Soft Costs ... for any other costs, expenses ... or liabilities arising out of the planning, design, construction, furnishing, or operation of the Project Improvements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859012\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/139/#p148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2. Moreover, the Foundation shall, at all times during its 99-year term, \"at its sole cost and expense, keep the Subject Property and the Project Improvements ... including all sidewalks, lawns and landscaped areas, parking and loading areas and other public access areas ... in good condition and repair.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859012\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/139/#p148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7.1. Here, Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim presumes that the Park District's Board of Park Commissioners will violate the City's Use Agreement to levy an annual tax supporting the OPC, without any indication that such a violation is planned or contemplated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, with respect to partisan political behavior, the Use Agreement provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The Foundation shall not use or allow the Subject Property to be used for political fundraisers or use or occupy, or authorize the use or occupancy of, the Subject Property or Project Improvements, in whole or in part, in a manner that would be inconsistent with the Foundation's status as a tax exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859012\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/139/#p148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.3(d). And the Foundation's tax-exempt status means that it cannot \"participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). Therefore, Plaintiffs ask this Court to find that President Obama, through the Foundation and the OPC, will, at some undefined time and in an undefined manner, disregard both the Use Agreement and applicable tax law by engaging in partisan political activities at the OPC. This Court declines Plaintiffs' invitation to predict the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Disputes \"must have ripened into a legal case before a federal court can act; the case must not lie merely in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Both the annual tax and any partisan political behavior on behalf of the OPC are purely speculative, future events. And dismissing Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim against Defendants will not prejudice Plaintiffs. If, at some point in the future, the Park District's Board of Commissioners levies an annual municipal tax to support the OPC's operations, and the OPC violates both federal law and the Use Agreement by engaging in partisan political activity, Plaintiffs will have a ripe claim and thus suffer no hardship. Acting on Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim now, on the other hand, will force Defendants \"to incur the time and costs of litigating a\n   dispute that there is no reason to believe will arise.\"\n   <em>\n    Ratajczak v.
