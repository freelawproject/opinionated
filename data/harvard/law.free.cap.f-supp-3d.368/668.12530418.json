The Administrative Law Judge Did Not Fully Develop The Record.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Social Security Administration denied Plaintiff's application for Social Security Benefits on June 11, 2014, after which Plaintiff requested a hearing before an ALJ. (Report at 2.) ALJ Kieran McCormack's April 6, 2016 decision found that, despite Plaintiff's physical impairments, \"she had the residual functional capacity ('RFC') to perform light work, including her past work as a housekeeper[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, because ALJ McCormack determined that Plaintiff had the capacity to perform\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   work, he determined that she was not disabled under the SSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11323243\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/34/#p39\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) However, because ALJ McCormack failed to completely develop the record, Magistrate Judge Freeman correctly determined that he made \"errors of law that might have affected the outcome of this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) In other words, because the record does not arm this Court with enough facts to make a functional assessment of Plaintiff's physical impairments and disabling symptoms, remand is warranted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11323243\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/34/#p39\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, remand is warranted because ALJ McCormack's finding that Plaintiff could have reprised her work as a housekeeper was premature. As Magistrate Judge Freeman states, the record is devoid of an opinion from a treating physician or examiner as to whether Plaintiff would require \"a significant number of rest breaks, of a significant duration, during a typical work day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39, 53-55.) Magistrate Judge Freeman also accurately found that ALJ McCormack's conclusion that Plaintiff's complaints of her symptoms were not credible \"lacked support in the medical record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) For example, ALJ McCormack first discounted Plaintiff's statements regarding her symptoms because he found that Plaintiff received \"conservative treatment\" but \"did not require hospitalizations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51.) This finding is inconsistent with Plaintiff's medical records, however, which indicate that she was hospitalized in July 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11323243\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/34/#p39\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, remand is also warranted to enable ALJ McCormack to \"correct or clarify his reasons for discounting Plaintiff's statements regarding her nonexertional limitations\" and alleged disabling symptoms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Magistrate Judge Freeman's Report is ADOPTED in full. Plaintiff's motion for remand pursuant to Rule 12(c), (ECF No. 16 ), is GRANTED. Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, (ECF No. 18 ), is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motions, accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    A more complete procedural and factual background is set forth in greater detail in the Report and is incorporated by reference herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Magistrate Judge Freeman also correctly determined that this case should be remanded to determine whether ALJ McCormack's reliance on \"Medical Vocational Guidelines ('Grids')\" was appropriate because the Grids may not have been an adequate assessment of Plaintiff's ability to work.
