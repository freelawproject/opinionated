(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.) The action was referred to Magistrate Judge Debra C. Freeman for general pretrial management and reports and recommendations on dispositive motions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7.) The BOP and Mitchell move to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 36.) Before this Court is Magistrate Judge Freeman's December 14, 2018 Report and Recommendation, (the \"Report\"), recommending that this Court grant the BOP and Mitchell's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims, Rehabilitation Act claim, and FTCA claim concerning his receipt of inadequate medical treatment for his facial injury. (Report at 34-35.) Magistrate Judge Freeman finds that Plaintiff has stated viable FTCA claims concerning: (1) placement on a methadone detoxification program; (2) improper prescription of Clonidine ; (3) receipt of another inmate's medication; and (4) Mitchell's order that Plaintiff stand despite a risk that he would fall. However, Magistrate Judge Freeman recommends that this Court dismiss the viable FTCA claims as to Mitchell and substitute the United States for the BOP, because the United States is the only proper defendant on such claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In her Report, Magistrate Judge Freeman informed the parties that failure to file timely objections to the Report would\n   constitute a waiver of those objections on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) The Objectors filed timely objections. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objs., ECF No. 47.) The objections are OVERRULED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The BOP and Mitchell's motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims and Rehabilitation Act claim against the BOP and Mitchell, all of Plaintiff's FTCA claims against Mitchell, and Plaintiff's FTCA claim against the BOP concerning Plaintiff's receipt of inadequate medical treatment for his facial injury. The motion to dismiss is DENIED as to Plaintiff's FTCA claims against the BOP concerning: (1) placement on a methadone detoxification program; (2) improper prescription of Clonidine ; (3) receipt of another inmate's medication; and (4) Mitchell's order that Plaintiff stand despite a risk that he would fall.

(Report at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Magistrate Judge Freeman construes the amended complaint to allege FTCA claims concerning: (1) Plaintiff's placement on a detoxification program; (2) Plaintiff's receipt of improperly prescribed medication; (3) Plaintiff's receipt of another inmate's medication; (4) Mitchell's order that Plaintiff stand despite his known risk of falling; and (5) Plaintiff's receipt of inadequate medical treatment for his facial injury.

Detoxification Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Magistrate Judge Freeman construes the amended complaint to allege a medical malpractice claim based on Plaintiff's \"placement by BOP medical personnel on a detoxication program that... deviated from acceptable medical practice.\" (Report at 23.) The Objectors argue that the amended complaint does not \"suggest that [Plaintiff] is asserting a claim based on his withdrawal symptoms independent of [his] fall.\" (Objs. at 8.) However, Plaintiff's amended complaint draws a clear factual distinction between Plaintiff's withdrawal symptoms and the symptoms he experienced after taking medication that allegedly caused his fall. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 11 (noting that Plaintiff's withdrawal symptoms \"consisted of nausea and vomiting, cold sweats, inability to sleep, generalized\n   pain, and weakness\" but not \"dizziness or lightheadedness\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    \u00b6 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that prior to taking the medication, Plaintiff \"was still experiencing symptoms of withdrawal,\" but \"was able to stand and was not dizzy\" and \"not sleepy\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Objectors' contention that Plaintiff's amended complaint does not suggest \"that he is seeking damages for [his withdrawal] symptoms\" is also without merit. (Objs. at 8.) Plaintiff alleges that \"Warden Maureen P. Baird sent [Plaintiff] a letter asking [him] if [he] wanted methadone\" for his withdrawal symptoms and that Plaintiff \"requested $ 20,000 in money damages\" instead. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) It is reasonable to infer from these allegations that Plaintiff is seeking damages for his withdrawal symptoms separate from those he is seeking for the injuries caused by his fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Objectors also argue that Plaintiff's claim based on the detoxification program should be dismissed because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Objs. at 9.) The Objectors contend that BOP only has records of a single administrative tort claim filed with the Northeast Regional office, and that the claim does not mention the detoxification program. (Objs. at 9 (citing Decl. of Joy Aassiddaa dated Mar. 1, 2019, Ex. 1, ECF No. 47-2, at 1).) However, Plaintiff alleges that he \"fill[ed] out numerous forms with the counselor's office including among others the BP-8 ... and the BP-10\" in addition to \"BP-9's filed at MCC and [the BOP's] Northeast [R]egional [office].\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 42.) For purposes of this motion, these allegations must be taken as true. Moreover, Plaintiff also alleges that \"Warden Maureen P. Baird sent [Plaintiff] a letter asking [Plaintiff] if [he] wanted methadone.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 43.) While it is unclear what prompted Baird's letter, it is reasonable to infer that the letter was in response to some type of administrative complaint from Plaintiff regarding the detoxification program. Thus, the Objectors' contention that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies does not provide a basis to dismiss Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Objectors further argue that even if the amended complaint is read to state a claim based on the detoxification program and Plaintiff has satisfied the exhaustion requirement, Plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim for relief. (Objs. at 10.) The Objectors contend that Plaintiff's allegation that the \"decision [to place him on the detoxification program] and ensuing treatment was [sic] made pursuant to established procedures, policy, and practice of the [BOP]\" is \"directly contradict[ed]\" by his allegation that his methadone dosage was decreased more rapidly than BOP guidelines provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9) ) But even if this Court disregards Plaintiff's allegations as to whether his treatment was in accordance with BOP policy, Plaintiff states a claim for medical malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that the detoxification program \"deviated from the treatment schedule that medical personnel at Albert Einstein had deemed appropriate\" prior to his arrest, and that the treatment he received at Albert Einstein was \"pursuant to appropriate medical practices.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff also alleges that this deviation from accepted medical practice caused him\n   injury in the form of the withdrawal symptoms described above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Improperly Prescribed Medication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Magistrate Judge Freeman construes the amended complaint to assert a claim that Dr. Bussanich, an MCC employee, committed medical malpractice by prescribing Clonidine to Plaintiff. (Report at 26.) The Objectors argue that the amended complaint should not be read to assert such a claim because \"the taking of Clonidine is not one of the three alternative reasons Plaintiff offers for his fall.\" (Objs. at 11 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6 41).) However, the paragraph of the amended complaint that the Objectors cite concerns Plaintiff's allegation that he was \"given medication belonging to another inmate.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 41.) As discussed above, Plaintiff also alleges, in the alternative, that he was given Clonidine that Dr. Bussanich prescribed for him without his knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    \u00b6 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiff further alleges that \"[d]izziness is a known side effect of Clonidine,\" and that he \"felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded\" when he awoke from a nap after Mitchell gave him a medication he did not recognize. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 24, 28.) Plaintiff also alleges that he \"never experienced dizziness while taking Buspirone by itself\" and \"did not experience dizziness or lightheadedness again while incarcerated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) These allegations support an inference that Mitchell gave Plaintiff Clonidine, which caused Plaintiff to experience the dizziness and lightheadedness that resulted in his fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Objectors argue that even if Plaintiff alleges that Clonidine caused his fall, Plaintiff does not allege that Dr. Bussanich committed malpractice, because \"the mere fact that a medication has side effects does not render its prescription malpractice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Objs. at 12 (citation omitted).) However, Plaintiff does not allege that prescribing Clonidine was malpractice solely because of its side effect of dizziness, but also because \"Buspirone is known to have a risk of interaction with Clonidine.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 19.) The Objectors note that \"Plaintiff does not specify what symptoms the interaction of Buspirone and Clonidine may have\" and assert that Plaintiff does not \"plausibly allege that any such symptoms caused his fall.\" (Objs. at 12.) However, as explained in the Report, Plaintiff's allegations support an inference that Buspirone interacted with Clonidine to cause or worsen the dizziness and lightheadedness that resulted in his fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Objectors also contend that even if Dr. Bussanich's prescription of Clonidine was malpractice, \"Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that it was foreseeable that prescribing Plaintiff Clonidine... would cause him to fall and sustain a laceration near his eye.\" (Objs. at 13.) However, the facts in the amended complaint support an inference that the Objectors knew or should have known that prescribing Clonidine in combination with Buspirone risked causing Plaintiff to become dizzy or lightheaded, and it is reasonably foreseeable that a person experiencing such symptoms could fall and become injured. Plaintiff therefore plausibly alleges that the prescription of Clonidine was medical malpractice that proximately caused his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Receipt of Another Inmate's Medication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As discussed in the Report, Plaintiff appears to be uncertain as to whether the new medication he was given was Clonidine. (Report at 3 &amp; n.1, 27.) Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Freeman construes the amended complaint to allege, in the alternative, that Plaintiff was negligently given another inmate's medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) The Objectors argue that Plaintiff fails to state a negligence claim because he \"alleges no basis for concluding that he was erroneously given another inmate's medication, or that the other inmate's medication would have caused him to fall.\" (Objs. at 13-14.) This aspect of the Report need only be reviewed for clear error, because the Objectors made these arguments to Magistrate Judge Freeman. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 27-28.) But even on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, Defendants' arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to BOP policy, Mitchell gave him a medication without asking for his name or identification number. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Plaintiff also alleges that he did not recognize the medication, and that Mitchell did not inform him what the name of the medication was or what it was intended to treat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) These allegations support an inference that Mitchell negligently gave Plaintiff another inmate's medication. Plaintiff also alleges that the medication made him drowsy and he fell asleep approximately fifteen minutes later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff further alleges that, upon awakening, he felt \"extremely dizzy and lightheaded,\" and when he tried to stand, he fell forward and struck his face against a sink. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28.) Thus, the amended complaint plausibly alleges Mitchell breached her duty of care to Plaintiff by giving him another inmate's medication and that Plaintiff sustained injuries as a result of the breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Mitchell's Order That Plaintiff Stand Despite a Risk of Falling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Magistrate Judge Freeman construes the amended complaint to allege a claim that Mitchell acted negligently by ordering Plaintiff to stand, ignoring his statements that he felt dizzy and lightheaded and that standing would be dangerous for him. (Report at 29.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff's allegation that \"[his] medical records indicat[ed] that he was dizzy\" is contracted by his allegations that his withdrawal symptoms did not include dizziness and that the statement in his medical records indicating that he had reported dizziness was wrong. (Objs. at 14 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 24-26).) However, Plaintiff alleges that his dizziness was a result of the medication he received, not withdrawal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) The Objectors also argue that Plaintiff \"alleges no facts to suggest... Buspirone and Clonidine... would make it difficult to stand.\" (Objs. at 14.) But, as explained above, Plaintiff alleges that \"[d]izziness is a known side effect of Clonidine\" and that \"Buspirone is known to have a risk of interaction with Clonidine.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Moreover, even if this Court disregards Plaintiff's allegations regarding his medical records and the side effects of the medications, Plaintiff also alleges that he \"told Mitchell that [he] did not think he could stand up\" and \"told her [his] symptoms to indicate that standing was dangerous for him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Thus, Plaintiff alleges that Mitchell was aware of a risk that standing without assistance could cause Plaintiff injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Receipt of Inadequate Medical Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Magistrate Judge Freeman correctly found that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for medical malpractice arising out of the medical treatment he received for the facial injury he sustained from his fall. (Report at 30.) As the Report states, Plaintiff pleads no allegations that would support an inference that the treatment he received was below the applicable standard of care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Magistrate Judge Freeman correctly found that Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim fails. (Report at 32-34.) As discussed in the Report, \"the Rehabilitation Act 'prohibits discrimination against a handicapped individual only where the individual's handicap is\n   <em>\n    unrelated\n   </em>\n   to, and thus improper to consideration of, the services in question.' \" (Report at 33 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Plaintiff claims that his disability is his drug addiction, which is\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   related to the services-i.e., adequate methadone treatment-that he claims that he was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The motion to dismiss is DENIED as to Plaintiff's FTCA claims against the BOP concerning: (1) placement on a methadone detoxification program; (2) improper prescription of Clonidine ; (3) receipt of another inmate's medication; and (4) Mitchell's order that Plaintiff stand despite a risk that he would fall.

Nonetheless, because Magistrate Judge Freeman recommends that this Court substitute the United States for the BOP as the proper defendant on Plaintiff's viable FTCA claims, this Court will consider the United States, BOP, and Mitchell's (collectively, the \"Objectors\") objections to the viability of those claims.

Rather, Magistrate Judge Freeman notes that Plaintiff's allegation that Dr. Bussanich prescribed him Clonidine without his knowledge or consent could support his medical malpractice claim.

While the URL Plaintiff provides does not lead to a functioning webpage, the Drugs.com website does have a webpage entitled \"Clonidine Drug Interactions,\" which is the title of the webpage in Plaintiff's citation. That webpage contains a link to a description of interactions between Clonidine and Buspirone, which states that \"CloNIDine and busPIRone [sic] may have additive effects in lowering ... blood pressure\" and that individuals taking both drugs \"may experience headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting and/or changes in pulse or heart rate.\" Interactions Between Your Drugs: Clonidine&lt; &gt; Buspirone, Drugs.com, https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/buspirone-with-clonidine-441-0-704-0.html (last visited March 4, 2019).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The Objectors contend that all of Plaintiff's FTCA claims should be construed as medical malpractice claims, rather than negligence claims, because they \"pertain to the provision of medical treatment.\" (Objs. at 6.)
