Initially, she received 6% of revenue received from government and private insurers, which was later increased to 7.5%. In November 2012, Defendants terminated her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In late 2013, Relator filed this\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action alleging Defendants violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by submitting claims for reimbursement through Medicare. The Complaint (Doc. 1) was unsealed in May 2019. Following this Court's denial of their Motion to Dismiss (Docs. 36, 45), Defendants filed an answer and counterclaims (Doc. 46). Specifically, Defendants filed a claim under the FCA, five claims seeking contribution or indemnification under different theories, and two claims seeking disgorgement of Defendants' payments to Relator. Relator responded with the instant motion (Doc. 51).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) allows motions to dismiss on the ground that a complaint does not state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    Hallinan v.

Public Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court finds Relator's argument that allowing Defendants' counterclaims would be against public policy is sufficiently developed to be reviewed and therefore not waived, contrary to Defendants' argument. While the Court agrees this argument is not particularly well-developed in Relator's memorandum of law, it has been developed beyond the \"perfunctory one-sentence assertions\" Defendants reference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ill. Aug. 11, 2011) (suggesting an argument was undeveloped and therefore waived where it was solely a conclusory statement). Relator's failure to explain how or why each counterclaim seeks to shift the blame does venture perilously close insufficiency, especially with regard to Counts VI and VII which do not on their face seek contribution or indemnification. However, the citation to numerous other cases along with parentheticals discussing their holdings clearly sufficed to allow Defendants to meaningfully respond and is enough for this Court to review the merits of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This public policy argument covers well-trod ground; the first instance of counterclaims being barred in an FCA case was in 1947.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Second, counterclaims are allowed \"where the defendant's claim, though bound up in the facts of the FCA case, can only prevail if the defendant is found\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   liable in the FCA case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649256\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/505/20/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649256\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/505/20/#p25\">\n    at 27-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing as examples defamation, libel, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process). \"The simple rule that emerges from these cases is therefore that a claim by an FCA defendant which requires for its success a finding that the FCA defendant is liable is the kind of claim barred by the FCA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649256\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/505/20/#p25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants contest the general rule as \"unmoored from principled application,\" suggesting a parade of mere unthinking applications of precedent devoid of thoughtful development throughout the cases resulted in the consensus of the other federal courts. (Doc. 56 at 17). This argument is necessary because Defendants concede Counts II through V do not survive the application of this test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Foremost among this Court's responses is that judges are not unthinking automatons reflexively adopting statements made in other cases and applying nonbinding precedent\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   without considering whether it ought to be applied. The reason for this consensus on public policy is that it is persuasive. Well-written and well-reasoned opinions are convincing to other courts. There is no need to reinvent the wheel-indeed, our legal system is premised on doing precisely the opposite. So, when a judge finds all that need be said has already been said eloquently by another court, it is both natural and an efficient use of judicial resources to quote and paraphrase the other court, with gratitude. \"Any decision may have persuasive force, and invite-indeed compel-the careful and respectful attention of a court confronted with a similar case. But unless the earlier decision is authoritative, the court that decides the later case does not discharge its judicial responsibilities by merely citing the earlier decision and following it without so much as indicating agreement with it, let alone analyzing its merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Colby v.

The Court is disinclined to believe every federal court to have considered the issue over the last seventy years has abdicated its judicial responsibilities. That the cases applying this policy cite to one another does not show lack of thoughtful development as Defendants suggest-it shows agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The public policy is far from untethered.

In order to ensure fraudulent schemes are uncovered, Congress created the private suit provision of the FCA to incentivize those with knowledge of fraud to come forward.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Joseph v. Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197204,3514684\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/642/1373/\">\n    642 F.2d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1376-77 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\"To encourage actions against defrauders, Congress authorized private citizens to bring civil actions against wrongdoers on the Government's behalf, and to retain half of any recovery.\"). This provision is not designed only\n   to encourage innocent parties who happen upon fraud to report; it also serves to drive a wedge between conspiring fraudsters and entice persons involved to turn upon a fraudulent scheme.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649256\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/505/20/#p25\">\n    505 F.Supp.2d at 25-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, a careful reading of the statute shows it contemplates almost the precise situation Defendants allege is occurring here.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) (\"[I]f the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation ... the court may ... reduce the share of proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive ....\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 56 at 16 (\"[I]t is another [thing] when that policy is simply applied mechanically to protect a purported whistleblower who was actually\n   <em>\n    in charge\n   </em>\n   of the purported wrongdoing ....\") ). Congress has adjusted the incentives as it thinks fair here; courts, recognizing that, have sought to preserve the congressionally-sanctioned balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, any crack in this wall could result in the whole edifice crumbling. If the rule were not a bright line but instead allowed contribution or indemnity in some cases, an unscrupulous party would need only plead their counterclaim to match prior cases in which such counterclaims had been allowed in order to retaliate against an informer. And the burdens between the motion-to-dismiss phase, where the Court must accept potentially false statements as true, and the summary-judgment phase, when it need no longer do so, might suffice to deter persons with information about fraud on the government from reporting. Therefore, even if it would make sense to allow counterclaims for contribution and indemnification in this case, the next FCA defendant might simply-and falsely-claim their case is indistinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court finds the consensus of federal cases persuasive and holds counterclaims in an FCA case seeking contribution or indemnification, or the effective equivalent thereof, may not be brought for reasons of public policy. Because Defendants concede such a holding bars Counts II through V of their Countercomplaint, Counts II-V are dismissed. Amendment would be futile because these counts amount solely to claims for contribution or indemnity, so they are dismissed with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Runnion ex rel.

(Doc. 46 at 26-27). As currently presented in the Countercomplaint, Count I argues \"if false claims were in fact submitted to the United States, then it was\" Relator who did so, and Relator's own allegations suffice to show her liability. (Doc. 46 at 26-27). Defendants are inconsistent on whether this claim requires them to be held liable (Doc. 56 at 2 (\"Counts I-V are all claims that seek to hold [Relator] liable to the Government and/or [Defendants]\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   [Defendants are] liable to the Government\") ) or requires them to be found not liable (Doc. 56 at 17 (\"If there was a scheme to defraud, it was a scheme of [Relator's] own making which she did not share with [Defendants].\") ). As discussed above, this is the very question on which the permissibility of a counterclaim turns. Because Count I suffers from other fatal defects warranting dismissal with prejudice, discussed in Section II,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Court need not determine whether it also depends on a finding of liability and therefore warrants dismissal as contrary to public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Counts VI and VII seek to disgorge payments to Relator, alleging she\n   either failed to perform her contractual duties by not ensuring compliance with Medicare billing regulations (Count VI) or, in the alternative, it would be unjust enrichment for her to keep the payments despite the lack of a contract because she failed to earn any compensation by not ensuring compliance (Count VII). These counts fall into a grey area. They are not factually independent of the FCA action because they require, at a minimum, that Relator submitted false or fraudulent claims for physical therapy performed by Defendants to the United States for reimbursement. (Docs. 46 at 30-31; 56 at 6). A jury could find Relator submitted false claims, thus breaching her contract (or being unjustly enriched), but could nonetheless find Defendants did not know of the false submissions, making them not liable under the FCA. Therefore, Counts VI and VII do not require Defendants be found either liable or not liable to succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court finds the Ninth Circuit's analysis of this issue persuasive.

(Doc. 52 at 3). Defendants contend they are not bringing an original action but rather bringing Relator in as an additional defendant to her existing claim. (Doc. 56 at 18). They also claim this argument is underdeveloped (Doc. 56 at 18), but the Court does not agree. Relator has sufficiently argued that Defendants are barred from filing an FCA claim by the statutory limitations on filing a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   FCA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court agrees Defendants cannot maintain Count I. The provisions of the FCA dealing with\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suits make clear the ability of anyone other than the\n   Attorney General to file FCA suits is strictly circumscribed. And the instant claim must be dismissed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A), which states: \"The court shall dismiss an action\n   <em>\n    or claim\n   </em>\n   under this section, unless opposed by the Government, if substantially the same allegations or transactions in the action or claim were publicly disclosed in a Federal criminal, civil, or administrative hearing ...

But the analysis is mercifully simple in this case. To be \"based upon\" publicly disclosed information, the allegations in a claim need only be \"substantially similar\" to it. \"Under current law, a relator must present genuinely new and material information beyond what has been publicly disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516234\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/798/#p803\">\n    884 F.3d at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Defendants' counterclaim is explicitly and solely based upon the allegations in Relator's Complaint; it presents no new information. (Doc. 46 at 27 (\"By Morgan's own allegations, she is a person who knowingly presented or caused to be presented for payment false records and statements, which she made in order to get a false or fraudulent claim paid by the government.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants do not argue they are \"original sources\" in the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B), with good reason. An original source is one who either \"voluntarily disclosed to the Government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based\" before public disclosure or who had knowledge which \"is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed transactions\" and voluntarily provides such information to the government before filing. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(B). Ordinarily, it would be reasonable to infer under the circumstances that Defendants had direct knowledge independent of Relator's claims. But, Defendants allege they\n   \"learned for the very first time of ... misconduct allegedly occurring while [Relator] was [Defendants'] billing manager\" on May 10, 2018, when Relator's Complaint was unsealed. (Doc. 56 at 14). Therefore, there is no need for a detailed inquiry here as Defendants admit their knowledge is solely from Relator's allegations. The Court thus concludes Count I is prohibited by the public disclosure bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants nevertheless claim \"[t]he Federal Rules (particularly Rules 19 ... and 13 ...)\" allow them to add Relator as a counterclaim defendant and therefore \"the FCA does not need to be tracked in all its particulars to add her as a party\n   <em>\n    to the United States' claim.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 56 at 18 (emphasis in original) ). The Court will not scour all of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to determine why Defendants think Rules 13 and 19 are \"particularly\" as opposed to exclusively sufficient here. At any rate, Rules 13 and 19 do not help Defendants, and Defendants fail to explain why they believe otherwise. Rule 13 generally covers counterclaims but does not give parties any special ability to bring claims they would otherwise be barred from bringing. Nor does Rule 19 on its face contemplate the sort of realigning Defendants suggest. Perhaps Defendants are hinting that something in the interaction of these Rules or the ample caselaw which have developed around them would shield Defendants' counterclaim from dismissal; but Defendants have done what they repeatedly accuse Relator of and presented the Court with an underdeveloped argument incapable of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To the extent Defendants attempt seek to slip free of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) by arguing they are not bringing a new claim but rather participating in the United States' claim, their ability to proceed is foreclosed by \u00a7 3730(b)(5), which provides: \"When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.\" An attempt by a defendant to intervene as a relator and turn the tables on the original relator is clearly blocked under this provision. If this is what Defendants meant by an attempt to add Relator to the Government's claim, and the Court does not see what other meaning Defendants could have had, their claim is barred for this reason as well. The Court thus dismisses Defendants' FCA claim, Count I of the Countercomplaint, with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

They also claim Relator's argument is underdeveloped to the point of waiver because she does not discuss the accrual date. (Doc. 56 at 14). The Court does not agree the argument is underdeveloped because, as will be discussed, it approaches the question in the ordinary situation rather than where the discovery rule applies. However, the discovery rule does apply here so the statute of limitations does not bar Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"For contract actions ... the cause of action ordinarily accrues at the time of the breach of contract, not when a party sustains damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Hermitage Corp. v.

They ask for disgorgement of \"all payments made to [Relator] in the [t]ime [p]eriod\" even though the contract was allegedly for ensuring compliance \"with respect to billing both private insurers and the United States government for physical therapy services\" and the alleged breach the submission of false claims to the United States. (Doc. 46 at 25, 28, 31). But the Court does not think this issue can be addressed at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Relator's fifth argument, that a breach of contract claim alone cannot serve as the basis for disgorgement, is appropriate to discuss here as well. This argument is severely underdeveloped-Relator solely states she has not found Illinois authority to support such a proposition, provides a\n   one-sentence policy argument, and concludes by suggesting this Court ought not \"be the first to adopt such precedent.\" (Doc. 52 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Illinois Bell Telephone Link-Up II\n   </em>\n   indicates, an amount of damages effectively disgorging money paid to a breaching party may be an appropriate remedy for a breach of contract. This Court would not be the first to adopt such a theory. Moreover, Relator's policy concerns are addressed by the causation limitations. Relator claims if a party \"can recover all of the monies that they paid out to [the] party that insufficiently performed,\" then \"independent contractors, contracting parties, and even employees will always be at risk of forfeiting whatever monies had been historically provided to them.\" (Doc. 52 at 10). But as discussed above, a party is not able to disgorge\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the benefit received by the breaching party. Rather, disgorgement may be appropriate only where the \"damages [are] proximately caused by the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ill. Bell Tel. Link-Up II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=373%20Ill.%20Dec.%20784\">\n    373 Ill.Dec. 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n    994 N.E.2d at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the breaching party would only be required to return money paid for services not rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This makes sense because \"[t]he proper measure of damages for breach of a contract is the amount of money necessary to place the plaintiff in a position as if the contract had been performed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=373%20Ill.%20Dec.%20784\">\n    373 Ill.Dec. 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n    994 N.E.2d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, to the extent a party pays another party to perform a service which is not performed, that payment should be recoverable even if no other damages are legally recoverable. But it does not place all employees in a position where all earnings are subject to potential disgorgement; if an employee (or contractor) is paid for ten hours of work but works nine, only the pay for the tenth hour may be disgorged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    C. Disgorgement Would Not Necessarily Result in a Windfall to Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Relator's argument that awarding disgorgement to Defendants would result in a windfall rather than curing harm fails for similar reasons to her arguments on disgorgement as a remedy for breach of contract. Disgorgement would allow Defendants to recover only money paid to Relator for services she did not provide, as discussed above. It would not be a windfall for them to receive such disgorgement since the remedy would essentially allow Defendants to rescind their performance of the portion of the contract Relator did not perform. Again, disgorgement would only ensure Defendant could recover amounts paid for services not actually rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    D. The Remedy of Disgorgement Does Not Require a Fiduciary Duty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Relator argues \"it appears that, under Illinois law, for disgorgement to be appropriate there must first exist an underlying fiduciary relationship between the parties.\" (Doc. 52 at 10).

(Doc. 52 at 10). Both deal with the doctrine of forfeiture under claims for breach of fiduciary duty-and it is\n   hardly surprising that claims for breach of fiduciary duty require as an element the existence of a fiduciary duty. But forfeiture in those cases allows a complete loss of a salary even if it would more than compensate the plaintiff, differing in a crucial respect from the award sought here.\n   <em>\n    Levy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20Ill.%20Dec.%20599\">\n    205 Ill.Dec. 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=643%20N.E.2d%201206\">\n    643 N.E.2d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Court has held, for a breach of contract claim, the only damages available are those proximately caused by the breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At any rate, Relator has not set out an argument that disgorgement is inappropriate absent a fiduciary duty under Illinois law, only that forfeiture is appropriate for a claim of breach of fiduciary duty. And,\n   <em>\n    In re Illinois Bell Telephone Link-Up II\n   </em>\n   suggests that disgorgement may be appropriate where no fiduciary duty exits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=373%20Ill.%20Dec.%20784\">\n    373 Ill.Dec. 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n    994 N.E.2d at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unjust Enrichment - Count VII\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Relator next argues Defendants' unjust enrichment claim, Count VII, fails due to the statute of limitations and because unjust enrichment requires the defendant to have failed to pay for service rendered, rather than the defendant to have failed to perform services paid for. The statute of limitations argument fails for the reason discussed above, namely, the application of the discovery rule. Section III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Relator's argument about the substantive law of unjust enrichment is similarly devoid of merit. As the Seventh Circuit has explained, under Illinois law \"[u]njust enrichment is a common-law theory of recovery or restitution that arises when the defendant is retaining a benefit to the plaintiff's detriment, and this retention is unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    Cleary v.

P. 11(b)(2), with supporting authorities provided in filings, CDIL-LR 7.1(B)(1-2), and pleadings will comply with the Local and Federal Rules. This Court will not countenance the so-called \"spaghetti approach\" to litigation whereby the parties \"heave[ ] the entire contents of a pot against the wall in hopes that something [will] stick\"\n   <em>\n    Indep.

Moreover, the Court will not attempt to grapple with every hint of an argument no matter how poorly developed: as the Seventh Circuit has now repeatedly explained, \"[j]udges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The parties should cite applicable precedent when making their points. Points of law should be adequately researched, rather than merely finding a single statement which could be offered in support; it should also be clear that counsel ought to read, at the very least, the entirety of the paragraph containing the phrase they cite. Arguments that begin \"it appears\" should be followed with a thorough explanation of the law or facts, why the law is not yet settled or the facts unclear, and why the party's preferred approach should be adopted. Disagreement with persuasive authority cited by the opposing party should fully engage with the reasoning of that authority. And responses cannot survive solely on pointing to a prior pleading if the opposing side has cited cases, but at a minimum should explain why the cited cases do not apply or the why a pleading satisfies the standard in those cases. The reason for this-the reason the Court raises this issue at all-is every issue with the local rules and every failure to have an apposite citation slows the pace of litigation in this case and diverts judicial resources from other cases on the docket as the Court attempts to fill the gaps left by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Further frivolous arguments or filings will result in orders to show cause why the filing counsel should not be sanctioned.
