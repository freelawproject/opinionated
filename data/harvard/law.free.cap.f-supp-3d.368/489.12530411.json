Sosa alleges that Berger and the NYCDOE subjected her to discrimination, harassment, and a hostile work environment based on her race, skin color, national origin, and disability while she worked as a special education teacher. This is the second lawsuit that Sosa has brought against the NYCDOE and Berger. The other lawsuit-pending before Judge DeArcy Hall, No. 14-CV-7094-contains allegations that are intertwined with and similar to those made in this case.

(Complaint, Dkt. No. 1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11-12). P4Q is a program that provides educational, vocational, and behavioral support for special needs students.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). During her employment at the NYCDOE, Sosa has been rated as \"highly effective\" and is known by her peers for innovative classroom practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Sosa identifies as an African American woman of West Indian origin, with darker-hued skin color. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) According to Sosa, she is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, NYSHRL, and NYCHRL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). She alleges that she has several disabilities, including breast cancer, carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal injuries, hernia, and anxiety and depression caused largely by discrimination she experienced in her workplace. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33-34). According to Sosa, Defendants concede that her requests for accommodations due to her disability were medically warranted and her disability is not in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sosa is the only African American teacher with a disability in her unit at P.S. 213. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). There are no other teachers of West Indian origin and only one other teacher with darker-hued skin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Berger is the Principal and Head Administrator for P4Q, the program that provides support for special needs students at P.S. 213. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9). Berger has supervisory power over Sosa and the authority to influence Sosa's working conditions and the manner in which other employees interact with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). Berger also has control over teacher scheduling matters for P4Q and P.S. 213. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Current Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Complaint alleges that since 2006, Sosa has experienced discrimination, harassment, and a hostile work environment based on her race, skin color, national origin, and disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). Much of the conduct is identical to the allegations made in her 2014 civil action against Berger and the NYCDOE, which is discussed further below. (\n   <em>\n    See Sosa v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-7094 (\"\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   \"), Complaint, Dkt. No. 1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 20, 38). Her allegations in this case focus on her treatment following her return to work in 2016 and fall into three general categories: (1) Sosa's placement and schedule upon her return to work; (2) the inconsistent application of workplace rules following her return to work; and (3) allegations of professional misconduct following her return to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1. From around 2013 to 2015, Sosa went on approved medical leave to obtain treatment for her disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 36). In April 2016, Sosa notified the NYCDOE that she wanted to return to work for the upcoming year and requested that she be placed in her previous position as a homeroom teacher at P.S. 213. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). She also submitted an accommodation request with doctors' notes that explained\n   her medical need for a \"consistent schedule\" and a \"structured classroom environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; NYCDOE Verified Answer to New York City Commission on Human Rights dated June 27, 2017, attached as Ex. 4 to\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. No. 1 (\"NYCDOE Verified Answer\"), Ex. A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Sosa requested to have a prep during third and eighth period and to have lunch during fifth period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (NYCDOE Verified Answer, Ex. F). However, Defendants initially placed Sosa as a cluster teacher at P4Q@179, another P4Q school, and denied her other requests without explanation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On June 6, 2016, Sosa filed a grievance with Berger as a result of this assignment. Berger then failed to schedule a grievance conference as required by the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) contract, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40), and otherwise \"refused to meaningfully interact\" with Sosa, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). The grievance moved forward without Berger's involvement, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40), and on July 7, 2016, a month after she made the request, the NYCDOE returned Sosa to P.S. 213. (NYCDOE Verified Answer, Ex. J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In late June 2016, Sosa emailed Berger asking to be assigned to her former classroom at P.S. 213, to be given the requested schedule, and to be assigned as a homeroom teacher instead of cluster teacher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 41). Berger referred the request to the NYCDOE Medical Administration (\"HR Connect\"), and Sosa submitted another doctor's note supporting her requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 47). On August 10, 2016, HR Connect issued a letter partially approving Sosa's requests, giving her a third period prep on every day except Thursday, an eighth period prep every day, and lunch during fifth period every day. (NYCDOE Verified Answer, Ex. D at 1). The August 10 letter denied Sosa's request for use of her usual classroom as not reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, Berger had already transferred Sosa to her old classroom at P.S. 213 and HR Connect issued a second letter on August 19, 2016 confirming that Sosa would be able to use that classroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. K). Thus, Defendants ultimately granted Sosa's accommodations for everything except her Thursday schedule, that is, everything except an additional prep period on Thursdays. Sosa asserts that Berger and the NYCDOE regularly granted similar requests by Caucasian, non-African American, non-disabled teachers and could easily have granted her this additional accommodation without undue hardship. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   2. Sosa also alleges Defendants inconsistently and discriminatorily applied workplace rules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). Sosa alleges Defendants instituted new rules solely for the purpose of harassing and abusing her. (Complainant's EEOC Rebuttal to NYCDOE Verified Answer dated Aug. 22, 2017, attached as Ex. 5 to\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. (\"Rebuttal to Verified Answer\") \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27). For example, in February 2017, Defendants began prohibiting teachers from using the\n   restroom during breakfast and lunch, soon after Sosa had spoken to her supervisors about needing to use the restroom more frequently during those times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-25). Similarly, Defendants required teachers to lock their classroom doors in order to prevent theft; this affected Sosa's ability to perform her job because she was one of the only teachers without a printer in her room and she needed to enter other teachers' rooms to use their printers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28, 30). When Sosa attempted to address this issue at a staff meeting on February 13, 2017, she was reprimanded by her supervisors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Sosa also alleges that other teachers were not reprimanded for breaking rules by doing things like leaving their classroom unattended while going to the restroom, using their phones during breakfast or lunch, leaving students unattended, and having hot coffee near students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3. Sosa alleges Defendants falsely accused her of professional misconduct, without cause, in a manner that deprived her of \"dignity, health, livelihood, professional reputation, and ... employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-63). Sosa alleges that Berger accused her \"of being AWOL\" from her job on April 6, 2017 after she became ill at school and left, even though she received the necessary approval to leave early. (Rebuttal to Verified Answer \u00b6 56). Sosa points to several other similar instances involving her work absences and Defendants' improper responses, which she believes to be retaliation for the filing of her EEOC Complaint on January 12, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 41, 46). These resulted in two disciplinary letters in Sosa's file, one made by Defendant Berger dated February 28, 2017 and one made by another supervisor dated March 15, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Sosa makes other miscellaneous allegations that do not fit neatly in these categories but are made in connection with her hostile work environment claim. For example, Sosa alleges that one of her supervisors, Ms. Berman, or her union representative, Ms. Thomas, leaked the details of Sosa's March 28, 2017 grievance meeting, during which Sosa disclosed that she had photographs documenting the inconsistent application of workplace rules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 52). Sosa alleges either Ms. Berman or Ms. Thomas leaked the details of the meeting \"in order to foment staff opposition\" towards her, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52), which caused other teachers to do things like allege Sosa was causing a hostile work environment for them, (Rebuttal to Verified Answer \u00b6 51). In addition, Defendants excluded Sosa from workplace social events, such as a surprise birthday party for another teacher on March 27, 2017, causing Sosa humiliation and sadness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sosa describes all these actions as a pattern of willful conduct by Berger and the NYCDOE amounting to a materially adverse and hostile work environment in an attempt to induce her to quit. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 69-70). Sosa alleges Berger's actions were motivated by \"racial animus against African American persons with dark skin and ... personal disgust for Ms. Sosa's disabilities,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53), and that Berger both engaged in discrimination herself as well as directed others under her supervision to do so, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-25). Sosa further alleges Defendants' conduct was in retaliation for the filing of her complaint in\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    E.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80, 93). Such conduct has impacted Sosa's \"health, livelihood, and working conditions, causing the plaintiff fear, shame, anxiety, hair loss, nausea and insomnia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sosa filed a Verified Complaint with the New York City Commission of Human Rights (\"NYCCHR\"), on behalf of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), against Defendants under\n   the ADA and the Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 8-107(15) on January 12, 2017.

(\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 33).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1). These causes of action are largely the same as those asserted in her 2018 Complaint, except that the 2014 Complaint did not allege disability discrimination in violation of the ADA against Berger or retaliation in violation of the ADA against the NYCDOE. (\n   <em>\n    Compare Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    with Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 122-127).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In her 2014 Complaint, Sosa alleged she qualified as an individual with a disability under the ADA, NYCHRL, NYSHRL, and Rehabilitation Act, as well as an individual with a serious health condition under the FMLA, due to her diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer, carpal tunnel syndrome, and a hernia. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24-25, 29). Her conditions \"substantially limited\" her \"ability to perform certain major life functions,\" and she struggled to eat and walk up the stairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). In 2008 and 2009, Sosa made multiple requests to leave early for chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which would not have interfered with her class time, but her requests were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27). Sosa's other accommodation requests, including a request for the elevator key because she struggled to walk up the stairs and a request to work with less aggressive students, were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   According to Sosa, these denials were part of an ongoing pattern of discrimination against her beginning in 2006 based on race, national origin, skin color, disability, and in retaliation for exercising her rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 29). For example, in 2006, Defendants denied her a promotion and special job training in favor of similarly or less qualified Caucasian employees. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). In 2012, after Sosa returned from medical leave due to a resurgence of breast cancer and a hernia, the Defendants subjected her to other instances of discrimination, including denying her the opportunity to be a member of the school's curriculum team and to present at the school's curriculum workshop in favor of other similarly qualified Caucasian employees, conveying numerous disparaging comments to her, and falsely accusing her of criminal assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   After Sosa complained several times to the NYCDOE's Office of Equal Opportunity,\n   Defendants wrote her up at least two times, threatened to fire her or transfer her to another school, and interfered with her application for benefits related to a work injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32, 35). Defendants' conduct damaged Sosa's reputation and caused her \"severe and lasting embarrassment, humiliation and anguish, and severe emotional and/or physical distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). On September 20, 2018, the District Court issued a Memorandum and Order dismissing several of Sosa's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Memorandum and Order dated Sept. 20, 2018, Dkt. No. 45 (\"\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Sept. Order\") ). Trial is currently scheduled for February 25, 2019. (Minute Entry dated Oct. 9, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Judge DeArcy Hall concluded that with respect to Sosa's discrimination claims under \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1981, Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA, Sosa had failed to make out a prima facie case. Specifically, Sosa had failed to demonstrate that she suffered an adverse employment action. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Sept. Order at 11). With respect to Sosa's failure to accommodate claims, Judge DeArcy Hall concluded that one allegation-Sosa's request that a dangerous student be removed from her classroom-was a speculative, non-actionable event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). However, with respect to Sosa's request that her lunch period be shifted to a later time, summary judgment for Defendants on this ADA claim was inappropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). As to Sosa's hostile work environment claims-based on discriminatory harassment because of Sosa's race, ethnicity, skin color, and national origin-the alleged statements that were the basis of her claims were too sporadic and trivial to be actionable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Finally, with respect to her federal retaliation claims under the ADA, FMLA, Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983, Sosa failed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). The Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Sosa's state law claims except to the extent they overlapped with her ADA claim based on a failure to be given a lunch accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   Sept. Order at 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standards for Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must \"accept as true all of the factual allegations set out in plaintiff's complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Gregory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124596\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/243/687/#p691\">\n    243 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Order to Show Cause dated April 11, 2018, Dkt. No. 12 (\"Order to Show Cause\") ).

(\n   <em>\n    See Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 37). The rest of the misconduct alleged in\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   , such as the allegations of professional misconduct and inconsistent application of workplace rules, occurred after Sosa returned to work for the 2016-2017 school year, namely from January 2017 to May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rebuttal to Verified Answer \u00b6\u00b6 13-65).

She argues that the retaliatory conduct was close in time to the filing of her EEOC Complaint in January 2017. (Sosa Resp. Mem. at 6) (\"The temporal proximity of Defendants' retaliatory conduct to the activities on the docket in the Court's prior action, and to the events in the proceedings between these parties before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are readily ascertainable.\"). The Rebuttal to the Verified Answer filed in connection with the EEOC Complaint does make such an allegation. (Rebuttal to Verified Answer \u00b6 41). The Rebuttal is attached to the Complaint and alleges that\n   following her initiation of the EEOC proceeding on January 12, 2017, Defendant Berger falsely accused her of misconduct on February 27 (namely that she was AWOL on February 17) and also manipulated her attendance records to buttress the false allegation. (Rebuttal \u00b6 40-41). However, the retaliation count in the Complaint narrows the retaliation claim to retaliation on the basis of filing\n   <em>\n    Sosa I\n   </em>\n   , and makes no mention the filing of the EEOC Complaint that preceded this action. (\n   <em>\n    See Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   But even if the Complaint properly relied on the EEOC Complaint as the protected activity leading to retaliation-and resuscitated the allegations from the Rebuttal-the retaliation claim would still fail. Although the events are temporally proximate (the accusation of being AWOL occurs six weeks after the EEOC filing), Sosa did not suffer an adverse employment action when she was accused of being AWOL. The Complaint alleges no negative consequences resulting from the allegation of absenteeism. And the alleged scrutiny attendant to the false allegation is insufficient to constitute an adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

As Defendants argue-(Mot. to Dismiss Mem. at 10-11)-Sosa's Complaint, when read without the incorporated documents, gives the misimpression that none of her requests for accommodation were granted. For example, Sosa refers in her Complaint to the August 10, 2016 HR Connect letter, stating this letter informed her that she was not granted her scheduling requests and that use of her usual classroom \"[could\n   not] be accommodated as reasonable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Sosa II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 48 (quotations omitted) ). The actual letter, attached as an exhibit to Sosa's Complaint, states that her requests were \"partially approved\" and that Sosa was given her requested schedule on all but one day of the week. (NYCDOE Verified Answer, Ex. D). Sosa's Complaint makes no mention at all of the August 19, 2016 HR Connect letter that reaffirmed the partial approval of her request and gave her use of her usual classroom, even though this too was attached to her Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. K). In fact, in Sosa's EEOC filings, she acknowledges that she was only denied her requested schedule one day per week.

Sosa's papers do not point out that she has received basically all of her requested accommodations; they instead invoke the failure of Berger to engage in the collective bargaining process and make allegations that Berger has never been disciplined. (Sosa Resp. Mem. at 14-15). These arguments about the collective bargaining process are far afield and inapposite; she does not tie those allegations to any process required under the ADA. The inquiry at this point-given the concessions evident from the papers attached to the Complaint-is whether denial of a single prep period could plausibly amount to a failure to accommodate. That is, whether there is some basis to infer that without this Thursday prep period, viewed in the light of the other accommodations that were provided, Sosa could not meet the essential functions of her job.\n   <em>\n    Nuchman v.

In the absence of any argument or allegation about the importance of a single prep period or how it would affect Sosa's disability, the Court has no basis to infer that it ever could. \"Because Defendants[ ] did attempt to[, and did,] accommodate Plaintiff, [she] fails to state a plausible failure to accommodate claim under the ADA[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Goonewardena v.

However, Sosa does not allege the request for accommodation is the protected activity against which Defendants retaliated; she alleges Defendants retaliated due to\n    <em>\n     Sosa I\n    </em>\n    . (\n    <em>\n     Sosa II\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 31).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    In her briefs, Sosa does attempt to demonstrate retaliatory animus by pointing to the same facts she alleges in her discrimination, hostile work environment, and disparate treatment claims. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sosa Resp. Mem. at 15-17). However, as discussed above, these claims do not survive the motion to dismiss and thus do not create an inference of discriminatory intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    It may well be that the prosecution of a lawsuit narrows the length of temporal proximity required to infer causation, as the events in the litigation could be closer in time to the alleged retaliatory acts than the mere filing of the lawsuit.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Pediford-Aziz v.

Any hint of such an argument in Sosa's Complaint, (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g., Sosa II\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 31 (\"The legal battles between the parties in Civil Action 07094 have been precursors for many of defendants' retaliatory and discriminatory actions against plaintiff.\") ), does not suffice. The non-specific nature of the allegations is insufficient to connect the ongoing litigation in\n    <em>\n     Sosa I\n    </em>\n    with alleged ongoing retaliation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    Because all of Sosa's \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 claims have been dismissed, the Court need not address Defendants' argument that the NYCDOE cannot be held liable under these statutes on the basis of respondeat superior, pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Monell v.

(Reply to Nov. 13 Order at 2). Defendants then proceed to point out which of Sosa's allegations are untimely, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-4), and why they do not constitute part of the hostile work environment claim that Sosa did timely file, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-6). This misapprehends the administrative exhaustion requirement and the purpose of the Court's inquiry, which was to clarify whether Sosa's EEOC Complaint had adequately notified Defendants of her race, skin color, and national origin discrimination claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    Count 18 alleges violations of both the ADA and NYSHRL.

(\n    <em>\n     Sosa I\n    </em>\n    Sept. Order at 15-16). The Complaint in this case, however, stands on different footing. In this case, the failure to accommodate is based on the 2016 school year;\n    <em>\n     Sosa I\n    </em>\n    is based on the school years from 2011-2014.

Moreover, in this case the only accommodation not provided is a single prep period on one day of the week;\n    <em>\n     Sosa I\n    </em>\n    appears to be predicated on a failure to provide Sosa with her requested lunch schedule every day of the week. (\n    <em>\n     See Sosa I\n    </em>\n    Sept. Order at 7-8). Finally, in\n    <em>\n     Sosa I\n    </em>\n    defendants did not argue that there was no adverse action, but rather that\n    <em>\n     Sosa\n    </em>\n    was not disabled.
