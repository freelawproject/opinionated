(Dkt. 1, 2). On April 1, 2010, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   . (Dkt. 3). In that order, the Court also dismissed Defendants Ontario County and Ontario County Attorney as parties to this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 6, 2010, the County Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 6). On July 27, 2010, the Court added Corporal Messura as a Defendant. (Dkt. 10). Plaintiff moved to amend his complaint on August 3, 2010. (Dkt. 12). On October 6, 2010, Defendants Beilein, Harrison-Ross, and Stewart filed a motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 18). On December 27, 2010, Plaintiff filed another motion to amend his complaint. (Dkt. 27). On July 26, 2011, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Defendants Beilein, Harrison-Ross, Stewart, and the Citizen's Policy and Complaint Review Council, and the Court dismissed these parties with prejudice by Court order. (Dkt. 60, 61). On January 11, 2012, the Court issued an order (Dkt. 62) granting Plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint (Dkt. 27), and dismissing as moot Plaintiff's additional motion to amend (Dkt. 12) as well as the County Defendants' motion to dismiss (Dkt. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 25, 2012, Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint. (Dkt. 64). On March 22, 2012, the Court ordered that Plaintiff's second amended complaint be amended to insert the name of Cynthia L. Muller in place of the Jane Doe nurse. (Dkt. 78). On April 10, 2012, the County Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Dkt. 82). On June 6, 2012, the Court ordered that Defendants Greg Domalski, Bradley Meister, Avis Robinson, Deputy Fitzsimmons, James Amico, and Deputy Ellen Danehy be added as Defendants in place of formerly named John\n   Does. (Dkt. 92). Plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint on July 26, 2012. (Dkt. 96). On August 1, 2012, Defendants Mary Ann McQueeney and Debbie Scarpulla, two nurses employed by Correctional Medical Care, Inc. (\"CMC\"), filed a motion to dismiss the claims against them. (Dkt. 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 2, 2012, the Court granted Plaintiff's request to file a third amended complaint, making Plaintiff's third amended complaint the operative pleading for this matter. (Dkt. 99). The Court also dismissed Defendants McQueeney, Scarpulla, Bye, Showers, Schultz, Wheatley, Burns, Caviccholi, Harris, Knox, Lopez, Chance, Gallina, and Potocki in accordance with Plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of these Defendants. (Dkt. 100). The outstanding motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 82) and motion to dismiss (Dkt. 97) were denied as moot (Dkt. 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 4, 2013, the County Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 119), and the remaining Defendants, Holman and Muller, filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim (Dkt. 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The County Defendants filed a motion to stay discovery on March 7, 2013. (Dkt. 125). The remaining Defendants filed a declaration in support of this motion to stay discovery on March 13, 2013. (Dkt. 127).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 19, 2013, Plaintiff filed his response to Defendants' motions and requested that the County Defendants' motion be converted into a motion for summary judgment and be granted in his favor. (Dkt. 133).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 11, 2013, the Court dismissed Defendant Muller in accordance with Plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of this Defendant. (Dkt. 135).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court granted Defendants' motion to stay discovery (Dkt. 125) on September 19, 2013 (Dkt. 138). On February 13, 2014, the Honorable Charles J. Siragusa, United States District Judge for the Western District of New York, transferred this case to the undersigned. (Dkt. 141). On January 13, 2015, Plaintiff filed a motion for recusal of the undersigned. (Dkt. 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 10, 2015, the Court granted in part and denied in part the January 30, 2013, motion to dismiss (Dkt. 119), granted the February 4, 2013, motion to dismiss (Dkt. 120), denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 133), and denied Plaintiff's motion for recusal (Dkt. 142). (Dkt. 148). The Court also lifted the stay of discovery, and defendants County of Monroe, Brooks, O'Flynn, Cececi, Kloner, Mooney, Kimball, Gatti, Pratt, Inipoli, Preston, T. Peck, Carlo, Messura, Kluth, Luther, Raby, Fitzsimmons, Palma, DiFlores, Jane Doe Nurse, Nurse Mary, Domalski, Meister, Robinson, Holman, Miller, Rizzo, and Thibuat were terminated as parties to the action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties conducted discovery, and the remaining Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment on October 16, 2017. (Dkt. 276). Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 28, 2018 (Dkt. 306), and a response to Defendants' statement of material facts on April 11, 2018 (Dkt. 314). Defendants filed their response to Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment on August 24, 2018 (Dkt. 335), and Plaintiff submitted a reply on September 10, 2018 (Dkt. 337).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff filed a motion for recusal on March 29, 2018. (Dkt. 307). On April 5, 2018, Defendants filed their response to the motion for recusal. (Dkt. 313).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 21, 2018, Plaintiff also filed a motion for sanctions with a request for appointment of counsel. (Dkt. 320). Defendants filed their response opposing the\n   motion for sanctions on September 10, 2018. (Dkt. 336).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The following facts are taken from Defendants' Local Rule 56 Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. 276-2), Plaintiff's Local Rule 56 Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. 315), and their supporting documents. Where the parties specifically controvert particular facts, the Court has noted the disagreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     August 7, 2008\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 7, 2008, Plaintiff was involved in a fight with two other inmates. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 3). Before the fight, Plaintiff was playing cards with inmates Trustee Eades and Tyrone Members, and Plaintiff won the pot in Eades' possession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). When Plaintiff exited his cell, Eades walked up to Plaintiff and hit him on top of his head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). Plaintiff then began fighting with Eades and Members, receiving multiple blows to the face and back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8; Dkt. 276-6). Newton was called on his radio to check the block Plaintiff was housed in and approached, ordering all inmates into their cells. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 9; Dkt. 315 at \u00b6 10). All inmates complied except for Plaintiff and one of the other inmates he was fighting with. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 10; Dkt. 276-6). Newton attempted to call a \"Code One\" on his radio, but the battery was dead. (Dkt. 315 at \u00b6 10). He then immediately activated the guard alarm in the west corridor of the jail, and central control paged a \"Code One.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Deputies Amico and Danehy were assigned to central control and were monitoring the video screens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Newton did not have a direct conversation with Amico or Danehy over the radio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Newton and several other guards entered the cellblock and ordered Plaintiff and the other inmate to stop fighting. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 276-6). Although the inmates stopped hitting each other, the other inmate had Plaintiff pinned to the ground when the guards approached. (Dkt. 276-6). Newton attempted to handcuff Plaintiff after the other inmate was secured, ordering Plaintiff to remain face down and to place his hands behind his back, but Plaintiff refused and instead attempted to roll over and stand up. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 12; Dkt. 276-6). Newton tried to stabilize Plaintiff on the ground, but Plaintiff continued to struggle and resist efforts to be handcuffed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Dkt. 276-6). A knee strike was applied to Plaintiff's right torso, and Plaintiff was then handcuffed and escorted out of the cell block.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 15; Dkt. 276-6). The entire incident lasted less than one minute and 40 seconds. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 20). Plaintiff's front tooth was knocked out during the altercation, and he had a gash in his upper lip. (Dkt. 306 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     December 23, 2008\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 23, 2008, Plaintiff was moved from a Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\") to a reception cell, where he was housed until December 26, 2008. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 72). Plaintiff contends that when he was placed in this cell, it \"was unconscionab[l]y filthy with walls covered with feces, urine, mucus and other crud and a toilet that [did] not function filled with excrement and spew all over it.\" (Dkt. 306 at 25). He claims that he complained about his cell 2 times to DeRosa, 5 times to Peck, 25 or 30 times to Cardella, 15 times to Kennelly, 6 times to Knapp, and 15 times to Tripoli, and that he also spoke to Jolly,\n   Horan, and Kaiser about his cell conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-28). Despite all his complaints, Plaintiff asserts, he was never given the opportunity to clean his reception cell while he was housed there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants assert that after an inmate exits a reception cell and before a new inmate gets placed there, inmate trustees clean the cell. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 74). Defendants further contend that if any prison guard was made aware of unsanitary conditions in Plaintiff's cell, she or he would have ordered a trustee to clean the cell or given Plaintiff the opportunity to clean the cell himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75). Additionally, inmates housed in reception cells are given one hour of recreation a day, and during that time they are allowed access to cleaning materials and supplies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     January 19, 2009\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 26, 2008, Plaintiff was moved from the reception cell to a mainframe cell. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 31). Plaintiff asserts that before he was moved to the mainframe cell, he pleaded with Tripoli to not be placed there, and that Tripoli responded by saying, \"I don't give a fuck how many times you got your ass kicked on main-frame, we have decided that you will only be placed in a cell on the mainframe and no place else, either you go to [mainframe] or I am going to put you back in SHU.\" (Dkt. 306 at 28). Plaintiff also alleges that he spoke to DeRosa, McGowan, Cardella, Kennelly, Knapp, Jolly, Horan, and Kaiser about being scared of moving back to mainframe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiff underwent a classification process when he was assigned to a mainframe cell. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 31). Classification is the process of assigning inmates to appropriate housing units using screening and risk assessment criteria delineated by the New York State Commission of Corrections' Minimum Standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33). The following factors are taken into account when classifying an inmate: criminal history; propensity for victimization; history of medical/mental illness; history of sex offenses; history of hostile relationships with other inmates; prior attempts at self-injury or suicide; prior escapes and attempted escapes; attitude behavior during present and prior incarceration, including any history of assaultive behavior during incarceration; and any other information which may affect the safety and welfare of the inmate or facility staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). Plaintiff underwent this classification process, and it was determined that a mainframe cell was appropriate housing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37). Defendants assert that an inmate would not be placed in a housing unit with inmates he has a hostile history with or who present a threat to the inmate's safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On January 19, 2009, Plaintiff was attacked on his cellblock by three other inmates named Anthony Smith, Mark Rogers, and Anival Williams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 41). After hearing a commotion and then seeing the inmates fighting, Willis called a \"Code One\" and ordered all inmates to return to their cells, which they did. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 44-45). Waud was not on duty on January 19, 2009. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff contends that earlier that day while Smith was cutting Plaintiff's hair, Willis told Smith \"none of us deputies care if [Plaintiff] gets his ass kicked ... so me like all the other sheriff deputies employed\n   here at [the Monroe County Jail] need you to kick his ass.\" (Dkt. 306 at 10). Plaintiff later noticed Smith again talking to Willis, and the attack happened shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     February 26, 2009\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On February 26, 2009, Plaintiff left his cell for a short time to brush his hair. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 55). While Plaintiff was gone, several inmates took items from his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56). Plaintiff confronted the inmates, and they jumped him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). Waud later noticed Plaintiff bleeding and a lump over his right eye and immediately escorted him to be evaluated by a nurse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants contend that before this incident, Plaintiff lost at cards and threatened the other inmates with a shower brush. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60). Plaintiff contends that before the theft occurred, Waud stated, \"It is no wonder why all the inmates hate you, all you do is win their commissary, just like you ... always filing grievances against us deputies and jail administration, it's not a secret why you are [the] most hated person in Monroe County Jail.\" (Dkt. 306 at 13). Plaintiff asserts that Waud then threatened his life and told Plaintiff he was going to \"have some inmates kick [Plaintiff's] ass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges these statements were caught on video and that the video was preserved for a misbehavior report hearing, but Defendants are withholding it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     March 2009\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On March 2, 2009, Plaintiff was subjected to a strip search, and he submitted a grievance about the officers' conduct during that search, including that of Scally, on March 3, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). On March 11, 2009, McGowan and Guest were conducting a supervisor tour and a grievance investigation in the SHU, where Plaintiff was housed. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 61). Scally, Atkins, Guest, Amatore, and McGowan were at the elevator gate entry to the SHU, and Guest and Amatore entered Plaintiff's cell. (Dkt. 335-1 at \u00b6 46). At that time, Scally walked by Plaintiff's cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff asserts that Scally puffed his cheeks out and imitated performing oral sex. (Dkt. 276-29 at 26). Defendants contend that Plaintiff yelled, \"Scally, you can suck my dick. When I get out of this cell I'm going to knock you on your ass. I am going to fuck with Scally every day until he loses his mind and opens my cell. Then I'm going to get him fired.\" (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 62). This alleged threat towards Scally violated the jail's rules and regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65). Defendants contend that Plaintiff was accordingly infracted for his violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66). That day, Scally submitted an administrative segregation request for Plaintiff. (Dkt. 335-1 at \u00b6 48). Plaintiff asserts that he never made such a threat, that the misbehavior report submitted was false, and that on March 12, 2009, Thomas, Horan, and Krenzer submitted and approved harsher sanctions than asked for by Scally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On March 17, 2019, Plaintiff submitted a written request to Shellard for assistance with investigating the incident. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 67). Shellard did investigate and found that Plaintiff had made threatening statements towards Scally. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 68). A disciplinary hearing was held on March 28, 2009, and Plaintiff was found guilty of violating the jail's rules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69; Dkt. 335-1 at \u00b6 53). Plaintiff was placed on administrative segregation, was restricted to\n   showering three days a week,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had his exercise revoked for a 20-day period. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 70-71). Plaintiff claims that the interaction between him and Scally on March 11, 2019, was videotaped and preserved for the disciplinary hearing, but that Defendants failed to produce the tape to Plaintiff. (Dkt. 335-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     May 2, 2009\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On May 2, 2009, Plaintiff was housed in the SHU.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50; Dkt. 314 at \u00b6 50). Plaintiff contends that Willis approached Clark and said he would let Clark dump dirty mop water into Plaintiff's cell, and that he would write a misbehavior report saying Plaintiff flooded his cell instead. (Dkt. 306-1 at 131). When Willis left to conduct his rounds, Clark checked Willis' office to make sure he was not there and then ran and threw a cup-full of liquid into Plaintiff's cell. (Dkt. 276-19). Plaintiff contends the liquid was urine. (Dkt. 314 at \u00b6 54). Willis returned from his rounds and spoke briefly with Clark and then with Plaintiff for five minutes before returning to his office. (Dkt. 276-19). Several minutes later Plaintiff began throwing papers from his cell into the hallway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Willis spoke with another officer in the SHU hall while Clark was present, and then both guards returned to their office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Willis was in his office when this occurred (Dkt. 276-19), and Defendants assert that he had no prior knowledge of the incident. (Dkt. 276-38 at \u00b6 21). Plaintiff asserts that Willis then walked by Plaintiff's cell while Plaintiff was trying to push the water out of it, made a threatening comment to Plaintiff, and then brought Plaintiff a towel purchased by Plaintiff's mother to clean up the urine-tainted water. (Dkt. 276-29 at 22; Dkt. 306-1 at 131). Willis contends he was not aware Clark threw mop water into Plaintiff's cell.

(Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Dkt. 314 at \u00b6 21). Defendants contend that Plaintiff lunged at Shellard in the no-contact room and bit him on the head, and that the only management technique used by Shellard was pushing Plaintiff on the chest, grabbing his uniform, and then stabilizing him to the ground. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Plaintiff contends that he was in full mechanical\n   restraints and having a conversation with Shellard while Alberti and Daly were in the room, and then Shellard grabbed the back of Plaintiff's head and rammed his face into the glass before slamming him to the floor. (Dkt. 276-29 at 13). Plaintiff asserts that he did not lunge at Shellard or bite him. (Dkt. 314 at \u00b6 23). He also contends the deputies then dragged him to the elevator by his legs, and when they got on the elevator, rammed his head into the corner. (Dkt. 276-29 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When they got off the elevator, Plaintiff grabbed the gate, and Plaintiff contends that Galen started beating his hands with an object,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Plaintiff was then thrown to the ground and kicked by the deputies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Plaintiff contends Lipari watched the other officers stomp and kick him while \"shaking a cannister of mace with a devious smirk on his face.\" (Dkt. 306 at 8). Defendants on the other hand state Lipari at no time laughed during the incident \"as it was a serious and dangerous situation.\" (Dkt. 276-37 at \u00b6 22). Plaintiff suffered from shoulder burn, back pain, a headache, a swollen ankle, and swollen hands.

(Dkt. 335-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 73-74). Plaintiff contends these lights were never turned off and damaged his eyes, causing him to switch from reading glasses to bifocals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75, 85). Plaintiff submitted grievances about the lights on March 6, 2009, April 6, 2009, April 8, 2009, and May 11, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 79, 81-82). Harling responded to the April 9, 2009, grievance, stating the lights were a \"recognized sound correctional practice\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79), and Lipari and Harling investigated the May 11, 2009, grievance and issued a similar response (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants assert that the Monroe County Jail is governed by the New York Minimum Standards and Regulations for Management of County Jails and Penitentiaries (\"NYMS\"), and all construction at the jail must be submitted for review and approval to the State Commission of Correction. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-81). The lights in the Monroe County Jail's SHU were installed around 1992, and they were built in accordance with the NYMS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82-83). The State's assessors also visit the jail annually to ensure it continues to meet the NYMS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 85-86). The SHU cells are lit so that staff members can adequately confirm the health and safety of the inmates at all times.

Plaintiff disobeyed a direct order from Newton when just moments before he had been in a fight with other inmates (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12), and Plaintiff struggled and resisted efforts to be handcuffed (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Looking at the record before the Court, a reasonable trier of fact could only find that no excessive force was used in the August 7, 2008, incident.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff struggled while ignoring Daly's orders to stop resisting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). When being escorted back to his cell, Plaintiff threatened the officers, ignored their orders, and made several more attempts to bite Daly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27; Dkt. 276-35 at \u00b6 23). Alberti had to pry Plaintiff's hands off the elevator gate, and eventually both Alberti and Daly again directed Plaintiff to the floor due to his combative behavior. (Dkt. 276-35 at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29). Plaintiff was then escorted back to his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27).

August 7, 2008\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Defendants Amico, Danehy, and Newton failed to protect him when they allowed him to be attacked by the other inmates. (Dkt. 306 at 5-6). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Newton premeditated the attack with the other two prisoners, and then Amico and Danehy collaborated with Newton to delay calling a Code 1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A reasonable trier of fact looking at the record before the Court could only find that Plaintiff's failure to protect claim regarding the August 7, 2008, incident is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The record viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff does not show that Amico, Danehy, or Newton knew or should have known that the two prisoners would attack Plaintiff. As previously discussed, Plaintiff's conclusory allegations do not establish that Amico, Danehy, and Newton had a conversation over the radio or on the phone, or that they conspired to allow Eades and Members to attack Plaintiff. Nor does the record show that Defendants intentionally or recklessly delayed in calling a \"Code One.\" To the contrary, after Newton became aware of the fight, he immediately activated the guard alarm in the west corridor of the jail, and central control paged a \"Code One.\" (Dkt. 315 at \u00b6 10). The entire incident lasted less than one minute and 40 seconds. (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because a reasonable trier of fact could only find for Defendants as to the August 7, 2008, failure to protect claim, the Court grants Defendants' motion related to this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2. January 19, 2009\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Tripoli, Waud, and Willis failed to protect him when he was attacked by three inmates on January 19, 2009, because they placed him in mainframe housing on December 26, 2008, despite his protests. (Dkt. 306 at 9-11). The Court grants Defendants' summary judgment as to Waud, but finds there are genuine issues of material fact as to Tripoli and Willis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   A reasonable trier of fact could not find that Waud failed to protect Plaintiff on January 19, 2009. Waud was not responsible for inmate housing assignments between December 2008 and January 2009 (Dkt. 276-39 at \u00b6 11), and he was not working on January 19, 2009, when the attack on Plaintiff occurred (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Plaintiff does not dispute these facts. (Dkt. 314 at \u00b6 48). Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion as to the failure to protect claim against Waud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   However, genuine issues of material fact exist as to Tripoli and Willis. Looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Plaintiff was incarcerated under conditions that posed a substantial risk of serious harm when he was moved to mainframe housing on December 26, 2008. Plaintiff contends that he knew if he was placed in mainframe housing, he would face an \"imminent threat of being pummeled by a violent gang attack by multiple inmates\" (Dkt. 306 at 9), and it is undisputed that three inmates attacked Plaintiff in mainframe housing on January 19, 2009 (Dkt. 276-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On the other hand, looking at the record in the light most favorable to Defendants, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Plaintiff did not face conditions that posed a substantial risk of serious harm when he was moved to mainframe housing. Defendants contend that \"an inmate would not be placed in a housing [unit] with other inmates [with] whom he has a history of hostile relationships or which would present a threat to the inmate's safety.\" (Dkt. 276-59 at 19). Additionally, Plaintiff testified at his deposition that of his three\n   attackers on January 19, 2009, he was only familiar with Smith, the jail barber. (Dkt. 276-29 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Defendants knew or should have known that Plaintiff was in danger of being attacked. Plaintiff asserts that before he was moved to the mainframe cell, he pleaded with Tripoli to not be placed there, and that Tripoli responded by saying, \"I don't give a fuck how many times you got your ass kicked on main-frame, we have decided that you will only be placed in a cell on the mainframe and no place else, either you go to [mainframe] or I am going to put you back in SHU.\" (Dkt. 306 at 28). Plaintiff also alleges that he spoke to DeRosa, McGowan, Cardella, Kennelly, Knapp, Jolly, Horan, and Kaiser and told them he was scared of moving back to mainframe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-28). A reasonable trier of fact could find that these alleged communications \"were sufficient to put [Tripoli and Willis] on notice of a serious risk to his safety such that they needed to act to protect him from that risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. Dzurenda\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:14-cv-966(VAB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201217092\">\n    2017 WL 1217092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D. Conn. Mar. 31, 2017) (denying summary judgment as to the failure to protect claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants, in contrast, contend that Plaintiff did not tell Defendants that he was afraid of being transferred back to mainframe. (Dkt. 335-1 at 20-24). Therefore, Defendants argue, Tripoli and Willis \"did not mistakenly fail to notice information that indicated an allegedly tenuous relationship between Plaintiff and any of the other inmates\" because \"there was no such information to notice.\" (Dkt. 276-59 at 20 (quotation omitted) ). Because there are genuine issues of material fact surrounding the January 19, 2009, incident, the Court denies both the motions for summary judgment as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    3. May 2, 2009\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On May 2, 2009, Plaintiff claims that Defendant Willis not only failed to protect Plaintiff from having urine, feces, and dirty mop water thrown into Plaintiff's cell by inmate Clark, but that Defendant Willis also let inmate Clark out of his cell and directed him to throw these materials into Plaintiff's cell. (Dkt. 306 at 11-13). The Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiff contends that inmate Clark threw a cup filled with urine at him, and then dumped a mop bucket of dirty water that contained urine into his cell. Looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable trier of fact could find this constitutes a condition that poses a substantial risk of serious harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hogan v. Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694925\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/509/#p516\">\n    738 F.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that spraying an inmate with vinegar, excrement, and machine oil is more than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   use of force and rises to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation). In contrast, Defendants contend that Clark only threw a cup of water into Plaintiff's cell. (Dkt. 276-38 at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Further, Plaintiff submitted a sworn affidavit from Clark where Clark states Willis approached him and told him he would let Clark dump dirty mop water into Plaintiff's cell, and that he would write a misbehavior report saying Plaintiff flooded his cell instead. (Dkt. 306-1 at 131). Clark also states Willis later told Clark, \"Don't make it look so obvious,\" and to wait until Willis left for his rounds to dump the mop water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A reasonable trier of fact could find based on the record before the Court that Defendant Willis directed the dumping of the mop bucket to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendants contend that Willis was unaware of any tension between Clark and Plaintiff, that Clark acted entirely on his own while Willis was making his rounds,\n   and that Willis had no knowledge of Clark throwing a cup of urine/water or dumping dirty mop water into Plaintiff's cell. (Dkt. 276-38 at \u00b6\u00b6 21-25). Additionally, the record shows that Plaintiff threw a stack of papers into the hall while Clark was mopping (Dkt. 276-19), which could have been the reason Clark dumped the mop water into Plaintiff's cell. The surveillance footage submitted by Defendants does little to clarify these factual disputes because it contains no audio, and therefore does not indicate what Plaintiff, Clark, and Willis said to each other during the time period in question. Therefore, the Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact and denies the motion and cross-motion for summary judgment as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    4. August 12, 2009\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff contends that during the August 12, 2009, incident, Defendant Lipari failed to intervene while Defendants Galen, Daly, and Alberti beat Plaintiff. (Dkt. 306 at 8). The Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As was previously discussed in this Decision and Order, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Plaintiff was subject to unconstitutionally excessive force during the incident on August 12, 2009. Additionally, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Lipari intentionally or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to mitigate the risk to Plaintiff. It is undisputed that Defendant Lipari was physically present when the officers attempted to remove Plaintiff from the elevator. (Dkt. 276-37 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-20). Plaintiff contends Lipari watched the other officers stomp and kick him while \"shaking a cannister of mace with a devious smirk on his face.\" (Dkt. 306 at 8). Defendants, on the other hand, contend that Lipari was supervising the other officers' handling of Plaintiff, was not shaking a can of mace, and at no point laughed during the incident. (Dkt. 276-37 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 22; Dkt. 335-1 at \u00b6 22). The Court finds genuine issues of material fact exist as to Lipari's conduct during the August 12, 2009, incident, and therefore denies both summary judgment motions as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Retaliation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff and Defendants move for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's February 26, 2009, and March 11, 2009, retaliation claims.

Plaintiff has not shown that the January 19, 2009, video would have assisted a trier of fact in determining the mental state of Tripoli and Willis in December 2008, when they assigned him to mainframe housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the March 11, 2009, videotape would be favorable to his retaliation claim. Plaintiff claims that Defendants authored a false misbehavior report against Plaintiff in retaliation for a grievance filed against Scally on March 3, 2009. (Dkt. 306 at 16-17). Plaintiff asserts the video would show that on March 11, 2009, Scally imitated oral sex when he walked by Plaintiff's cell. (Dkt. 320 at 33-34). Defendants appear to concede, for the purposes of this motion, that Scally did make such a gesture. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 276-59 at 28-29). However, the relevant disputed issue of material fact is whether Plaintiff made the threatening statements towards Scally that the misbehavior report alleges he did. The surveillance videos maintained by the Monroe County Jail do not have sound. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 276-6; Dkt. 276-19). Therefore, the video\n   would not make it any less likely that Plaintiff threatened Scally, and consequently any more likely that Defendants authored a false misbehavior report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   However, Plaintiff has presented evidence that the February 26, 2009, videotape could aid his second retaliation claim. \"Courts must take care not to hold the prejudiced party to too strict a standard of proof regarding the likely contents of the destroyed or unavailable evidence, because doing so ... would allow parties who have destroyed evidence to profit from that destruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Residential Funding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437742\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/99/#p107\">\n    306 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation and internal alterations omitted). Plaintiff claims that on February 26, 2009, Defendant Waud permitted several inmates to steal Plaintiff's commissary and beat him up in retaliation for Plaintiff's filing of grievances. (Dkt. 306 at 13). Plaintiff contends that in addition to the inmate altercation that undisputedly took place, the February 26, 2009, video shows Waud \"threatening the Plaintiff's life and stating that he is going to have some inmates kick the Plaintiff's ass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Again, surveillance videos maintained by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office during the time Plaintiff was in custody do not have sound. Therefore, the video would at best show Waud apparently speaking with Plaintiff. Still, if the video demonstrated that some sort of conversation took place, it may be helpful to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Nonetheless, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Waud had control over the February 26, 2009, video, or that the defendants relevant to Plaintiff's January 19, 2009, failure to protect claim or March 11, 2009, retaliation claim had control over those videos. \"[T]he obligation to preserve is attendant only upon 'the party having control over the evidence ... at the time it was destroyed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Butkiewicus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201718368\">\n    2016 WL 1718368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Residential Funding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437742\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/99/#p107\">\n    306 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   107 ).

In other words, unlike the other videos, the record suggests that the Jail complied with its preservation obligations-but for reasons unrelated to the duty to preserve, technical issues prevent the video from presently being viewed. Under the circumstances, the Court does not believe sanctions are appropriate, and therefore Plaintiff's motion for sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court's decision in this regard should not be misconstrued by Defendants as condoning the management of the video evidence in this case. \"[T]he courts have a right to expect that litigants and counsel will take the necessary steps to ensure that relevant records are preserved when litigation is reasonably anticipated, and that such records are collected, reviewed, and produced to the opposing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Pension Comm. of Univ. of Montreal Pension Plan v.

Indeed, the undersigned presided over a prior trial where Plaintiff ably-albeit unsuccessfully-represented himself. Moreover, the remaining claims are not overly complex and the trier of fact's resolution of the claims will depend on credibility assessments as opposed to any complex factual or legal issues.
