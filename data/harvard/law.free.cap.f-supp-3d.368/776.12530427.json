(Doc. 1 \u00b6 2). Teresa and Snyder decided to leave their spouses and move to Montana together, and on June 7, 1984, Teresa informed Harshman of her intentions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Harshman reacted badly to this news and drove toward Snyder's home, at which point Harshman encountered Snyder en route to pick up Teresa.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Three days after Teresa served Harshman with divorce papers, he purchased a .25 caliber handgun. (7/11/01 Trial Tr. 8:2-15, 9:1-5).

(Doc. 1 \u00b6 6). No body has ever been discovered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the summer of 1999, the Franklin County District Attorney enlisted assistance to search the farm where Harshman and Teresa lived at the time of Snyder's disappearance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Investigators, using metal detectors, found a single .25 caliber shell casing buried one inch below ground on the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A ballistics expert determined that the shell casing was fired from the same gun as the shell casing recovered from Snyder's barn in 1985.\n   <em>\n    Harshman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203135797\">\n    2016 WL 3135797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Harshman and Snyder's wife were arrested and charged with Snyder's murder in April 2000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203135797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The charges against Snyder's wife were eventually withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203135797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On July 9, 2001, Harshman began a five-day jury trial for first-degree murder. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 9). Of particular importance for the instant petition, besides the above-referenced evidence, the jury heard testimony from three jailhouse informants who had been incarcerated with Harshman at the Franklin County Jail in 2000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Randi Kohr (\"Kohr\") testified that while playing cards with Harshman and two other inmates, Harshman admitted that he \"was with a woman and she cheated on him. He caught them and he ended up shooting him and he got rid of the body.\" (7/12/01 Trial Tr. 20:5-22, 21:10-13). Kohr further testified that Harshman had stated that \"there would be no evidence. There's no gun, no body, no casings .... There's no evidence against me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:11-15). Keith Granlun (\"Granlun\"), a former minister incarcerated for drunk driving and unsworn falsification to authorities, attested that Harshman had admitted that he had \"murdered somebody years ago\" and \"wanted to know if he could be saved for that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:24-41:18; Doc. 1 \u00b6 15). Granlun testified that Harshman asked Granlun to go to Maryland and pray over a particular area where \"somebody is buried.\" (7/12/01 Trial Tr. 42:10-23). Finally, Wallace Jones (\"Jones\") testified that he was known in jail for proficiency with legal\n   research, and that Harshman had asked him if he could \"find anything where it was known in Pennsylvania for someone to be tried for a homicide without a body ever actually being found.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:12-21). According to Jones, Harshman maintained that in his case, \"there's no body or a gun and they won't find one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   All three jailhouse witnesses averred that they were not testifying pursuant to any deal with, or in exchange for any personal favorable treatment from, the Commonwealth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:14-21, 28:9-14, 29:21-30:9 (Kohr); 38:16-24 (Jones); 49:12-50:12 (Granlun) ). Then-District Attorney for Franklin County, the late John F. Nelson, Esquire (\"DA Nelson\"), emphasized in his closing that \"no deals\" were made with the jailhouse informants, claimed that nothing was \"offered\" by the Commonwealth in exchange for testimony, and reviewed each witness's allegedly selfless motives for testifying. (7/13/01 Trial Tr. at 62:21-64:4). After deliberating for less than four hours, the jury convicted Harshman of first-degree murder. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17; 7/13/01 Trial Tr. 96:1-2, 104:7-8, 18-22). Harshman was sentenced the same day to a mandatory term of life in prison without parole. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Harshman's state-court procedural history is both lengthy and circuitous. After his direct appeal was denied, he began his pursuit of post-conviction relief, which has been ongoing for nearly 15 years. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-21). Harshman timely filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   PCRA petition in December 2004, which was amended in June 2006 by retained counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). Because of the complicated procedural course of Harshman's post-conviction process, we separately discuss the relevant portions of each PCRA opinion and appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. September 2010 PCRA Opinion and Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his amended PCRA petition, Harshman averred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the jailhouse informants wanted to disavow their prior trial testimony.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Harshman\n   </em>\n   , No. CP-28-CR-851-2000, at 4 (Pa. Ct. Com. Pl. Franklin Cty. Sept. 13, 2010) [hereinafter \"9/13/10 PCRA Op.\"]. Harshman contended that Granlun had spoken with a private investigator and had fully recanted and admitted that his trial testimony was false. (Doc. 9-10 at 43). Granlun, moreover, was prepared to testify to this effect at the PCRA evidentiary hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Harshman, Kohr, too, had recanted his trial testimony in a signed, written statement witnessed by Harshman's PCRA counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). This statement allegedly contained Kohr's admission that he had never spoken to Harshman in his life and had obtained details for his trial testimony from newspaper articles and conversations with other inmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kohr's statement went on to claim that \"[t]he testimony I provided was absolutely false and the only reason I gave false testimony was because the District Attorney had agreed to help me obtain an early release from prison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49 (quoting Harshman PCRA Ex. 1) ). Kohr had also purportedly mailed letters to Harshman's PCRA counsel and Kohr's then-girlfriend, Megin Chilcote (\"Chilcote\"), outlining an agreement with the prosecution to provide testimony against Harshman in exchange for favorable treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The PCRA court held evidentiary hearings on August 3, 2009, September 10, 2009, and December 14, 2009. At the August 3 hearing, Harshman presented the testimony of Walter Dill (\"Dill\"), Granlun's brother-in-law of 27 years. 9/13/10 PCRA Op. at 3; (8/3/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 25:14-21). According to counsel's proffer, Dill would\n   testify that Granlun had directed him to contact Harshman's trial counsel, Attorney David S. Keller (\"Attorney Keller\"), because false testimony was going to be given at Harshman's upcoming trial. (8/3/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 20:5-12, 21:11-20, 22:6-10). The PCRA court, on the Commonwealth's objection, limited Dill's testimony to the fact that Granlun had told Dill to contact Attorney Keller regarding the upcoming murder trial and that Dill did as asked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:7-27:2; 28:3-11). The court determined that what Granlun specifically told Dill regarding why Dill should contact Attorney Keller was more appropriate for direct testimony from Granlun. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:12-23:7, 27:4-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That testimony never came because Granlun-upon advice from appointed counsel-asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:1-60:25). Granlun explained that, according to his counsel, police were \"waiting to arrest him\" and he \"would be arrested\" if he provided testimony contradicting his prior trial testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:6-11, 21-23; 59:5-24). Granlun steadfastly refused to testify unless granted immunity from prosecution for perjury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:25-57:19). DA Nelson confirmed Granlun's predicament, stating that \"it wasn't a threat\" but rather \"a fact of life\" that Granlun would be arrested for perjury if he contradicted his prior testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:12-23, 64:1-7). Kohr likewise blanketly invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:4-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the September 10, 2009 evidentiary hearing, only Chilcote testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   9/13/10 PCRA Op. at 4. Chilcote attested that she had spoken with DA Nelson and detective Mark Christman (\"Detective Christman\") on multiple occasions and that DA Nelson told her \"if [Kohr] would testify in the Harshman case that [DA Nelson] would release [Kohr]\" from prison. (9/10/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 13:3-16:4; 29:18-19; 30:13-18). Chilcote averred that she had called multiple times a week to urge the prosecutor to \"keep up his end of the bargain,\" so much so that \"[DA] Nelson got tired of [her] calling, so he started making [her] talk to [Detective Christman] at that point in time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:25-17:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the December 14, 2009 evidentiary hearing, the Commonwealth called Detective Christman to testify. 9/13/10 PCRA Op. at 5. When asked whether he was aware of \"any agreement that the Commonwealth made with Kohr in order to secure his testimony at trial,\" Detective Christman replied that he was aware only that DA Nelson had written letters to the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole on Kohr's behalf seeking to have Kohr's parole \"reconsidered.\" (12/14/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 5:2-12). Two letters written by DA Nelson to the parole board, dated November 28, 2000, and January 19, 2001, were then admitted into evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:16-6:22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1-5, 1-6). According to the PCRA court, the letters \"ask the Board to take [Kohr's] cooperation into consideration and 'perhaps grant him an earlier release date.' \" 9/13/10 PCRA Op. at 5 (quoting Commonwealth Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its initial post-conviction decision, the PCRA court identified three grounds for relief raised by Harshman: (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (2) violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), for failing to disclose exculpatory evidence; and (3) an\n   after-discovered evidence claim pursuant to 42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(vi) regarding prosecution witnesses providing false testimony at trial. 9/13/10 PCRA Op. at 5. The court denied all three claims. As to the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, the PCRA court first found that Chilcote \"incorrectly interpreted\" DA Nelson's statements regarding contact with the parole board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The PCRA court then resolved the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim with the following internally inconsistent analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, the complete lack of any corroborating evidence of\n   <em>\n    any agreement\n   </em>\n   in exchange for Kohr's testimony gives this court no alternative but to find insufficient evidence to hold that any agreement\n   <em>\n    other than the one acknowledged by the Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   existed between District Attorney Nelson and Kohr. Given the\n   <em>\n    lack of credible evidence of an agreement\n   </em>\n   there is no need to review the second prong of the [\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ] test and this ground for relief is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

It instructed the PCRA court to allow individual questions to be asked of Kohr and Granlun and to determine-on a question-by-question basis-whether the witnesses could properly invoke the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The Superior Court affirmed the evidentiary holdings of the PCRA court that excluded as hearsay certain evidence proffered by Harshman in support of his claims regarding false trial testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31). At the September 6 hearing, Granlun fully recanted his trial testimony, explaining that he had never spoken to Harshman in prison and that the testimony he had given at Harshman's trial was unequivocally false. (9/6/12 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 26:9-16, 27:10-25, 33:6-7, 37:2-13, 38:4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Granlun averred that he had testified against Harshman in exchange for various types of favorable treatment from the Commonwealth and outlined the nature of those benefits. Granlun explained that another inmate at the prison, Keith Snyder, was distraught because his mother was terminally ill and he was unable to visit her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:17-27:2). Granlun, through his relationship with DA Nelson based on his agreement to testify, was able to help Keith Snyder secure temporary release and transportation to visit his dying mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:2-9).

Dill averred that he had informed Attorney Keller that Granlun, his brother-in-law, was in jail and wanted to speak with Attorney Keller because \"there was a bunch of guys going to lie at the trial and [Granlun] wanted [Attorney Keller] to come down to ask him or help him out or whatever.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:17-24).

She further verified that Granlun's \"fines and costs were discharged,\" which was not typical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:11-23). ADA Krom then confirmed that possible reasons for remittal of fines and costs included \"financial hardship\" as well as \"cooperation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:12-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Attorney Keller testified that, according to his notes, he had spoken with Dill prior to Harshman's trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:13-41:17). Attorney Keller's notes were read into the record during the hearing.

The PCRA court found Granlun's recantation testimony incredible and \"inherently untrustworthy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. The court ultimately held that, under Pennsylvania Supreme Court after-discovered-evidence jurisprudence, Granlun's recantation testimony did not afford Harshman a basis for relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The issues Harshman raised included that the PCRA court had failed to abide by the Superior Court's August 31, 2011 remand order regarding Kohr's blanket Fifth Amendment assertion, had failed to recognize an undisclosed deal between the Commonwealth and Granlun, and had failed to apply the correct legal standards to the alleged existence of an undisclosed deal with Granlun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The PCRA court issued a Rule 1925(a) opinion on June 10, 2014, addressing the issues it had not discussed in its March 10, 2014 opinion. As to the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, the court first reviewed the evidence presented, which included Granlun's full recantation of his trial testimony; Granlun's PCRA testimony regarding immediate release from prison and the dismissal of charges and fines in exchange for testifying at trial; Dill's corroborating PCRA testimony regarding false trial testimony offered by jailhouse informants and his direct conversations with DA Nelson concerning favorable treatment for Granlun; the documentary evidence submitted establishing that Granlun was released the day he testified and had his pending charges and fines dismissed \"at the request of the District Attorney's Office\" for his cooperation; and ADA Krom's testimony that she did not recall any deal other than \"Granlun asking for some benefit for his friend [Keith] Snyder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13.

The court noted that despite Granlun's recantation, \"Kohr's trial testimony of [Harshman's] admission still stands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It reasoned that \"there was a plethora of circumstantial evidence upon which a jury was entitled to find guilt,\" and concluded that even if a deal between Granlun and the Commonwealth had not been disclosed, it would not have satisfied\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   's materiality standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court added that its March 10, 2014 opinion elaborated on this point when it reasoned that \"even if Granlun's testimony would have been consistent with his recanted testimony, a jury still would not have been compelled to find [Harshman] not guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Superior Court issued its decision on February 25, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

In reviewing the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, the Superior Court first noted the unreliability of recantation testimony, then adopted wholesale the PCRA court's analysis, concluding that \"the record supports the [PCRA] court's determination that there was no undisclosed deal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. The court then performed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materiality analysis in the alternative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. It began by stating, \"even if a deal existed and it was material, [Harshman] fails to prove how it would have changed the outcome of [his] trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Observing that the prosecution can sustain its burden of proof at trial by circumstantial evidence alone, the court reasoned that \"the jury could have found [Harshman] guilty based on Mr. Kohr's testimony and the plethora of circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the court remanded on the issue of Kohr's blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment and the PCRA court's direct refusal to comply with the earlier remand order, reassigning the case to a different judge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4, *8 ; (Doc. 1 \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Harshman presented two witnesses: Kohr and Chilcote. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   5/21/15 PCRA Hr'g Tr.). During this proceeding, Kohr was asked specific questions and was permitted to discuss with his appointed counsel whether to invoke the Fifth Amendment on a question-by-question basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:17-65:10). Of relevance to the matter\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , Kohr testified that he had asked DA Nelson about writing to the parole board on his behalf and that DA Nelson had agreed to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:16-27:13). Kohr further attested that he had expected \"to get some help\" from the Commonwealth in obtaining an early release from prison, possibly before the birth of his daughter in November 2000, but clarified that his trial \"testimony had nothing to do with making a deal or anything to get out or cooperation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:14-36:19). Kohr also affirmed his prior trial testimony that Harshman had admitted to murdering Snyder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:19-25:15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In a written opinion dated August 20, 2015, the PCRA court examined one issue: \"did [Harshman] provide enough evidence in his PCRA that an agreement existed that was not disclosed to [him] and that enticed witness testimony.\" 8/20/15 PCRA Op. at 6. The court considered the letters written by DA Nelson to the parole board as well as Kohr's testimony from the May 2015 hearing where he admitted to seeking and expecting assistance from DA Nelson regarding his parole status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12. The court reasoned that while Harshman claimed that DA Nelson had \"failed to disclose the presence of an agreement relating to assisting Mr. Kohr with the state parole board, the record establishes that such an agreement was clearly disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The court concluded that Harshman had failed to show \"that a deal existed or that his trial counsel was unaware of a certain deal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court then performed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materiality analysis in the alternative. It found that, even if the testimony of Granlun and Kohr had been excluded, there was other \"overwhelming evidence\" of Harshman's guilt, reasoning that \"[t]his was not a case where the jury's finding of guilt was contingent on the testimony of Mr. Kohr and Mr. Granlun being credible,\" and that even if a deal existed \"it would not be essential to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the PCRA court's determination that \"there was 'no undisclosed deal between Mr. Kohr and the Commonwealth.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Harshman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203135797\">\n    2016 WL 3135797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (quoting 8/20/15 PCRA Op. at 13). The Superior Court acknowledged the letters written to the parole board by DA Nelson on Kohr's behalf, then affirmed the PCRA court's determination that there was no deal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court reasoned that \"no deal\" existed between Kohr and the prosecution because the letters were written prior to trial, they had \"no effect\" because parole was not granted, and Kohr had testified at trial despite knowing of the inefficacy of the letters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Superior Court did not discuss the PCRA court's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materiality analysis, nor did it independently perform one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

DA Nelson admitted that he sent not one but two letters to the parole board on Kohr's behalf. To the extent the PCRA court found that the agreement to assist Kohr with the parole board was \"clearly disclosed,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8/20/15 PCRA Op. at 10, that finding is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The record establishes, and respondents admit, that existence of the letters was not disclosed until the PCRA proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8/3/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 69:19-72:8; Doc. 10 at 2). The PCRA court appears to have mistaken post-conviction disclosure with\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   disclosure. Quite logically, however,\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   requires disclosure\n   <em>\n    prior to trial\n   </em>\n   , not in collateral relief proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16 at 11-13, 20-21). Respondents cite no portion of the record indicating that the Commonwealth disclosed the parole-board assistance before or during trial. They argue that Kohr's trial testimony that he \"maxed out\" and that \"[n]obody in Franklin County can do anything with state parole\" shows that the assistance was disclosed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055333\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/263/#p298\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 12 (citing 7/12/01 Trial Tr. 21:18-21, 30:3-7) ). This testimony,\n   <em>\n    per contra\n   </em>\n   , in no way establishes disclosure of the prosecution's assistance; it merely reiterates Kohr's untenable suggestion at trial that he received no favorable treatment from the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The substance of those undisclosed letters bears repeating verbatim. On November 28, 2000, DA Nelson wrote, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   While incarcerated at the Franklin County Prison, Mr. Kohr became privy to information concerning a pending murder prosecution in Franklin County....

The post-hoc PCRA assertions of Kohr and DA Nelson that these letters were not part of any \"agreement\" in exchange for trial testimony is both rebutted by the letters' explicit language and irrelevant in determining whether a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation occurred. The fact that Kohr still testified even though DA Nelson was unable to procure his release prior to Harshman's trial is likewise immaterial.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence is that which is favorable to the accused, including impeachment evidence. These letters unambiguously indicate that the District Attorney of Franklin County-who was leading Harshman's prosecution-agreed to contact the parole board on Kohr's behalf \"in exchange for [Kohr's] cooperation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They are unquestionably favorable to Harshman and were required to be disclosed pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We reject respondents' inverted argument that Harshman \"failed to meet his burden of proving that these letters to the State Parole Board were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   disclosed by the Commonwealth.\" (Doc. 10 at 4 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16 at 18-19).

We initially note that extensive evidence was presented in the PCRA proceedings regarding favorable treatment for Granlun concerning his own pending criminal liability and related fines and costs. Granlun-despite threat of prosecution for perjury-unequivocally averred at the September 6, 2012 PCRA hearing that he had testified falsely at trial and did so in exchange for favorable treatment from the prosecution, including dismissal of his pending criminal and financial liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   But there was other independent, corroborating evidence beyond Granlun's own PCRA testimony. For example, it is undisputed that Granlun was released from prison the very day he testified against Harshman. Nowhere in the record does the Commonwealth provide an explanation for why Granlun secured release from prison approximately two hours after testifying at Harshman's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additional corroboration comes from both documentary and testimonial evidence. The Commonwealth does not dispute that Granlun's pending fines and costs of approximately $ 1,300 were remitted. Granlun testified that this remittal was due to his agreement to testify against Harshman. Although acknowledging that fines and costs could be remitted for multiple reasons, including \"cooperation,\" (3/28/13 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 29:12-15), the government never explained this particular remittal. The only non-testimonial explanation came by way of the effectuating October 2001 order, which recognized Granlun's assistance in acting as a \"key witness\" for the prosecution before dismissing all charges and sums due at the \"\n   <em>\n    request of the district attorney's office\n   </em>\n   .\" (9/6/12 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 24:20-25:4 (emphasis added) ). Granlun's brother-in-law, Dill, separately confirmed the cooperation, testifying that he had spoken to DA Nelson directly, knew that DA Nelson was trying to help Granlun, and believed DA Nelson applied pressure regarding Granlun's current legal troubles when he learned that\n   Granlun was wavering on his decision to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Despite all this evidence, the PCRA court found no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, concluding that the Commonwealth had provided no favorable treatment to Granlun regarding his personal criminal and financial liabilities in exchange for testimony. The court categorically rejected Granlun's recantation as incredible; dismissed the October 2001 order because it postdated Granlun's testimony and was not \"filed until after the expiration of Granlun's parole\"; and completely discounted Dill's testimony because it was \"based on information that he received from his admittedly untrustworthy brother-in-law Granlun.\" 6/10/14 PCRA 1925(a) Op. at 10-13. The court never addressed Dill's testimony about his conversations with DA Nelson concerning assistance for Granlun's pending criminal troubles, nor did it discuss the fact that neither Granlun nor Dill appeared to have any reason to testify untruthfully at the PCRA hearings. Granlun, in fact, fully recanted his trial testimony despite believing he faced imminent prosecution for perjury. On appeal, the Superior Court essentially adopted the PCRA court's rationale and findings on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We disagree with the state courts' factual determination and would have held differently. Harshman presented the PCRA court with substantial evidence that the Commonwealth had provided Granlun favorable treatment concerning his own criminal and financial liabilities. Nevertheless, under the considerable deference required by Section 2254(d), even though we believe the PCRA court's findings were incorrect, we cannot say its decision was based on an\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   determination of the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055333\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/263/#p298\">\n    834 F.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   But the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence relating to Granlun does not end there. The record unquestionably demonstrates that the Commonwealth provided benefits to Granlun through preferential treatment for his prison acquaintance, Keith Snyder (\"Keith\"). At the August 3, 2009 PCRA hearing, Harshman attempted to present Keith as a witness. (8/3/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 77:9, 78:24-25). Harshman's PCRA counsel proffered that Keith would testify that, through his friendship with Granlun, Keith had learned that Granlun's trial testimony was false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:4-9). Keith would also aver that he had received a special privilege by temporarily getting out of prison to see his dying mother, which the Commonwealth had facilitated without court order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:9-15). Harshman also identified a letter Keith wrote to DA Nelson\n   verifying the temporary release. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:15-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   DA Nelson fully admitted to providing special treatment to Keith at the behest of Granlun. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:12-25). DA Nelson confirmed that the Commonwealth both \"wrote a letter to the parole board\" on Keith's behalf and transported Keith from jail to the hospital to see his \"gravely ill\" mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:18-24). DA Nelson explained, \"We don't deny that it happened. It did happen.... We think Darren Hockenberry and Mark Chris[t]man took [him].... We know it happened. [They] took [Keith] to see his mother who he thought was terminally ill, whatever.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:23-81:5). Granlun corroborated this testimony at a later PCRA hearing, (9/6/12 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 26:17-27:9), and ADA Krom testified that she recalled that Granlun had sought \"some benefit for his friend [Keith],\" (3/28/13 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 20:12-17). When Harshman's PCRA counsel pointed out that the prosecution had only disclosed the letter to the parole board on Keith's behalf and not the special hospital visit, DA Nelson conceded, \"You're right about that.\" (8/3/09 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 81:10-19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:5-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The state courts' only reference to favorable treatment provided to Keith on Granlun's behalf appears in the June 2014 PCRA opinion. The court found that \"it is undisputed that this request [from Granlun for some benefit for Keith] was disclosed to trial counsel by letter dated June 19, 2001 from the District Attorney's Office.\" 6/10/14 PCRA 1925(a) Op. at 12. This finding is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). DA Nelson admitted that the prosecution had\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   disclosed the letter to the parole board on Keith's behalf,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the temporary release and transportation of Keith from jail to see his terminally ill mother.

The undisputed facts establish that the Commonwealth-on request from a key cooperating witness-secured temporary release and transportation for an inmate to see his dying mother in the hospital. This type of preferential treatment is, without a doubt, compelling impeachment material that must be disclosed to the defendant prior to trial. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Granlun received no direct personal benefit for his testimony, the state courts' determination that there was no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation relative to Granlun was still an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Such determinations, if reasonable, could absolve the unreasonable conclusions that no\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations occurred. Unfortunately, the state courts' applications of precedent regarding materiality were also plainly unreasonable. First, the courts never performed the proper cumulative assessment of prejudice as required by\n   <em>\n    Kyles\n   </em>\n   . Second, in its materiality analysis in relation to Granlun, the Superior Court applied the wrong standard. We will address these issues in reverse order for the sake of clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Wrong Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In its February 25, 2015 opinion, the Superior Court adopted the PCRA court's rationale and conclusion on the absence of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation as to Granlun.\n   <em>\n    Harshman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206172671\">\n    2015 WL 6172671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5. It then proceeded to a materiality analysis, stating, \"even if a deal existed and it was material, [Harshman]\n   <em>\n    fails to prove how it\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    would have changed the outcome of [his] trial\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (emphasis added). Next, noting that the prosecution can sustain its burden of proof by circumstantial evidence alone, the Superior Court reasoned that \"the jury\n   <em>\n    could have found [Harshman] guilty\n   </em>\n   based on Mr. Kohr's testimony and the plethora of circumstantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The court closed by setting forth the remaining evidence presented at trial with Granlun's testimony omitted, concluding that \"the record supports the PCRA court's denial of relief\" on the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This analysis was plainly incorrect. Harshman is not required to prove that the suppressed\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence \"would have changed the outcome\" of his trial because a defendant does not have to show that the evidence would have resulted in acquittal.\n   <em>\n    Kyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p433\">\n    514 U.S. at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p433\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We find that Harshman did not receive such a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The testimony at trial amply demonstrated a motive for Harshman to kill Snyder due to Snyder's affair with Teresa. There was evidence of a previous violent engagement between Harshman and Snyder where Harshman intentionally crashed into Snyder's vehicle and fired two bullets into the seat beside Snyder. Harshman had also made repeated threats against Snyder to Snyder's wife and son in 1984 and 1985. Neighbors testified that, on the day Snyder went missing, they saw a two-tone brown pickup truck parked next to Snyder's barn and later saw the same truck, which Harshman had purchased in 1984, at Harshman's residence. The sole physical evidence tying Harshman to the murder was a .25 caliber shell casing found in Snyder's barn and a second .25 caliber casing-fired from the same gun-found some 14 years later on property previously owned by the Harshmans. Snyder did not own a .25 caliber gun but Harshman did; he purchased a .25 caliber handgun several days after Teresa served him with divorce papers. And Harshman was not able to\n   produce the gun that he had purchased when requested by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This evidence, while not insubstantial, is far from overwhelming. Police never found a body, blood, DNA evidence, or the purported murder weapon. There were no eyewitnesses. And the only physical evidence connecting Harshman to the murder was the two shell casings found in separate locations and many years apart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At trial, the Commonwealth bolstered its largely circumstantial case by presenting a trio of jailhouse witnesses who claimed to have spoken to Harshman in prison. Jones' testimony was the least inculpatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at pp. 781-82. But the other two witnesses-Granlun and Kohr-gave damning testimony that, for all practical purposes, constituted confessions by Harshman to the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, both Granlun and Kohr essentially testified that, while incarcerated with them, Harshman admitted to murdering someone who had an affair with his wife and disposing of the body. It is difficult to understate the significance of such devastating testimony and the potential effect it may have had on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Granlun and Kohr, moreover, averred that they had no self-interest in testifying against Harshman. Kohr attested that he had reluctantly taken the stand, explaining that \"I feel that there's some things people can do. I'm not saying that, you know, I was righteous my whole life, I shouldn't have got in trouble for what I did,\n   <em>\n    but certain things people should pay for what they did, what the cost is\n   </em>\n   .\" (7/12/01 Trial Tr. 28:1-14 (emphasis added) ). When cross-examined about whether he was receiving anything in return for his testimony, Kohr emphatically denied that was the case and affirmed that he was testifying pursuant to his \"duties as a citizen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:21-30:7). Granlun likewise attested that he personally was not benefitting from his testimony but admitted that he wanted to help an inmate friend and that is why he had come forward with information about Harshman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:3-50:13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The materiality of evidence \"is best understood by taking the word of the prosecutor.\"\n   <em>\n    Kyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p433\">\n    514 U.S. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p433\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DA Nelson, on multiple occasions, emphasized the importance of the jailhouse witnesses' testimony and motives. In his closing argument, DA Nelson reminded the jury that defense counsel had suggested that the jailhouse witnesses were testifying \"because they wanted something in return or they were getting something in return.\" (7/13/01 Trial Tr. 62:24-63:2). He then attempted to undercut that assertion by outlining the witnesses' testimony, reviewing their proffered motives, and arguing that their cooperation was freely offered without any type of benefit given or expected in return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:21-66:5). DA Nelson summarized: \"This isn't a case where the Commonwealth offered deals to people. It's a case where people told us information that they had. And, you know, they all had different reasons for why they were telling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:8-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Additionally, in his letter to the parole board on Kohr's behalf, DA Nelson described Kohr's testimony as potentially \"critical to the successful prosecution of this murder case.\" (Doc. 1-5 at 1). And, according to the October 2001 court order, the district attorney had requested that Granlun's charges and fines be dismissed because Granlun had likewise acted as a \"key witness\" in Harshman's prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/6/12 PCRA Hr'g Tr. 24:20-25:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The law is clear about the value of impeachment evidence when testimony is critical to the prosecution.

(Doc. 17). According to his affidavit, former Franklin County Deputy Sheriff Jason Bitner (\"Bitner\") recently came forward with additional evidence of promises of favorable treatment made to the jailhouse witnesses by the Commonwealth. Bitner avers that he transported three prisoners to the sheriff's office around the time of Harshman's murder trial. (Doc. 17-1 \u00b6 5). Each prisoner was interviewed separately by DA Nelson, and Bitner was present for \"substantial parts\" of the interviews. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6-7).
