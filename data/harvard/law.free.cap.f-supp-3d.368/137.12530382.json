INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, acting pro se, filed his complaint on February 20, 2018, asserting claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and for the torts of false imprisonment, battery, trespass to chattel, negligence, and negligence for failure to adequately train against the Pittsfield Police, the City of Pittsfield, the Massachusetts State Police, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and ten members of either the Massachusetts State Police or the Pittsfield Police (including two unnamed individuals), all sued in their individual and official capacities. With respect to all claims and all defendants, Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, both compensatory and punitive. Plaintiff's claims stem from his detention following a routine traffic stop on the evening of February 19, 2015 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In the course of his detention, illegal drugs were found in his vehicle and he was charged in state court with various drug-trafficking crimes. A superior court judge denied\n   Plaintiff's motion to suppress the evidence obtained the evening of the traffic stop. On interlocutory appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") reversed, ruling that officers did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity at the time they completed their investigation of civil traffic violations, did not have a legitimate basis to detain Plaintiff past that point, and all evidence seized thereafter must be suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

COMPLAINT AND PROPOSED AMENDED COMPLAINT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges that he was subjected to a traffic stop on the evening of February 19, 2015 during which, as the SJC later ruled, his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights were violated. Specifically, the SJC wrote that the state and local law enforcement officers present at the stop detained Plaintiff for longer than was required to complete the traffic stop.\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n    74 N.E.3d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff alleges the officers acted pursuant to \"a policy implemented by the Pittsfield Police Department and the Massachusetts state police [sic] to pull over suspects for minor traffic violations when their real purpose is to monitor felonious drug and other criminal activity\" and that the \"pretextual pullovers often involve searches that violate the constitution.\" (Dkt. No. 1, Compl., 2.) With respect to the individual defendants who are supervisors, and presumably were not present on February 19, 2015, Plaintiff states that he is suing them based on their failure to train. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Within the body of his complaint, Plaintiff does not identify which of the officers he has named as defendants are supervisors and which were present at the traffic stop. In the caption he identifies Colonel Kerry Gilpin (\"Gilpin\") as the Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, Major Michael Habel (\"Habel\") as a Troop Commander, and Lieutenant David Buell (\"Buell\") as Station Commander of the Lee Barracks of the Massachusetts State Police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   , the SJC provided a detailed description of the actions of Trooper Noah Pack (\"Pack\"), the officer who made the initial traffic stop and summarized the actions of two unnamed officers: a second Massachusetts State Trooper and a Pittsfield Police Officer.\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n    74 N.E.3d at 1285-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both unnamed officers arrived at the traffic stop after Pack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n    at 1286-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Pittsfield Police Officer, Steven Haecker (\"Haecker\") is described by the SJC as arriving on the scene after the routine traffic stop had been completed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n    at 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At that time, Plaintiff had been patfrisked, \"handcuffed and placed in the back of [a state police] cruiser,\" though he had not been arrested and his vehicle had not yet been searched.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The SJC stated the Pittsfield officer asked three different times for Plaintiff's consent to a search of his vehicle before, \"according to the officer, [Plaintiff] 'gave consent for it,' \" and\n   the vehicle was searched.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%201282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff supplements the facts set forth in\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   , disputing Haecker's statement and asserting he never consented to the search. He asserts the search was unconstitutional for that reason, as well as being unconstitutional for the reasons given by the SJC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Entwined with Plaintiff's opposition to the defendants' motions to dismiss is a motion for leave to file an amended complaint in which Plaintiff proposes to explicitly state certain facts he believes were reasonably inferred from his initial complaint. Specifically, Plaintiff takes issue with arguments that he has not adequately articulated a failure to train claim. He says a failure to train can reasonably be inferred from the fact that, as previously determined by the SJC, the officers involved in the stop behaved in a way that was inconsistent with clearly established law and a plausible reason for their behavior is that they did not know their actions were unconstitutional because they had not been adequately trained. Plaintiff goes on to assert that a failure to train officers to understand the constitutional requirements related to traffic stops, a routine part of any officer's job, implicates deliberate indifference to ensuring compliance with those constitutional requirements. He requests permission to explicitly state his theory, if necessary, in an amended complaint. Additionally, he asks permission to amend if it is necessary for him to more clearly state that he is asserting failure to train claims against the supervisory officers he has named, specifically Buell, Gilpin, and Habel of the Massachusetts State Police and Chief Wynn of the Pittsfield Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   V. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff filed a motion for extension of time to file his opposition and motion for leave to amend within twenty-one days of the filing of the first motion to dismiss and filed his motion for leave to amend within the expanded time allowed by Magistrate Judge Robertson. (Dkt. Nos. 42, 43, and 44.) Under, Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff could have simply filed an amended complaint as a matter of course. Instead, he sought leave of this court to file an amended complaint in the event the court determined Plaintiff's complaint failed \"to articulate a failure to train claim.\" (Dkt. No. 44, Pl.'s Opp., 18.) After reviewing the scope of Plaintiff's proposed amendments, the court concludes the proposed amendment is unnecessary because it would only repeat and clarify factual allegations sufficiently pleaded in the original complaint. However, as Plaintiff was free to file an amendment without leave of the court, Plaintiff is permitted, should he so desire, to file an amended complaint within twenty-one days of this order. Plaintiff's amended complaint must contain only language included in (1) the original complaint (Dkt. No. 1) or (2) in his opposition and motion for leave to file an amended complaint (Dkt. No. 44). Any new language may be stricken upon a defendant's motion. As the amendment will not add additional facts, the court will not further delay consideration of the defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motions to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    State Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three state troopers with titles identifying them as having supervisory responsibility, Buell, Gilpin, and Habel; the Massachusetts State Police; and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have moved for dismissal. Plaintiff asserts claims against Buell, Gilpin and Habel in their\n   individual capacities as well as their official capacities, Buell as Station Commander, Gilpin as Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, and Habel as a Troop Commander. With respect to the claims asserted against Buell, Gilpin, and Habel in their official capacities, the Massachusetts State Police and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, well-established case law provides that \"the Eleventh Amendment bars federal suits by citizens against the state or state agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Neill v. Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526106\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/41/#p47\">\n    210 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (1st Cir. 2000). This bar extends to the claims made against Buell, Gilpin, and Habel in their official capacities because Plaintiff seeks only damages, not injunctive relief, and \"[a] damages suit against an official in an official capacity is tantamount to a suit against the entity of which the official in an agent.\"\n   <em>\n    Burrell v.

They have all moved for dismissal, and the claims against each entity or individual are considered below. As an initial matter, the court considers the argument, asserted by all the municipal defendants, that Plaintiff has not alleged any action by a municipal actor that deprived him of his constitutional rights and resulted in harm to Plaintiff. Referring back to the SJC's\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   opinion, the municipal defendants assert the only constitutional violation identified by the SJC was Pack's decision not to allow Plaintiff to resume his journey once the tasks related to the routine traffic stop were completed. As that decision was made before Haecker, whose name does not appear in\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   , arrived on the scene, the municipal defendants assert Haecker was not involved in the deprivation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights identified by the SJC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, once he arrived on the scene, Haecker repeatedly asked Plaintiff, who was then sitting, handcuffed, in the back\n   seat of a state trooper's cruiser, for permission to search Plaintiff's vehicle and may have assisted with the ensuing search. Plaintiff's complaint supplements the facts set out in\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   in an important respect - he disputes that he ever consented to the search. He thus has alleged not only that the Pittsfield officer was present after the stop became unconstitutional, but also that he played a role in searching Plaintiff's vehicle without properly obtaining Plaintiff's consent. The allegations about that conduct are credited at this stage of the litigation. That conduct, taken as true at this point, would have constituted a further violation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights and the harm experienced by Plaintiff was largely a result of the search. The court, therefore, concludes Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that Haecker's conduct deprived him of constitutional rights and caused him harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   a.

The court finds the first prong is satisfied by the SJC's ruling, and turns to the second prong, which itself has two sub-parts. The first sub-part requires the plaintiff to \"identify either 'controlling\n   authority' or a 'consensus of cases of persuasive authority' sufficient to send a clear signal to a reasonable official that certain conduct falls short of the constitutional norm.\"\n   <em>\n    Alfano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184872\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/71/#p75\">\n    847 F.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Based on the cases cited in\n   <em>\n    Cordero\n   </em>\n   , the court concludes a reasonable officer would have known both that Plaintiff's rights were being violated during the period when Haecker was participating in the extended traffic stop and that a policy which encouraged officers to use routine traffic stops to investigate criminal conduct was likely to lead to constitutional violations. Qualified immunity thus does not protect Haecker and Wynn at this preliminary stage when the court must credit the alleged facts.\n   <em>\n    Maldonado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654768\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/263/#p268\">\n    568 F.3d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   VI. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court takes the following actions. The court DENIES as moot Plaintiff's Motion to Amend incorporated into his opposition to the various motions to dismiss (Dkt. No. 44). The Motion to Dismiss filed on behalf of Gilpin and Habel, the Massachusetts State Police, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Dkt. No. 37) is ALLOWED as to (1) all claims against the Massachusetts State Police and the Commonwealth, (2) the claims against Gilpin and Habel in their official capacities, and (3) the tort claims against Gilpin and Habel in their individual capacities; and is DENIED as to the \u00a7 1983 claims asserted against Gilpin and Habel in their individual capacities. The Motion to Dismiss filed on behalf of Buell (Dkt. No. 39) is ALLOWED as to (1) the claims against Buell in his official capacities and (2) the tort claims against him in his individual capacity; and is DENIED as to the \u00a7 1983 claims asserted against him in his individual capacity. The Motion to Dismiss filed on behalf of Haecker, Wynn, the PPD, and the City (Dkt. No. 24) is ALLOWED as to (1) all claims against the PPD as a separate entity, (2) the \u00a7 1983 claims asserted against Haecker and Wynn in their official capacities, and (3) the tort claims against the City, Haecker, and Wynn; and is DENIED as to the \u00a7 1983 claims against the City and Haecker and Wynn in their individual capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is so Ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In preparing his complaint, Plaintiff indicates he was assisted by an attorney; however, as he is proceeding without counsel, his complaint is treated as a pro se filing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The court did not previously discuss qualified immunity as neither Buell, Gilpin, nor Habel argued for its application in their motions to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
