Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs SourceAmerica and Lakeview Center, Inc., nonprofits that seek to enhance economic opportunities for the blind, request judicial review of the decision of an arbitration panel, convened by the Secretary of Education, that concluded the Department of the Army (\"Army\") violated the Randolph-Sheppard Act when the Army sought to award to plaintiffs a contract for services in Army dining facilities rather than to intervenor, the Kansas Department for Children and Families, a state agency that also seeks to enhance economic opportunities for the blind. This is a somewhat curious situation-it is, in essence, a dispute between organizations, both of which seek to advance the economic interests of the blind, as to which is entitled to a preference in the Army's contracting decision. And this curious situation is further compounded by the involved factual, legal, and procedural history of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issues now are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The motions have been fully briefed and argued and are now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Just as this case involves multiple organizations that seek to enhance economic opportunities available to the blind, it also involves multiple statutes that provide a preference for the blind in federal contracting decisions. In particular, the Randolph-Sheppard Act (\"RSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 107f, and the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (\"JWOD\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208501\">\n    41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 8506, both create a preference for the blind in federal contracting decisions, although they differ in important respects. A basic understanding of both statutes is necessary to understand the factual and procedural history of this case and the current dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Congress enacted the RSA to \"provid[e] blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarge[e] the economic opportunities of the blind, and stimulat[e] the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). To effectuate these aims, the RSA provides a \"priority ... to blind persons licensed by a State agency\" in \"the operation of vending facilities on Federal property.\" \u00a7 107(b). The RSA tasks the Secretary of Education (\"the Secretary\") with implementing this preference for blind vendors and promulgating regulations in accordance with the statute. \u00a7\u00a7 107(b), \u00a7 107a(a). Specifically, the RSA directs the Secretary to designate a state licensing agency in each state. \u00a7\u00a7 107a(a)(5), 107b. The designated state licensing agencies seek permits or contracts from federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities for the operation of vending facilities, and state licensing agencies that are awarded such permits or contracts then must issue licenses to blind vendors to operate the vending facilities. \u00a7 107a(a)(5), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The RSA also tasks the Secretary with reviewing federal departments', agencies', and instrumentalities' decisions to limit the placement or operation of vending facilities. \u00a7 107(b). Specifically, the RSA requires that \"[a]ny limitation on the placement or operation of a vending facility based on a finding that such placement or operation would adversely affect the interests of the United States shall be fully justified in writing to the Secretary, who shall determine whether such limitation is justified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This provision is referred to\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   as the \"RSA Review Requirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Anticipating that conflicts might arise between state licensing agencies and the federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities from which state licensing agencies seek permits and contracts, Congress provided for a process for the arbitration of such disputes.

The JWNDA, as relevant here, provides that the RSA and the JWOD are inapplicable in certain circumstances. This provision is referred to\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   is the \"JWNDA No-Poaching Provision.\" Specifically, the provision provides that the RSA \"does not apply to full food services, mess attendant services, or services supporting the operation of a military dining facility that, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, were services on the procurement list established under\" the JWOD.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 856(a)(1).

Plaintiff SourceAmerica is a creature of one of these schemes. Specifically, SourceAmerica is a JWOD central nonprofit agency. SourceAmerica works closely with plaintiff Lakeview Center, Inc. (\"Lakeview\"), a nonprofit agency that was designated by the Commission as the mandatory source of supply of certain services on the JWOD's procurement list. Intervenor, the Kansas Department for Children and Families (\"Kansas\"), is intimately familiar with the other primary statutory scheme in this case, the RSA, because of its status as an RSA state licensing agency. Defendant the Department of Education (\"DOE\"), through its Secretary, Betsy Devos, is charged with administering the RSA. The DOE, through its Secretary, convened the arbitration at issue here between the Army and Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With the statutory schemes outlined and the principal players identified, it is appropriate next to outline the pertinent factual and procedural history of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispute revolves around the procurement of a contract for services to be performed in the dining facilities at Fort Riley, an active military installation operated by the Army in Kansas. Pursuant to Army regulations, the Army contracts for two different\n   types of services in its dining facilities, Full Food Services (\"FFS\") and Dining Facility Attendant (\"DFA\") services. The Army defines FFS as \"a contract that covers those activities that comprise the full operation of an Army dining facility. It includes, but is not limited to, requisitioning, receiving, storing, preparing, and serving food ... [and] the performance of related administrative, custodial, and sanitation functions.\" Resp't's Pre-Arbitration Br. 4 (citing U.S. Dep't of Army, Reg. 30-22, Army Food Program, glossary (July 24, 2012) ), at Admin. R. 61. DFA services, according to Army regulations, are \"[t]hose activities required to perform janitorial and custodial duties within dining facilities. [They] include [ ] ... sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, trash removal, dishwashing, waxing, stripping, buffing, window washing, pot and pan cleaning, and other sanitation-related functions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2006, the Army awarded Kansas a FFS contract pursuant to the RSA. As required by the RSA, Kansas awarded the contract to a blind vendor. In 2011, the Army awarded Kansas a follow-on contract for the provision of FFS that was scheduled to expire in August 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Army subsequently determined that it no longer needed a FFS contract because Army soldiers formerly deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan could perform most of the duties, including cooking, at the Fort Riley dining facilities. However, because Army regulations prohibited soldiers from performing DFA services, the Army was required to contract out these services. Thus, the Army decided that it would procure a new contract, effective upon the conclusion of Kansas's contract, that covered only DFA services. Specifically, this new DFA contract would be for \"janitorial and custodial duties within dining facilities [and] [i]include[ ] ... cleaning, sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, trash removal, dishwashing, waxing, stripping, buffing, window washing, pot and pan cleaning and other sanitation related functions.\" Draft of Solicitation, Offer, and Award for DFA Services 7 (July 20, 2015), at Admin. R. 1002. Believing that a contract covering only DFA services did not constitute the operation of vending facilities, the Army concluded that the new contract would not be subject to the RSA's preference for blind vendors in the operation of vending facilities. Accordingly, the Army instead sought to procure a contract pursuant to the JWOD. To that end, the Commission proposed adding the Fort Riley DFA services to the JWOD's procurement list through publication in the Federal Register in July 2015. The Commission ultimately added the DFA services to the procurement list and formally designated Lakeview as the mandatory source of supply, effective February 2016. SourceAmerica facilitated the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In March 2015, the Army informed Kansas that, following the conclusion of Kansas's contract, the Army would purchase only DFA services through a new contract not subject to the RSA. Dissatisfied with this turn of events and convinced that the new DFA contract was subject to the RSA, Kansas, in May 2015, filed a request with the Secretary for arbitration with the Army. As required by the RSA, the Secretary,\n   in October 2016, convened a three-member panel to arbitrate the dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-1(b). Kansas also filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas and obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the Army from proceeding with the JWOD procurement during the pendency of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Kansas v.

Kan. 2016). The Army complied with the injunction and awarded a bridge contract to Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs also sought to intervene in the arbitration between Kansas and the Army based on plaintiffs' interest in the DFA contract at issue in the arbitration. To this end, plaintiffs sent two letters to the DOE requesting to intervene in the arbitration, dated April 8, 2016 and August 31, 2016. Plaintiffs did not receive a response to either letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In advance of the arbitration, the Army submitted an amended witness list that represented that it intended to call witnesses employed by plaintiffs and the Commission to support its position that the RSA does not apply to contracts for DFA services at military dining facilities. Specifically, the Army represented that it intended to call: (i) Barry Lineback, Director of Business Operations at the Commission; (ii) Joe Diaz, Vice President of Operations at SourceAmerica; and (iii) Gary Murphy, Representative at Lakeview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The arbitration hearing was held on January 10, 2017. Plaintiffs attended the hearing and sought to be heard through counsel, but the panel denied this request. The panel also refused to hear testimony proffered by the Army from three witnesses employed by plaintiffs and the Commission-the three witnesses the Army had previously informed the panel that it intended to call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following the hearing, the Army filed a request for a new hearing, citing fundamental unfairness in the proceeding and concerns about the panel's lack of impartiality. First, the Army argued that the panel chair improperly excluded relevant testimony from the three witnesses employed by plaintiffs and the Commission. Specifically, the Army argued that the exclusion of the witnesses was improper because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (i) the panel chair had previously found one of the witnesses essential for the Army's defense and ordered the DOE to fund his travel to the hearing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (ii) the panel did not raise any relevancy concerns when the Army provided the panel with a summary of the witnesses' testimony twenty days before the hearing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (iii) the panel chair asked an Army contract specialist about the Commission and JWOD preference but refused to hear evidence about the same from the Commission's and plaintiffs' employees, who had direct knowledge of these matters;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   (iv) the panel chair knew or should have known that SourceAmerica and Lakeview had successfully intervened in the related federal litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the Army argued that the panel chair acted inappropriately in riding to the airport with Kansas's counsel after requesting permission from the Army's counsel \"to ride to the airport with your enemy\" in the presence of the public and witnesses. Dep't of the Army's Post-Arbitration Br. &amp; Request for New Hearing 9 (Feb. 17, 2017), at Admin. R. 1590. Third, the Army argued that \"the Panel Chair and [Kansas's] Counsel made it known ... that they both had flights\" at the beginning of the hearing and repeatedly referenced these flights, thereby inappropriately \"set[ting] the tone ... that their schedules were more important than obtaining evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138703\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/192/1184/#p1187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Army questioned the panel's lack of impartiality because one of the panel members had represented a client and obtained a favorable outcome in an arbitration proceeding presided over by the panel chair at the same time that the two sat on an arbitration panel together in a separate proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The arbitration panel issued its decision on May 9, 2017. The two-member majority denied the Army's request for a new hearing and held (i) that the Fort Riley DFA contract was subject to the RSA's preference; (ii) that the Army violated the RSA when it failed to apply the RSA's preference to the Fort Riley DFA contract; (iii) that the Army violated the RSA Review Requirement when, without consulting the Secretary, it included services formerly performed by an RSA vendor in a new contract that would not be performed by an RSA vendor; and (iv) that the Army violated the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision when it worked with the Commission to place services formerly performed by an RSA vendor on the JWOD's procurement list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   General Carey, the panel's third member, dissented. He concluded that the RSA's preference did not apply to the Fort Riley DFA contract and that he would have granted the Army's request for a new hearing owing to concerns about the fairness of the proceeding. Following the panel's decision, the preliminary injunction issued by the district court in Kansas was dissolved, and the lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by the parties in February 2018.\n   <em>\n    Kansas Dep't for Children &amp; Families v.

Plaintiffs request vacation of the arbitration decision, a declaration that the Fort Riley DFA services are covered by the JWOD and not the RSA, and an injunction preventing defendants from implementing or enforcing the arbitration decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants respond that only a state licensing agency may seek judicial review of an arbitration panel decision, and thus argue that plaintiffs cannot seek judicial review here. With respect to the merits, however, defendants agree with plaintiffs that the Army did not violate the RSA and thus contend that the arbitration decision was incorrect in this respect. But defendants argue that plaintiffs' remaining challenges to the arbitration decision should be rejected. Specifically, defendants argue that the panel's alleged\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications should not be addressed because they are outside the scope of the complaint; that although the panel erred when it refused to allow plaintiffs to participate in the arbitration pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20555\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), the error was harmless; and that plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment rights were not violated. Finally, defendants argue that the equitable relief plaintiffs request is inappropriate and that the proper remedy is remand to the arbitration panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, intervenor argues that the arbitration decision was correct and is not contrary to either the RSA or the JWOD.

Here, by contrast, the RSA merely provides a preference for state licensing agencies in certain federal contracts and provides for state licensing agencies to seek arbitration of alleged violations of the RSA. As such, unlike the process for setting market orders in\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   , the RSA's contracting and arbitration processes are not \"a complex, technical undertaking.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n    at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, unlike the statute in\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   , the RSA does not create a complex regulatory scheme, the balance of which may be upset by the participation of parties other than state licensing agencies. Thus, the RSA does not create an inference that Congress intended to foreclose the availability of judicial review for all parties except state licensing agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable because the interests of those precluded from seeking judicial review in\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   -namely, consumers-were adequately represented by those authorized to seek judicial review, namely handlers. Specifically, consumers and handlers shared an interest in the promulgation of market orders that set lower minimum purchase prices. Although not relied on by the Supreme Court, these corresponding interests are nonetheless significant because they shed light on the ultimate inquiry, namely whether \"the congressional intent to preclude judicial review is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citation omitted). Congressional intent to preclude judicial review is less likely to be found-and thus greater evidence of it is needed-where preclusion would prevent parties likely to be impacted by agency action from having their interests represented during judicial review. Here, the interests of nonprofits like plaintiffs will not infrequently be at odds with the interests of state licensing agencies. As demonstrated by this case, the award of a contract pursuant to the RSA may eliminate opportunities otherwise available to nonprofits like plaintiffs and their members. Limiting the availability of judicial review to state licensing agencies does not adequately protect the interests of nonprofits like plaintiffs. Accordingly, defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Block\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive. Moreover, the Supreme Court has directed that even \"where substantial doubt about the congressional intent exists, the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is controlling.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199614\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/340/#p345\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants do not argue that Lakeview currently has a remedy. And, significantly, defendants do not even argue that Lakeview\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   have a remedy in the future; they argue only that Lakeview\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have a remedy in the future. The potential availability of a bid protest action at some future date is insufficient to protect Lakeview's interests. Lakeview has allegedly already suffered harm-namely, the denial of a contract that it was otherwise entitled to receive-and there is no guarantee that it will be able to seek redress for that harm through a bid protest action. As such, a bid protest action is not an adequate remedy that precludes judicial review pursuant to the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, plaintiffs have standing to seek judicial review of the RSA arbitration decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With respect to the merits, plaintiffs and defendants argue that the arbitration panel erroneously concluded that the Fort Riley DFA contract is subject to the RSA's preference.

It is not a contract for the operation of vending facilities; it is a contract for less than that. In particular, the Fort Riley DFA contract is for \"janitorial and custodial duties within\n   dining facilities [and] [i]include[s] ... cleaning, sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, trash removal, dishwashing, waxing, stripping, buffing, window washing, pot and pan cleaning and other sanitation related functions.\" Draft of Solicitation, Offer, and Award for DFA Services 7 (July 20, 2015), at Admin. R. 1002. These services constitute ancillary services in support of the operation of a vending facility and do not constitute the operation of a vending facility. The plain language of the RSA's preference, the meaning of \"operate\" in other parts of the RSA, and the regulations issued pursuant to the RSA make this clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The plain language of the RSA makes clear that its preference applies only where the vendor exercises control or management over the functioning of the vending facility as a whole and thus does not apply to the Fort Riley DFA contract. In particular, the RSA's preference applies only to \"the\n   <em>\n    operation\n   </em>\n   of vending facilities on Federal property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added). \"Operation\" requires control or management of the vending facilities. One cannot be said to operate something unless one is in some sense in charge; operation requires more than mere performance of assigned tasks. And, crucially, the RSA's preference applies to \"the operation\n   <em>\n    of vending facilities\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating that it applies only where the vendor will operate the vending facility. As such, the vendor must exercise control or management over the functioning of the vending facility as a whole, not merely exercise control or management over tasks performed in support of the facility's functioning. The Fort Riley DFA contract is limited to janitorial and custodial duties such as cleaning, trash removal, and dishwashing. These duties are discrete tasks performed in support of the facility's functioning; they do not involve control or management over the facility's functioning as a whole and thus do not constitute operation of the vending facility. The performance of such services is thus insufficient to trigger the RSA's preference, which applies by its terms only to \"the operation of vending facilities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The meaning of \"operate\" in other parts of the RSA supports this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   For it is well settled that \"identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    IBP, Inc. v.

The RSA uses \"operation\" and \"operated\" in a number of provisions other than those creating a preference for blind vendors, and some of these references make sense only if \"operate\" is interpreted to mean the blind vendor will exercise control or management over the functioning of the vending facility as a whole and not merely perform discrete tasks in support of the vending facility's functioning. For example, the RSA provides that \"no department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States shall undertake to acquire ... any building unless ... it is determined by the Secretary that ... such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for the location and operation of a vending facility by a blind person.\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107a(d)(1). And the RSA provides an exception to this requirement where, among other things, \"the operation of such a vending facility by a blind person would\n   be in proximate and substantial direct competition with\" an existing \"restaurant or other food facility.\" \u00a7 107a(d)(2). Furthermore, the RSA defines \"vending facility\" as \"automatic vending machines, cafeterias, snack bars, cart services, shelters, counters, and such other appropriate auxiliary equipment as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe as being necessary for the sale of articles or services ... and which may be operated by blind licensees.\" \u00a7 107e. These provisions only make sense if \"operation\" and \"operated\" are interpreted to mean the blind vendor exercises control or management over the functioning of the vending facility as a whole and not merely over ancillary services in support of the facility's functioning. Because identical words that appear in different places in a single statute should ordinarily be presumed to have the same meaning, the RSA's preference applies only where blind vendors exercise control or management over the functioning of the vending facility as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the regulations issued pursuant to the RSA support this interpretation because they imply that the blind vendor's operation of the vending facility must involve control or management over food-a requirement consistent with application of the RSA's preference only where vendors will exercise control or management over the functioning of the vending facility as a whole, not merely perform discrete tasks in support of the facility's functioning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the regulations provide that \"[p]riority in the operation of cafeterias by blind vendors ... shall be afforded when the Secretary determines ... that such operation can be provided at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality.\" 34 C.F.R. 395.33(a). The DOE thus contemplates that the blind vendor's \"operation\" of the cafeteria will involve food. Similarly, the regulations invite state licensing agencies to respond to federal contract solicitations \"[i]n order to establish the ability of blind vendors to operate a cafeteria in such manner as to provide food service at comparable cost and of comparable high quality as that available from other providers of cafeteria services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923137\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/21/#p34\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 395.33(b). The regulation's implication-that \"operation\" of dining facilities must involve control or management over food-is consistent with the plain language interpretation that the RSA's preference applies only where a vendor exercises control or management over the functioning of a dining facility as a whole and not merely where a vendor performs discrete tasks in support of the functioning of a dining facility. Because the Fort Riley DFA contract involves only sanitation and other janitorial services, it consists only of discrete tasks performed to support the functioning of Fort Riley dining facilities and does not entail control or management over the functioning of the dining facilities as a whole. As such, the RSA's preference does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The arbitration panel erroneously concluded that the RSA's preference applies to the Fort Riley DFA contract because it had an unduly broad view of the scope of the preference. Specifically, the panel majority concluded that the RSA's\n   preference applies \"[w]here the tasks to be performed by a contract for DFA services includes [sic] tasks that constitute an integral element of providing food service at a military cafeteria facility, or pertain to the operation of a cafeteria, or tasks that without which the cafeterias would not be able to function.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final Arbitration Decision 31 (May 9, 2017), at Admin. R. 1765. The panel reached this conclusion by relying on a regulation that did not purport to define the scope of the RSA's preference. Specifically, the panel relied on a regulation requiring the renegotiation of contracts \"pertaining to the operation of cafeterias on Federal property ... pursuant to the provisions of this section\" following the regulation's effective date.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20395.33\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The panel concluded, and the intervenor now argues, that this regulation establishes that the RSA's preference applies to any contract that pertains to the operation of vending facilities. It does not. Indeed, another regulation explicitly defines the scope of the RSA's preference; it states that \"[p]riority in the operation of cafeterias by blind vendors on Federal property shall be afforded when the Secretary determines ... that such operation can be provided at a reasonable cost, with food of a high quality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20395.33\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 395.33.

Indeed, the DOE agrees that the arbitration panel had an unduly broad view of the scope of the RSA's preference. Accordingly, the panel's interpretation of the scope of the RSA's preference is contrary to the statutory text and finds no support in the regulation on which the panel claims it relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Intervenor argues that a letter from the Secretary to a member of Congress supports its position and compels the conclusion that the RSA's preference applies to the Fort Riley DFA contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Intervenor is incorrect; the letter is neither entitled to deference\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor does it\n   represent the DOE's position with respect to this litigation or the Fort Riley DFA contract generally. The DOE has unequivocally stated its litigation position that the RSA does not apply to the Fort Riley DFA contract. And counsel for the DOE represents that the DOE, through its General Counsel, stated that, apart from this litigation, the DOE has not adopted any position regarding the application of the RSA to the Fort Riley DFA contract and that the Secretary's letter did not adopt any such position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Intervenor correctly notes that the Fourth Circuit has held that when both the RSA and the JWOD \"appear to apply,\" the RSA must control because it is the more specific statute.\n   <em>\n    NISH v.

However, that instruction is inapplicable here. The RSA does not \"appear to apply\" to the Fort Riley DFA contract. To the contrary, it is clear that the RSA's preference does not apply to the Fort Riley DFA contract. The contract is for sanitation and janitorial services. Such services are ancillary and support the operation of a vending facility; they do not constitute the operation of a vending facility, as is required for the RSA's preference to apply. Accordingly, the arbitration panel erroneously concluded that the Fort Riley DFA contract is subject to the RSA's preference, and the APA requires that this agency action be set aside because it is \"not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    Sauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718482\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/644/#p650\">\n    668 F.3d at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs and defendants argue that the arbitration decision was also contrary to the RSA because the panel erroneously concluded that the Army violated the RSA Review Requirement.

This argument fails. Under the Army's plan, the operation of Fort Riley dining facilities was to be limited in that the facilities would not be operated by a vendor at all. Removing a vendor entirely is the most basic limitation on the operation of vending facilities of all. Indeed, the\n   legislative history confirms this view. Specifically, the Senate Report explains that the RSA Review Requirement was added, in part, because \"[f]ederal agencies had not done all they could to insure the establishment\n   <em>\n    and the maintenance\n   </em>\n   of blind vendors on property under their control.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   S. Rep. No. 93-937, at 16 (1974) (emphasis added). This concern-that federal agencies were not doing all they could to ensure blind vendors continued to operate dining facilities-is directly implicated by the Army's decision to cease contracting with vendors for the operation of its dining facilities. Indeed, it is the exact scenario that motivated the Senate to add the review provision. As such, the arbitration panel correctly concluded that the Army's decision to discontinue the operation of its vending facilities by a vendor triggered the RSA Review Requirement. And the arbitration panel correctly concluded that the Army failed to comply with this requirement.

Pub. L. No. 109-364, \u00a7 856(a)(1).

Indeed, the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision is titled \"INAPPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN LAWS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 856(a). It thus cannot\n   fairly be read as expanding the scope of the RSA's preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Nor does the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision shed much light on the meaning of the RSA. \"[S]ubsequent legislative history is a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And, even if such intent could be inferred, the provision does not imply what that the panel seems to think it does. In particular, the JWNDA's instruction that the RSA \"does not apply to ... services supporting the operation of a military dining facility that... were services on the [JWOD's] procurement list\" at the time of the JWNDA's enactment does not imply that the RSA applies to all other services supporting the operation of a military dining facility. Pub. L. No. 109-364, \u00a7 856(a)(1). A contrary conclusion would fly in the face of the RSA's text, which expressly stipulates that the RSA's preference applies to \"the operation of vending facilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Moreover, the second part of the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision confirms this view. Specifically, the provision further provides that the JWOD \"does not apply at the prime contract level to any contract entered into by the [DOD] as of the date of the enactment of this Act with a State licensing agency under the [RSA] for the operation of a military dining facility.\" Pub. L. No. 109-364, \u00a7 856(a)(2). Surely neither the panel nor intervenor would argue that this implies that all contracts for the operation of a military dining facility other than those in effect under the RSA at the time of the JWNDA's enactment are subject to the JWOD. The ridiculousness of this conclusion-ridiculous because the RSA expressly applies in such circumstances-underscores that the other part of the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision too lacks the implication the arbitration panel apparently believed it contained. Rather, the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision does exactly what it says; it clarifies that services supporting the operation of military dining facilities that were on the JWOD's procurement list when the JWNDA was enacted are not subject to the RSA. It does not include or invite the inference that all such services not on the JWOD's procurement list at the time are covered by the RSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the JWNDA neither expanded the scope of the RSA's preference nor revealed the proper interpretation of the RSA, the arbitration panel erred when it found that the Army violated the JWNDA No-Poaching Provision when it worked with the Commission to put the Fort Riley DFA services on the procurement list. Accordingly, that finding must be set aside as \"not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the arbitration decision must also be set aside as \"not in accordance with law\" because it violates the JWOD.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the JWOD requires that the Fort Riley DFA services be obtained pursuant to that Act because the services were on the JWOD's procurement list.

The evidence consisted of testimony by two witnesses employed by plaintiffs and a third witness employed by the Commission. Indeed, the Army requested a new hearing in part because the panel refused to hear this evidence. The Army cannot now plausibly argue that the panel's failure to allow plaintiffs' participation was harmless given its prior position that the panel's exclusion of \"material\" testimony by plaintiffs' employees caused the Army to \"suffer[ ] prejudice when it was not allowed to offer their testimony at the hearing.\" Dep't of the Army's Post-Arbitration Br. &amp; Request for New Hearing 3-4 (Feb. 17, 2017), at Admin.

The error here likely negatively impacted public perception of the arbitration. The panel refused to allow plaintiffs to participate even though the arbitration had the potential to eliminate Lakeview's chances of receiving a contract for services for which it had been designated as the mandatory source of supply. This created a perception of unfairness that was magnified by the panel's refusal to allow one of Lakeview's employees to testify for the Army despite the panel's pre-arbitration determination that the witness was essential to the Army's defense and thus the DOE should pay his travel costs. The panel's error was thus likely to have a negative impact on public perception of the arbitration, including the proceeding's fairness. For these reasons, the harmless error rule-which the Fourth Circuit has explained \"is not ... a particularly onerous requirement\"-is clearly satisfied here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055352\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/244/#p253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055352\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/244/#p253\">\n    at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Therefore, the panel's finding that the Army violated the RSA when it failed to apply that preference must also be vacated as not in accordance with law.

Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957123\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/224/#p236\">\n     410 U.S. at 237\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957123\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/224/#p236\">\n     93 S.Ct. 810\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As such, plaintiffs' proposed amendment would be futile because \u00a7 557's prohibition on\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    communications does not apply to RSA arbitrations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Defendants, of course, argue first that the case should be dismissed without reaching the merits, but that argument fails for the reasons discussed\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Nor is remand necessary for the arbitration panel to determine whether plaintiffs are entitled to appear before the panel pursuant to \u00a7 555(b) or whether the \"the orderly conduct of public business\" does not permit this appearance.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20555\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). Certainly, the proper remedy for a \u00a7 555(b) violation ordinarily is remand for the agency to consider the requested appearance. However, remand would be fruitless here. There is nothing for the arbitration panel to decide on remand apart from whether plaintiffs should be permitted to make an appearance. Plaintiffs have attacked the arbitration panel's conclusions on the merits. These challenges have been resolved, many in plaintiffs' favor, and there is nothing more for the panel to decide. Remand to allow the panel to consider whether plaintiffs may appear before it when there are no outstanding merits issues for the panel to decide would be futile.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
