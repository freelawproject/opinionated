In response to this letter, on August 8, 2017, Defendants sent a reply letter to Plaintiff's counsel, stating that \" 'each aisle in the store [would be] both clear and accessible,' and that the store manager [would] review 'Dollar General's internal policies concerning store accessibility' at Store # 10652.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. Defendants also stated that \" '[s]tore employees were reminded to follow these internal stocking guidelines, which require that employees do not allow aisles to become blocked or obstructed during stocking and do not leave stocking carts unattended on the sales floor during operation hours.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Furthermore, Defendants advised Plaintiff's counsel that \"they would remove stocking carts kept in front of the store to improve curb cut accessibility.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about October 13, 2017, Plaintiff once again visited Store # 10652 and \"could not navigate her wheelchair around ... and encountered physical impediments and obstacles.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that she \"intends to patronize ... Store # 10652 if it becomes accessible [and that] ... Store # 10652 is the closest store to [her] that sells basic necessities, and is the only store of its kind that [she] can travel to independently, without relying on transportation.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court concludes that these allegations are sufficient, at least at this stage of the litigation, to find that Plaintiff has standing to bring her ADA claim, as well as her state-law claims. Specifically, she has stated facts, which accepted as true, demonstrate that she suffered past injury under the ADA in that, on two occasions in June and October 2017, the latter of which occurred after Defendants had assured her counsel that they would correct the problems that she had encountered on her June visit to Store # 10652, she was unable to navigate her wheelchair around the obstacles that Defendants' employees had placed in the aisles. Plaintiff's allegations also indicate that the same obstacles that she encountered on her June visit would continue and, in fact, allegedly did continue as evidenced by her October visit. Finally, Plaintiff has alleged that Store # 10652 is the closest store to her that sells basic necessities and that it is the only one to which she can travel independently. Such allegations are sufficient to demonstrate that she intends to return to Store # 10652 in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged just enough facts \"to allow the Court 'to draw the reasonable inference that' [she is] deterred from [returning to Store # 10652] because of [D]efendants' purported violations of the ADA\" and that such \"deterrence constitutes the requisite injury under Article III to allow plaintiff[ ] to proceed with this action.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Plaintiff, however, has alleged that, on two occasions in June 2017 and October 2017, she visited Store # 10652 and that, on both occasions, she encountered physical impediments that prevented her from being able to navigate through the store in her wheelchair. Furthermore, she asserts that, after her visit to Store # 10652 in June 2017, her counsel contacted Defendants' corporate office and notified Defendants of the accessibility barriers she had encountered; and Defendants' counsel responded and assured her that Defendants would resolve\n   the accessibility barriers. Apparently, however, despite this assurance, at least some of the impediments still existed when she returned to Store # 10652 in October 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Keeping in mind that, on a motion to dismiss, the court's function is to \"assess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Initial Pub.
