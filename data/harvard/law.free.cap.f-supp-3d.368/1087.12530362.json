(Mot., Dkt. 52). Plaintiffs request that the Court enjoin enforcement of Section 3(l)(2) of New Jersey Senate Bill 2465, which provides for third degree criminal penalties for distributing digital instructions that may be used to print firearms and firearm components from a three-dimensional printer. Having considered Plaintiffs' submissions and applicable law, the Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Defense Distributed is a Texas corporation that is \"committed to legally publishing information about firearms to the public domain on the internet by hosting computer files on its website and making them available to visitors for download.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Mot., Dkt. 52, at 3). Plaintiff Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization whose members seek to obtain the information published by Defense Distributed. (First Am. Compl., Dkt. 23, at 4). On June 29, 2018, Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with the United States Department of State concerning the publication of four categories of computer files related to firearms and subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the \"\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9). The Settlement Agreement would have permitted the publication of the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files on the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). On June 30, 2018, several States and the District of Columbia filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Settlement Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). The court granted the injunction the next day, and Defense Distributed ceased publishing the\n   <em>\n    Defense Distributed I\n   </em>\n   files on the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, New Jersey passed Senate Bill 2465. In relevant part, Section 3(l)(2) provides for third degree criminal penalties for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A person to distribute by any means, including the Internet, to a person in New Jersey who is not registered or licensed as a manufacturer as provided in chapter 58 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes, digital instructions in the form of computer-aided design files or other code or instructions stored and displayed in electronic format as a digital model that may be used to program a three-dimensional printer to manufacture or produce a firearm, firearm receiver, magazine, or firearm component.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (SB 2465 \u00a7 3(l)(2), Mot. Ex. B, Dkt. 52-1, at 15). The subsection further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As used in this subsection: \"three-dimensional printer\" means a computer or computer-driven machine or device capable of producing a three-dimensional object from a digital model; and \"distribute\" means to sell, or to manufacture, give, provide, lend, trade, mail, deliver, publish, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, display, share, advertise, offer, or make available via the Internet or by any other means, whether for pecuniary gain or not, and includes an agreement or attempt to distribute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 9, 2018, the day after Senate Bill 2465 was passed, Plaintiffs Defense Distributed and Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. filed the instant motion to enjoin enforcement of Section 3(l)(2), alleging that the law violates the First Amendment, Commerce Clause, and Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. (Dkt. 52, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The party moving for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") must establish that: \"(1) there is a substantial likelihood that the movant will prevail on the merits; (2) there is a substantial threat that irreparable harm will result if the injunction is not granted; (3) the threatened injury outweighs the threatened harm to the defendant; and (4) the granting of the [TRO] will not disserve the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Plaintiffs' argument relies on their novel construction of the statute-specifically, that the scope of the statute reaches the activities Plaintiffs enumerate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The statute has not yet been construed by the State of New Jersey.

Accordingly, the Court must construe Senate Bill 2465 to the extent necessary to determine whether Section 3(l)(2) is fairly susceptible to an interpretation that would avoid Plaintiffs' constitutional challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By its plain terms, Section 3(l)(2) reaches only the distribution of \"[1] digital instructions [2] in the form of computer-aided design files or other code or instructions stored and displayed in electronic format as a digital model [3] that may be used to program a three-dimensional printer to manufacture of produce a firearm, firearm receiver, magazine, or firearm component.\" (SB 2465 \u00a7 3(l)(2), Mot. Ex. B, Dkt. 52-1, at 15). Plaintiffs themselves construe the statute in a similarly limited way. (Mot., Dkt. 52, at 11) (the New Jersey law applies \"only to speech with this content: 'digital instructions' that 'may be used to program a three-dimensional printer to manufacture or produce a firearm, firearm receiver, magazine, or firearm component' \"). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs claim that they will suffer irreparable harm if Section 3(l)(2) is not enjoined because it will force them to \"halt a broad array of constitutionally protected current and ongoing activities under threat of the new law. These activities include[:]\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 public accessibility of files on the DEFCAD website;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 participating in trade shows where Plaintiffs are unable to determine the state of residence of attendees that may view their displays and other advertisements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 sending advertisements via email lists where Plaintiffs are unable to determine the states of residence of the recipients and have no way of knowing in which states recipients will be when they receive emails; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 participation in any national advertising network, radio communication, televised media, and other media that may advertise and promote Plaintiffs' respective missions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs appear to base their argument on the definition of \"distribute\" in Section 3(l)(2), which includes the terms \"advertise\" and \"offer.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12). But, Plaintiffs have failed to acknowledge with respect to irreparable harm what they acknowledge with respect to their First Amendment argument: that Section 3(l)(2) \"only\" applies to the actions specified in that section. Indeed, Section 3(l)(2) expressly cabins the provided definition of \"distribute\" to Section 3(l). (SB 2465 \u00a7 3(l), Mot. Ex. B, Dkt. 52-1, at 15). Thus, for the statute to reach the \"constitutionally protected current and ongoing activities\" Plaintiffs identify, Plaintiffs would have to be distributing, in the course of these activities, (1) digital instructions, (2) in the form of computer-aided design files or other code or instructions stored and displayed in electronic format as a digital model, (3) that may be used to program a three-dimensional printer to manufacture of produce a firearm, firearm receiver, magazine, or firearm component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that they are engaged in such distribution in the course of the activities they identify. Plaintiffs allege that Section 3(l)(2) would prevent them from showing \"displays\" at trade shows; sending \"advertisements\" via email lists; and promoting and advertising the Plaintiffs' \"missions\" on a variety of media channels. Nowhere do Plaintiffs specify the content of the \"speech\" made in these activities, and the Court is skeptical that displays at a trade show, advertisements, and media campaigning about the Plaintiffs' \"missions\" involve the distribution of \"digital instructions\" in the form of \"computer-aided design files or other code.\" Similarly, Plaintiffs do not specify the kinds of files allegedly accessible on the DEFCAD website, or what, if any, speech they entail. The Court therefore concludes that a fair reading of Section 3(l)(2) suggests that the section would not reach any\n   of the activities Plaintiffs claim the section would halt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that the irreparable harm Plaintiffs allege they will suffer is unlikely and speculative. \"Clearly demonstrating irreparable injury is a heavy burden to overcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Enterprise Int'l, Inc. v. Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366296\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/464/#p472\">\n    762 F.2d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (5th Cir. 1985). For a temporary injunction to issue, the plaintiff must demonstrate \"a\n   <em>\n    likelihood\n   </em>\n   that irreparable harm will occur,\" and \"speculative injury is not sufficient\" to make this showing.\n   <em>\n    Morrell v. City of Shreveport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631115\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/536/433/#p435\">\n    536 F. App'x 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Emerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9463189\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/203/#p262\">\n    270 F.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (5th Cir. 2001) ) (original emphasis). Under a fair reading of the statute, Section 3(l)(2) would not reach the \"constitutionally protected current and ongoing activities\" Plaintiffs identify. It therefore would not force Plaintiffs to cease those activities, and therefore would not cause Plaintiffs to suffer the irreparable injury of which they complain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Section 3(l)(2) is fairly susceptible to an interpretation under which that section would not reach, and therefore would not cause to be halted, the activities in which Plaintiffs are currently engaged, and which Plaintiffs allege are constitutionally protected. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to demonstrate that they will likely suffer irreparable harm in the TRO's absence. Because Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm for a TRO to issue, and have failed to do so, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief requested. Therefore, it follows that Section 3(l)(2) is fairly susceptible to an interpretation that would dispose of the instant matter without the need to resolve Plaintiffs federal constitutional challenges on the merits.
