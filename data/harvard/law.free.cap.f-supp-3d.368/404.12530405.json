However, plaintiff has yet to purchase either device because he reasonably fears prosecution under New York Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(1), which criminalizes the civilian possession of any \"electronic dart gun\" or \"electronic stun gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The penal law defines an \"electronic dart gun\" as \"any device designed primarily as a weapon, the purpose of which is to momentarily stun, knock out or paralyze a person by passing an electrical shock to such person by means of a dart or projectile,\" \u00a7 265.00(15-a), and an \"electronic stun gun\" as \"any device designed primarily as a weapon, the purpose of which is to stun, cause mental disorientation, knock out or paralyze a person by passing a high voltage electrical shock to such person,\" \u00a7 265.00(15-c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tasers and stun guns are just two examples of weapons that fall under the umbrella of \"conducted electrical weapons\" or \"electronic control devices.\" The sparse legislative history associated with New York's ban on these particular electric weapons reveals that each was added to the laundry list of devices criminalized by \u00a7 265.01 after their improper use caught the attention of state legislators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1976, state officials amended \u00a7 265.01 to prohibit the possession of \"electronic dart guns,\" including the eponymous taser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although these were relatively novel devices at the time, lawmakers expressed concern that tasers had \"already been used in holdups and robberies.\" The bill jacket for the amendment shows that the New York State Police supported the change, positing that \"such weapon employed unsuspectingly on a police officer\" would pose a dangerous situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1990, state officials amended the law again to add stun guns to the list. This time, lawmakers justified the change by noting that these devices \"have shown up across the State in a variety of confrontational circumstances.\" In particular, though, the written materials repeatedly reference an incident in 1988 in which police arrested a county worker after he \"shocked two fellow female co-workers with an electrical stun gun.\" As before, various law enforcement organizations threw their support behind the expansion of the law, with at least one group insisting there was \"no rational basis for permitting the possession of a stun gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Avitabile disagrees. Plaintiff is a law-abiding citizen who has never been diagnosed with any form of mental illness. Although he owns three rifles and a shotgun, and would use these firearms to defend himself if it ever became \"absolutely necessary,\" plaintiff thinks that lethal force should be a last resort. Instead, plaintiff would like to arm himself with a non-lethal weapon, and believes a taser is the most effective choice. But doing so would be unlawful under \u00a7 265.01(1), even if he just kept the weapon in his own home for self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The entry of summary judgment is warranted when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The State argues that tasers and stun guns are not entitled to protection under the Second Amendment. Even if they were, defendant argues the blanket ban should nevertheless be upheld because rifles, handguns, shotguns, and even pepper spray are \"adequate alternatives\" to a taser or stun gun when it comes to civilian self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Second Amendment provides: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Avitabile solicited sales data from several electric arms companies, many of which were unwilling to provide it. However, based on the limited data available, the parties agree there are at least 300,000 tasers and 4,478,330 stun guns owned by private citizens across the United States. Plaintiff contends these stipulated figures are more than sufficient to establish that tasers and stun guns are a class of bearable arms that are in \"common use\" by private citizens across the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The State's position on this issue is more muddled. In its cross-motion and opposition, defendant suggests that only stun guns, and not tasers, are in \"common use.\" Defendant analogizes the smaller number of tasers (300,000) to the relatively small number of civilian-owned machine guns that were sold prior to the 1986 federal ban on those weapons. As defendant points out, the Fifth Circuit has suggested that the number of those particular weapons believed to exist (176,000) would probably be insufficient to establish their \"common use.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923993\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/436/#p449\">\n    827 F.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to undertake the analysis given the dearth of record evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Avitabile rejects the premise implicit the State's assertion: that tasers and stun guns are separable \"classes\" of arms for purposes of the Second Amendment. Plaintiff argues that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   did not try to parse out which particular types of handguns (e.g., revolvers or semi-automatics) were entitled to constitutional protection but rather spoke more broadly about handguns as a \"class\" of bearable arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Avitabile argues the same sort of conclusion is appropriate here. Plaintiff emphasizes that tasers and stun guns have the same basic functionality; that is, both utilize an electric charge to incapacitate an attacker. In fact, plaintiff argues, a taser operated in \"drive-stun\" mode is functionally identical to a stun gun. According to plaintiff, these weapons are better understood as a single class of \"electric arms\" that, taken together, number in the millions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In reply to this argument, the State reiterates its assertion that the 300,000 figure for tasers is insufficient to establish \"common use\" because that number almost certainly represents the entire domestic market. According to defendant, Axon (formerly TASER) enjoys a virtual monopoly on the domestic sale of tasers. However, defendant goes on to indicate that it is willing to concede for purposes of this motion practice that tasers\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   stun guns are both in \"common use.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even if the State were to refuse to make such a concession, Avitabile would\n   still have the better of this argument. Whether or not the parties' agreed-upon figure for tasers is closer to the ceiling or the floor when it comes to the number of electronic dart guns sold in this country, at least one other court has found the \"common use\" requirement satisfied with a substantially lower figure.\n   <em>\n    Maloney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528829\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/222/#p232\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d at 237-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding same as to metal and wood nunchakus where at least 64,890 were sold to private citizens).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   And there has been no meaningful contrary evidentiary showing by the State, which ultimately \"bears the burden of rebutting the 'prima facie presumption of Second Amendment protection' that extends to all bearable arms.\"\n   <em>\n    Maloney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528829\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/222/#p232\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p582\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   257 n.73).

Defendant also asserts that pepper spray, sometimes called self-defense spray, is an alternative weapon adequate for non-lethal self-defense. According to defendant, the availability of these and other weapons means that the taser and stun gun ban is not a \"substantial burden\" on Avitabile's Second Amendment right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   But the State's reading of this \"adequate alternative\" language is far too broad and, if accepted, would lead to absurd results. To begin with, the Second Circuit has used this language in the context of regulations imposed on some subset of arms (e.g., assault weapons), some restriction on functionality (e.g., magazine size), or some restriction on use outside the home (e.g., access to firing ranges), not to justify a more sweeping, class-wide ban on possession like the one at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For instance, in\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

This was so, the court held, because the law at issue left the defendant \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   alternative means of doing so, let alone\n   <em>\n    adequate\n   </em>\n   alternatives.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517603\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/228/#p234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The same could be said here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statewide ban on civilian possession of tasers and stun guns is a functional ban on the entire class of these arms, not a small subset, and leaves open no permissible avenue for their possession or use. The ban thus leaves Avitabile no means of possessing these weapons for self-defense, even in his own home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The fact that other weapons exist in the world, and that those weapons might conceivably\n   be used for self-defense, does not shield the State's blanket ban on these constitutionally protected arms from at least some measure of heightened scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p582\">\n    554 U.S. at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p582\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , long guns) is allowed.\");\n   <em>\n    Caetano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594862\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1027/#p1033\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., concurring) (\"[T]he right to bear other weapons is 'no answer' to a ban on the possession of protected arms.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Indeed, the State's analogy to pepper spray as being an \"adequate alternative\" to a taser or a stun gun is a particularly poor one. The parties have offered competing expert opinions on the safety and efficacy of pepper spray, which is subject to extensive regulation in the State of New York. Among other things, state law dictates the active ingredient (oleoresin capsicum), the strength (no more than 0.7 percent by weight total capsaicinoids), and the total weight (not to exceed 0.75 ounce). N.Y. COMP. CODES R. &amp; REGS. tit. 10, \u00a7 54.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As Avitabile points out, though, law enforcement enjoys access to a much stronger formulation of pepper spray than civilians do. Thus, the State's argument that pepper spray is an \"adequate alternative\" for self-defense purposes might make some sense if plaintiff in this case were seeking to possess and use law enforcement-strength pepper spray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Assuming, arguendo, that self-defense sprays were entitled to Second Amendment protection, the State might convincingly argue that the challenged restrictions left open \"adequate alternatives\"-the legislature did not ban the whole class of weapons (i.e., self-defense sprays) but rather imposed reasonable restrictions on their civilian use.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Decastro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892473\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/160/\">\n    682 F.3d at 167-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analogizing permissible Second Amendment restrictions to reasonable \"time, place and manner restrictions\" under the First Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Of course, that is not the case here. And worse yet, adopting the State's broad reading of the \"adequate alternative\" language might justify any number of bizarre restrictions. For instance, a state might conceivably ban all (or almost all) firearms but handguns, since the \"quintessential self-defense\" weapon is surely a constitutionally \"adequate alternative\" for that purpose, even for the citizen who would prefer not to use deadly force.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caetano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594862\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1027/#p1033\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., concurring) (\"Countless people may have reservations about using deadly force, whether for moral, religious, or emotional reasons-or simply out of fear of killing the wrong person.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Or as the State suggests in its reply memorandum, the baseball bat Avitabile already owns certainly counts as the type of thing a determined person could pick up and use for self-defense. What other self-defense weapons could be banned by pointing to baseball bats as a so-called \"adequate alternative\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, the Court declines to conclude that the \"adequate alternative\" language sweeps so broadly as to mean that a state can permissibly enact what amounts to a total ban on an entire class of weapons that are in common use for the lawful purpose of self-defense simply because various alternative items that might also be useful for that purpose could still be obtained and kept in the home. Accordingly, some form of heightened scrutiny must apply to the total ban at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Application of Scrutiny\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On this final step, Avitabile renews his argument that strict scrutiny should apply because \u00a7 265.01(1) substantially burdens the core right of a law-abiding citizen to\n   acquire and possess a taser or stun gun for self-defense in his own home. As plaintiff points out, the State does not appear to have engaged with his strict scrutiny argument at all, instead opting to discuss only intermediate scrutiny, even in its reply memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This is a difficult question. The comprehensive reach of the ban certainly suggests that strict scrutiny might be warranted. After all, \"[b]oth\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   suggest that broadly prohibitory laws restricting the core Second Amendment right-like the handgun bans at issue in those cases, which prohibited handgun possession even in the home-are categorically unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Ezell v.

A law-abiding citizen like Avitabile, if prevented from buying a taser or stun gun, would buy a handgun for protection in the home. This would result in more handguns in the home. A handgun in the home would be much more likely to result in injury or death than a taser or a stun gun. Fewer handguns in the home would result in fewer injuries or deaths. More handguns in circulation increase the likelihood of criminal activity causing injury or death, both in the home and out of it.
