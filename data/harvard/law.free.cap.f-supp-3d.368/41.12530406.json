INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Climate change, and humanity's ability to combat it, are increasingly prominent topics of public discourse. This case concerns the attention the government must give climate change when taking action that may increase its effects. Two non-profit organizations, WildEarth Guardians (\"WildEarth\") and Physicians for Social Responsibility (together, \"Plaintiffs\") assert that the United States Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") violated federal law by not sufficiently considering climate change when authorizing oil and gas leasing on federal land in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. Those states and two industry organizations with interests in the Leases-the Western Energy Alliance and Petroleum Association of Wyoming (\"Western Alliance\"), and the American Petroleum Association of Wyoming (\"American Petroleum\")-(together with BLM, \"Defendants\") have intervened as defendants. Another organization, the New York University School of Law's Institute for Policy Integrity (the \"Institute\"), seeks to file an amicus curiae brief in support of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and the Institute's motion to file an amicus brief. Having reviewed the record and the relevant law, the Court concludes that-withholding judgment on whether BLM's leasing decisions were correct-BLM did not sufficiently consider climate change when making those decisions. BLM summarized the potential on-the-ground impacts of climate change in the state, the region, and across the country. It failed, however, to provide the information necessary for the public and agency decisionmakers to understand the degree to which the leasing decisions at issue would contribute to those impacts. In short, BLM did not adequately quantify the climate change impacts of oil and gas leasing. Thus, for the reasons explained more thoroughly below, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion in part, denies Defendants' motions, and denies the Institute's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court will briefly summarize the relevant portions of the EAs and then discuss them in greater detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The EAs discuss climate change on a conceptual level. They summarize Wyoming's current climate, explain the mechanics of climate change, acknowledge that oil and gas drilling contributes to climate change, and predict the impact of climate change on the state's climate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR3411-3415; AR13961-63; AR19502-06; AR28195. Certain EAs also reference various climate change reports. For instance, several EAs incorporate reports issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\"IPCC\") discussing the impact of GHG emissions on climate change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR3412; AR13962; AR19504; AR34663.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The EAs also include more specific GHG emissions assessments, which are slightly different across the challenged EAs but are similarly detailed. The EAs acknowledge that oil and gas drilling on leased parcels will emit GHGs, and they describe the sources of those emissions, but they do not attempt to quantify and project the GHG emissions likely to result from a given lease sale. For instance, certain EAs acknowledge that each potential oil or gas well on the leased parcels could emit approximately 0.00059 metric tons of carbon dioxide,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   but they state that \"[t]he [total] amount of increased emissions cannot be quantified at this time since it is unknown how many wells might be drilled, the types of equipment needed if a well were to be completed successfully ... or what technologies may be employed by a given company for drilling any new wells.\" AR13989;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR13754; AR28220; AR55015-16. Likewise, certain EAs incorporate a report quantifying and projecting consumption-based GHG emissions in Wyoming through 2020-the \"Wyoming GHG Inventory\"-but the EAs do not attempt to apply those projections to particular lease sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR3412; AR19503.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although the EAs acknowledge that GHG emissions may contribute to climate change, they conclude that \"[t]he inconsistency in results of scientific models used to predict climate change at the global scale coupled with the lack of scientific models designed to predict climate change on regional or local scales, limits the ability to quantify potential future impacts of decisions made at this level.\" AR3435;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR28219. Ultimately, the EAs conclude that \"[w]hen compared to total national or global emissions, the amount [of GHG emissions] released as a result of potential production from the proposed lease tracts would not have a measurable effect,\" AR13989, or would represent only an \"incremental contribution to the total regional and global GHG emission levels.\" AR55023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the EAs emphasize that the leasing stage is a preliminary step towards oil and gas drilling, but that specific drilling projects are not guaranteed to move forward simply because a given lease was sold. For instance, the EAs state that \"[t]he offering and subsequent issuance of\n   oil and gas leases is strictly an administrative action, which, in and of itself, does not cause or directly result in any surface disturbance.\" AR3382;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR13718; AR19458; AR54983. The EAs also state that \"BLM cannot determine at the leasing stage whether or not a nominated parcel will actually be leased, or if it is leased, whether or not the lease would be explored or developed.\" AR3382;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR13718; AR19458-59. They note that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   BLM cannot determine exactly where a well or wells may be drilled or what technology that [sic] may be used to drill, complete and produce wells, so the impacts listed [in the EA] are more generic, rather than site-specific. Additional NEPA and technical engineering analysis would be conducted prior to approval of an APD to ensure that the proposal is compliant with all Federal and/or state rules and regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   AR3426;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR13744; AR19518; AR55008. Accordingly, the EAs conclude that the \"filing of an [APD] may be the first useful point at which a site-specific environmental appraisal [of a lease parcel] can be undertaken.\" AR3382;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR13718; AR19458; AR28179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In summary, according to Plaintiffs, NEPA required BLM to conduct a more piercing consideration of the consequences of oil and gas drilling before it authorized the Wyoming Lease Sales. More specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the EAs and FONSIs issued in conjunction with the Wyoming Lease Sales violated NEPA because BLM failed to take a \"hard look\" at GHG emissions and the climate change impact of those emissions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl; Pls. Mem. at 2. Plaintiffs ask the Court to (1) declare that the leasing authorizations violated NEPA; (2) vacate the leases; and (3) enjoin BLM from approving APDs for those leases until new NEPA analyses have been conducted. Am. Compl. at 39-40. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge one of the lease sales, and that BLM's environmental analyses were sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.

Mem.; BLM Mem.; API Mem.; Western Alliance Mem.; States Mem. As explained below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action, and that BLM did not properly discharge its NEPA obligations. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in part and denies Defendants' motions for summary judgment.

As Plaintiffs note, Pls. Mem. at 16, and as some of the EAs at issue make clear, the Wyoming Leases do not contain stipulations preventing oil and gas drilling without further post-lease approval by BLM. Moreover, BLM's fluid minerals planning handbook states that \"[b]y law, [direct, indirect and cumulative] impacts must be analyzed before the agency makes an irreversible commitment,\" which, for oil and gas drilling, \"occurs at the point of lease issuance.\" AR55446 (quoting the BLM Handbook H-1624-1). Finally, Defendants themselves concede that once the\n   Wyoming Leases were issued, BLM could no longer prevent the lease-holders from exploring the parcels and drilling for oil and gas, producing GHG emissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   States Suppl.
