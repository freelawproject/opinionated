No. 53) and exclude all evidence proffered by the Government at the penalty phase related to those aggravators. Specifically, Fackrell challenges the following aggravating factors: (a) heinous, cruel, or depraved manner of committing the offense,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(6) ; (b) substantial planning and premeditation,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3592(c)(9) ; (c) vulnerability of the victim,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3592(c)(11) ; and (d) lack of remorse and membership in a racist gang-two sub-factors of future dangerousness.

In the Government's Amended Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty (Doc.

No. 215, at 13. While the court is unconvinced that the environment of the instant killing is insufficiently limiting from other murders, the fact that Johns died in a prison cell outside the view of the guards and without access to a weapon does not make him a vulnerable victim according to the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Government contends that Johns constitutes a vulnerable victim because of \"the helplessness the environment and [Fackrell's] actions placed on him.\" Doc. No. 287, at 8. Section 3592(c)(11), however, limits vulnerability to \"old age, youth, or infirmity.\" Johns's external environment and Fackrell's alleged placement of him in that environment clearly do not relate to old age or youth, and the ordinary meaning of infirmity cannot be stretched in such a manner to encompass the Government's allegations.

The Fifth Circuit found this distinction significant and, accordingly, upheld the admission of such evidence, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A reasonable juror could conclude that membership in [the AB] is relevant to future dangerousness.\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   established that a state may not employ a defendant's abstract beliefs at a sentencing hearing when those beliefs are not relevant to the issue being tried. In this case, however, Texas did not violate [the defendant]'s First Amendment rights because it introduced relevant evidence of his future dangerousness. The fact that [the defendant] was within his rights in joining the gang does not bar the use of relevant evidence at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 498.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the Government states that it intends to offer proof of \"the violent nature of SAC as well as Fackrell's participation in violent gang-related act(s) such as the murder of [Johns], which was committed because Johns, a SAC member, failed to comply with the orders of superior SAC members.\" Doc. No. 287, at 7. This evidence falls squarely within that approved by\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fuller\n   </em>\n   . Not only is it directly relevant to the death of Johns, but it tends to show Fackrell's potential for future dangerousness, as the Government submits that SAC endorses the killing of members perceived to be disobedient, among other unlawful and violent acts. Accordingly, although the First Amendment places restrictions on admissible evidence concerning Fackrell's membership in SAC, it does not require the court to strike this sub-factor from the Government's notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Consistent with the foregoing analysis, Fackrell's Motion to Strike Unconstitutional Aggravating Factors and Allegations from Government's Intent to Seek Death\n   (Doc. No. 215) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Government contends that Defendants stabbed Johns more than sixty times.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
