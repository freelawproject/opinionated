Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 8, 2014, plaintiff submitted applications for DIB and SSI, asserting disability due to lumbar sacral radiculopathy, high blood pressure, and bulging disc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSA Administrative Record (Dkt. No. 9) (hereinafter \"R. ___\"), at 196, 200, 224. Both claims were denied on September 30, 2014. (R. 136.) On November 7, 2014, plaintiff requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) (R. 144, 147), which took place on April 25, 2016, before ALJ Janet M. McEneaney. (R. 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a written decision dated October 25, 2016 (Decision), the ALJ determined that plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the Act. (R. 13-24.) On November 1, 2016, plaintiff requested Appeals Council review. (R. 195.) The Appeals Council denied that request on November 14, 2017 (R. 1), making the ALJ's determination final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Personal Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was born on August 9, 1960. (R. 196.) She went to school through ninth grade, in New York. (R. 99.) For most of her adult life plaintiff did not work outside the home, instead staying home to raise her five children. (R. 197.) Plaintiff joined the workforce in 2007 and worked in retail sales from 2007 to 2011. (R. 101, 197.) She was laid off in 2012. (R. 197.) For approximately two months in 2013, plaintiff worked in cleaning and maintenance as a seasonal parks worker. (R. 101.) She then worked for a few weeks in January 2014 cleaning bathrooms, but stopped working in February 2014 when she started \"feeling the pain.\" (R. 101, 197.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As of April 20, 2015 (when plaintiff testified in front of the ALJ), she lived in an apartment with three of her five adult children, and two of her grandchildren, ages three and four. (R. 96-98.) She took care of her grandchildren - with their mother present - approximately twice a week, watching TV with them, reading them books, and feeding them, but did not take them outside. (R. 97-99, 115.) According to a Function Report that plaintiff completed on July 28, 2014, her daily activities included basic hygiene and personal care, eating, going to appointments if she had them, taking her medication, and going to bed. (R. 233.) She wrote that she woke up in chronic pain in the middle of the night, and that while she \"used to walk blocks,\" she could no longer \"even walk a block.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, she stated that she could dress, bathe, and care for her hair slowly, and had no problem shaving, feeding herself, or using the toilet. (R. 233-34.) She also noted that she prepared meals with the help of her adult daughter. (R. 235.) Plaintiff wrote that she needed help with household chores, except for sweeping, which she could do \"little by little.\" (R. 235.) She wrote that she could go out alone and could use public transportation, but did not shop or do any social activities; however, she listed the \"store\" as a place she went on a regular basis. (R. 235, 237.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Turning to her functional limitations, plaintiff reported that she could lift \"maybe 5, 10? pounds,\" could stand \"no\n   more than 10 to 15 minutes,\" could walk one block before needing to sit down, could sit \"no more than 45 minutes,\" and could not climb stairs, kneel, or squat. (R. 237-38.) She wrote that she could reach (depending on \"how high\"), could use her hands, and had no issues seeing, hearing, or talking. (R. 238.) She reported that she needed a cane and a back brace\"always[s].\" (R. 238-39.) She also wrote that she was talking Mapap and Percocet for her pain, and that Percocet caused drowsiness and numbness. (R. 241-42.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PLAINTIFF'S MEDICAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

United Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 25, 2014, physical medicine and rehabilitation physician Aleksandr Levin, M.D. saw plaintiff for an initial evaluation. (R. 387.) Plaintiff complained of dizziness, pain in her upper extremity and lower back, numbness, and paresthesia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Levin noted that the pain was exacerbated by bending down, pulling, lifting, prolonged sitting, weather changes, and \"ambulation \u00d7 2 blocks,\" but not by going up or down stairs, squatting, walking, grasping, pushing, carrying heavy objects, prolonged standing, laying down, or getting up from a sitting position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Levin performed a physical examination, assessed plaintiff with lumbosacral sprain /strain and lumbar radiculitis, and prescribed physical therapy. (R. 389.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A May 16, 2014 letter from United Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation \"[t]o whom this may [c]oncern\" reported that plaintiff was \"a patient at our facility\" who was seeing Dr. Levin for pain management and was \"receiving Physical Therapy.\" (R. 304.) The letter stated that plaintiff had chronic back pain, and due to \"her diagnosis of Lumbar Sacral Radiculopathy she [was] required to be in physical therapy at least three times a week.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff underwent physical therapy at United Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation throughout 2014, 2015, and 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 352-84.) The notes of those sessions are often unintelligible, but they do reflect that plaintiff consistently reported back, hip, hand and knee pain at levels between 5/10 and 9/10. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 352, 357, 363, 370, 376.) She also reported throughout this period that bending, lifting, sitting, stairs, and dressing exacerbated her pain. (R. 360, 366, 373, 378.) Over the same period, Dr. Levin continued to prescribe Percocet (R. 319); in March 2015, he added Voltaren. (R. 284.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 21, 2016, Dr. Levin saw plaintiff for a follow-up examination. Plaintiff complained of headache, lower back pain, and knee pain. (R. 385.) A physical examination revealed decreased ranges of motion and tenderness in the neck and lumbar spine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Levin diagnosed \"cervical radiculitis\" and prescribed additional physical therapy. (R. 385-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Neighborhood &amp; Family Health Center\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Family nurse practitioner Meredith Gentes, FNP, wrote a letter \"[t]o whom it\n   may concern,\" dated July 31, 2014, on the letterhead of Neighborhood &amp; Family Health Center (N &amp; FHC) (R. 307), reporting that plaintiff was \"a patient at our clinic\" and had \"chronic lower back pain with lower thoracic disc disease and disc bulging.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nurse Gentes wrote that plaintiff was \"unable to sit for long periods, stand for longer than 15 minutes, walk upstairs, or bend over without severe back pain\" and would be \"re-evaluated in 3 months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Family nurse practitioner Carly Skinner, FNP-BC confirmed in a letter dated November 25, 2014, also on the letterhead of N &amp; FHC, that plaintiff remained \"a patient at our clinic.\" (R. 300.) Nurse Skinner wrote that plaintiff had \"many medical comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, vitamin D deficiency, and chronic low back pain with reported lower thoracic disc disease at the L3-L4 disc, L4-L5 disc, and L5-S1 disc.\" (R. 300.) On exam, plaintiff \"exhibit[ed] lower back pain\" and could not \"stand for long periods of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nurse Skinner added that plaintiff was \"receiving pain medications through a pain specialist and sees a physical therapist to help with daily functions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There are no other documents from N &amp; FHC in the record of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Narco Freedom, Inc.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to plaintiff, she saw three medical professionals at Narco Freedom, Inc. (Narco Freedom) during the relevant period: internist Ricardo O. Dunner, M.D./M.P.H., pediatrician Jennifer Fisher, M.D., and \"Dr. Meredith Gentes,\" presumably meaning Nurse Gentes. (R. 228.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The record contains no treatment notes from Dr. Dunner or Dr. Fisher. However, pharmacy records and plaintiff's own statements evidence the treatment that they provided. Plaintiff saw Dr. Dunner beginning in 2013 for \"exams and medications.\" (R. 261.) She saw him again in August 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At various points in 2015, he prescribed plaintiff Nifedipine, Pravastatin Sodium, Vitamin D, Aspirin, and Bacitracin. (R. 284-85.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Dr. Dunner signed a Medical Report concerning plaintiff, which is discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in section II(C)(1). Plaintiff saw Dr. Fisher beginning in 2012, for \"exams and prescription pills,\" and saw her again in September 2014. (R. 261.) Pharmacy records reflect that Dr. Fisher prescribed plaintiff Benadryl in December 2014. (R. 284.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(R. 291.) However, for each of those discs, the \"visualized nerve roots reveal[ed] no evidence of structural abnormality,\" and the \"residual neuroforamen\" were \"adequate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    April 25, 2014\n   </em>\n   : A Lower Extremity Physiologic Study was normal.

The hearing was held \"for the Jersey City Hearing Office,\" though ALJ McEneaney presided by video from Brooklyn, and plaintiff appeared, with counsel, in the Bronx. (R. 94.) Also present were vocational expert (VE) Marian R. Marracco and hearing reporter Mr. Ross.

Plaintiff's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff's attorney began the hearing by arguing that plaintiff had a \"combination of impairments that we think are severe,\" including \"back pain, knee pain, hip pain, high blood pressure, shoulder and carpal tunnel syndrome.\" (R. 95.) He then argued that \"she could meet listing 1.04\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), or - alternatively - would have an RFC limited to \"sedentary at most which at her age over 50, she could grid favorably.\" (R. 95-96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff testified that her medical conditions included \"chronic pain,\" that her knees \"rip,\" and that she had arthritis in her right side and hip, high blood pressure, and carpal tunnel syndrome. (R. 102-03.) She testified that the medication she took for carpal tunnel syndrome helped, and that the medication she took for pain also helped, reducing her pain to \"mild\" (R. 103-04), but making her sleepy and dizzy. (R. 104.) Plaintiff said that she could walk two blocks before stopping to sit (or, if she had her walker, to rest in her walker). (R. 104-05.) She testified that Dr. Levin prescribed a walker, but that most days, she used a cane instead. (R. 105.) She stated that she needed the cane to get up and down and for balancing. (R 106.) She testified that she could \"stand ten minutes\" before having to sit down, and could sit \"30 to 40 minutes\" before having to stand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She could \"lift maybe ten pounds,\" could reach up to her height, could reach out in front of her, and could climb \"like four or five steps\" with her cane. (R. 107-08.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Concerning daily activities, plaintiff testified that she got dressed by herself, cooked and went shopping \"sometimes,\" did not do laundry, cleaned on \"good days,\" and was able to shower by herself. (R. 109-10.) She said she took the bus to appointments but never went out with friends or to a restaurant or a movie. (R. 110.) She testified that she had three or four good days in a week. (R. 111.) In response to questions from her attorney, plaintiff testified that on her bad days, she had \"chronic pain\" (R. 113-14), meaning \"that I cannot even walk, get out of bed. It's like I'm stuck to the bed.\" (R. 114.) She said that these bad days happened two or three times a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. VE Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   VE Marracco identified the titles, exertional levels, and DOT numbers for each of the three jobs performed by plaintiff in the past (park attendant, sales attendant, and cleaner). (R. 117-18.) The ALJ then provided a hypothetical:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   So let us assume a person with the Claimant's age, education and work experience, who's able to perform the full\n   range of light duties as prescribed in the regulations with the following limitations: Person is allowed to sit or stand alternately, provided that she is not off task more than 5% of the work period; occasionally climbs ramps or stairs; never climbs ladders, ropes or scaffolds; occasionally stoops, crouches or kneels; never crawls.... Only occasional overhead reaching; limited [to] jobs that can be performed while using a hand-held assistive device with the dominant hand for ambulation and standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (R. 118.) The ALJ asked whether that hypothetical claimant could perform any of plaintiff's past work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) VE Marracco testified that she could perform the job of a sales attendant. (R. 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The ALJ then presented VE Marracco with a second hypothetical claimant, with plaintiff's age, education, and work experience, who was able \"to perform the full range of sedentary duties,\" further limited as in the first hypothetical. (R. 119.) VE Marracco testified that the hypothetical claimant could perform the sedentary jobs of document preparer (DOT 249.587.018, SVP 2, national employment figure of 38,000), greeter (DOT 237.367-018, SVP 2, national employment figure of 956,000), and order clerk for food and beverage (DOT 209.567-014, SVP 2, national employment figure of 208,800). (R. 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In response to a third hypothetical - identical to the second, but with the additional limitation that there would be \"no exposure to moving machinery, unprotected heights or driving vehicles\" - VE Marracco confirmed that such a hypothetical claimant could also perform the jobs identified in response to the second hypothetical. (R. 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the ALJ presented VE Marracco with a fourth hypothetical:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Thank you, and Hypothetical # 4, please assume the same individual as in Hypothetical # 3 with one more limitation and that would be due to accommodation of medical condition and pain. This person is unable to engage in sustained work activity for a full eight-hour workday on a regular and consistent basis and would there be work in the national economy for such an individual?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (R. 120.)

(R. 14-15.) The Second Circuit has described the sequence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   First, the Commissioner considers whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. Where the claimant is not, the Commissioner next considers whether the claimant has a \"severe impairment\" that significantly limits her physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. If the claimant suffers such an impairment, the third inquiry is whether, based solely on medical evidence, the claimant has an impairment that is listed in 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1... Assuming the claimant does not have a listed impairment, the fourth inquiry is whether, despite the claimant's severe impairment, she has the residual functional capacity to perform her past work. Finally, if the claimant is unable to perform her past work, the burden then shifts to the Commissioner to determine whether there is other work which the claimant could perform.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Jasinski v.

In determining plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ considered her complaints of pain and statements about her own limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the ALJ found that plaintiff's \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and disabling effects of these symptoms are not consistent with the totality of the medical evidence of record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The ALJ also considered plaintiff's treatment history, the objective medical evidence, and the opinion of Dr. Mescon, which she gave \"significant weight.\" (R. 17-22.) The ALJ did not specifically discuss Dr. Dunner's assessment that plaintiff was \"[u]nable to work for at least 12 months\" (R. 290), or Nurse Gentes's statement that plaintiff was \"unable to sit for long periods, stand for longer than 15 minutes, walk upstairs, or bend over without severe back pain.\" (R. 307.)

(R. 297.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   I note that the ALJ did not wholly accept Dr. Mescon's opinion. Instead, when formulating plaintiff's RFC, she limited plaintiff to \"light\" work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and added several additional restrictions, including that plaintiff be permitted to \"sit/stand alternately at will as long as she is not off task more than 5% of the work period\"; that she only occasionally be required to climb ramps or stairs, stoop, crouch, kneel, and reach overhead; that she never be required to climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, or crawl; and that she be permitted to use a hand held assistive device (such as a cane) at all times when standing. (R. 17.) These restrictions fully accommodated the concerns articulated by Nurse Skinner, who stated that plaintiff \"could not stand for long periods of time\" but listed no other restrictions, and partially accommodated the longer list articulated by Nurse Gentes, as well as plaintiff's own complaints that she could not sit or stand for long periods without having to change position, could not climb many stairs, and needed a cane to get up and down and for balancing. (R. 104-08.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The ALJ's RFC determination was also consistent with plaintiff's ADLs, including cooking, cleaning, and shopping (R. 295); with her own testimony that medication reduced her pain to \"mild\" (R. 103-04) and that it \"relieves\" the pain to \"get up and sit down and then get up again\" (R. 106); and with the objective medical evidence. As the ALJ noted, the May 29, 2015 Electromyography/Nerve Conduction Study\n   performed on May 29, 2015 (R. 335), on Dr. Levin's referral, revealed no evidence of lumbar radiculopathy (which is what Dr. Levin's office was treating her for) and no evidence of peripheral neuropathy.

The third - an Electrodiagnostic Report dated three days after the Decision on October 28, 2016 - reported evidence \"consistent with\" carpal tunnel syndrome (R. 33), which is an impairment that the ALJ already acknowledged (R. 15), but that did not require accommodation in plaintiff's RFC because, as plaintiff herself testified, she had no difficulty handling and fingering small objects. (R. 107-08.) The fourth is a physiologic study concluding that plaintiff had \"[s]evere resting HTN\" (high blood pressure ) and results \"consistent with\" mild to moderate peripheral artery disease. (R. 39.) A similar physiologic study, dating from the prior year, was already in the record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 343.) The fifth new test result was another EMG/NCV Lower, conducted by Dr. Levin on July 22, 2016, which reported evidence of \"a chronic denervation limited to the right lumbosacral paraspinal muscles.\" (R. 35.) Neither the EMG nor any other document in the record explains the significance of that finding, if any, to plaintiff's RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Dr. Levin's December 26, 2017 letter (stating that plaintiff \"requires\" a walker, is \"unable\" to push, pull, or carry more than 15 pounds, and cannot \"stand or sit more than 15 mins\") is similarly not material. Dated fourteen months after the ALJ's October 25, 2016 Decision, the letter does not state or suggest that it describes plaintiff's limitations before that Decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florek v.

For example, Dr. Levin's new statement that plaintiff \"requires\" a walker is inconsistent with the record evidence, including plaintiff's hearing testimony that she \"mostly\" used a cane \"every day.\" (R. 105.) Similarly, his opinion that plaintiff is unable to carry more than 15 pounds or \"stand or sit more than 15 mins\" is largely accommodated by the ALJ's RFC, which limits plaintiff to light work (which involves \"lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds\") and to jobs that permit her to sit and stand at will. (R. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Plaintiff's October 29, 2018 letter to the Court is even less helpful to her, because it appears to be wholly unrelated to her pre-Decision condition. To the contrary: plaintiff makes it clear that the purpose of the letter was to update the Court on her post-Decision condition, writing \"I have gotten far worse. To this date October 29, 2018 I can barely walk a block without resting for 2 or 3 minutes.... My pain remains the same. But now the pain isn't only in my back or lower back.\" (Dkt. No. 18.)
