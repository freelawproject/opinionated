Starks's (Ms. Starks; collectively with Mr. Starks, Plaintiffs) contingent motion for transfer of venue. Having carefully considered the motions, the responses, the replies, the record, the arguments at motions hearing, and the applicable law, it is the judgment of the Court American's motion to transfer venue will be granted. Consequently, American's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs' contingent motion for transfer of venue will be rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court need address neither American's motion to dismiss nor Plaintiffs' contingent motion to transfer venue. Rather, the Court may transfer the case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) without determining whether it has personal jurisdiction over American.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fort Knox Music Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083099\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/108/#p112\">\n    257 F.3d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court declines to examine American's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs' contingent motion to transfer venue as the analysis regarding American's motion to transfer renders the remaining motions moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karsten v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan of Mid-Atl. States, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521750\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/8/#p11\">\n    36 F.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"If the first reason given is independently sufficient, then all those that follow are surplusage; thus, the strength of the first makes all the rest\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   .\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Applying the above standards to the instant matter, the Court must first determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Plaintiffs assert there is complete diversity of the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000. American admits the diversity of the parties, and in seeking transfer, further avers the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000. Accordingly, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Turning to American's motion to transfer, the Court first concludes the case could properly have been brought in the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division. American asserts the case could have been filed originally in the Northern District of Texas because that court - like this one - has subject matter jurisdiction over the case. American further advances the Northern District of Texas has personal jurisdiction over American as American's headquarters are located in the Fort Worth Division of the Northern District of Texas. Finally, American asserts venue is proper in the Fort Worth Division where American's headquarters are located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs oppose transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). However, if the Court determines it lacks personal jurisdiction over American, Plaintiffs seek transfer to the Northern District of Texas under -\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   -\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Section 1406(a) allows for transfer of a case to a court where the action could originally have been brought if it was improperly filed in the transferring court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiffs thus concede the instant action could have been brought in the Northern District of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court next turns to the second element of the test for transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) : whether such transfer is in the interest of justice and serves the convenience of the parties and witnesses. In making that determination, as noted\n   above, the Court looks at plaintiff's choice of venue, convenience and access of witnesses, convenience of parties, and the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    Trs.

Plaintiffs chose to bring this case in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (District of South Carolina). Their choice is entitled to substantial weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next factor to be considered is access to, and convenience for, the witnesses. The witnesses in this case include Mr. Oswell, American personnel who were onboard flight 102 and who met flight 102 when it landed, emergency medical personnel who met flight 102 upon arrival, treating physicians from Baylor Medical Center, the on-call physicians who communicated with the crew on flight 102, and Mr. and Ms. Starks. ECF Nos. 27 at 18-19, 30 at 15-16, 30-8. Many of these witnesses are American employees who live in the Dallas Fort Worth area, ECF No. 27 at 18-19, and thus are within the subpoena power of the Northern District of Texas, but outside the subpoena power of the District of South Carolina,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c). The Northern District of Texas is also more convenient for the majority of the American employees. ECF No. 27 at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Texas is also more convenient for many of the witnesses who are not American employees, and some of them are more accessible to the Texas court than to this Court. The Baylor Medical Center employees are likely within the subpoena power of the Northern District of Texas, but not the District of South Carolina,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c), and Texas is more convenient for them. The on-call flight physicians work out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ECF No. 30-8, and are thus likely outside the subpoena power of both courts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c), with neither court substantially more convenient for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Oswell currently resides in New York, but was deposed in this case in Killeen, Texas, where he was training to obtain his commercial driver's license, which will be issued by the State of Texas where Mr. Oswell maintains his driver's license. ECF No. 48-2 at 1-6. Thus, the Northern District of Texas is arguably more convenient for Mr. Oswell than the District of South Carolina. Mr. and Ms. Starks reside in Columbia, South Carolina, ECF No. 30-1 \u00b6 2; South Carolina is thus more convenient for them than Texas. Accordingly, for the majority of the witnesses in this case, the Northern District of Texas offers both better access to the witnesses, and more convenience for the witnesses than the District of South Carolina. This is particularly so for the witnesses who were onboard flight 102, and can attest to the series of events which preceded - and allegedly led to - Ms. Oswell's death. For those reasons, this factor weighs strongly in favor of transferring this action to the Northern District of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The third factor is convenience of the parties. American is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, ECF No. 27-1 \u00b6 5, and would have to transport people, documents, and evidence to Columbia if a trial were held in Columbia. Mr. and Ms. Starks reside in Columbia, and would have to take time off of work and incur costs for travel to and staying in Texas if a trial were held there. ECF No. 30-1 \u00b6 \u00b6 2, 4, ECF No. 48-3 at 2-3. Thus, venue in Columbia would be more convenient for Mr. and Mrs. Starks\n   whereas venue in Texas would be more convenience for American. In addition, many of American's documents and evidence, which will likely be at issue in this case, are located in Fort Worth. ECF No. 27 at 19-20. Accordingly, this factor weighs somewhat in favor of transferring this action to the Northern District of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The final factor to be considered is the interest of justice. American is a transportation company that operates flights in both Texas and South Carolina. American, however, is based in Fort Worth, Texas. Thus, Texas has a stronger interest in hosting this litigation than does South Carolina. This final factor thus weighs in favor of transferring the instant action to the Northern District of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, the Court finds with the exception of Plaintiffs' choice of venue, the factors weigh in favor of transferring this matter to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division. In particular, the witnesses are more accessible to the Texas court, and Texas is a more convenient venue for some of the parties and the majority of the witnesses. As the home of American, Texas also has a stronger interest in adjudicating this matter than does South Carolina. For those reasons, the Court will grant American's motion to transfer venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Wherefore, based on the foregoing discussion and analysis, it is the judgment of this Court American's motion to transfer venue is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . As a result, both American's motion to dismiss and Plaintiffs' contingent motion to dismiss are\n   <strong>\n    RENDERED MOOT\n   </strong>\n   . This case is\n   <strong>\n    TRANSFERRED\n   </strong>\n   to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Signed this 27th day of March, 2019, in Columbia, South Carolina.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
