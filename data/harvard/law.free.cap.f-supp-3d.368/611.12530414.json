Blackerby (\"Agent Blackerby\"), Clifton Springs Hospital (\"CSH\"), Dr. Douglas Landy (\"Dr. Landy\"), and registered nurse Kim Dean (\"Nurse Dean\") (collectively \"Defendants\"). (Dkt. 8; Dkt. 9). Currently pending before the Court are Agent Blackerby's motion to dismiss the claims against him (Dkt. 26) and CSH's, Dr. Landy's, and Nurse Dean's (collectively the \"CSH Defendants\") motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 49). For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Agent Blackerby's motion to dismiss, grants the CSH Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's federal claims against them, and dismisses Plaintiff's state law claims against the CSH Defendants without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CSH is a private community hospital and nursing home located in Clifton Springs, New York. (Dkt. 49-2 at \u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Landy is a board-certified psychiatrist and has been employed by CSH for approximately six years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). Nurse Dean is a registered nurse and has been the unit coordinator for CSH's inpatient psychiatric unit since April 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). On February 4, 2014, Plaintiff was transported via ambulance to CSH's emergency room because he was hearing voices telling him to harm himself and others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). Plaintiff was admitted to CSH's inpatient psychiatric unit, where he met with Dr. Landy for an initial inpatient evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Plaintiff told Dr. Landy that he was having auditory hallucinations commanding him to kill himself and others, including the President of the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Landy contacted the Secret Service to advise them that \"one of his patients\n   had auditory hallucinations of command to kill then-President Obama.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Dr. Landy spoke to Agent Blackerby, who requested to meet with Plaintiff at CSH the following morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Dr. Landy advised Plaintiff that a Secret Service Agent would be coming the following morning to speak with him regarding his statement about the President and Plaintiff indicated that he was agreeable to the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 7, 2014, Agent Blackerby met with Plaintiff in a conference room at CSH's inpatient psychiatric unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Dr. Landy and Nurse Dean were present for the entirety of the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After the meeting, Agent Blackerby told Dr. Landy and Nurse Dean that he would \"report his investigative findings to the appropriate individuals to make a decision regarding whether criminal charges would be pursued against Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Agent Blackerby also asked to be contacted when Plaintiff was discharged from CSH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff was discharged from CSH on February 28, 2014, and the Secret Service was notified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff was indicted on April 10, 2014, for threatening the life of the President of the United States, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20871\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 10, 2017, (Dkt. 6), and a second amended complaint on February 14, 2017 (Dkt. 8) (the \"Second Amended Complaint\"). On April 14, 2017, the Court entered a Decision and Order screening Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). (Dkt. 10). The Court dismissed certain of Plaintiff's claims, and permitted the following claims to proceed to service: (1) a false arrest claim against Agent Blackerby; (2) a First Amendment retaliation claim as to Agent Blackerby, Dr. Landy, and Nurse Dean; (3) a malicious prosecution claim against Agent Blackerby and Dr. Landy; (4) a false imprisonment claim against Agent Blackerby, Dr. Landy, and Nurse Dean; and (5) a negligence/medical malpractice claim against the CSH Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Agent Blackerby filed his motion to dismiss on December 18, 2017. (Dkt. 26). Plaintiff filed a declaration opposing Agent Blackerby's motion on January 10, 2018 (Dkt. 36), and Agent Blackerby filed a reply on January 23, 2018 (Dkt. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The CSH Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment on April 20, 2018. (Dkt. 49). Plaintiff filed opposition papers on November 26, 2018. (Dkt. 69). The CSH Defendants filed a reply on December 20, 2018.

First, Agent Blackerby contends that any\n   state common-law tort claims against him are barred by the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \"FTCA\"). Second, Agent Blackerby argues that Plaintiff cannot maintain a First Amendment retaliation claim against him because there is no\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   remedy for First Amendment retaliation. Third, Agent Blackerby argues that Plaintiff cannot maintain a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim against him in his official capacity. Fourth, Agent Blackerby argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   . Fifth, Agent Blackerby argues that, in any event, he has qualified immunity from Plaintiff's claims. Sixth and finally, Agent Blackerby contends that he has not been properly served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees that (1) Plaintiff's state common-law claims are barred by the FTCA, (2) Plaintiff cannot maintain a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim against Agent Blackerby in his official capacity, and (3) Plaintiff has failed to state a viable\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim. Because these conclusions mandate dismissal of all Plaintiff's claims against Agent Blackerby, the Court need not and does not reach Agent Blackerby's remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     State Common-Law Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiff has asserted claims against Agent Blackerby for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment. Such claims generally may be asserted both as constitutional claims and as state common-law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crews v.
