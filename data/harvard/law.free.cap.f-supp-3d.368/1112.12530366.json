INTRODUCTION\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Before the Court is Plaintiff Radiant Global Logistics, Inc.'s (\"Radiant\") Motion for a Preliminary Injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a). (ECF # 7.) Radiant argues that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims for threatened or actual misappropriation of trade secrets and/or breach of fiduciary duty.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 7, 2018, Radiant filed a six-count Verified Complaint (\"Complaint\") against Charles \"Chad\" Furstenau, Jr., and BTX Air Express of Detroit, a Connecticut limited liability company (\"BTX Detroit\"), alleging the following claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Count I - Declaratory Judgment (Against Furstenau);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Count II - Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Against Furstenau);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Count III - Misappropriation of Trade Secrets under the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 USC \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"DTSA\") and the Michigan Uniform Trade Secrets Act, MCL \u00a7 445.1901,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"MUTSA\") (Against Furstenau and BTX Detroit);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Count IV - Tortious Interference (Against BTX Detroit);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Count V - Aiding and Abetting (Against BTX Detroit); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count VI - Common Law and Statutory Conversion Under MCL \u00a7 600.2919a (Against Furstenau).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (ECF # 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 14, 2018, Radiant filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF # 7) and a Motion to Expedite Discovery in Aid of Preliminary Injunction (\"Motion to Expedite\") (ECF # 8). On September 18, 2018, BTX Detroit filed its Response to the Motion to Expedite (ECF # 13), and Furstenau filed his concurrence with BTX Detroit's Response (ECF # 14). On October 5, 2018, the Court entered a Stipulated Order as to the expedited discovery and timelines for responsive pleading to the Complaint and the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (ECF # 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 11, 2018, BTX Detroit filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses (ECF # 25), and Furstenau filed his Answer and Affirmative Defenses (ECF # 26). On November 1, 2018, the Court scheduled a full-day Preliminary Injunction evidentiary hearing for December 14, 2018. (ECF # 29.) On November 21, 2018, BTX Detroit filed its Response to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF # 32), and Furstenau filed his concurrence therewith (ECF # 33). Radiant filed its\n   Reply in support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction on November 28, 2018. (ECF # 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the December 14, 2018 Preliminary Injunction hearing, Defendants sought to introduce the \"expert report\" and testimony of Scott Polus. Radiant moved to strike Polus's report and testimony. The Court ordered briefing on the \"expert\" issue. The evidentiary hearing was continued to December 21, 2018 (ECF # 42), at which the Court granted Radiant's motion to strike Polus's report and testimony under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2). The Court also struck Polus's affidavit attached to BTX Detroit's Response to the instant Motion under that Rule. (Scott Polus Aff., [undated] PgID 1136, ECF # 32-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Radiant's Detroit Location\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Radiant is a third party logistics and supply chain management company in the freight brokerage industry. (Compl., \u00b6 12, ECF # 1.) Radiant provides transportation and logistics services - freight forwarding services - to companies in the consumer goods, food and beverage, manufacturing, and retail sectors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Radiant has numerous stores (a.k.a., offices or stations) around the country, including 16 company-owned stores and over one hundred independently franchised locations. (Dep. of Tim O'Brien, Vice President of Radiant Company Stores, Oct. 19, 2018, 18:1-12, ECF # 36-3, PgID 1688.) Radiant's Detroit location, where Furstenau served as the general manager, was a company store (\"Radiant Detroit\") primarily serving the automotive industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Beginning in 1994, Furstenau worked in the third-party logistics industry (\"3PL\") for United American, and continued there after it was acquired by the 3PL freight brokerage company Stone Path, in 2002. (Dec. 14, 2018, Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Tim O'Brien Test. 55:3-19, PgID 2032, ECF # 43.) Radiant purchased Stone Path's assets in 2005 and asked Furstenau to stay on with Radiant Detroit as the general manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furstenau was the \"highest ranking\" manager at Radiant Detroit (Dec. 14, 2018, Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Chad Furstenau Test. 134:23-135:5, PgID 2111-12, ECF # 43) and reported to Tim O'Brien - Radiant's Vice President of Company Stores - who is \"responsible for the company-owned offices of Radiant Global throughout the United States.\" (O'Brien Dep. 7:15-17, ECF # 36-3, PgID 1677.) Furstenau also held the title of \"Director of Automotive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:17-25, ECF # 36-3, PgID 1717-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During his tenure with Radiant, Furstenau never signed a specifically-titled non-compete or non-solicit contract. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test. 95:14-23, PgID 2072.) And in May 2018, when presented with a non-compete contract by Radiant, Furstenau refused to sign it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95:24-25, 96:1-2, PgID 2072-73.) Furstenau (and all Radiant employees) did, however, sign an acknowledgment of and agreement to abide by Radiant's Code of Ethics, which included the following \"Conflicts of Interest\" and \"Confidentiality\" provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    CONFIDENTIALITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Directors, officers and employees should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by [Radiant] and any other confidential information about [Radiant], its business, customers or suppliers, from whatever source, except when disclosure is authorized.... For the purposes of this Code, \"confidential information\" includes all non-public information relating to [Radiant], its business, customers or suppliers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Employees must not use their position or knowledge gained as a result of their position for private or personal advantage or for improper benefits. No one should also engage in other duties, responsibilities or obligations that run counter to his or her duty to [Radiant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Any employee involved in a conflict of interest or a transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to conflict, must report the matter promptly to the employee's management. Any officer or director in such situations must make reports to the Board of Directors or a designated Board committee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 179:6-13, PgID 2156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Furstenau also signed an acknowledgment of receiving Radiant's Employee Handbook (\"Handbook\") (Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Sep. 14, 2018, PgID 66, ECF # 7), which contained a \"Computer, Internet &amp; Software Policy\" (\"Computer Policy\") (Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. B, PgID 99, ECF # 7-3). (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 135:17-23, PgID 2112-13.) The Computer Policy required employees to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [k]eep confidential all [Radiant] data and all information provided to [Radiant] by other entities.... Each user is bound by obligation not to disclose Radiant Logistics' business information unless authorized to do so. Breach of confidentiality through accidental or negligent disclosure may expose User to disciplinary action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Computer Policy further required employees to \"[e]nsure that computers are not left unattended without first logging out or locking computer and/or securing the entrance to the work area, particularly if the computer system ... contains sensitive or valuable information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The acknowledgment page states that the Handbook \"is intended to provide general information about the policies, benefits, and regulations governing the employees of the Company\" and is an \"overview.\" (Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. C, PgID 102, ECF # 7-4.) Moreover, \"[t]he Company reserves the right to modify, supplement, rescind or revise any provision of this handbook from time to time as it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion with or without notice to you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Above the signature line, the acknowledgment states, \"Please sign below to indicate that you have received and read this Employee Handbook[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furstenau signed the acknowledgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Furstenau testified that he became increasingly disenchanted with Radiant over compensation/bonus issues and Radiant's various attempts to implement a new transportation management software system. (Dep. of Charles Furstenau, Oct. 16, 2018, 58:23-59:20, PgID 1547-48, ECF # 36-2.) Furstenau discussed his concerns about the software systems with O'Brien and Joe Bento, Radiant's chief operating officer. (Furstenau Dep. 62:21-63:4, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1550-51.) He testified that he thought Radiant was going to terminate him at any moment; he claims he saw an advertisement for his position on LinkedIn. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 165:3-4, PgID 2142; 184:10-15, PgID 2161.) Radiant denies that it ever planned to terminate its manager, Furstenau. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test. 99:1-13, PgID 2076; 103:5-8, PgID 2080.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furstenau terminated his employment with Radiant on Friday evening, August 24, 2018, and opened a BTX Detroit office\n   as it manager on Monday, August 27, 2018. He acknowledged engaging in discussions with BTX Global Logistics, Inc.'s (\"BTX Global\") CEO Rosario \"Ross\" Bacarella about opening a BTX Detroit office over the preceding seven months, beginning in February 2018. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 142:11-15, PgID 2119.) These discussions culminated in the opening of a staffed and furnished BTX Detroit office on the morning of Monday August 27, 2018. Furstenau brought to BTX Detroit his five key Radiant office employees, two on Monday and the others soon thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141:21-142:20, PgID 2018-19.) Present at the new BTX office on that first Monday morning were Angela \"Angie\" Dupree and Chris Higgins, who had resigned from Radiant on Sunday, August 26, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Significantly, while still employed at Radiant on August 14, 2018, Furstenau sent Bacarella an email with a list of the five key Radiant employees who would join his team when he came over to BTX Detroit from Radiant (including Higgins and Dupree), going so far as to specifically request BTX to purchase computers for them at the new BTX office prior to its opening. (Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 54.) The computers were there for Furstenau and his now-BTX team of former Radiant employees when the two arrived at the new leased and furnished BTX office on Monday, August 27, 2018. The five key Radiant employees that came over to BTX Detroit were: Angela Dupree, Chris Higgins, Liana Renteria, Kari Piper, and, as noted\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , indirectly, Ben Watkins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Formation of BTX Detroit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   From 2003 to 2005, BTX Global had serviced the Detroit market through a Detroit office. (Dep. of Rosario Bacarella, CEO of BTX Global, Oct. 18, 2018, 9:4-11, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1349.) From 2005 through August 27, 2018, BTX had serviced Detroit from afar - through a BTX independent contractor located in Dallas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Bacarella, BTX Global had plans to open an office in Detroit in fall 2019 to gain business in the automotive market, after completing a three-year term buyout of that Dallas independent BTX contractor beginning in fall 2016 that would conclude in fall 2019. (Bacarella Dep. 20:22-25, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1360; 32:12-14, PgID 1372.) However, after discussions with Furstenau beginning in February 2018, Bacarella expedited the opening of BTX Detroit to August 2018 because he believed hiring Furstenau would provide the experience and team necessary to open a new Detroit location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:1-5, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1361.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furstenau had initially contacted Bacarella in mid-February 2018, expressing his interest in opening an independent BTX contractor store in Detroit. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 153:7-154:12, PgID 2130-31.) At his deposition, Furstenau testified as to the February 17, 2018 email exchange with Bacarella where Furstenau confirms that he met the \"criteria\" for an independent BTX store - a sales/operations team and $ 3 million in gross revenue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (Hickey) Q: ... it's an email from Mr. Bacarella where he says, \"Chad, Sorry I had to cut our conversation short last evening. You caught me at an awkward time. In order to be a serious candidate for station ownership, you need to have\n   <em>\n    a team of operations and salespeople\n   </em>\n   with a minimum of\n   <em>\n    3 million in gross revenue.\n   </em>\n   Please advise if this is the case and we can continue our conversation on Monday. If not, I wish you the very best.\" Do you see that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: Did you satisfy him that you were a serious candidate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: I believe so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: Did you convince him that you did indeed have a team of operations and salespeople who would could [sic] generate a minimum of 3 million in gross revenue?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: I don't recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: Well, you say to him ... three days later on February 20, \"Ross, yes,\n   <em>\n    we meet your criteria\n   </em>\n   ...\" Do you see that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Furstenau Dep. 129:18-131:3, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1617-19.) (Emphasis added.) The Court finds that \"we\" meant a sales team of individuals. Furstenau testified at his deposition that, in February 2018, he filled out a \"business plan\" provided by BTX Global that substantiated his \"3 million in gross revenue\" representation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131:20-132:23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furstenau testified that he continued communicating with Bacarella from February to Friday, August 24, 2018, the date of his late-night resignation from Radiant. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 142:11-15, PgID 2119.) Furstenau also developed a pro forma and budget for BTX Detroit at BTX Global's request. (Bacarella Dep. 57:19-23, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1397.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While still at Radiant, Furstenau helped select the new BTX Detroit office location, going so far as installing Formica countertops and selecting carpets - all allegedly after his Radiant work hours. (Furstenau Dep. 79:1-13, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1567; 12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 53:24-54:3, PgID 2289-90.) Throughout the January to August 2018 period prior to Furstenau's departure from Radiant, he forwarded approximately 300 emails from his Radiant account to his personal Comcast Account. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 143:4-7, PgID 2120.) Those emails included Radiant financial forecasts, budgets, profit and loss statements, profit margin data, customer lists, customer reports detailing activity and profitability, salaries of the Radiant employees, agent/carrier lists, and some personal emails. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test., 17:9-16, PgID 1994.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furstenau testified that he sent Radiant profit and loss emails to his Comcast Account both before and after he had engaged with BTX. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 198:6-16, PgID 2175.) Furstenau initially denied having opened any of the emails he sent to his Comcast Account but later admitted that he had opened some. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 200:17-20, PgID 2177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Furstenau emailed his resignation to Radiant on the night of Friday August 24, 2018, and then commenced immediate solicitation of Radiant clients for BTX Detroit that weekend. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test. 33:14-22, PgID 2010; Furstenau Dep. 98:15-24, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1586.) The BTX Detroit location headed by Furstenau officially commenced operations on the morning of Monday, August 27, 2018. As noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , two long-time Radiant employees - Chris Higgins and Angela Dupree - had submitted their resignations to Radiant on Sunday, August 26, 2018 and joined Furstenau as BTX Detroit employees the next morning. (Furstenau Dep. 72:16-21, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1558.) Three other Radiant employees - Liana Renteria, Kari Piper and Ben Watkins (indirectly) - joined BTX Detroit shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81:8-15.) Watkins was the only exiting Radiant employee who had executed Radiant non-competition and non-solicitation agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   82:21-23.) Because Watkins, who had been embedded by Radiant onsite with its client, the George P. Johnson Co. (\"George P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Johnson\") in Memphis, Tennessee, to secure business for Radiant, had signed those non-compete/non-solicit contracts, it was arranged for him to become an employee of George P. Johnson to direct its business to BTX Detroit. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test. PgID 2024-26.) Radiant argues that Higgins, Dupree, Renteria, and Piper all perform the same job functions for BTX Detroit that they did for Radiant (as does Watkins for George P. Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court find inherently incredible the testimony of Furstenau and Dupree, that the five former Radiant team members never discussed with Furstenau leaving Radiant for BTX Detroit before August 24, 2018, the day Furstenau resigned. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Angela Dupree, Oct. 15, 2018, 40:6-9, ECF # 36-4, PgID 1830; 12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 168:3-170:10, PgID 2145-47.) Furstenau stated in an August 14, 2018 email (Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 54) to Bacarella: \"Here are the names of users that need a computer,\" and then listed the names of his Radiant team that would join him at BTX Detroit. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 161:13-23, PgID 2138.) Indeed, at the time of the December 14, 2018 Preliminary Injunction hearing, all BTX Detroit employees were former Radiant Furstenau team employees. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 174:4-8, PgID 2151;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 44:12-17, PgID 2280.) Furstenau did admit that recruiting these employees was his plan for some time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (Hickey) Q: You didn't wake up on Sunday morning and say, Hey, if I can get Chris Higgins, Angie Dupree, and the other employees that you previously identified [Renteria, Piper and Watkins] [to] move over to BTX, I'll offer them a job. You didn't wake up Sunday morning and decide. That's something you'd been thinking and actually discussed with BTX some weeks before, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:24-78:7, PgID 1565-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court finds significant as evidence that Furstenau had discussed with his Radiant team about moving to BTX prior to August 24, 2018, in his email to Bacarella on August 14, 2018, where he stated that \"some folks were inquiring on a 401(k)[.] Can you provide any information?\" When questioned about his reference to some folks inquiring on a 401(k) at BTX, Furstenau testified, incredibly, that he was probably talking about himself. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 163:1-19, PgID 2140.) When Bacarella, who was present in Court during Furstenau's testimony, was subsequently questioned on December 21, 2018 about Furstenau's explanation of this term \"some folks\" in this email, he testified that some folks \"could mean himself.\" (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 72:2, PgID 2308.) This incredible testimony played out further in Bacarella's deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q (Jeffers): When [Furstenau] said, \"Also, some folks were inquiring on a 401(k), can you provide any information,\" and then it lists the names of six individuals below, you didn't think [Furstenau] was referring ... to one of those individuals ...?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A (Bacarella): Not unless he said \"these folks\" instead of \"some folks.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Bacarella Dep. 92:16-23, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1433.) The Court finds this consistent testimony by both Furstenau and Bacarella to be consistently inherently incredible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Also incredible is the testimony that the five Radiant employees quit their jobs in advance, without knowing anything about where they would find new employment: no advance knowledge of BTX or the office location, and then being hired without even\n   submitting an employment application to BTX Detroit, or asking/learning about what their BTX Detroit positions, salaries, or benefits would be:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q (Hickey): And they quit their jobs without having any discussion with you about compensation, 401(k), vacation, healthcare benefits, anything of that nature, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A (Furstenau): That is 100 percent correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 169:7-10, PgID 2146.) Angie Dupree testified that she did not even know the company name until she saw it on the sign the morning of Monday, August 27, 2018. (Dec. 21, 2018 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Angela Dupree Test. 100:14-17, ECF # 45, PgID 2336.) The Court concludes this aforestated testimony is inherently incredible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Bacarella testified to BTX Detroit's measures to prevent any access to Radiant information and his desire to \"stay out of trouble,\" and out of court. (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 22:17, PgID 2258.) According to Bacarella, Radiant email cannot permeate the BTX servers. Bacarella also told the former Radiant employees not to use any confidential Radiant information. (Bacarella Dep. 115:16-116:14, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1455-56.) The former Radiant employees were also required to sign BTX's Terms and Conditions of Employment, compliance with which is overseen by BTX managers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Use of Confidential Information of Other Persons.\n   </em>\n   You represent that you have not brought and will not bring with you to [BTX Detroit], any materials or documents of a former employer that are not generally available to the public, unless express written authorization from such employer for their possession and use has been obtained. You also understand that you are not to breach any obligation of confidentiality that you have to any former employer, and agree to fulfill all such obligations during the period of your affiliation with [BTX Detroit].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Defs.' Resp., Nov. 21, 2018, PgID 936, ECF # 32; Bacarella Aff., Nov. 20, 2018, \u00b6 13, ECF # 32-2, PgID 957.) Further, Furstenau had specifically been told not to use Radiant information, and he has \"assured\" Bacarella that he has not done so. (Bacarella Dep. 115:16-116:14, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1455-56.) This attempt by Bacarella to legitimize and ethicize BTX's conduct in this conspiracy between BTX and Furstenau to hijack Radiant's Detroit office is undermined by the testimony and exhibits introduced in Court in this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Focusing on BTX's conduct, the Court points to Exhibit 56, a June 22, 2018 email from Bacarella to \"Carol Furstenau\" regarding points discussed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   1. You (CF) [Chad Furstenau] would join BTX as a salaried employee at $ 175,000 (per submitted budget). We would also hire 4 additional operational support staff at the budgeted amounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   3. BTX would supply all the office essentials at BTX expense....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   6. Benefits would begin for all employees on day 1[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   7. All customers that are brought over by CF and any customers acquired by CF will be converted over to CF when CF becomes an independent contractor[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   8. Once CF is an employee of BTX, BTX will establish an office in Detroit with approximately 7,000 sq. ft. of combined office and warehouse space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   10. BTX will fund any defense brought against you, by your former employer,\n   as it relates to any non-compete or\n   <em>\n    confidentiality\n   </em>\n   issues. To prepare for [sic] we will need to be aware of any employment agreements that are currently in place, if any.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 56.) (Emphasis added.) This establishes that Furstenau will become a salaried employee of BTX, that he would hire four additional operational support staff - he had provided Bacarella with their names - and that his new BTX team would begin receiving BTX benefits on their first day of work. The Court finds significance in Paragraph seven, which anticipates that Furstenau would get credit for bringing over his Radiant customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Also significant is Paragraph eight, which states \"Once CF is an employee of BTX, BTX will establish an office in Detroit with approximately 7,000 sq. ft. of combined office and warehouse space.\" This confirms that BTX would not establish a Detroit office until after Furstenau becomes an employee of BTX. Since BTX had secured office space prior to August 27, 2018, under the terms of the email agreement, Furstenau would have been a BTX employee before he left Radiant. This undermines Furstenau's claim that the reason he left Radiant on Friday, August 24, 2018 was because he had informed them on Tuesday, August 21, that he would quit on Friday, August 24, 2018 unless they agreed to all his claims for additional compensation by that Friday. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 165:18-166:2, PgID 2142-43.) Clearly, these demands were a \"smoke screen\" to try to obscure his already-planned departure to a previously leased and furnished BTX Detroit office. As Judge Avern Cohn noted in\n   <em>\n    Superior Consulting Co. v. Walling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3878269\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/851/839/#p848\">\n    851 F.Supp. 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848-49 (E.D. Mich. 1994) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Walling said that SCC demonstrated bad faith in failing to pay him commissions it owes him.... If SCC owes Walling compensation from his employment there, he is entitled to pursue legal remedies against SCC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, Furstenau has done just that in filing a Counterclaim in this case, (ECF # 31), which will be dealt with subsequently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, very significant is the fact that Bacarella acknowledged in his Preliminary Injunction hearing testimony that he had testified at his deposition that he and Furstenau had a handshake deal\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he signed the BTX Detroit lease. (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 57:12-23, PgID 2293.) This \"handshake deal\" spawned Bacarella's working with Furstenau to lease and furnish a BTX Detroit office for Furstenau and his team's post-August 24, 2018 \"landing.\" The post-handshake conduct of both parties confirms that it was a contract acceptable to and carried out by both BTX and Furstenau, while he was still a Radiant employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In fact, Furstenau admits this where he testified that he specifically directed his Verizon cell phone customer service representative to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   transfer his Radiant contacts or emails to his new BTX Detroit cell phone. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 148:6-19,\n   PgID 2125 (\"I told her only my personal email address and contacts ... I did not want Radiant information on my ... [BTX] cell phone.\").) Therefore, not only are any client or carrier lists protectable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noretto\n   </em>\n   at 658, but the significant \"secret sauce\" content of the multitude of Furstenau's emails to himself go miles beyond mere contacts. It bears noting that Furstenau still has his Radiant phone. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj.

So for the example of the Detroit operation, our rank and file members, our operational staff, the Chris Higgins of the world, Angie Duprees of the world, wouldn't have access to what we deem to be confidential and proprietary. That would be for general manager's eyes only or the vice president's eyes only and people above me. So there are certain protocols we follow in terms of who we distribute what we deem to be confidential. So [Furstenau] as the senior leader of that would receive all that data because he needed that as a tool to help him perform his job. But people below him necessarily wouldn't have that. They just wouldn't see it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (O'Brien Dep. 66:16-67:9, ECF # 36-3, PgID 1737.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The yearly budget report was a password-protected document.

Furstenau had signed Radiant's Code of Ethics that included a confidentiality provision prohibiting disclosure. (Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 3.) The Handbook's Computer Policy also included a prohibition on disclosure of confidential information and required employees to \"[e]nsure that computers are not left unattended without first logging out or locking computer and/or securing the entrance to the work area, particularly if the computer system ... contains sensitive or valuable information.\" (Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. B., ECF # 7-3, PgID 99.) Accordingly, Radiant clearly made sufficient efforts to safeguard its confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Misappropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Radiant proceeds on a theory of actual misappropriation and, alternatively, on a\n   theory of threatened misappropriation. The MUTSA defines misappropriation as either of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (I) Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   (II) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who did 1 or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   (A) Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   (B) At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it, acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use, or derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   (C) Before a material change of his or her position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   MCL \u00a7 445.1902.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Actual Misappropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Radiant argues against Defendants' \"attempt to characterize this case as merely one in which an employee leaves an employer for a competitor and begins soliciting customers of that former employer\" (Pl. 's Reply, Nov. 28, 2018, ECF # 34, PgID 1260):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Furstenau was not preparing to\n   <em>\n    comp[ ]ete\n   </em>\n   with Radiant Detroit at all; he was preparing to\n   <em>\n    replicate\n   </em>\n   Radiant Detroit and leave it a shell of its former self. He plotted surreptitiously and methodically for over six months with BTX Global to create a new office in Detroit that would be all things Radiant; different in name only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PgID 1265.) (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Radiant cites as clear evidence of Furstenau's misappropriation/disclosure that the BTX Detroit office was up and running on the Monday morning with Radiant's former office manager and critical members of his former Radiant team contacting Radiant's customers. It is uncontested that BTX wanted \"boots on the ground\" in Detroit in 2018. BTX had previously operated a failed presence in Detroit in the 1990s. (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 17:11-12, PgID 2253.) The new 2018 BTX boots on the ground operation in Detroit was composed of Furstenau and his Radiant team, and Furstenau had Radiant's \"secret sauce\" within his 300 Comcast Account emails. The Court concludes that this evidence establishes that the exodus to BTX was planned by Furstenau and Bacarella over the six months prior to August 24, 2018, and that BTX's quick start business contacts to Radiant's clients that Monday morning, whose complex business history was contained in the 300 emails, had been well planned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   O'Brien testified that Radiant \"has seen a decrease in business since [Furstenau] left\" (O'Brien Dep. 29:2-5, ECF # 36-3, PgID 1699); it has \"lost volume from customers\" in the two months since BTX Detroit opened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:4-5, ECF # 36-3, PgID 1721.) O'Brien also testified that Radiant has lost the business of the George P. Johnson office in Los Angeles. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test. 43:4-9, PgID 2020.) O'Brien further testified to specific financial losses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Now, it's very early to tell financially what it looks like, but I can tell you as of [December 13, 2018], if I look at our top six customers in the Detroit marketplace\n   from October, '17, to October, '18, this year the revenue was down about $ 400,000. That's revenue. And in terms of profitability, if I look at the first fiscal quarter of the year, for us it's July, August, September of '17 versus this first fiscal quarter year, we're down over 300,000 in gross profit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:9-16, PgID 2021.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   While O'Brien acknowledged that he has not yet seen any specific direct evidence of disclosure as of December 2018, Radiant did not yet have the ability to \"drill down\" into Furstenau's phone or BTX computer. Further, at the Preliminary Injunction hearing on December 14, 2018, Furstenau did change his testimony from initially insisting that he had never accessed any of the Comcast emails to later admitting accessing at least 24 emails, but then insisting that none of them involved Radiant. (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 198:20-199:12, PgID 2175-76; 200:17-20, PgID 2177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Bacarella testified that he and Furstenau had early-on discussed \"that it would be improper for him [Furstenau] to ask or try to recruit any individuals that currently worked there\" and added that Furstenau \"had not done that.\" (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 30:10-22, PgID 2266.) This testimony is undermined by the August 14, 2018 email from Furstenau to Bacarella listing the names of his Radiant team that would serve as his BTX team when the Detroit office opened. Bacarella also testified that he would not have opened the BTX Detroit office without making sure it was staffed properly with a team of qualified people. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:1-7, PgID 2304.) And he got this assurance by learning their names in advance. Bacarella guaranteed to hire and pay Furstenau's Radiant team on day one, without even requesting them to fill out an employment application or request for benefits, etc.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dana Ltd. v. Am. Axle &amp; Mfg. Holdings, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   No. 1:10-CV-450,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202524008\">\n    2012 WL 2524008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (W.D. Mich. June 29, 2012) (denying summary judgment based on circumstantial evidence of disclosure). Bacarella's seeking and receiving Furstenau's assurance that he could provide BTX a team and a large sales value, and then over a period of six months of emails and calls, culminating in a handshake deal, and then their leasing and furnishing of a BTX Detroit office while Furstenau was still at Radiant, establishes compelling circumstantial evidence of a plan between Bacarella and Furstenau to misappropriate Radiant's trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Threatened Misappropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In addition to the incriminatory emails between Furstenau and Bacarella and Furstenau's accumulation of 300 Radiant emails in his personal account, a significant factor establishing Radiant's likelihood of success is the incredulity of Furstenau's in-court testimony regarding the formation of BTX Detroit. Although \"threatened misappropriation\" has not been expressly adopted by Michigan courts, \"[t]o establish threatened misappropriation, a party must specifically identify the trade secret likely to be misappropriated and must convince the court of the former employee's 'duplicity' by proffering evidence indicating a significant lack of candor or willingness to misuse trade secrets.\"\n   <em>\n    Gene Codes Corp. v.

Mich. Feb. 11, 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    CMI Intern., Inc. v. Intermet Intern. Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"276993\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/251/125/#p134\">\n    251 Mich.

The Court finds Furstenau's testimony to be inherently incredible as to many key components that establish threatened misappropriation. In particular, Furstenau's claim that he never accessed his 300 Radiant emails, his initial\n   denial that he made a deal with BTX when he had made a handshake deal with Bacarella before he left Radiant, his immediate calls to Radiant clients with knowledge of their needs and history, his immediate hiring of his Radiant team allegedly without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   prior discussion with them about their pay, benefits, BTX's location, or any other terms of employment, and the claim that the team would blindly follow him to a hitherto non-existent BTX office. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 161:22-162:12, PgID 2138-39; 200:17-201:5, PgID 2177-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Also inherently incredible is Furstenau's insistence that a list he created in the August 14, 2018 email entitled \"Computers/Rosters\" sent to Bacarella requesting computers for the five\n   <em>\n    named\n   </em>\n   Radiant team employees who all left to become the staff of BTX Detroit was pure chance or serendipity - allegedly he had never spoken with any of his Monday BTX \"team\" about moving to BTX Detroit before he resigned that Friday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162:9-17, PgID 2139.) Perhaps the strongest evidence of Furstenau's mendacity on this issue is the August 14, 2018 email, listing the specific names of his BTX team comprised of his Radiant team, which establishes that it was not his \"hope\" that his team would follow. While he testified that \"[i]t was more of a hope\" the named individuals would leave Radiant (Furstenau Dep. 128:4-14, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1616), the plot to jump ship was confirmed in his email:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Here are the names of users that need a computer, note there is 1 additional employee who works out of\n   <em>\n    customer\n   </em>\n   location in Tennessee [George P. Johnson] who will not need a computer. Also, some folks were inquiring on a 401k can you provide any information?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Chad Furstenau\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   Kari Piper\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Liania Renteria\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   Angie Dupree\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Chris Higgins\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Ben Watkins (\n   <em>\n    customer\n   </em>\n   location)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   (August 14, 2018 Email, Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 54.) (Errors in original.) (Emphasis added.) That \"customer\"-located employee, Ben Watkins, was a Radiant employee working at a Radiant customer, George P. Johnson, Co., Furstenau's use of the designation \"customer\" supports the conclusion that his list was all Radiant employees who were then servicing Radiant customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Court concludes that this email confirms that Furstenau's testimony that he had no exit plans (think \"smoke screen\" ultimatum), and no pre-August 24, 2018 exit discussion with any of his team was inherently incredible. The Court's conclusion is validated with his and Bacarella's locating, leasing, and setting up the BTX office to open for business on Monday, August 27, 2018. The evidence clearly establishes a pre-planned exit by Furstenau and Bacarella that was carried out that late August weekend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   As far back as February 2018, Furstenau's statements to Bacarella indicated that he likely had discussions with his \"team\" at Radiant regarding a move to BTX Detroit. In email correspondence with Bacarella confirming that Furstenau qualified for consideration as an independent contractor, which required a sales/operations \"team\" and a $ 3 million book of business, he indicated, \"Yes,\n   <em>\n    we\n   </em>\n   meet your criteria.\" (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 154:4-10, PgID 2131.) (Emphasis added.) At his deposition and the hearing, Furstenau maintained that \"it was essentially me but I used the word we.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Furstenau Dep. 131:6-8, ECF # 36-2, PgID 1619 (\"I use the word we, but at that point it's a me.\").) Furstenau again stated at the Preliminary Injunction hearing that\n   \"there was no team\" in response to questions regarding an April 4, 2018 email wherein Bacarella states, \"Please reach out when appropriate as we remain interested in establishing a relationship with you and your\n   <em>\n    team.\n   </em>\n   \" (12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Furstenau Test. 157:2-18, PgID 2134.) (Emphasis added.) Furstenau testified, incredibly, \"There was, you know, again, there was the same - there was no team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Further, Furstenau's breach of the \"Conflicts of Interest\" provision in the Radiant Code of Ethics (stating in relevant part, \"[a]ny employee involved in a conflict of interest or a transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to conflict, must report the matter promptly to the employee's management\") by failing to disclose his plans to join BTX Detroit further mars his credibility. (Joint Ex. Book, Ex. 3; 12/14/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, O'Brien Test. 36:18-37:2, PgID 2014.) Radiant's forensic analysis of Furstenau's computer also concluded that Furstenau \"deleted files showing his undisclosed interest in BTX while still employed at Radiant, including a document titled 'BTX Freight Business Office 7 30 18.pdf.' \" (Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj., PgID 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   As for BTX Detroit, the Court finds Bacarella's testimony that he lacked any knowledge of the staffing at the new office inherently incredible. It bears repeating that there was an early \"handshake agreement\" with Furstenau \"that they were going to do business\" prior to Bacarella signing the BTX Detroit office space lease. At his deposition, Bacarella had stated that \"BTX would not open the branch without making sure it was staffed properly. Any branch.\" (Bacarella Dep. 45:12-12, ECF # 36-1, PgID 1385.) Despite documentary evidence to the contrary, he repeatedly denied any awareness that the former Radiant employees would follow Furstenau to BTX Detroit or the status of staffing efforts whatsoever. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   Q (Jeffers): \"Did you ever ask [Furstenau] whether he knew any qualified individuals who would be interested in coming over?\" A (Bacarella): \"No.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:8-11, PgID 1388); Q (Jeffers): \"Once you found out that those individuals were there, did you glean any information about how they got there?\" A (Bacarella): \"No, sir.\" (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 33:23-25, PgID 2269).) This is inherently incredible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Bacarella also wavers from acknowledging that he read Furstenau's August 14, 2018 email, claiming that he merely forwarded the email listing the employees to his human resources department without any discussion of the content. (12/21/18 Prelim. Inj. Hr'g, Bacarella Test. 70:20-71:21, PgID 2307-08.) The Court does not find this credible, based on testimony of BTX Founder and CEO Bacarella, who is clearly a \"hands on\" CEO who had six months of discussions and emails with Furstenau, who came to Detroit to locate and lease the office, and later flew down to Memphis to meet with Watkins, the only former Radiant employee with a non-compete contract.

Also, Furstenau forwarded approximately 300 emails from his Radiant computer to his personal Comcast Account. The more confidential information Furstenau possesses, the higher the likelihood that he will use that information on behalf of BTX Detroit, and the more likely the other preliminary injunction factors, particularly irreparable harm and public interest, will weigh in favor of granting a preliminary injunction. Radiant has identified the lists of customers, carriers and other confidential financial information attached to the emails in the Joint Exhibit Book as specific trade secrets, and has adduced sufficient evidence of mendacity in the testimony of Furstenau and Bacarella to establish likelihood of success on its claims of threatened misappropriation against both BTX Detroit and Furstenau.

You're willing to allow Counsel who is representing BTX to argue on behalf of yourself?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n    Attorney Kurt Kobiljak: That's correct, your Honor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n    Court: I just want to get his approval on the record.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n    Charles Furstenau: Yes, your Honor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    (12/21/18 Prelim.
