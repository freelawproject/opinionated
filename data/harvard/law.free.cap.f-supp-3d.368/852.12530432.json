INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The subpoena in this case was issued in relation to Defendant's \u00a7 2255 Motion. Defendant was convicted of RICO conspiracy following a four-month jury trial in which Defendant was represented by Santaguida. Defendant was sentenced to incarceration for 188 months. Defendant's direct appeal was denied,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this case, the Court considered Defendant's need for Santaguida's testimony, the probative value of that testimony, and the hardships that would befall Santaguida if he were required to testify at the \u00a7 2255 Motion's evidentiary hearing. The Court heard testimony from three witnesses: Santaguida's son, Rocco; Santaguida's treating physician, Dr. Sammartino, testifying as both a fact and expert witness; and Defendant's retained expert, Dr. Levin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1957, 1970. Expert reports and medical records were also submitted to the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1919, 1943.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendant's need\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To the extent Santaguida's testimony about what actions he did or did not take may be a probative area of inquiry, the merits of the \u00a7 2255 Motion would not turn on Santaguida's testimony. For one, the trial record speaks for itself. Moreover, Defendant has alleged the existence of independent, corroborative evidence of ineffective conduct, and has already adduced testimony from witnesses on such matters, including Edwin Jacob, Esq., counsel for one of the co-defendants at trial, and Victoria Clark, Santaguida's secretary. The value of Santaguida's own testimony about what he did or did not do before and during trial is therefore cumulative and certainly not crucial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Probative value\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite Defendant's insistence that Santaguida must testify, the value of Santaguida's testimony is minimal. Certain lines of inquiry are simply irrelevant. Defendant's underlying argument concerning Santaguida's cognitive abilities at trial overlooks that to determine whether Santaguida provided ineffective assistance of counsel, the inquiry is an\n   <em>\n    objective\n   </em>\n   one under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Again, the question is only\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   was trial counsel's performance ineffective, and it is not\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   was it so. Indeed, trial counsel may have a subpar performance on any given day for any number of reasons, but none of such reasons would be relevant to the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   inquiry. Similarly, Santaguida's subjective impressions about his own performance have no bearing on the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In any event, even if theoretically Santaguida's present-day testimony about his past conduct were relevant and non-cumulative, it still would be unreliable due to his current medical condition. Rocco Santaguida, Santaguida's son and caregiver, testified that Santaguida's cognitive abilities are so compromised that he needs almost round-the-clock assistance and supervision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1957 at 15, 22-24, 27-29. Rocco as well as Dr. Sammartino, Santaguida's treating physician, both testified as to Santaguida's confusion and inability to understand questions and the nature of events happening around him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 1970 at 21, 23-25. All of the witnesses, including Dr. Levin, Defendant's expert, agreed that Santaguida currently suffers from mid-severe dementia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   No. 1970 at 85. Based on this unrebutted testimony, the Court concludes that if called to give evidence at a hearing in 2019, Santaguida could not reliably interpret or understand questions posed concerning his prior actions as counsel; explain the basis for decisions he made in that capacity; comprehend or appreciate the nature of the proceeding before the Court; or otherwise meaningfully assist counsel or the Court with his testimony. Therefore, given Santaguida's cognitive impairment, his testimony would be of questionable relevance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 401 (\"Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Hardship to Santaguida\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to the hardships on Santaguida, the burden imposed on him by requiring his testimony would be unreasonable and oppressive. Santaguida would be placed in a confrontational setting, and subjected to accusatory if not out-right hostile questioning about his previous conduct. Based on the testimony adduced at the motion to quash hearing, it is highly likely that he would be confused and would not understand what was happening. In his current condition, Santaguida would be seriously adversely affected by testifying at a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Sufficiency of the record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that additional information is needed before the Court can rule on the Motion to Quash. The Court disagrees. Dr. Sammartino's first-hand medical findings and Rocco Santaguida's first-hand observations support Dr. Sammartino's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court also rejects what is really a late-stage attempt to seek and introduce further information that if at all relevant should have been sought at an earlier date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even assuming that this additional information would shed more light on Santaguida's present condition, a matter that is not at all apparent, Defendant is clearly out of time. Despite being in receipt of Dr. Sammartino's report for many months, which address Santaguida's cognitive impairment, Defendant has failed to explain why such information was not timely requested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Defendant overlooks the fact that Dr. Levin attended the first hearing on this matter where Dr. Sammartino's report was discussed, and that a four-month gap transpired between the first and second hearings. Thus, there can be no doubt that for many months, Defendant, his several counsel, and his expert were on notice about the issues that Defendant argues must now be further explored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant bore the burden to seek what he claims are relevant records. Having failed to do so in a timely fashion, he cannot be heard to complain the he needs those records to argue his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court concludes that under these circumstances, Santaguida has met his\n   heavy burden to support the motions to quash. The need for the testimony is minimal, and in any event, because Santaguida is so cognitively impaired, he is now unable to provide meaningful testimony. To require him to testify would be unreasonable, oppressive, and an undue burden, all for little or no probative value in return. The Court will grant the motion to quash the subpoena, and Santaguida will not, therefore, be required to testify at an evidentiary hearing in support of Defendant's \u00a7 2255 Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    25th\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    March, 2019,\n   </strong>\n   upon consideration of the Motion to Quash Subpoena to Non-Party Witness Joseph Santaguida (ECF No. 1919), and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion to Quash Subpoena to Non-Party Witness Joseph Santaguida (ECF No. 1919) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    AND IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Courts in this District and other Circuits have held that a would-be quasher carries a \"heavy burden of establishing that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable and oppressive.\"\n    <em>\n     Pennmont Sec. v.
