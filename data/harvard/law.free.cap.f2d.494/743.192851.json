Burns, Acting Commissioner of the State of Iowa Department of Social Services, and Michael Ryan, Director of the Scott County Department of Social Services, acting pursuant to their interpretation of the Employees Manual of the Iowa Department of Social Services, denied such assistance to plaintiffs-ap-pellees, who at the time of application were pregnant and who admittedly would become eligible for benefits once their children were born. Upon denial of benefits, plaintiffs brought this class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa charging that defendants\u2019 actions violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution, and, because inconsistent with \u00a7 406(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 606(a), also violated the Supremacy Clause. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and monetary damages for assistance wrongfully withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">Following a hearing, the district court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Alcala v. Burns, 362 F.Supp. 180 (S.D.Iowa 1973). Formal judgment was entered adjudging invalid defendants\u2019 denial of AFDC payments to plaintiffs and permanently enjoining defendants from further denying AFDC payments to pregnant women who are otherwise qualified for such payments. Defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\"> As a preliminary matter, we wish to clarify the basis for jurisdiction in the district court, although no question as to jurisdiction has been raised by the parties on appeal. <em>See </em>United States v. Redstone, 488 F.2d 300, 301 (8th Cir. 1973); Williams v. Rogers, 449 F.2d 513, 517 (8th Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 405 U.S. 926, 92 S.Ct. 976, 30 L.Ed.2d 799 (1972). As was the case in Doe v. Lukhard, 493 F.2d 54 (4th Cir. 1974), to our knowledge the initial circuit case to decide the \u201cunborn child\u201d question, plaintiffs here alleged a colorable claim of denial of equal protection within the scope of \u00a7 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, \u00a7 1343(3), and, accordingly, the district court possessed pendent jurisdiction of the Supremacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Clause claim. Further, whether or not a three-judge court would have been required to determine the constitutionality of defendants\u2019 interpretation of the welfare manual, <em>see </em>Doe v. Lukhard, <em>supra </em>at n. 4, a three-judge court is clearly not required to determine whether that interpretation conflicts with the Social Security Act. Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham, 382 U.S. 111, 86 S.Ct. 258, 15 L.Ed.2d 194 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The Social Security Act requires that \u201caid to families with dependent children * * * be furnished * * * to all eligible individuals * * 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">A triad of Supreme Court cases \u201cestablishes that, at least in the absence of congressional authorization for the exclusion clearly evidenced from the Social Security Act or its legislative history, a state eligibility standard that excludes persons eligible for assistance under federal AFDC standards violates the Social Security Act and is therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause.\u201d Townsend v. Swank, 404 U.S. 282, 286, 92 S.Ct. 502, 505, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971) . <em>See </em>King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968); Carleson v. Remillard, 406 U.S. 598, 92 S.Ct. 1932, 32 L.Ed.2d 352 (1972) .</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">If the <em>King, Townsend </em>and <em>Remillard </em>cases are to govern, it must first be determined that unborn children are \u201celigible,\u201d that is, that they are \u201cdependent children\u201d within the protection of the Act. On this point the courts have differed. Three district courts have ruled that an unborn child is not a \u201cdependent child.\u201d Mixon v. Keller, 372 F. Supp. 51 (M.D.Fla.1974); Murrow v. Clifford, Civ.No.114-73 (D.N.J., June 12, 1973); Parks v. Harden, 354 F. Supp. 620 (N.D.Ga.1973) (appeal pending Fifth Circuit). One circuit court and twelve district courts, including the court below, have decided that an unborn child is a \u201cdependent child.\u201d Doe v. Lukhard, <em>supra, </em>aff\u2019g 363 F.Supp. 823 (E.D.Ya.1973); Wisdom v. Norton, 372 F.Supp. 1190 (D.Conn.1974); Stuart v. Canary, 367 F.Supp. 1343 (N.D. Ohio 1973); Whitfield v. Minter, 368 F.Supp. 798 (D.Mass.1973); Carver v. Hooker, 369 F.Supp. 204 (D.N.H.1973); Tapia v. Vowell, Civ.No.73-B-169 (S.D. Tex., Nov. 14, 1973) (preliminary injunction granted pending decision of Parks v. Harden by the Fifth Circuit); Tillman v. Endsley, No. 73-1476-Civ-CF (S.D. Fla., Oct. 1, 1973) (preliminary injunction) ; Jones v. Graham, Civ.No.73-L235 (D.Neb., Sept. 5, 1973); Green v. Stanton, 364 F.Supp. 123 (N.D. Ind.1973); Harris v. Mississippi State Dept, of Public Welfare, 363 F.Supp. 1293 (N.D.Miss.1973); Alcala v. Burns, <em>supra; </em>Wilson v. Weaver, 358 F.Supp. 1147 (N.D.Ill.1972). Courts on both sides of the question have looked to the plain meaning of the word \u201cchild\u201d and reached opposite results. The Act itself and the legislative history are unhelpful. Of some note are the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) regulations implementing the Act which provide: \u201cFederal financial participation is available in: * * * (ii) Payments with respect to an unborn child when the fact of pregnancy has been determined by medical diagnosis * * 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(2). The regulations further provide: \u201cFederal financial participation * * * is available in any expenses incurred in establishing eligibility for AFDC, including expenses incident to obtaining necessary information to determine the existence of * * * pregnancy of a mother.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(3). HEW, however, takes the position that these regulations merely extend an option to the state of including unborn children within its plan and do not mandate such coverage. In fact, as of 1971, 18 states and the District of Columbia furnished AFDC benefits to unborn children, while 34 states and Puerto Rico did not. Brief for HEW as Amicus Curiae, Appendix B, Murrow v. Clifford, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>We seriously question the right of HEW, as opposed to the unquestioned right of Congress, to decide what benefits are optional. Clearly Congress possesses, and has exercised in the past, the power to give individual states an option to exclude children eligible under the federal standards. <em>See </em>Townsend v. Swank, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 287-289 and n. 5, 92 S.Ct. 502. But there is no indication that Congress has so acted with respect to unborn children.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We ask, as did the district court, from whence can HEW have derived the authority to bestow benefits, albeit supposedly optional benefits, upon unborn children if not from the eligibility provisions of the Social Security Act? We are inclined, in this respect, to accord substantial weight to HEW\u2019s understanding, implicit in the regulations, that unborn children are eligible. On the other hand, we are not permitted to defer to the agency\u2019s practice of making benefits to eligible persons optional. Townsend v. Swank, <em>supra </em>at 286, 92 S. Ct. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We believe that the district court correctly concluded that the term \u201cdependent child\u201d is broad enough to encompass an unborn child and that such coverage is consistent with the purposes of the Social Security Act. The <em>King, Townsend </em>and <em>Remillard </em>cases, then, determine that defendants\u2019 interpretation of the welfare manual, denying benefits to unborn children and their mothers, violates the Supremacy Clause and is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Although granting declaratory and injunctive relief, the district court refused to order retroactive payment of benefits, citing our case of Doe v. Gillman, 479 F.2d 646, 649 (8th Cir. 1973), petition for cert, filed sub nom. Burns v. Doe, 42 U.S.L.W. 3205 (U.S. Nov. 5, 1973) (No. 73-406), which avoided deciding whether the Eleventh Amendment prohibits retroactive payments by presuming that the Iowa welfare officials would follow their own regulations which, in the court\u2019s view, provided for retroactive payments. Now appellants request this court to decide directly the Eleventh Amendment question. We have already done so in Anderson v. Graham, 492 F.2d 986 (8th Cir. 1973), holding that \u201cthe Eleventh Amendment deprives the federal court of jurisdiction to award a money judgment against the State for * * * retroactive [AFDC] payments * *</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
