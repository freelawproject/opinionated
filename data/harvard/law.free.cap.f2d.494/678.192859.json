KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Although many find hot chocolate a delightful treat, appellant Ringers\u2019 Dutchocs had rather the opposite reaction when 2,405 cartons of chocolate arrived in New York in an overheated condition. Ringers\u2019 had ordered the chocolates from a German shipper, Gebruder Stollwerck AG, terms C.I.F. from Cologne, Germany to a public warehouse in New York. Stollwerck, in turn, had purchased an \u201cAll Risk\u201d policy of marine insurance from appellee Helvetia Swiss Fire Insurance which, at Stollwerek\u2019s request, was issued to \u201cthe bearer.\u201d The policy was delivered to Stollwerck by Helvetia in Cologne; Stollwerck paid the premium on the policy and then mailed it to Ringers\u2019 in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The chocolates arrived in New York harbor on board the S.S. \u201cS.L. 180\u201d on September 3, 1971. They were then transported to West Side Warehouses, Inc., arriving September 10. Upon discovering their damaged condition, Ringers\u2019 immediately notified Helvetia\u2019s designated claims survey agent in New York, Bertschmann &amp; Maloy. Bertsch-mann, in turn, requested Worman &amp; Co., Inc., surveyors, to examine the shipment. A copy of their report was sent to Ringers\u2019, which subsequently lodged a claim in the amount of $41,569.39 with Helve-tia at its home office in Switzerland. Helvetia promptly rejected the claim, and Ringers\u2019 brought suit against Helve-tia as well as the vessel, S.S. \u201cS.L. 180,\u201d and its owner, Sea-Land Service, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">On December 28, 1972, Helvetia moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was not amenable to service of process in New York, and had committed no act which would support substituted service of process upon the Superintendent of Insurance as agent for Hel-vetia pursuant to N.Y. Insurance Law \u00a7 59-a. Judge Brieant agreed and dismissed the complaint as to Helvetia in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Ringers\u2019 relies on \u00a7 59-a, subd. 2(a)(1) which authorizes substituted service upon a foreign insurer where there is \u201cissuance or delivery of contracts of insurance to residents of this state [New York] or to corporations authorized to do business therein\u201d by the foreign insurer. Judge Brieant correctly determined that this subsection did not apply, since the policy in this instance was neither \u201cissued\u201d nor \u201cdelivered\u201d to Ringers\u2019 by Helvetia. Moreover, we are of the view that although the insured \u201cbearer\u201d proved to be a corporation authorized to do business in New York, that fact nevertheless was not sufficient to confer jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 59-a, subd. 2(a)(1) because it was by no means certain, nor even likely, that the insured purchaser of the goods shipped to a New York warehouse would in fact be a corporation authorized to do business in New York. Thus, Helvetia\u2019s conduct did not comport with the conceptual underpinnings of long-arm jurisdiction \u2014 an implied consent to the constructive agency through the voluntary and, therefore, knowing act of insuring a corporation authorized to do business in New York. Cf. McLaughlin, Practice Commentary to CPLR 302 (basic long-arm statute), McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws of N. Y., c. 8 (1972) at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Nor can Ringers\u2019 find comfort in the broader, though not limitless, language of \u00a7 59-a, subd. 2(a)(4) which confers jurisdiction over the foreign insurer if he conducts \u201cany other transaction of business\u201d in New York. Although there is a dearth of case law interpreting this phrase in the context of \u00a7 59-a, there is analogous precedent interpreting the comparable phrase \u201ctransacts any business within the state\u201d under CPLR 302(a)(1). In Kramer v. Vogl, 17 N.Y.2d 27, 267 N.Y.S.2d 900, 215 N.E.2d 159 (1966), the Court of Appeals decided that the \u201cmere shipment\u201d of goods into New York was not sufficient \u201cpurposeful activity,\u201d Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. v. Barnes &amp; Reinecke, Inc., 15 N.Y. 2d 443, 457, 261 N.Y.S.2d 8, 18, 209 N.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>2d 68, cert denied, Estwing Mfg. Co. v. Singer, 382 U.S. 905, 86 S.Ct. 241, 15 L. Ed.2d 158 (1965), by the foreign shipper to subject him to \u00a7 302(a)\u2019s extraterritorial reach. Similarly, we believe that the insurance of goods \u201cmerely shipped\u201d into the State would not subject the foreign insurer to New York\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Our decision in Aquascutum of London, Inc. v. S.S. American Champion, 426 F.2d 205 (2d Cir. 1970), strongly urged upon us by appellant, is not to the contrary. In <em>Aquascutum, </em>we carefully distinguished between two types of foreign freight forwarders: those, like carriers, who were responsible for the physical delivery of the goods into New York; and those, like shippers, who were not. We found only the former to be engaged in \u201cthe transaction of business within the state\u201d required for long-arm jurisdiction. It is, quite simply, the physical nexus held determinative in <em>Aquascutum </em>which is absent here to link Helvetia to New York for jurisdictional purposes under \u00a7 59-a, subd. 2(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Ringers\u2019 contention that Helvetia\u2019s appointment of Bertschmann &amp; Maloy as its New York claims agent constitutes the necessary \u201cpurposeful activity\u201d to sustain long-arm jurisdiction lacks merit as well. Until quite recently, it was well-settled that, under New York law, a \u201ctrue agency\u201d relationship between the foreign defendant and the New York \u201cagent\u201d was required to establish the requisite connection with New York. Glassman v. Hyder, 23 N.Y.2d 354, 362, 296 N.Y.S.2d 783, 789, 244 N.E.2d 259 (1968); McLaughlin, <em>supra </em>at 66-67. Dean McLaughlin does suggest, however, that the following cryptic footnote in Parke-Bernet Galleries, Inc. v. Franklyn, 26 N.Y.2d 13, 19-20 n. 2, 308 N.Y.S.2d 337, 341-42 n. 2, 256 N.E.2d 506, 509 (1970) might augur change:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">The present case differs materially from others, relied upon by the defendant, in which we have denied jurisdiction. . . . It is sufficient to point out that in each of those cases, all of which involved agents who were suing their principals, the plaintiff was relying on his own activities within the State, and not those of the defendant, as the basis of jurisdiction. In other words, in no one of these cases had the defendant himself engaged in purposeful activity within the State <em>nor had the cause of action arisen out of transactions with third parties conducted through an agent. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">And, in his Supplementary Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons.Laws of N.Y. Cumulative Pocket Suppl. for 1973-1974, pp. 9-10, Dean McLaughlin, on the basis primarily of a decision by Justice Gellinoff in Legros v. Irving, N.Y.L.J. (May 22, 1973), p. 18, col. 4<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (jurisdiction sustained over foreign defendant, Elmyr de Hory, in libel action based on book written by de Hory\u2019s \u201cagent,\u201d Clifford Irving, published in New York) concludes that where a third party\u2019s complaint against a foreign principal arises out of the acts of his \u201cagent\u201d in New York, those acts will suffice for the jurisdictional requirement of \u201cpurposeful activity,\u201d without regard to whether the representative is an agent or an independent contractor. Yet, even if Dean McLaughlin\u2019s expansive view of New York\u2019s jurisdictional reach has merit, it would not extend to Helvetia in light of the facts presented in this case. The Certificate of Insurance explicitly states that Bertschmann &amp; Maloy were authorized to survey and report the amount of damages <em>only, </em>not to pay or reject claims. Indeed, after receiving the survey report, Ringers\u2019 filed its claim with Helvetia in Switzerland, and Helvetia in turn rejected the claim from its home office in Switzerland. Accordingly, since the alleged breach of contract which precipitated this action emanated exclusively from Helvetia in Switzerland, and Bertschmann &amp; Maloy appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>to be the archetypal independent contractor, its designation alone would not constitute the \u201cpurposeful activity\u201d by Helvetia necessary for long-arm jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">One final note: Judge Brieant refers in his opinion to a \u201cforum clause\u201d in the Certificate of Insurance which restricts jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of the insurance contract to Germany (where the policy was issued) or Switzerland (the location of Helvetia\u2019s home office). Helvetia urges us, in the alternative, to affirm the dismissal on the ground that such clauses are \u201cprima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to be \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the circumstances,\u201d The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 10, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 1913, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972). We do not reach the question of the clause\u2019s applicability, however, for we agree with Judge Brieant that dismissal is required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2) for lack of jurisdiction over Helvetia.
