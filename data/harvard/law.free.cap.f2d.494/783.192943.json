On appeal he challenges his conviction on the following grounds: (1) the indictment was insufficient because it did not allege that he \u201cunlawfully\u201d possessed and distributed the heroin; (2) the prosecutor\u2019s closing statements characterizing the exchange of heroin as a \u201csale\u201d prejudiced Miranda\u2019s right to a fair trial because the Government failed to prove a sale took place; (3) Miranda\u2019s due process rights were infringed by the statutory definition equating distribution with delivery; (4) the indictment was defective because it did not specify where the offense was committed, the names of the parties involved, and that Miranda was \u201cWimpy\u201d; (5) Miranda was denied the effective assistance of counsel; and (6) the District Court insufficiently charged the jury as to the offense since there was no instruction that the possession of heroin must be contrary to law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Miranda was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued in response to a grand jury indictment charging \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, aka \u201cWimpy\u201d with two violations of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The indictment was based on a heroin transaction between Miranda and undercover policeman Steven Widener. Widener met Miranda in the company of several other people, all of whom became interested in purchasing some heroin. After taking everyone\u2019s order, Miranda collected the money, returned after a short absence during which he ostensibly got the heroin, and made delivery. The packet for which Widener had given Miranda $10 was found to contain heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Whether Indictment Charges a Crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Miranda argues that his indictment is defective because it does not charge a crime. Each count of the indictment alleges the statute and then alleges the fact of possession with intent to distribute, as to Count I, and the fact of distribution, as to Count II, without alleging the unlawfulness of that conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Miranda contends that \u00a7 841 (a)(1) recognizes that possession with intent to distribute and distribution can be lawful as well as unlawful because of the opening phrase \u201cExcept as authorized by this subchapter.\u201d Section 841 (a)(1) provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">(a) Except as authorized by this sub-chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014 (1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Relying on the authority that it is necessary to allege that the conduct charged was done unlawfully if it may be either lawful or unlawful, Miranda contends that his indictment does not allege a crime. He argues that since the distribution of heroin is not inherently illegal but is only made so by a statute which recognizes exceptions to its prohibitions, \u201cillegal\u201d distribution becomes an essential element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">An indictment must be read in its entirety. United States v. Wilshire Oil Co., 427 F.2d 969 (10th Cir. 1970). The citation in the indictment to the United States Code section upon which the averred criminal violation was based, viewed in relation to the averred activity, was sufficient to indicate that Miranda was charged with a violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Miranda\u2019s \u201clawful-unlawful\u201d argument must be viewed in light of his sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>tus under the present law. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq., \u201cprovides for control by the Justice Department of problems related to drug abuse through registration of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and all others in the legitimate distribution chain,' and makes transactions outside the legitimate distribution chain illegal.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 91-1444, 91st Cong. 2d Sess., 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4566, 4569 (1970) (hereinafter House Report). Distribution of a controlled substance is made illegal unless the person is authorized to distribute by the statute. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841; United States v. Pruitt, 487 F.2d 1241, 1245 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Authorization to distribute is obtained by appropriate registration with the Attorney General. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 822. Employees of registered distributors, common carriers, and ultimate users are exempted from registration if their activities are within the legitimate distribution chain. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 822(c); House Report, 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4566, 4606 (1970). Thus, with the exception of three narrowly drawn catagories or classes of people within the legitimate distribution chain, all distribution must take place under the auspices of an appropriate registration certificate. As the prefatory phrase of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 makes clear, such distribution is the exception to the penal provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Miranda argues that since some distribution without registration is lawful, <em>i. e. </em>employees of registered distributors, common carriers, and ultimate users, the indictment must aver that he was not one of the exempted persons or that his activity was unlawful. Section 885(a) (1) of 21 U.S.C.A. relieves the Government of the burden of negativing in the indictment exceptions to unlawful distribution :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">(a)(1) It shall not be necessary for the United States to negative any exemption or exception set forth in this subchapter in any . . . indictment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">The defendant has the burden of affirmatively asserting any defense based upon an exception to the unlawful distribution of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">An averment in Miranda\u2019s indictment that his activity is \u201cunlawful\u201d need not be included either. Distribution without registration is only permitted by certain categories of people. Miranda is not included within any of those categories, nor is there anything in the indictment which would mislead him in thinking that he was within an exempted category.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">Miranda\u2019s situation is different from the indicted defendant in United States v. Leigh, 487 F.2d 206 (5th Cir. 1973). In <em>Leigh, </em>the indictment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-14\">described the defendant as a medical doctor (M.D.) and charged that he \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally distribute and cause to be distributed [the particular prohibited substance] by means of a prescription signed by said defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">487 F.2d at 207. By identifying Leigh as a medical doctor, the indictment placed him within a class of persons who are registered to dispense controlled substances as a matter of right. 21 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 822; House Report, 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4566, 4590 (1970). By further averring that a prescription was used to distribute the controlled substance, the activity alleged on the face of the indictment could be legal. Thus as shown in the indictment, the defendant was a person who could lawfully distribute. The indictment was dismissed because it did not allege that the act of distribution was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">Miranda, however, does not fall within one of the registered or exempted categories of people and there is nothing in the indictment which raises this possibility. The distribution of heroin by Miranda as alleged in the indictment could not be lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Thus, Miranda\u2019s relia3ice on Middlebrooks v. United States, 23 F.2d 244 (5th Cir. 1928), is misplaced. <em>Middle-brooks </em>holds that \u201cwhere an act may be either lawful or unlawful . . . the indictment must allege that it was done unlawfully.\u201d 23 F.2d at 245. Middle-brooks was indicted and convicted of conspiring to manufacture intoxicating liquors. Such activity, however, was illegal only if the liquors were for beverage purposes. The indictment was found insufficient since it only averred that the liquors were \u201cfit for beverage purposes,\u201d a phrase which the Court found incorporated both legal and illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In Schmidt v. United States, 286 F.2d 11 (5th Cir. 1961), the Court discussed the necessity of alleging that the taking of money from a bank by intimidation, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a), was unlawful. Schmidt\u2019s indictment charged that he \u201cknowingly and willfully, and by intimidating [the bank employee] took from the presence of [said employee] $2,000.-00 which said currency belonged to the Bank . . . .\u201d 286 F. 2d at 12. Although instances of lawful intimidation can be envisioned, the Court held that the failure of the indictment to use the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d did not render the indictment fatally defective. <em>See </em>Braswell v. United States, 224 F.2d 706 (10th Cir.), cert, denied, 350 U.S. 845, 76 S.Ct. 86, 100 L.Ed. 752 (1955); Hickman v. United States, 170 F.2d 353 (5th Cir. 1948); Musey v. United States, 37 F.2d 673 (5th Cir. 1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Since Miranda could not make a lawful distribution under \u00a7 841(a)(1) or any of its exceptions, it was not necessary to expressly allege that the acts committed were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Prosecutor\u2019s Argument to Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Miranda contends that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the heroin transaction as a \u201csale\u201d in his closing statement. He contends there was no evidence introduced which would establish that a sale took place between Miranda and Widener and that Miranda was merely the \u201cprocuring agent\u201d for Widener under Adams v. United States, 220 F.2d 297 (5th Cir. 1955). Since Miranda did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements at the time of trial, the standard on review is that of plain error. Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The evidence established that on their first meeting, Miranda asked Widener if he wished to purchase some heroin. After a favorable response, Miranda directed Widener to the purchase area, collected the money and returned with the heroin. These facts might support an inference that a sale took place between Miranda and Widener and disspell Miranda\u2019s argument. The prosecutor\u2019s characterization thereof as a sale did not amount to plain error. If error at all, it was harmless at most.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">Due Process.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Miranda attacks the statutory definition of \u201cdistribute\u201d as \u201cdeliver\u201d in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 802(11) on due process grounds. This section defines distribute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-15\">The term \u201cdistribute\u201d means to deliver (other than by administering or dispensing) a controlled substance. The term \u201cdistributor\u201d means a person who so delivers a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">Miranda claims that \u201cthe plain meaning of distribute is to divide a whole into parts or to take a number of items and dispense them,\u201d and the statutory definition contrary to the plain meaning is an equivocal warning of the acts prohibited. The statutory definition is clear and we find no merit to Miranda\u2019s contention. <em>See </em>United States v. Worko-pich, 479 F.2d 1142, 1147 (5th Cir. 1973). This Court has held the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq., to be constitutional on several occasions. United States v. Dupart, 483 F.2d 1393 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Leisner, 469 F.2d 336 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>1972), cert, denied, 410 U.S. 942, 93 S. Ct. 1374, 35 L.Ed.2d 609 (1973) ; United States v. Lopez, 459 F.2d 949 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, Llerena v. United States, 409 U.S. 878, 93 S.Ct. 130, 34 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Specificity of Indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Miranda challenges the sufficiency of the indictment on the ground that it did not specify where the offense was committed, the names of the parties involved, or that Miranda was the \u201cWimpy\u201d charged by the grand jury. The validity of an indictment under Rule 7(c), F.R.Crim.P. is determined by practical, not technical considerations. United States v. Miller, 491 F.2d 638, 649 (5th Cir. 1974). In Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 52 S.Ct. 417, 76 L.Ed. 861 (1932), the Supreme Court established the guidelines for testing the sufficiency of the indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, \u201cand sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet, and, in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense, whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">285 U.S. at 431. <em>See </em>Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962); United States v. Miller, 491 F.2d 638 (5th Cir. 1974); United States v. Newsom, 493 F.2d 439 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">We have held that Miranda\u2019s indictment contains the essential elements of the offense charged. We hold it sufficient to apprise Miranda of what he must be prepared to meet and to protect him from the hazards of double jeopardy. Failure to specify the precise location of the offense is not fatal if the district is alleged. United States v. Tomasetta, 429 F.2d 978 (1st Cir. 1970). The purchaser\u2019s name in a narcotics transaction need not be averred. Snowden v. United States, 384 F.2d 357 (5th Cir. 1967), cert, denied, 390 U.S. 966, 88 S.Ct. 1075, 19 L.Ed.2d 1169 (1968). Use of an alias in an indictment is not error. United States v. Skolek, 474 F.2d 582 (10th Cir. 1973). <em>See generally, 1 </em>C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 124 (1969); 1 L. Orfield, Criminal Procedure Under the Federal Rules \u00a7\u00a7 7.99-7.101 (1966). A bill of particulars was available to clarify any questions that Miranda may have had concerning the indictment. <em>See </em>United States v. Blakely, 491 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1974). Since the indictment apprised Miranda with reasonable certainty of the charge against him, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Effective Assistance of Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Miranda\u2019s brief asserts ineffective assistance of counsel both before and during trial alleging: refusal to discuss the strategy of the case with the defendant, persistently advising Miranda to plead guilty, refusal to subpoena three crucial witnesses, failure to file notice of appeal, and misinforming Miranda\u2019s sister that the appeal was pending when in fact no notice of appeal had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">A careful review of the record reveals these contentions to be without merit and that Miranda was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. Both of his court-appointed attorneys worked diligently in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">Jury Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">Miranda alleges error in the District Court\u2019s jury instructions because there was no charge that possession must be contrary to law. First, Miranda did not object to the charge at trial. Second, since he did not introduce any evidence placing him within the exception to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1), there was no need for the District Court to instruct as to lawful distribution. The District Court fully charged the jury concerning the essential elements of the offense and we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">.
