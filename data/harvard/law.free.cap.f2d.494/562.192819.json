Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). We conclude after reading the record, briefs, and supplemental briefs that United States v. Russell is the controlling law in this appeal and that the defense of entrapment was not available to McGrath. We also conclude that the government agents\u2019 involvement here does not amount to the type of outrageous conduct, \u201cshocking to the universal sense of justice,\u201d which <em>Russell </em>suggests might preclude prosecution on due process principles. See 411 U.S. at 431-432, 93 S.Ct. at 1643. We accordingly affirm the conviction as to both counts.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-14\"> We previously dealt with defendant\u2019s challenges based on suppression of the incriminating sales receipts and the excessive sentence in the context of the affirmance of the conspiracy count. See n. 2 of our original opinion. 468 F.2d at 1031. The refusal to suppress the incriminating sales receipts was also harmless error, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it was error, in the context of the substantive offense. We also hold that the district judge did not abuse his discretion under the circumstances of this case in sentencing defendant to a seven years prison sentence to run concurrently with the three years sentence on the conspiracy count that we previously affirmed. Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s unsupported contention that the indictment should have been dismissed due to the grand jury\u2019s failure to identify David Leo Binns as a named co-conspirator.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
