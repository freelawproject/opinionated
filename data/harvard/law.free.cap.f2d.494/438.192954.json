WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">This is an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) from a district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of Matson Terminals, Inc., limiting Matson\u2019s liability as a stevedore to a maximum of $500, as distinguished from the claimed damage in excess of $14,000. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-19\">S.N.T.F.L.I. Gonrand delivered to defendant Italpacific Lines in Italy an industrial dry cleaning machine for delivery to Vancouver, B. C. Labor trouble at the destination required delivery instead at Tacoma. At the time of the discharge, appellant Tessler Brothers was the holder in due course of the bill of lading that Italpacific had initially issued to Gonrand. Matson Terminals unloaded the cargo. Tessler Brothers, alleging that Matson damaged the machine in excess of $14,000, sued Italpa-cific for breach of the contract of carriage, and sued Matson for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">Italpacific and Matson claimed that liability, if any, was limited to $500 under \u00a7 4(5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) [46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(5)] and/or the terms of the bill of lading, which contained no declaration of value of the machine. Tessler and Matson moved for summary judgment on the issue of the limitation of Mat-son\u2019s liability to $500. A ruling in Mat-son\u2019s favor prompted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-21\">Clause 1 of the bill of lading provided that the bill would be subject to the provisions of COGSA, \u00a7 4(5) of which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, <em>unless the noc-ture and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading. </em>This declaration, if embodied in the bill of lading, shall be prima fa-cie evidence, but shall not be conclusive on the carrier. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Matson claims that its liability as stevedore is limited under \u00a7 4(5) by virtue of clause 21 of the bill of lading.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This clause, which purports to extend protections provided for the carrier to those employed by the carrier, is commonly known as a \u201cHimalaya clause.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mat-son also claims the benefit of clause 18 of the bill of lading, which contains substantially the same provisions limiting liability as \u00a7 4(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Tessler raises two principal issues on appeal. It contends, first, that an ocean carrier (Italpacific in this case) cannot extend its own limitation of liability to independent stevedores by using a Himalaya clause in a bill of lading. Secondly, it contends that, even if Himalaya clauses are valid, the bill of lading in this case does not, when strictly construed, extend the limitation of liability to the stevedore. We. conclude that both contentions are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">THE EXTENSION OF COGSA LIMITATIONS TO STEVEDORES</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Whether a stevedore may benefit from the limitation of liability provisions in COGSA or in an ocean bill of lading has been the subject of considerable litigation. In Robert C. Herd &amp; Co. v. Kra-will Machinery Corp., 359 U.S. 297, 79 S. Ct. 766, 3 L.Ed.2d 820 (1959), the Supreme Court considered the issue in order to resolve an intercircuit conflict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In <em>Herd, </em>cargo interests sued a stevedore for damages resulting from the stevedore\u2019s dropping of a press being loaded for foreign shipment. Both the COGSA provisions and the applicable bill of lading limited the liability only of the carrier and the ship, making no reference to agents or independent contractors of the carrier. COGSA defines the term \u201ccarrier\u201d to include \u201cthe owner or the charterer who enters into a contract of carriage with a shipper.\u201d [46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(a)]. The Supreme Court held that neither the language, the legislative history, nor the environment of the Act shows any intent by Congress to regulate stevedores. 359 U.S. at 302, 79 S.Ct. 766, 3 L.Ed.2d 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">The Court next considered whether the parties had intended in the bill of lading to limit the stevedore\u2019s liability. It found that the bill of lading referred only to the \u201ccarrier\u2019s liability\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>showed no intention to limit the liability of stevedores, an intention that could easily have been expressed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court noted that the unlimited liability of an agent for his own negligence has long been embedded in the law, and anything in derogation of this principle, whether statute or private contract, must be strictly construed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Tessler mounts a four-pronged attack on the validity of Himalaya clauses. It contends, first, that <em>Herd, </em>should not be read to indicate that parties may properly extend limitations of liability to stevedores by clearly expressing their intent to do so in the bill of lading. We reject this contention, as have other courts that have considered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The <em>Herd </em>court concluded that the stevedore\u2019s liability was not limited because no statute limited it and because the stevedore \u201cwas not a party to nor a beneficiary of the contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier, and hence its liability was not limited by that contract.\u201d 359 U.S. at 308, 79 S.Ct. at 773. We and other courts interpret this to mean that under certain circumstances parties to a contract of carriage may limit a stevedore\u2019s liability, but only if the intent to do so is clearly expressed.

Tiber, 450 F.2d 285, 286 (5th Cir. 1971); Cabot Corp. v. S. S. Mormacscan, 441 F.2d 476, 478 (2d Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 404 U. S. 855, 92 S.Ct. 104, 30 L.Ed.2d 96 (1971); Dorsid Trading Co. v. S/S Fletero, 342 F.Supp. 1, 6 (S.D.Tex.1972); Carle &amp; Montanari, Inc. v. American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., 275 F. Supp. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d mem., 386 F.2d 839 (2d Cir. 1967), cert, denied, 390 U.S. 1013, 88 S.Ct. 1263, 20 L.Ed.2d 162 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Tessler next contends that seven years before the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Herd, </em>the Court held void any bill of lading clauses which deprive cargo interests of any portion of their rights against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">In United States v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., 343 U.S. 236, 72 S.Ct. 666, 96 L.Ed. 907 (1952), the Court held invalid \u201cBoth-to-Blame\u201d clauses, often contained in the ocean bills of lading. Provisions in COGSA, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2) (a), and the Harter Act, 46 U. S.C. \u00a7 192, took away, under some circumstances, the right of a cargo owner to sue his own carrier for cargo damages caused by the negligent navigation of the carrier\u2019s servants or agents. When two negligent vessels collided, however, the cargo owner could still recover from the non-carrying vessel. In a both-to-blame situation, each carrier was liable, vis-a-vis each other, for one-half the total damage, and the non-carrying vessel was entitled to include in the total the sums it had paid to owners of cargo in the carrying vessel. The carrying vessel thus ultimately became responsible for one-half the damage suffered by its cargo. The \u201cBoth-to-Blame\u201d clause in <em>Atlantic Mutual </em>granted the carrying vessel the right to recoup those sums from its cargo owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">The Supreme Court held this clause invalid, prompted by \u201cthe controlling rule that without congressional authority [carriers] cannot stipulate against their own negligence or that of their agents or servants.\u201d 343 U.S. at 242, 72 S.Ct. at 669. Given a cargo owner\u2019s right to recover from the non-carrying vessel, and the right of that vessel to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>cover one-half its liability to cargo from the negligent carrying vessel, a stipulation in the bill of lading requiring cargo to indemnify the carrying vessel for sums it paid the non-carrying vessel violated the rule against a carrier stipulating against its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Tessler argues that this same reasoning condemns the contractual extension, not authorized by Congress in COGSA, of a limitation of liability to stevedores.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Tessler\u2019s argument is off base. True, a carrier cannot immunize itself from responsibility for its own negligence. It may, however, <em>limit </em>the amount of its liability if the limitation is tied to an agreed value of goods, subject to' carriage at a specific freight rate, with the cargo owner having the option of declaring and recovering a higher value if it pays a higher rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">This distinction between a limitation on liability and an exemption from liability is crucial. A limitation, unlike an exemption, does not induce negligence. Compensation for carriage is based on the value of the cargo agreed on by the carrier and the cargo owner and, unless immunized by act of Congress [see 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)], a carrier who negligently damages cargo must respond in that value for its negligence. Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 112 U.S. 331, 340-341, 5 S.Ct. 151, 28 L.Ed. 717 (1884); The Ansaldo San Giorgio I v. Rheinstrom Brothers Co., 294 U.S. 494, 496-497, 55 S.Ct. 483, 79 L.Ed. 1016 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Section 4(5) of COGSA [46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(5)] limits a carrier\u2019s liability to $500 unless a higher amount is inserted in the bill of lading.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Atlantic Mutual, </em>while invalidating clauses that <em>exempt </em>carriers or their agents from liability for their negligence, is inapposite to a discussion of the validity of Himalaya clause in this case, which in effect purports to extend to a carrier\u2019s agents and servants all defenses provided for the carrier, including COGSA\u2019s limitation of liability. For this reason, it is not surprising that <em>Atlantic Mutual, </em>as Tes-sler itself notes, is not mentioned by the Supreme Court in <em>Herd </em>or by other courts that have considered the validity of Himalaya clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">A significant restriction on a carrier\u2019s right to limit liability to an amount less than the actual loss sustained is that the carrier must give the shipper \u201ca fair opportunity to choose between higher or lower liability by paying a correspondingly greater or lesser charge. . . . \u201d New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Co. v. Nothna-gle, 346 U.S. 128, 135, 73 S.Ct. 986, 990, 97 L.Ed. 1500 (1953); Sommer Corp. v. Panama Canal Co., 475 F.2d 292, 298 (5th Cir. 1973), and cases cited therein. Clause 18 of the bill of lading in question provides that the $500 limitation exists \u201cunless the nature of the goods and a valuation higher than $500, shall have been declared in writing by the shipper upon delivery to the carrier and inserted in the bill of lading and extra freight paid if required. . . . \u201d Section 4(5) of COGSA, to which the bill of lading is expressly subject, has a similar provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Tessler contends there is no evidence that the shipper was offered a choice of rates, one with the limitation and another without it. The provisions in the bill of lading and COGSA are prima facie evidence of the opportunity to avoid the limitation, however, and it is Tessler\u2019s burden to prove that such an opportunity did not in fact exist. Petition of Isbrandtsen Co., 201 F.2d 281, 285 (2d Cir. 1953). Tessler did not carry this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">Tessler\u2019s third argument against the validity of a Himalaya clause is that \u00a7 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>of COGSA describes the only situations, none of which is present here, in which protections may be extended beyond the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Section 6 [46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306] <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides that in special cases a carrier, its agents, and a shipper may enter into \u201cany agreement\u201d as to their respective rights and liabilities. Tessler contends that the section indicates congressional intent to prohibit any other extension of protections not provided in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">This argument does not withstand analysis. Section 6 concerns private, as opposed to common, carriage of goods by sea. It allows carriers and shippers to agree to <em>any terms </em>as to liability and immunity. Therefore, it even authorizes a total exemption from liability, although \u00a7 3(8) of COGSA would void such an exemption in an ordinary transaction. The context of \u00a7 6 simply does not support the inference that a carrier, cannot, in ordinary cases, extend a statutory limitation of liability to its agents, merely because, in special situations, it can totally exempt itself, and possibly its agents, from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">Tessler\u2019s final argument is that the bill of lading is a contract of adhesion and that only persons who give \u201cunderstanding consent\u201d to such contracts may be bound thereby. <em>See </em>Cabot Corp. v. S. S. Mormacscan, 441 F.2d 476, 478 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Congress passed the Harter Act and COGSA to counteract the persistent efforts of carriers, who are the drafters of ocean bills of lading, to insert all embracing exceptions to liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ency<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>clopedia Britannica, Inc. v. S. S. Hong Kong Producer, 422 F.2d 7, 11 (2d Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 964, 90 S. Ct. 998, 25 L.Ed.2d 255 (1970). One of the specific purposes of COGSA was to obviate the necessity for a shipper to make a detailed study of the fine print clauses of a carrier\u2019s regular bill of lading on each occasion before shipping a package. <em>Id. </em>422 F.2d at 14; H.R.Rep. No. 2218, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">We recognize that the content of ocean bills of lading is for all practical purposes completely within the carrier\u2019s power, subject to the provisions of COGSA, and that contracts purporting to limit liability must be strictly construed. Robert C. Herd <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Krawill Machinery Corp., 359 U.S. 297, 305, 79 S. Ct. 766, 3 L.Ed.2d 820 (1959); Sommer Corp. v. Panama Canal Co., 475 F.2d 292, 296 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Even viewed in this light, we cannot agree that Tessler gave no \u201cunderstanding consent\u201d to the bill of lading. Tessler does not contend that it was unaware of the provisions in question;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nor did it present evidence to the district court adequately explaining its failure to declare a higher value, as the bill of lading provided that it could, and thereby increase the liability of the carrier and the carrier\u2019s agents, or to insure itself against the loss that occurred. In the absence of such evidence, we are reluctant to remedy what might be nothing more than lack of foresight.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">DOES THE BILL OF LADING EXTEND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO STEVEDORES?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Tessler contends that, assuming the validity of Himalaya clauses in general, the bill of lading here involved does not limit Matson\u2019s liability. When strictly construed, Tessler argues, the bill does not extend the limitation of liability to independent contractors, and, in any event, stevedores are not covered unless the bill of lading mentions them expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Clause 21 of the bill of lading has three distinct limbs:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> first, it exonerates from liability to the shipper any \u201cservant or agent of the Carrier (including every independent contractor .)\u201d; second, it extends the carrier\u2019s rights and limitations of liability to \u201cevery such servant or agent of the Carrier . . . \u201d; and, third, it provides that the carrier is deemed to be acting on behalf of \u201chis servants or agents . . . (including independent contractors as aforesaid). . . .\u201d Because of the term \u201cindependent contractors\u201d is not used in the second of these three provisions, Tess-ler contends that this provision is inapplicable to independent contractors and, thus, to. Matson.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">Although we strictly construe Clause 21,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we do not read it as narrowly as Tessler would have us. Reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the clause as a whole, it is apparent that \u201csuch servant or agent\u201d in the second provision refers to the phrase in the first provision \u201cservant or agent of the Carrier (including every independent contractor . . . ).\u201d The word \u201csuch\u201d in the second provision emphasizes that a modification of \u201cservant or agent\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cincluding every independent contractor\u201d \u2014 was intended to apply in the second provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The format of Clause 21 is very similar to the bill of lading clauses considered in Bernard Screen Printing Co. v. Meyer Line, 328 F.Supp. 288 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) , aff\u2019d, 464 F.2d 934 (2d Cir. 1972) , cert, denied, 410 U.S. 910, 93 S. Ct. 966, 35 L.Ed.2d 272 (1973), and Carle &amp; Montanari, Inc. v. American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., 275 F. Supp. 76 (S.D.N.Y.1967), aff\u2019d mem., 386 F.2d 839 (2d Cir. 1967), cert, denied, 390 U.S. 1013, 88 S.Ct. 1263, 20 L.Ed.2d 162 (1968).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In both cases, the relevant clause first purported to exonerate completely from liability specifically named legal entities. The second provision stated the limitation of liability ; however, in listing those to whom it extended, the provision did not repeat the parties set forth in the first provision, but merely used a phrase that referred to those parties. The courts in <em>Bernard Screen </em>and <em>Carle &amp; Montanari </em>held, as do we now, that this format is sufficient to extend the limitation of liability in the second provision to the specific parties listed in the first provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Tessler\u2019s final contention is that, even if the bill of lading in question extends to independent contractors, it does not extend to stevedores, who must be mentioned expressly. Relying on Cabot Corp. v. S. S. Mormacscan, 441 F.2d 476, 478 (2d Cir. 1971), Tessler argues that stevedores are protected only if the word \u201cstevedores\u201d is included in the bill of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\"><em>Cabot </em>involved a bill of lading limiting the liability of the \u201ccarrier,\u201d which was defined as \u201call persons rendering services in connection with performance of this contract.\u201d The defendant stevedore damaged plaintiff\u2019s goods while loading cargo belonging to another shipper. The Second Circuit, finding the language of the bill of lading ambiguous, refused to extend the limitation of liability to the stevedore. \u201cOne can only guess,\u201d the court stated, \u201c . whether \u2018all persons rendering services\u2019 is designed to include stevedores loading the goods of another shipper.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">Whether a bill of lading extends limitations of liability to stevedores depends on whether \u201cthe clarity of the language used expresses such to be the understanding of the contracting parties.\u201d Robert C. Herd &amp; Co. v. Krawill Machinery Corp., 359 U.S. at 305, 79 S.Ct. at 771. Two circuits have recently held that a bill of lading mentioning independent contractors clearly includes stevedores. Bernard Screen Printing Corp. v. Meyer Line, 464 F.2d 934, 936 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1972), cert, denied, 410 U. S. 910, 93 S.Ct. 966, 35 L.Ed.2d 272 (1973); Secrest Machine Co. v. S. S. Tiber, 450 F.2d 285, 287 (5th Cir. 1971). The language of the district court in <em>Bernard Screen </em>is instructive:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">To exclude \u201cstevedores,\u201d who are independent contractors, from the scope of the more inclusive term would, in ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>feet, be holding that parties by using the more inclusive term had accomplished the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">328 F.Supp. at 290.

The amount of litigation that has surrounded the validity of Himalaya clauses leads us to believe that such clauses are not at all uncommon in modern ocean bills of lading. The Uniform Ocean Bill of Lading does not contain a Himalaya clause. It does, however, provide in Clause 17 for a choice of rates in language quite similar to that contained in Clause 18 of the bill of lading at issue. W.

Rather, it contends that the second portion of Clause 21, extending the carrier\u2019s rights and immunities to \u201csuch servant or agent,\u201d controls and extends the carrier\u2019s $500 limitation of liability to Matson.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">We are at a loss to explain why the first portion is even in the bill of lading if it is not meant to have some effect.
