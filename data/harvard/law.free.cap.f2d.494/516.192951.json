GULLAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">Q. Mr. Roth, I noticed while you were testifying you were referring to a file, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-15\">Q. I believe that you have the file in your possession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-17\">Q. Could I see that, please ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-18\">MR. BYRNE: Your Honor, we will allow him to observe the page that he read the vehicle identification number off of, but we would object to him having to turn over his entire investigative file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-19\">MR. GULLAGE: I don\u2019t know what he has got in his possession. THE COURT: You can look at what he was looking at but not everything he has got with him. MR. GULLAGE: He simply had the file, of course, Your Honor, while he was testifying, referring to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-20\">THE COURT: I won\u2019t let him show you anything unless you show what he was. looking at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajo\">But if you want to shorten it you can ask him what he is looking at, and you can see what he was looking at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-22\">MR. GULLAGE: Of course, my motion, Your Honor, requests just to see the file itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-23\">THE COURT: Well, I overrule that motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">It is apparent from this record that Witness Roth, the FBI agent, refreshed his recollection from file material and the Court ruled the defense attorney could look at the material so used. Defense counsel neither renewed his request fo.r inspection, nor propounded any questions to Roth on <em>voir dire, </em>nor asked the Court to make an <em>in camera </em>inspection of Roth\u2019s file. There is nothing in the record to indicate the existence of a statement within the meaning of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500, which might require an <em>in camera </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-25\">On this state of the record, the defense attorney was entitled to look at \u201cthe notes, papers and memoranda which were used by the witness for the purpose of refreshing his memory.\u201d Montgomery v. United States, 203 F.2d 887, 894 (5th Cir. 1953). <em>See </em>Marcus v. United States, 422 F.2d 752 (5th Cir. 1970); Jackson v. United States, 250 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. 1958). The Court correctly granted this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-26\">The Jencks Act affords no ground for reversal because there is no evidence to indicate the existence of Jencks Act material, although the defense was given the opportunity by the trial court to develop the record on this point. We perceive no ground for a determination that defense counsel was entitled to review the entire file of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
