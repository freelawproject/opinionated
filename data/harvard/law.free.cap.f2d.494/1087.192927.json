In No. 72-1994, Local 2188, IBEW v. NLRB and Western Electric Co. and No. 72-1995, Local 1974, IBEW v. NLRB and Western Electric Co., the Board has declined to reach the merits of unfair labor practice complaints against Western Electric Co. because contracts between the parties provide for grievance and arbitration procedures. Since the facts of these two cases are virtually identical, they will be discussed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-14\">Both cases arise from disputes regarding certain organizational changes at two plants of the Western Electric Company at Omaha, Nebraska and Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1969, the Omaha employees were restructured into three \u201cmanager\u2019s organizations\u201d whereas there had formerly been only two such groups. In 1970, a similar change was made at the Shreveport plant, creating two manager\u2019s organizations in place of one. The significance of these changes, for present purposes, is that the contractual provisions governing movement of personnel (i. e. promotion, downgrading and lateral transfer) at both plants are keyed to the concept of a manager\u2019s organization. For example, an employee can be considered for transfer within his manager\u2019s organization, but cannot ordinarily move from one manager\u2019s organization to another. Section 2.1(c) of Article 27 of the Omaha contract is illustrative :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-15\">When a vacancy occurs, employees of the Company who have qualifications for the vacancy will be considered in successive steps in the following order until the vacancy is filled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-16\">(c) Graded employees in successively lower grades from within (1) the Assistant Manager\u2019s organization having the vacancy for vacancies in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>grade 34 and lower, or (2) the Manager\u2019s organization having the vacancy for vacancies in grade 35 and higher or in the JOURNEYMAN TRADES OCCUPATIONS or JOURNEYMEN from within the Manager\u2019s organization having the vacancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-4\">Similar provisions are found in the section governing layoffs. The union argues that as a result of the company\u2019s organizational changes, a literal reading of the words \u201cmanager\u2019s organization\u201d will drastically affect seniority rights of employees since each worker\u2019s field of movement will be restricted to the new, smaller manager\u2019s organizations. The union does not contest management\u2019s right to reorganize the plants but urges that the employee movement provisions should be applied as if the Omaha plant still had only two manager\u2019s organizations and the Shreveport plant still had only one. The Company insists upon a literal reading of the words \u201cmanager\u2019s organization\u201d and plans to administer employee movement on the basis of the new organizational structure at each plant. As a result of this impasse, each local filed unfair labor practice charges, alleging that the company has unilaterally changed the working conditions of its employees in violation of section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act. In each case the Board dismissed the complaint, noting that the dispute involves a matter covered by the grievance and arbitration procedures contained in the labor contract. In both cases the Board retained jurisdiction for the limited purpose of entertaining a motion for further consideration upon a showing that either: (a) the dispute has not been resolved or submitted to' arbitration; or (b) the grievance and arbitration procedures have not been fair and regular or have reached a result repugnant to the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">The Board\u2019s disposition of these two cases followed the rule established by its decision in Collyer Insulated Wire, 192 NLRB 837 (1971). In that case, like the present one, the union had charged the employer with effecting a unilateral change in working conditions. The employer defended the charge on the ground that its actions were authorized by the contract. Alternatively, the employer argued that the dispute ought to be resolved under the grievance and arbitration procedures contained in the contract. The Board agreed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-10\">We find merit in Respondent\u2019s exceptions that because this dispute in it*, entirety arises from the contract between the parties, and from the parties\u2019 relationship under the contract, it ought to be resolved in the manner which that contract prescribes. We conclude that the Board is vested with authority to withhold its processes in this ease, and that the contract here made available a quick and fair means for the resolution of this dispute including, if appropriate, a fully effective remedy for any breach of contract which occurred. We conclude, in sum, that our obligation to advance the purposes of the Act is best discharged by the dismissal of this complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">It should be understood that the <em>Col-lyer </em>decision and those now under review are not based upon any right of the employer to compel the union to utilize grievance procedures rather than file charges with the Board. Rather, they proceed from the Board\u2019s asserted power to withhold its processes when to do so will best serve the policies of the Federal labor laws. The <em>Collyer </em>doctrine has been applied by the Board in numerous subsequent cases and has received judicial approval in the Second Circuit. Nabisco, Inc. v. NLRB, 479 F.2d 770 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-13\">The union attacks the present dismissals on alternative grounds. It is argued: <em>first, </em>that the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine is an illegal abdication of the Board\u2019s duty to remedy unfair labor practices; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>and, <em>second, </em>that even if <em>Collyer </em>is valid, it was erroneously applied in these two eases. Both arguments must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">First of all, the <em>Collyer </em>rule of deferral to grievance and arbitration procedures is clearly valid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is well established that the Board may decline to take jurisdiction of a complaint if, in its judgment, Federal labor policy is best served by leaving the parties to voluntary settlements. This principle has been approved in this Circuit, Office &amp; Professional Employees Local 425 v. NLRB, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 12, 419 F.2d 314 (1969), and cited with approval by the Supreme Court. NLRB v. Plasterers\u2019 Union, 404 U.S. 116, 136-137, 92 S. Ct. 360, 30 L.Ed.2d 312 (1971); Carey v. Westinghouse Corp., 375 U.S. 261, 270-271, 84 S.Ct. 401, 11 L.Ed.2d 320 (1964), <em>quoting </em>International Harvester Co., 138 NLRB 923, 925-26 (1962), aff\u2019d sub nom. Ramsey v. NLRB, 327 F.2d 784 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 377 U.S. 1003, 84 S.Ct. 1938, 12 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1964). <em>See also </em>Smith v. Evening News Ass\u2019n, 371 U.S. 195, 198 n. 6, 83 S.Ct. 267, 9 L.Ed.2d 246 (1962). These authorities contemplate Board deference to arbitration awards issued <em>before </em>the filing of unfair labor practice complaints. <em>Collyer </em>and the decisions under review go a step further, however. In these cases the Board dismissed unfair labor practice complaints even though arbitration had not been initiated. <em>Collyer </em>is not the familiar case of deferral to an arbitration <em>award, </em>but deferral to the arbitration <em>procedure </em>which is available but not yet invoked. Like the former class of cases, the <em>Collyer </em>decision relies upon the Federal labor policy expressed in section 203(d) of the Labor Management Relations Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-5\">Final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective-bargaining agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">We believe that this declaration of policy applies in the pre-arbitral (Collyer) context as well as in the post-award context. We also believe that this policy supports pre-arbitral deferral since the grievance and arbitration procedure is the only remedy left to a party from whom the Board withholds statutory relief. It should be clear, however, that the fostering of one policy may be detrimental to another policy, <em>viz.: </em>that expressed by the Congress in granting the Board power to remedy unfair labor practices. Certainly the Board appreciated this ambivalence in its <em>Collyer </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-9\">Thus, this case like each such case compels an accommodation between, on the one hand, the statutory policy favoring the fullest use of collective bargaining and the arbitral process and, on the other, the statutory policy reflected by Congress\u2019 grant to the Board of exclusive jurisdiction to prevent unfair labor practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">192 NLRB at 841. We read the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine as a balancing rule which requires deferral to arbitration only where a balance of both supporting and antagonistic policies favors deferral. The operation of this balancing process is demonstrated by the <em>Collyer </em>opinion itself. There the Board considered five factors bearing upon the probable effectiveness of arbitration to advance Federal labor policy:</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">1. the history and quality of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining relationship;</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">2. the absence of anti-union animus;</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">3. willingness of the respondent party to arbitrate;</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-14\">4. the scope of the arbitration clause;</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-15\">5. suitability of the dispute to resolution by arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 842. In <em>Collyer </em>all of these considerations favored deferral. Elaborating on the fifth point, the Board noted that the factual bases of the statutory claim and of the contractual dispute were so intertwined that resolution of the contractual issue by arbitration might be dispositive of the statutory (unfair labor practice) issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-4\">The contract and its meaning in present circumstances lie at the center of this dispute. In contrast, the Act and its policies become involved only if it is determined that the agreement between .the parties, examined in the light of its negotiating history and the practices of the parties thereunder, did not sanction Respondent\u2019s right to make the disputed changes That threshold determination is clearly within the expertise of a mutually agreed-upon arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abe-dedup-0\">192 NLRB at 842. This congruence between the contractual dispute and the overlying unfair labor practice charge is significant. If it were not present, the Board\u2019s abstention might have constituted not deference, but abdication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Our endorsement of the <em>Collyer </em>rule would be incomplete without one further comment. While the Board\u2019s promise to overrule arbitration awards which are irregular or repugnant to the Act is a necessary condition to the legality of pre-arbitral deferrals, it is not a sufficient one. Put another way, the fact that any ultimate award must conform to the policies of the Act does not guarantee that deferral itself is consistent with the Act. Pre-arbitral deferral might constitute an effective denial of any remedy if, for example, arbitration of the dispute would impose an undue financial burden upon one of the parties. Dismissal of the complaint m such a case would be contrary to the policies of the Act although all other criteria for application of the <em>Collyer </em>doctrine are met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deferral might also be unjustified where it prevents an orderly exposition of the law in question. Successive arbitration awards could produce a variety of ad hoc solutions to the same problem, all consistent with the Act, but no uniform rule. In such circumstances further abstention by the Board might be contrary to Federal labor policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">Having approved the <em>Collyer </em>decision, it remains for us to determine whether the principle of that case was properly applied in the cases at hand. We note, first of all, that the results of an arbitration will very likely be dispositive of the unfair labor practice issue: if the award adopts the union\u2019s construction of the term \u201cmanager\u2019s organization\u201d for purposes of the Articles gov- \u2022 erning \u201cMovement of Personnel\u201d, then the company\u2019s compliance with this decision would moot the instant unfair labor practice complaints; if the company\u2019s construction prevails, of course, there will be no basis for the charge of unilateral action. This likelihood alone strongly supports the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint pending the outcome of grievance and arbitration proceedings. Examination of the other factors considered in <em>Collyer </em>does not dissuade us from this view. The dispute is clearly within the scope of the grievance and arbitration procedures at both the Omaha and the Shreveport plants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The company has expressed its willingness to arbitrate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no suggestion of anti-union animus such that deferral to arbitration would be a futile gesture; nor does the history of the collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>bargaining relationship of the parties indicate that arbitration would not be fruitful. We cannot conclude that the Board has abused its discretion by referring the parties in these cases to the grievance and arbitration procedures provided in their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Petitions denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1172-17\">.
