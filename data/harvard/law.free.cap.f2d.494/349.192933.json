Plaintiff sued his railroad employer under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51, (hereinafter \u201cF.E. L.A.\u201d) for injuries sustained while performing voluntary overtime work as a wrecker in defendant\u2019s Canadian operations. Normally, plaintiff worked in and around Detroit and did not, except on this one occasion, cross into Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that F.E.L.A. does not apply to railroad employees injured outside the territorial United States. After receiving briefs and hearing oral argument on this issue the District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Defendant-appellee defends this decision on the authority of New York Central R.R. Co. v. Chisholm, 268 U.S. 29, 45 S. Ct. 402, 69 L.Ed. 828 (1925). In <em>Chisholm, </em>a case strikingly similar on its facts to the one at bar, the Supreme Court, after noting that the \u201ccase presents nothing beyond a question of construction,\u201d held that F.E.L.A. does not have extraterritorial effect. 268 U.S. at 31, 45 S.Ct. at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Plaintiff-appellant argues that <em>Chisholm </em>does not stand for the proposition that Congress did not intend F.E.L.A. application for railroad employees injured while temporarily working outside the United States, but rather that the decision reflected contemporary conflicts of law principles that stressed lex loci delictus theories. Appellant further asserts that conflicts of law principles have undergone profound changes since 1925, and that under currently accepted theories, variously known as \u201csignificant contacts,\u201d \u201csignificant relations\u201d or \u201cgovernmental interests\u201d tests, United States law (in this case F.E.L.A.) would be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">While it is true, as appellant asserts, that a number of federal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>state</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>courts have begun to reject the lex loci delictus test method of determining applicable law, <em>Chisholm </em>remains a firm restriction on the extra territorial application of F.E.L.A. Indeed, the Supreme Court apparently added to this resolve in Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571, 581, 73 S.Ct. 921, 927, 97 L.Ed. 1254 (1952), wherein it stated that, \u201c[w]e have held [F.E.L.A.] not applicable to an American citizen\u2019s injury sustained in Canada while in service of an American /employer.\u201d Appellant has failed to demonstrate any reasonable basis for our holding that the Supreme Court has abandoned the <em>Chisholm </em>decision, however desirable such a course may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">The District Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\">.
