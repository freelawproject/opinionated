Appellant sought administrative review through two levels in the United States Civil Service Commission. In the meantime he requested a preliminary injunction ordering reinstatement pending a final determination of his <em>administrative appeal. </em>The District Court denied the requested equitable relief and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">A first level decision by the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Appeals Examining Office denying appellant all requested relief was rendered prior to oral argument. Subsequent to argument, that decision was affirmed by the Civil Service Commission Board of Appeals and Review bringing appellant\u2019s administrative appeal to a conclusion. Since the sole issue raised on appeal to this Court is a challenge to the District Court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief pending a final decision of the administrative appeal we are compelled to vacate the order and remand the case to the District Court to dismiss it as moot.
