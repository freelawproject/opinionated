We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">Appellant is the owner of an incontestable registration of \u201cBLUE RIBBON\u201d for \u201cshelled and unshelled edible nuts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board rejected appellant\u2019s contentions that it is entitled to the registration of the mark \u201cCORDON BLEU\u201d because this mark can be translated from the French as \u201cBLUE RIBBON\u201d and that, under Morehouse Manufacturing Company v. J. Strickland and Company, 407 F.2d 881, 56 CCPA 946 (1969), the appellee cannot be damaged by issuance of the registration sought. In so doing, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1482-6\">\u2022\u00bb * * notwithstanding that \u201cCORDON BLEU\u201d can be literally translated as \u201cBLUE RIBBON,\u201d the marks in the United States project different impressions and would not be likely to be equated as identical expressions. The board noted that it had sustained</blockquote>\n<p id=\"au9-dedup-0\">an opposition against the same application in a previous decision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and quoted from its opinion wherein it decided that <em>Morehouse </em>was not applicable to the facts of this case. The appeal of that decision is decided by this couft of even date herewith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2019*</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-14\">Turning to the question of likelihood of confusion, the board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1482-15\">The products of the parties are food items which applicant, in its answer to opposer\u2019s request for admissions, has acknowledged are generally sold [to] the same classes of purchasers in the same retail outlets including in the ease of applicant\u2019s edible nuts and opposer\u2019s various spread products in the snack food sections of self-service markets. Under these circumstances, conditions do exist where the sale of these products under the identical mark \u201cCORDON BLEU\u201d is likely to cause purchasers encountering the products of the parties to attribute them to the same, although possibly anonymous, source, [footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1482-16\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on its registered mark \u201cBLUE RIBBON\u201d is misplaced. In <em>Morehouse, </em>the mark \u201cBlue Magic,\u201d which the court held registerable, was essentially the same mark for which the applicant held an incontestable registration. For the same reasons set out in our opinion of this date in appeal PA 9251, the mark \u201cCORDON BLEU,\u201d which appellant seeks to register here, is not essentially the same as its registered mark \u201cBLUE RIBBON,\u201d so <em>Morehouse </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-17\">Concerning the issue of likelihood of confusion, we agree fully with the conclusion of the board quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-18\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1482-7\">.
