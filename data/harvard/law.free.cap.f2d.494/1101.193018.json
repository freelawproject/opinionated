He moved the District Court to convene a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284. The District Court denied that motion (and simultaneously dismissed the complaint) because it thought that the complaint raised no substantial constitutional issue; and the only question before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>us on this appeal is the correctness of that determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The Supreme Court has made abundantly clear that a three-judge district court must be convened if the constitutional issues raised have a substantiality which takes them outside such characterizations as \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d \u201cwholly insubstantial, [or] legally speaking nonexistent,\u201d or unless \u201cunsoundness so clearly results from previous decisions of this Court as to foreclose the subject.\u201d <em>See </em>California Water Service Co. v. City of Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 255, 58 S.Ct. 865, 867, 82 L.Ed. 1323 (1938), and Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31, 33, 82 S.Ct. 549, 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962). In appellant\u2019s ease, Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 657, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (decided January 21, 1974) \u2014 a decision which was not available to the District Court at the time of its ruling \u2014 is ample indication that appellant\u2019s challenge in this instance presents a constitutional issue of sufficient substance as to warrant consideration by a three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">The District Court\u2019s orders (1) denying appellant\u2019s motion to convene a three-judge court and (2) granting ap-pellee\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice, are reversed; and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to convene a three-judge court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">. At the time of appellant\u2019s forced retirement, he was continued in governmental service as a re-employed annuitant in the same job he had been performing, with the same total number of dollars being received by him each month from the Government. Since, contrarily, the complaint appeared to have alleged only reduction of income as appellant\u2019s injury, we questioned during oral argument whether appellant\u2019s continuing employment resulted in a case or controversy, and we asked the parties to submit supplemental memoranda on that issue. In the light of the representations made therein, we do not pursue the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">In addition to the loss of his job tenure and the resulting loss of procedural protections accompanying that loss, which by themselves might only anticipate a possible case or controversy in the future, appellant identifies in his supplemental memorandum a number of specific immediate injuries, the existence of which are essentially unchallenged by the Government in its reply. First, although the \u201cre-employed annuitant\u201d salary provides the same compensation as that attained on the date of retirement, appellant no longer qualifies for the periodic pay increases within his GS level. Second, since pension levels are a function of the three highest consecutive years of salary, appellant\u2019s frozen salary also freezes his pension. Lastly, appellant\u2019s life insurance rights are also calculated by reference to salary, and appellant asserts that he has been deprived of $2,000.00 of coverage by virtue of his change in status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
