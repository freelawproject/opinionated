We find it necessary to deal only with the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">Exemption 7 involves investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7). As the District Court recognized (at p. 1325), there is no dispute that the correspondence in question became part of NHTSA\u2019s investigatory file. Although the court also recognized that the correspondence in question \u201ccould conceivably lead to a civil enforcement proceeding,\u201d it went on to conclude that \u201cthe agency has not made the required showing that disclosure of the files sought is likely to create a concrete prospect of serious harm to its law enforcement efficiency,\u2019 \u201d citing for this proposition, and quoting from, a decision of a division of this court. Weisberg v. Department of Justice, No. 71-1026 slip opinion dated February 23, 1973.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">The division\u2019s opinion in <em>Weisberg </em>was, however, subsequently vacated by an order granting rehearing <em>en banc; </em>and the <em>en banc </em>disposition by this court of <em>Weisberg, </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. -, 489 F.2d 1195 (decided October 24, 1973), compels reversal of the result reached in this instance by the District Court. The court <em>en banc </em>in <em>Weisberg </em>held that, if the documents in issue are clearly to be classified as \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d the exemption attaches, and it is not in the province of the courts to second-guess the Congress by relying upon considerations which argue that the Government will not actually be injured by revelation in the particular case. We have explored with care the question of whether the correspondence in issue was compiled for law enforcement purposes, and we are of the opinion that it patently was, as appeared also to be the view of the District Court. Under these circumstances, exemption 7 was applicable, and the District Court, not having the benefit of <em>Weisberg en banc, </em>erred in holding that the correspondence should be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">. At issue also in the District Court were claims to disclosure of Book D of the submission of Genefal Motors Corporation to NHTSA, and a' report of the Office of Standards Enforcement concerning the enforcibility of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The District Court\u2019s action, after examining these items <em>in camera, </em>in allowing the first such claim and denying the second has not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1158-22\">. The District Court thought to find good reason to override the exemption in the circumstance that the correspondence was between the agency and the auto manufacturer being investigated. This suggested to it that there were \u201cno apparent problems of confidential sources, premature revelation of suspects and the like;\u201d and that there was \u201cmost certainly\u201d no problem about the discovery of the information by the subject of the investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
