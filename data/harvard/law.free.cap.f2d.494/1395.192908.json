We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">Appellant seeks to avoid the board\u2019s holding of likelihood of confusion by relying on the fact that it is the owner of the prior incontestable registration of \u201cBLUE RIBBON\u201d for \u201cshelled and un-shelled edible nuts.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relying on More-house Manufacturing Corporation v. J. Strickland and Company, 407 F.2d 881, 56 CCPA 946 (1969), appellant asserts it has a \u201cright\u201d to register the foreign equivalent of its registration for the same goods. In the aforementioned case, Morehouse opposed Strickland\u2019s application for registration of \u201cBlue Magic\u201d for \u201cpressing oil\u201d and petitioned for cancellation of Strickland\u2019s registration of the same mark for \u201chair dressing,\u201d which was \u201cthe same product.\u201d In finding for Strickland in both proceedings, the court commented that \u201cthe board took the proper approach in first determining the cancellation and then dismissing the opposition, on the basis of the cases relied on, for the reason that the opposer cannot suffer legal damage from the additional registration, over and above any damage it may suffer from the existing registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">The board here agreed that \u201cCordon Bleu\u201d can be translated literally as \u201cBlue Ribbon\u201d but it did not consider that controlling, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-6\">What does \u201cCordon Bleu\u201d really mean to the American public and what does \u201cBlue Ribbon\u201d mean? The French term is not so unusual to the American public because it is defined in American Dictionaries. Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language defines that term as \u201cthe blue ribbon of the order of the Holy Ghost, the highest order of the old French monarchy\u201d, and as \u201ca person regarded as entitled to a badge of eminent distinction; specif., a first class cook, particularly a woman cook.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, 1965, similarly defines the term \u201cCordon Bleu\u201d and indicates the applicability of said term to a cook of great skill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-13\">The term \u201cBlue Ribbon\u201d figuratively refers to an honor or award gained for prominence and, literally, signifies a blue ribbon awarded the first place winner in a competition. See: The American College Dictionary, 1970; Webster\u2019s World Dictionary of the American Language 1966; Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, 1963; Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language, supra; and Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-14\">On the basis of dictionary definitions, we are of the opinion that \u201cBlue Ribbon\u201d and \u201cCordon Bleu\u201d would not have the same significance to the American public and that the marks \u201cBLUE RIBBON\u201d and \u201cCORDON BLEU\u201d create different commercial impressions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the ownership of a registration of \u201cBLUE RIBBON\u201d for edible nuts does not preclude opposer from asserting damage resulting from the registration of \u201cCORDON BLEU\u201d for edible nuts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-15\">Turning to the question of likelihood of confusion the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-16\">\u201cWhile it is true that applicant seeks registration of its mark for edi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>ble nuts whereas opposer\u2019s mark is registered for a service and a magazine, it is apparent from the record that both parties direct their efforts to the same type of people \u2014 those interested in fine cooking. It is further apparent that those interested in French cooking are aware of the reputation of \u201cLE CORDON BLEU\u201d as a cooking school. While such persons may well be aware that opposer does not sell goods in the United States, they may logically assume that a famous cooking school will endorse certain products. If such a product is sold under a mark identical to or substantially identical to opposer\u2019s service mark, such persons would well assume that the product has opposer\u2019s sanction or approval. In this particular case, the marks are virtually identical, and since applicant\u2019s mark is for an edible product described as \u201cgourmet cooking nuts\u201d, the public may readily come to the conclusion that applicant\u2019s edible nuts are endorsed by the well-known school of French cooking, \u201cLE CORDON BLEU\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1481-4\">We agree with the board that the <em>Morehouse </em>case does not preclude appel-lee from asserting that damage would result from granting appellant a registration of the mark \u201cCORDON BLEU.\u201d That mark is not essentially the same as appellant\u2019s previously registered mark, as was the case in Morehouse7 Moreover, appellant has not demonstrated that the board erred in finding \u201cCORDON BLEU\u201d has a significance to the American public distinct form that of \u201cBLUE RIBBON.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">The case turns then on the question of likelihood of confusion. On that point, we find no reversible error in the board\u2019s reasoning quoted above. The decision of the board is affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1481-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1479-24\">.
