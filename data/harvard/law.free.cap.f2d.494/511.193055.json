The petition relies upon Schoen-amsgruber v. Hamburg American Line, 294 U.S. 454, 55 S.Ct. 475, 79 L.Ed. 989 (1934), for the proposition that an order granting arbitration is interlocutory and reviewable only upon appeal from final decree. Two years after <em>Schoenams-gruber </em>was decided this circuit noted that that decision was in an admiralty case and held that an order denying a \u00a7 4 petition to compel arbitration, entered in a suit at law claiming damages for breach of contract, was a final judgment and appealable. La Nacional Platanera v. North American Fruit &amp; Steamship Corp., 84 F.2d 881 (CA5, 1936). For a statement of reasons supporting the correctness of our analysis of <em>Schoenams-gruber </em>see The Sydfold, 25 F.Supp. 662 (S.D.N.Y.1938). In <em>La Nacional </em>the order denied arbitration while in the instant case it granted arbitration. The latter is an <em>a fortiori </em>situation \u2014 the court by deliberative act has set in motion the arbitration, and the arbitrators take over the controversy and dispose of it subject only to possible application to a court to vacate or to enforce the award. For a discussion of the \u201cfunctional\u201d finality of an arbitration-compelling order see Krauss Bros. Lumber Co. v. Louis Bossert &amp; Sons, 62 F.2d 1004 (CA2, 1933).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-18\">There are policy reasons pro and con in holding for appealability of orders entered under \u00a7 4, and at least one other circuit has held them appealable under neither 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 nor <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1292(a)(1). Blount Bros. Construction Co. v. Troitino, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 99, 381 F.2d 267 (1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But in this area of the law where there are \u201cmedieval if not Byzantine peculiarities,\u201d New England <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Power Co. v. Asiatic Petroleum Corp., 456 F.2d 183 at 189 (CA1, 1972), this circuit has spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We, therefore, amend the third from the last paragraph of our opinion [490 F.2d 182] so as to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">We are not persuaded by the City\u2019s insistence that it will have to appeal in two circuits in order to secure review of all the issues in the case. The arbitration order was an appealable final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. See La Nacional Pla-tanera v. North American Fruit &amp; Steamship Corp., 84 F.2d 881 (CA5, 1936). Since the time for appealing it has long since run out, the City has lost its right to have it reviewed. The denial of the motion to remand, although it would not have been immediately appealable standing alone, merged with the final arbitration order and became reviewable. Thus time has run out on it, too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Also we delete footnote 7 [p. 184].</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">On the basis of our opinion as amended and as supplemented by this order, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-15\">. Shanferoke Coal &amp; Supply Corp. v. West-chester Service Corp., 293 U.S. 449, 55 S.Ct. 78, 79 L.Ed. 583 (1935), is not contrary to our holding. There an order denying a stay pending arbitration was held not final, although it was deemed appealable as an interlocutory injunction within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The present case concerns not a 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 stay order alone, but a \u00a7 4 arbitration order, which stands on a different footing. See The Syd-fold, 25 F.Supp. at 663; New England Power Co. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co., 456 E.2d 183, 188 (CA1, 1972). Since the arbitration-compelling order was final, all that had gone before, including the stay order and the denial of the motion to remand, merged with it and became mandatorily appealable. See 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice If 110.07 at 109, text accompanying note 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-20\">. See also Standard Chlorine of Delaware v. Leonard, 384 F.2d 304 (CA2, 1967), in which the Second Circuit rationalized its previously inconsistent decisions by distinguishing between the case where the \u00a7 4 order is entered in an independent proceeding and that where entered as a collateral matter in a pending case. And see Goodall-Sanford, Inc. v. United Textile Workers, 353 U. S. 550, 77 S.Ct. 920, 1 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1953) (order directing arbitration under \u00a7 301(a) of the Taft-Hartley Act held appealable as final order).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
