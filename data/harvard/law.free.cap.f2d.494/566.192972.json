The court adjudicated in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages in the amount of $2,500.00. The officer has appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We immediately dispose of defendant\u2019s improper venue contention. Clearly in a Civil Rights Act case brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, venue did not properly lie in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b), this action \u201cnot founded solely on diversity of citizenship\u201d could \u201cbe brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d Grenoble resides in the Middle District, and the claim arose in the Middle District. At the beginning of the trial, however, Michael Minkin, Assistant Attorney General, conceded to the court that the question of venue was waived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The trial record discloses that William L. Bracey, Jr., a prisoner at Camp Hill Institution, Pennsylvania, participated in an assault on a prison guard on November 18, 1968, for which he was convicted in a state court. His civil action encompassed events which occurred immediately after the events which led to his subsequent conviction. Two guards were assaulted on B-Block, one of whom was a Sergeant Bartlebaugh. The plaintiff candidly admitted that he \u201cwas participating in the assault right then.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Knives and daggers were used by pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>oners in the assault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff testified that he left B-Block and \u201cwent out in the hallway and . . . was sprayed again with the can of Mace.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When asked if he knew who sprayed him, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t quite recall, but I remember Lieutenant Yucha then was out there in the hallway,\u201d and that \u201cI did see Major \u2014 he was acting as major, Grenoble then in the hallway, when I went out in the hallway.\u201d He said that he was thrown to the floor but could not \u201crecall which one pushed . . . [him] to the floor,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that while on the floor he was beaten with night sticks \u201cfor about five minutes. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Asked how much time elapsed between the time when he saw the defendant and the beating he received, he responded: \u201cIt was like, just like seconds. The time it took me to stand up and like the time it took them to Mace me, I would say about five or six seconds, that is all it took.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">There is evidence that Grenoble was present at the time plaintiff was brought into the hallway; there is no evidence he was present during or throughout the beatings. The defendant was <em>seen </em>by plaintiff only at this one time, and his voice was <em>heard </em>later when plaintiff was brought up the hallway:</p>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">BY THE COURT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-21\">Q. Mr. Bracey, from the time that you got through the door from B-Block into the corridor and the events that you have described took place, during that period of time do you know where the defendant Grenoble was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-22\">A. When I entered the hallway he was standing behind the guards, he was standing right behind them, and like the guards with the Mace was along the wall and when I came out, I came out of B-Block like this way (indicating), and I turned this way (indicating), and like the guards came over and like two guards grabbed me and I was sprayed with the Mace then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-23\">Q. And all during this period of time where was the defendant Grenoble; if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-24\">A. When I came out like he was standing directly behind the guards, you know, like he was standing right in front of the door but directly behind the guards as I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">BY MR. SOSKIN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">Q. Well, to clarify that, was that the only time you saw the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">A. No. When I was being taken up the hallway I recall his voice, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">THE COURT: You recall his voice ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">THE WITNESS: His voice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">THE COURT: Saying what? Do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">THE WITNESS: \u201cGet him up there; go check on the keys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">The witness said that he was then taken through the hallway to the entrance of D-Rlock, about twenty-five feet further: \u201cI was put on the wall, I was told to put my hands on the wall until they brought the key from the control desk, the control desk where they keep all the keys at. ... I was told to like stretch out, put my hands on the wall. ... I was facing the wall.\u201d He testified that some six guards brought him there. The group then waited for a key to arrive from the control clerk to open D-Block. He stated: \u201cWhile waiting for the,key, Lieutenant Yucha then was the one that was hitting me with the night sticks. As soon as they got the key he went across my face and then after \u2014 as soon as I was hit I was pushed in D-Block, I went in D-Block, and like they ripped my clothes off me and . . . Captain Wilkes started choking me. . . .\u201d Significantly, plaintiff testified that he did not know where Major Grenoble was when he was struck by Lieutenant Yucha, when his clothes were ripped off, and when he was pushed down the steps.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-18\">Plaintiff spent eight days in the Camp Hill Hospital. According to the nurses\u2019 and hospital records, his injuries consisted of a broken nose and a right eye injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-27\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-28\">The precise question that we address is whether Grenoble was responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s beating. We emphasize that we do not reach the question of whether the physical acts which led to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were state torts only, or whether they amounted to constitutional deprivations. Smith v. Spi-na, 477 F.2d 1140 (3d Cir. 1973); Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272 (3d Cir. 1972). Although at trial Grenoble\u2019s attorney took the position that the plaintiff failed to state the deprivation of a constitutional right, the district court specifically rejected that argument, and Grenoble has elected not to renew this contention before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-29\">That portion of the district court\u2019s opinion outlining the basis of defendant\u2019s responsibility is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-30\">We have no difficulty in concluding that the defendant Grenoble was in charge of the prison guards and had complete control over their actions. When a superior personally directs his subordinates to do acts or when he has actual knowledge of their acts and acquiesces in them, he is regarded as having been personally involved and is liable for his own conduct, not on the basis of <em>respondeat superior </em>but because of his direct personal involvement. Landman v. Royster, 354 F. Supp. 1302 (E.D.Va.1973); Wright v. McMann, 460 F.2d 126, 135 (C.A.2, 1972). We hold that Grenoble is liable for the injuries inflicted upon the plaintiff in violation of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-31\">In reaching the legal conclusion of Grenoble\u2019s liability, the district court relied on findings of fact \u201cbased largely on the testimony of the plaintiff which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>straightforward and consistent . . ., [rejecting] out of hand the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses.\u201d We hold that the implicit findings of the trial court as to the adjudicative facts of \u201cdirection\u201d or \u201cactual knowledge and acquieseense\u201d cannot survive under the clearly erroneous test. Krasnov v. Dinan, 465 F.2d 1298 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Plaintiff frankly admits that he did not prove Grenoble\u2019s participation in the administration of the beatings. Incredibly, plaintiff did not sue the two officers of the guard whom he identified as beating him \u2014 Lieutenant Yucha and Captain Wilkes. There was no evidence introduced at trial that Grenoble gave orders \u201cto do acts,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>to administer the beatings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court ruled out liability on the basis of <em>respondeat superi- or, </em>and the parties do not now contest this ruling. Therefore, if the district court\u2019s legal conclusion of liability is to be sustained it has to be, in the district court\u2019s words, on the theory: \u201c[W]hen he has actual knowledge of their acts and acquiesces in them, he is regarded as having been personally involved and is liable for his own conduct. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">We exclude the acts of violence in the hallway at the entrance to D-Block. Although Grenoble was placed at the other end of the hallway, and at some intermediate point in the hallway, plaintiff testified that he did not know where Grenoble was when he was \u201cpushed in D-Block, like they was hitting me like for not \u2014 they weren\u2019t minutes, and they just ripped my clothes off.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If then there is to be liability, it must generate from Grenoble\u2019s earlier presence in the hallway or corridor between B-Block and D-Block.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\"> The mere fact of presence of a superior officer would not be sufficient to impose liability even under the district court\u2019s theory. Yet presence is evi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>dentiary on the facts of actual knowledge of and acquiescence in the unlawful acts of the subordinates. Even if we were to adopt the rule of law as stated by the trial court (in view of our decision in Curtis v. Everette, 489 F.2d 516 (3d Cir. 1973)), the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts of actual knowledge and acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In an attempt to establish Grenoble\u2019s presence during the beating plaintiff testified that when he came out of B-Block he saw the defendant directly behind twenty guards. The beating, according to plaintiff, began five or six seconds after he saw the defendant. However, there was not one iota of direct evidence that Grenoble was present during the crucial time period \u2014 the five or six minute beating; nor was there evidence that Grenoble saw the plaintiff being beaten. Indeed, although there is evidence that plaintiff saw Grenoble at one time, there is no direct evidence that Grenoble ever saw plaintiff. Moreover, there is no proof that the defendant knew that the guards who participated in the beating had engaged in similar beatings in the past. The absence of this evidence is crucial to plaintiff\u2019s case, for in Curtis v. Everette, <em>supra, </em>we reversed the dismissal of a complaint which alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cdefendants had actual knowledge of the dangerous nature and propensity of [plaintiff\u2019s attacker] Everette.\u201d In that same case we affirmed the court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as to other defendants and stressed that \u201c[t]here [were] no allegations that . . . [the defendants] had reason to know . . . [that plaintiff\u2019s attacker] would commit such an assault or that similar assaults had taken place.\u201d (489 F.2d at 521) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">We would be more constrained to find actual knowledge and acquiescence if plaintiff had proved defendant\u2019s presence throughout the entire five or six minute beating. Likewise, if plaintiff had proved that Grenoble saw him being beaten, or if there were evidence of a history of such episodes by the participating guards, we would be hard put to hold that a trial court\u2019s finding of actual knowledge was clearly erroneous. Had this interlude been an isolated incident that day, we could invoke the laws of probability to conclude that the defendant remained in one spot to deal with the solitary troublemaker. But that is not this case. Putting plaintiff\u2019s incident in its proper perspective, his beating took place immediately after a major disturbance in B-Bloek in which knives and daggers were used to assault two prison guards. By his own admission, plaintiff\u2019s participation in the assault was minimal; he attacked the bleeding Sergeant Bartlebaugh with physical force only. Other prisoners used knives and daggers. Therefore, it is just as reasonable to conclude that Grenoble was looking after other facets of the prison disturbance, <em>i. e., </em>apprehending the prisoners who used knives and daggers, as it is to conclude that he remained at the scene of plaintiff\u2019s beating.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Assuming without conceding the correctness of the district court\u2019s statement of the law, the brute fact remains that the district court\u2019s findings of actual knowledge and acquiescence are completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support and are, therefore, clearly erroneous. Krasnov v. Dinan, <em>supra, </em>465 F.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the proceedings re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>manded with a direction to enter judgment in favor of the defendant Grenoble.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\">. Unfortunately, this is an example where one state assistant attorney general diet not know what other assistant attorneys general had done in this ease. Incredibly, the trial assistant attorney general did not have a copy of the pleadings with him at trial, stating, \u201cMy file doesn\u2019t reflect an answer being filed by our office.\u201d The contrary is true. An answer was filed on November 26, 1969, by William O. Sennett, Attorney General, by David W. Rutstein, attorney-at-law, and Frank P. Lawley, Jr., Deputy Attorney General. The following colloquy took place between the court and Mr. Minkin :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">THE COURT: There was an answer filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-13\">MR. MINKIN: O.K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-14\">THE COURT: So, the question of venue is waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-15\">MR. MINKIN: Waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">At the close of jdaintiff\u2019s case Mr. Minkin moved for a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or in the alternative, for dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Then again, at the conclusion of all testimony, Mr. Mink-in moved for dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. At neither time did he resurrect the venue question.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">Judge Lord, at the conclusion of testimony, was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about the venue question. He observed that the defendant\u2019s Answer could be construed as raising an issue as to venue. In paragraph 1 of the Answer there appears the following statement: \u201c [I] t is denied that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has jurisdiction over this action.\u201d Strictly speaking, the Eastern District had <em>jurisdiction, </em>but <em>venue </em>did not lie. It was at least arguable that the averment qualified as an intention to challenge venue. However, Mr. Minkin did not comment on this matter, despite the court\u2019s specific request for comment from both counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-19\">. Q. O.K.

An independent ground for reversal for a new trial is dictated by the district court\u2019s improper use of defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories. Rule 33(a), F.R.Civ.P. provides : \u201cEach interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections signed by the attorney making them.\u201d Heilig v. Studebaker Corporation, 347 F.2d 686, 689 (10th Cir. 1965), emphasized that \u201canswers to interrogatories do not become evidence in the case, unless voluntarily introduced. . . . \u201d Patterson Oil Terminals, Inc. v. Charles Kurz &amp; Co., 7 F.R.D. 250, 251 (E.D.Pa.1945), held: \u201cThe answers to interrogatories are not considered evidence until offered, as such, at trial. Coca-Cola Co. v. Dixi-Oola Laboratories, Inc., D.C., 30 F.Supp. 275.\u201d <em>See also </em>8 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2180 at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Here, the critical interrogatory and answer, which were not introduced into evidence state:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">5. Who was the highest person in command present during the incident?</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">At the scene was Captain John Grenoble and Lieutenant Yucha.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">a). Were all actions carried out through his orders? Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"ADl\">The record discloses that the answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories were signed by Grenoble\u2019s attorney, and they were not made under oath. The trial court stated: \u201cWell, if you believe the plaintiff and if you believe the defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories, there is plenty of evidence\u201d to show participation by defendant in this case. The court was told that Grenoble did not see the interrogatories, and it was reported that Attorney Minkin had answered them. Mr. Minkin said: \u201c[I]t hasn\u2019t been introduced as evidence.\u201d The court responded : \u201cOh ! I take judicial notice of what is in the record.\u201d Therefore, the court ruled that it was taking as an admission of fact that Grenoble gave orders to have the plaintiff beaten. This ruling by the trial court is sufficient to reverse the judgment and order a new trial for three reasons: First, the answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories were not made by Grenoble as required by Rule 33(a) ; Second, the answers were not made under oath; Third, the answer was not introduced into evidence, and it was error to take judicial notice of it. The answer to Interrogatory No. 5 was part and parcel of the disputed event; in no way can it be characterized as a matter of common knowledge or verifiable with certainty by consulting authoritative reference sources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b654-18\">. <em>See </em>footnote 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\">.

Holding that the warden could not be held liable for the acts of others, Judge Friendly emphasized, in part, that \u201cthere had been [no] . . . history of previous episodes requiring the warden to take ... action\u201d as was the case in Wright v.

It provides no indication whether the court found that the defendant actually ordered the beating or that the defendant had actual knowledge of the acts of his subordinates and merely acquiesced in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The court\u2019s emphasis on the answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories seems to indicate that the court found that defendant actually ordered the guards to beat plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. The district judge in his memorandum and order, however, points to nothing, other than the answers to the interrogatories, to support his conclusion that plaintiff was beaten by prison guards acting on specific directions from the defendant. Nor can I find in the record any other basis for such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Do the answers to interrogatories executed by defendant\u2019s counsel, and of which the district court took judicial notice, supply the missing ingredient? I am satisfied that they do not because, as Judge Aldisert says, they were not signed by the defendant, were not under oath, and, of critical importance, were not introduced into evidence. Nor do the answers constitute matter which is the proper subject of judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Thus, the district court had no permissible basis for inferring that the defendant gave orders to beat plaintiff. Similarly, the answers to the interrogatories cannot be used as the basis for a finding that defendant had knowledge of and acquiesced in the beatings. It does not, however, inexorably follow that judgment should be entered for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Had the district court judge confined himself to the evidence, I cannot say whether he would have found knowledge and acquiescence on the part of the defendant to the beating after plaintiff had been effectively subdued. While I do not intimate that such a finding would be mandated by the record, I cannot say that the record could not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">There was evidence placing the defendant at the scene both immediately before and immediately after the first incident in which the plaintiff was beaten. Possibly, because of its erroneous reliance on the answers to the interrogatories, the district court did not focus on this evidence. I would therefore remand and direct the district court to make properly based findings and draw conclusions concerning defendant\u2019s knowledge of and acquiescence in the beatings at the critical time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-10\">.
