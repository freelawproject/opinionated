Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1268-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">Appellant Howard brought this tort action against Vulcan Materials to recover for personal injuries suffered while engaged in waste disposal activities at Vulcan\u2019s plant. At the time he was employed by AAA Contracting Co., which contracted to perform various tasks for Vulcan. The issue is whether Howard was a statutory employee of Vulcan for the pui\u2019poses of the exclusive liability provisions of Louisiana\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1-021 et seq. Concluding that he was, under the undisputed facts, the district court granted Vulcan\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">Section 23:1061 of the Louisiana compensation act provides that a contractor\u2019s employees are to be treated as employees of the principal employer where the contractor performs work which is a part of the \u201ctrade, business, or occupation\u201d of the principal. Louisiana and Fifth Circuit cases have clearly established that contracted work is a part of the principal\u2019s \u201ctrade, business, or occupation\u201d if it is so necessary to its operation that, save for the contractor, it \u201cwould have to hire workers of its own to perform the task.\u201d Cole v. Chevron Chemical Co., 5 Cir., 1973, 477 F.2d 361, 365. <em>See also, </em>Duhon v. Texaco, Inc., 5 Cir., 1974, 490 F.2d 91; Leger v. Amerada Hess Corp., 5 Cir., 1973, 479 F.2d 1250; Foster v. Western Electric Co., La.App., 1972, 258 So.2d 153; Goodwin v. United States Rubber Co., La.App., 1966, 186 So.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">Under these cases, Howard was a statutory employee of Vulcan, since the disposal of waste generated by the plant\u2019s normal operations was so necessary that in the absence of an available contractor Vulcan would have to, and in fact did, use its own employees to perform the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">There remains the claim by AAA against its insurer for the costs of its defense in this proceeding. This claim fell victim to summary judgment, without opinion and before judgment on the principal complaint, and AAA appeals. We remand for further consideration by the district court in light of our disposition of the principal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">Affirmed in part and remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
