United States, 373 U.S. 1, 16, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Because neither denial rested upon an evidentiary hearing, the inquiry must be directed to the files and records of the case to ascertain whether or not they \u201cconclusively show\u201d that the prisoner is entitled to no relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sanders, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">In his several applications Leano has charged, in substance, that the sentencing judge enhanced punishment on the basis of a conviction void because he had not been afforded his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed. 2d 592 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\"> The initial motion was denied by the sentencing judge, who observed in passing that he had not considered Leano\u2019s prior conviction when fixing punishment. Such informal disclaimers have indeed been given controlling weight in instances where a petitioner\u2019s allegations were essentially all that appeared in the record. United States v. Eidum, 474 F.2d 581 (9th Cir. 1973); Dukes v. United States, 492 F.2d 1187 (9th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But Leano\u2019s allegations do not stand alone. To the contrary, they are fully corroborated; the transcript of the proceedings on Leano\u2019s arraignment for sentence makes evident the \u201creasonable probability\u201d (Tucker v. United States, 431 F.2d 1292, 1294 (9th Cir. 1972)) that the prior conviction played a vital role in the fixing of the questioned sentences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>denial of the first motion was not \u201con the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Leano\u2019s second motion was denied by an order which contains the recital that \u201cThere is nothing in the petition to indicate that petitioner did other than make a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We fail to understand the import of this statement. True, the allegations appearing in Leano\u2019s second application are imprecise, but, as noted above, they are sufficient to charge an unconstitutional denial of counsel and were so regarded both by the court and the district attorney. But even if we construe the statement to mean that the records, etc., affirmatively show a valid waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u2014 for such a waiver cannot be presumed (Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969)) \u2014 the court\u2019s factual conclusion is simply in error. The sole mention of waiver appears in the commitment wherein it is stated that when Leano was arraigned for sentence, \u201che appeared in person and without counsel; (that) the court advised the defendant of his right to counsel and asked him whether he desired to have counsel appointed by the court and the- defendant thereupon stated that he waived the right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d If relevant at all, this recital suggests that when Leano was earlier arraigned for plea, he was then \u201cwithout counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> It follows that the denial of the second motion, like the first, was not \u201con the merits.\u201d Accordingly, and as in <em>Tucker, supra, </em>431 F.2d at 1294, the order is vacated and \u201cthe cause is remanded to the district court for resentencing without consideration of any prior convictions which is invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\">. \u201cThis means that if factual issues (were) raised in the prior application, and it was not denied on the basis that the files and records conclusively resolved those issues, an evidentiary hearing was held.\u201d Sanders at p. 16, 83 S.Ct. at p. 1077.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\">. The statement in <em>Bidum, </em>reiterated with approval in <em>Buhes, </em>was \u201cThis court will not refute the judge\u2019s own estimation of the deleterious impact of the prior convictions on his determination of sentence. The record shows on its face that the judge did not consider those convictions in imposing sentence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-12\">. These sentences were for violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a. That statute provides a term of not less than five nor more than twenty years for a first offender, and a term of not less than ten nor more than forty years for a second. An offender\u2019s status as a recidivist is established by filing an information against him setting forth the prior conviction and either proving or securing an admission of identity. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">As the following extracts from the arraignment proceedings show, not only did the district attorney file such an information and Leano admit the allegation, but the district judge during the colloquy and in pronouncing sentence referred to the term that he was imposing as \u201cthe minimum.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-18\"><em>u </em>* 5\u00a1S *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-19\">MR.
