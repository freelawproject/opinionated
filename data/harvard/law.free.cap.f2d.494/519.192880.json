We need not address most of these, since it appears that the essential finding of willfulness, now passionately protested, was made in a proceeding instituted without the customary warning letter, which the Judicial Officer conceded might well have resulted in prompt correction of the claimed insuffi-ciencies. Under these circumstances, the finding of willfulness appears erroneous on the record taken as a whole, and the sanctions imposed unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">The petition for review is granted and the order set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
