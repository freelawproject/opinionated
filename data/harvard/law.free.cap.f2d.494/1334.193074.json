Freeman filed a complaint seeking a judgment declaring his various obligations to the Community Bank of Lyn-brook, Long Island, void as extensions of credit in violation of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. He claimed that the bank lent him the full purchase price of stocks listed on national securities ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>changes for the purpose of purchasing and carrying such stocks, and that his indebtedness was evidenced by \u201cwritten negotiable instruments,\u201d in the hands of the bank or its assigns, the cancellation and return of which he prayed. He did not allege that the credit was secured, either directly or indirectly, by stocks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">The Community Bank merged with the appellee Marine Midland Bank-New York on September 30, 1970. The successor bank denied having extended credit to Freeman, denied having advanced funds for the purpose of carrying or purchasing securities, and set up three \u201caffirmative defenses\u201d: failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the plaintiff\u2019s unclean hands in procuring the funds. Alleging that Freeman and a faithless bank employee conspired to defraud the bank, it counterclaimed in fraud for $88,843.77.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-18\">Subject matter jurisdiction was properly based on section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-20\">Freeman resisted Marine Midland\u2019s motion under Rule 12(b)(6) with his own and his attorney\u2019s affidavits, which were answered by an affidavit of the bank\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-21\">The affidavits show an extended course of dealing between Freeman and the bank, a course characterized as \u25a0 an \u201cillegal extension of credit\u201d by Freeman, and characterized as a \u201ccheck kiting scheme\u201d by the bank. At various times, commencing in 1965, Community Bank paid directly to broker-dealers the full purchase price of stocks purchased for Freeman\u2019s account. When the securities were delivered to the bank, it in turn delivered them to Freeman (it is the latter delivery that the bank insists was fraudulently procured by Freeman).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>change for the stock certificates, Freeman gave the bank his personal checks for the purchase price drawn on New York City banks. At first, sufficient funds were available to cover these checks, but as the course of dealing progressed, Freeman drew them against insufficient funds. In the case of such transactions, Freeman asked that the checks be held by Community Bank until funds were deposited in and collected by the drawee bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">Freeman, in his affidavit, described his agreement with Community Bank as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-6\">\u201cThe securities were delivered to me upon the express understanding that I would use them only to sell them promptly and deposit the proceeds in my New York bank to allow [the Community Bank] to present for payment the checks tendered to [the Community Bank] in exchange for the securities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">Early in 1968, the bank paid for shares of a speculative stock listed on the American Stock Exchange, and delivered them to Freeman against his post-dated checks for $365,943.77. Before Freeman could sell the stock and cover the overdrafts, the Securities and Exchange Commission stopped trading in the issue. The scheme collapsed on April 16, 1968, when Freeman informed the bank that he would not be able to make the checks good.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-13\">Marine Midland took the position in the district court that Freeman did not make out a claim because he did not allege that the credit was \u201csecured\u201d by a stock, as that term is used in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.-1(a) (1973). Freeman offered to cure his pleading by amending it to state the conclusion of violations of sections 7(a) and (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78g(a) &amp; (d) (1970), arguing that it is not necessary to allege a security arrangement to make out a violation of the Exchange Act. The district court granted the 12(b) (6) motion, dismissing the complaint with prejudice, and denied Freeman\u2019s motion for leave to amend. Freeman appeals from the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">On the basis of the scant record before \u00fas, we reverse and remand. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that a complaint based on the margin requirements must allege that the indebtedness is secured directly or indirectly by stock, but we find that the affidavits disclose a triable issue of fact as to whether the obligations in question were indirectly secured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">Freeman\u2019s first contention on this appeal is that the district court erred in holding that the complaint must allege that Freeman\u2019s loan from the bank was \u201csecured\u201d by a stock. His position, that he need only allege that credit was extended \u201cfor the purpose of purchasing or carrying a security,\u201d is based on the portion of section 7 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-5\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person . to extend or maintain credit . for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any security, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall prescribe . . . \u201d Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \u00a7 7(d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 78g(d) (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">Freeman\u2019s interpretation of the statute focuses on the language \u201cfor the purpose of purchasing or carrying any security,\u201d while it ignores the obviously limiting language \u201cin contravention of such rules and regulations as the Board of Governors . . . shall prescribe.\u201d A loan does not offend against section 7(d) unless it violates the margin regulations promulgated under section 7 by the Federal Reserve Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">To violate Regulation U, it is not sufficient that a bank extend \u201cpurpose\u201d credit; it must also take stock as security for such credit. The regulation states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-10\">\u201cno bank shall extend any credit <em>secured directly or indirectly </em>by any stock for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock in an amount exceeding the maximum loan value of the collateral. . . .\u201d12 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.1(a) (1973) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">To be subject to Regulation U, a loan must be for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities, and it must be collateralized, either directly or indirectly; by stock. Solomon &amp; Hart, Recent Developments in the Regulation of Securities Credit, 20 J. of Public L. 167, 174 (1971). The purpose requirement is statutory, deriving from section 7(d). The security requirement is from Regulation U, and embodies the Board\u2019s determination that banks should not be saddled with the burden of determining whether the purpose of each unsecured loan is to purchase or carry securities. Id. Were we to hold that Freeman\u2019s complaint is sufficient on its face, we would impose that burden on the Community Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-15\">Freeman\u2019s complaint was defective in failing to allege that the obligation was directly or indirectly secured. Because the facts alleged were not sufficient to make out a violation of Regulation U, they do not make out a violation of section 7. Thus section 29, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78ce (1970), which voids contracts made in violation of the Exchange Act, does not avail Freeman. Because the proff\u00e9red amendment to Freeman\u2019s pleadings did not contain sufficient additional facts to make out a violation of section 7, the district court acted within its discretion in refusing leave to amend the complaint to state the conclusion of a section 7 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-17\">Despite the fact that Freeman\u2019s pleading was defective, the district court erred in dismissing the complaint. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that when matters outside the pleadings are considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the motion is to be treated as a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, F.R.Civ.Proc. 12(b). 6 J. Moore, Federal Practice f\u00ed 56.02 [3] (1972); Pirone v. Flemming, 278 F.2d 508 (2d Cir. 1960), aff\u2019g, 183 F.Supp. 739 (S.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>N.Y.1959). The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit opposing the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been considered in testing the sufficiency of his pleadings, as well as in testing whether a triable issue of fact exists on the question of whether the arrangement with the bank was an indirectly secured loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">The gist of Freeman\u2019s statement as to the nature of his deal with the bank is that he was to sell the securities turned over to him by Community Bank, using the proceeds to cover the overdrafts on his. New York bank. The arrangement, if proved at trial, may come within the scope of the words \u201cindirectly secured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">Regulation U defines \u201cindirectly secured\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018indirectly secured\u2019 includes any arrangement with the customer under which the customer\u2019s right or ability to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of stock owned by the customer is in any way restricted so long as the credit remains outstanding . ...\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.3(c) (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\">The regulation does not require that a lender take any of the steps usually necessary to create a legally enforceable security interest. Rather it focuses on whether the arrangement impinges on the ability of the borrower to dispose of his securities. Regulation U is drafted in terms broad enough to' combat any sharp practice developed by a lender to avoid the effect of the margin requirements and yet put himself in a better position than a general creditor. It is significant that Freeman\u2019s obligations to the bank were payable on demand, rather than at fixed maturities, and that the record does not disclose that the advances were supported- by the type of current financial data usually required to justify the extension of personal credit. Both of these factors support an inference that the bank was primarily relying on the stock for repayment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">One of the examples illustrating the meaning of \u201cindirect security\u201d in the Board of Governors interpretations accompanying Regulation U is similar to the arrangement disclosed by Freeman\u2019s affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-13\">\u201cA borrower may not deposit his stock with the bank, but agree not to pledge or encumber his assets elsewhere while the loan is outstanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-14\">\u201cSuch an agreement may be difficult to police, yet it serves to some extent to protect the interest of the bank if only because the future credit standing and business reputation of the borrower will depend upon his keeping his word. If the assets covered by such an agreement include stock, then . . . the stock is \u2018indirect security\u2019 for the loan within the meaning of this part.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.113(f)(2) (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-16\">The central issues of fact in this case remain unresolved, but it appears that plaintiff states a claim for relief. The district court\u2019s decision granting the defendant\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion is reversed, and the cause is remanded for appropriate further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">. Freeman\u2019s complaint reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-6\">\u201cFOURTH: At various times in the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-7\">past defendant extended credit to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-8\">\u201cFIFTH: Defendant extended credit to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-9\">plaintiff for the purpose of purchasing and carrying stocks registered and listed on national securities exchanges, and defendant knew that the loans were made to plaintiff for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-10\">\u201cSIXTH: Loans were made by defend-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-11\">ant to plaintiff for the full purchase price of the stocks, in violation of Regulation \u201cU\u201d promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-12\">\u201cSEVENTH: Plaintiff is presently in-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-13\">debted to defendant as a result of the aforementioned loans made for the purpose of purchasing and carrying stocks registered on national securities exchanges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-14\">\u201cEIGHTH: As evidence of plaintiff\u2019s indebtedness to defendant for the aforementioned loans, plaintiff issued to defendant written negotiable instruments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-15\">\u201cNINTH: Such written instruments are</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-16\">contracts made in violation of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and of Regulation \u201cU\u201d of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System promulgated thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-17\">\u201cTENTH: Such contracts are void pursuant to Section 29(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.G. 78cc(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-23\">\u201cELEVENTH: Upon information and belief, some of the written instruments issued by plaintiff may have been assigned to other party or parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-24\">\u201cWHEREFORE, plaintiff demands judgment declaring void the debt owed to defendant as resulting from loans made in violation of the Statute and ordering defendant or defendant\u2019s assigns to surrender any written instruments evidencing such debt to this Court to be cancelled and for such other and further relief as this Court deems proper, together with the costs and disbursements of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1420-25\">. The counterclaim represents the uninsured portion of the bank\u2019s loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1420-26\">. The Marine Midland side of the story is summarized in its affidavit supporting the motion to dismiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-27\">\u201c(a) commencing in or about August, 1965, Freeman together with an officer of the Bank engaged in a scheme to defraud the Bank pursuant to which Freeman purchased securities from or through various securities brokerage concerns and ordered the securities delivered to the Bank for delivery against payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-28\">\u201c(b) after securities were delivered to the Bank, plaintiff Freeman fraudulently procured the delivery of the securities to himself by delivering to his co-conspirator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>within the Bank a cheek or checks drawn against insufficient funds in his personal checking account at another bank, which plaintiff and confederate knew did not contain sufficient funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-9\">\u201c(c) upon information and belief plaintiff Freeman immediately thereafter would sell the securities which he had fraudulently obtained from the Bank and deposit the receipts in his personal checking account at the other bank in an attempt to cover the check or checks which he had previously delivered to his co-conspirator at the Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-10\">\u201c(d) As part of this fraudulent scheme Freeman\u2019s co-conspirator would hold such check or checks in his personal possession until informed by Freeman that the securities had been sold and sufficient funds had been deposited in plaintiff\u2019s personal checking account to cover the check which he had previously delivered to his co-conspirator at the Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-15\">\u201c(e) On or about April 16, 1968, the scheme collapsed when Freeman was unable to sell the securities which he had fraudulently obtained from the bank for an amount sufficient to cover the checks which he had previously delivered -to his co-conspirator at the Bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1421-16\">. All of the events giving rise to this action took place prior to the effective date of section 7(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by section 301 of the Bank Records and Foreign Transactions Act, Pub.L.No. 91-508, 84 Stat. 1114 (1970), and prior to the promulgation of Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 224 (1973). We therefore need not determine the effect of Regulation X, which makes the knowing borrower particeps criminis with the lender in a Regulation U violation, on our holding in Pearlstein v. Scudder &amp; German, 429 F.2d 1136 (2d Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 401 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>1013, 91 S.Ct. 1250, 28 L.Ed.2d 550 (1971), the basis for this action. <em>Pearlstein </em>held that a borrower may maintain an action against a lender for margin violations despite the fact that he participated in the margin violation.
