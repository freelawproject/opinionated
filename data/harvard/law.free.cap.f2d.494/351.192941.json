He relies upon Milanovich v. United States, 365 U.S. 551, 81 S.Ct. 728, 5 L.Ed.2d 773 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-20\">As a discretionary matter, we decline to consider this issue. <em>See </em>Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837, 848 n.16, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973). The Supreme Court has indicated, \u201cThe concurrent sentence rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may have some continuing validity as a rule of judicial convenience.\u201d Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 791, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2061, 23 L. Ed.2d 707 (1969). In Barnes v. United States, <em>supra, </em>it very recently squarely employed the concurrent sentence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-21\">We can think of few circumstances where the rule can be more aptly applied than here. Appellant was convicted upon four counts with the sentences shown below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-22\">Count 8 \u2014 murder to avoid apprehension for bank robbery \u2014 50 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Count 1 \u2014 conspiracy to commit bank robbery and murder \u2014 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Count 2 \u2014 bank robbery \u2014 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Count 3 \u2014 possession of the proceeds of a bank robbery \u2014 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">All of these sentences are concurrent. The 50-year sentence is not under attack. We can think of no set of circumstances where there could be meaningful collateral effects of the sentences he now attacks. <em>See </em>Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968); Benton v. Maryland, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-23\">. Its classical application is found in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b436-9\">McCREE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Al4\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">I concur because appellant makes no claim that adverse collateral effects may result from the sentences that' he challenges here. I do not agree, however, that there exist no circumstances under which possible adverse consequences might be demonstrated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
