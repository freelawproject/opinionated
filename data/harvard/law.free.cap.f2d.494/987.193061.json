Pursuant to this authority the Secretary may assess civil penalties against operators of coal mines in which health and safety violations occur.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The present action challenges the procedures adopted by the Secretary to assess these penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-21\">Plaintiffs, an association of coal mine operators and various individual coal mine operators, seek an injunction and declaratory relief on the ground that the civil penalty assessment procedures embodied in 30 C.F.R. Pt. 100 violate the procedural requirements of Section 109(a)(3) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 819(a)(3) (1970).

This proposed assessment order refers to the particular violation, specifies the amount of the proposed penalty,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and advises the mine operator that he has 20 days from receipt of the order either to protest the proposed penalty or to petition for hearing and formal adjudication.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the operator fails timely to protest or request a formal hearing, \u201che shall be deemed to have waived his right of protest and his right of formal adjudication with opportunity for hearing, and the Proposed Assessment Order shall become the final assessment order of the Secretary of the Interior.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2P\">In the event that the operator protests the proposed order, the assessment officer may reconsider in light of the operator\u2019s arguments and redetermine, amend or reissue the proposed order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Upon amendment or reissuance of the proposed order, the operator again has 20 days to accept or reject it in whole or in part, and to request a hearing and formal adjudication.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the operator does not file a timely request for a hearing and formal adjudication, the amended or reissued proposed assessment order becomes the final assessment order of the Secretary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">In the event that the operator does request a hearing,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the hearing is de novo<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the Secretary has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation occurred and that the penalty is warranted.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The hearing examiner must render a decision based solely on the record of the hearing,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> incorporating findings of facts and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, throughout the preliminary procedures for, assessing civil penalties, formal adjudication is available to a mine operator who either contests the occurrence of the violation or protests the amount of the proposed penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\">Plaintiffs contend that these preliminary procedures violate the procedural requirements of Section 109(a)(3) of the Act which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-15\">A civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary only after the person charged with a violation under this chapter has been given an opportunity for a public hearing and the Secretary has determined, by decision incorporating his findings of fact therein, that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is warranted, and incorporating, when appropriate, an order therein requiring that the penalty be paid. Where appropriate, the Secretary shall consolidate such hearings with other pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>ceedings under section 815 of this title. Any hearing under this section shall be of record and shall be subject to section 554 of Title 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 819(a)(3) (1970). Plaintiffs argue that this section requires a formal decision incorporating findings of fact in every case regardless of whether a mine operator waives- his right to a formal hearing by failing to file an objection to the proposed assessment order. If plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the Act is correct, then the Secretary\u2019s preliminary procedures for assessing civil penalties are illegal because, absent a request for formal adjudication, the final assessment order issues without a decision which complies with the formal requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Section 109(a)(3) is logically capable of two different constructions. Plaintiffs would read the statute, even where no hearing is requested by the operator, as follows: \u201cA civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary only after . the Secretary has determined, by decision incorporating his findings of fact therein, that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is warranted . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The Secretary maintains that the requirement for a decision must be read in context and that the section as a whole describes the formal adjudicative process which is available to a mine operator upon his request. The Act clearly requires a formal decision whenever disputed issues are contested in a hearing. However, according to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, the requirement for a formal decision of the character and extent for which appellant argues, is linked to the statutory guarantee of an opportunity for a hearing. Under this interpretation a formal decision is not required unless the mine operator takes advantage of that opportunity by requesting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">In deciding which is the proper interpretation it is helpful to identify the nature of the decision contemplated by the Act. The Act requires more than an \u201cact of deciding.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The decision described in Section 109(a)(3) parallels the decision required by the Administrative Procedure Act (hereinafter APA) after a formal hearing has been conducted. The APA specifies that a decision following a hearing must include \u201c(A) findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record; and (B) the appropriate rule, order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A decision under Section 109(a)(3) must include (1) findings on the material issues of the occurrence of a violation and the amount of the penalty, and (2) an order requiring that the penalty be paid.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This similarity to a formal APA decision suggests that when a decision is required under Section 109(a)(3), it must contain \u201cspecific and detailed findings and conclusions of the kind customarily associated with formal proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">Plaintiffs would interpret the Act to require this kind of formal decision even though the mine operator wilfully chooses not to request a hearing on the proposed penalty. However, once given notice of his right to object, the operator\u2019s failure to request a hearing suggests that he does not dispute the fact of violation nor disagree with the appropriateness of the specific penalty proposed. As the district court pointed out, in the absence of a request for a hearing the Secretary may act on the information available to him and need not adduce evidence for the other side.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Where no issue is disputed by the operator, we do not believe that Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>109(a)(3) requires the Secretary to prepare a formal decision which merely would consist of the same information already contained in the proposed assessment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\"> In situations where a statute prescribes a hearing prior to agency action the courts have held that the agency need not conduct a hearing if no disputed issue exists.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cIn such situations, the rationale is that Congress does not intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Similarly, as we interpret Section 109(a)(3), the Secretary need not prepare a formal decision where there is no dispute and the operator evidences his satisfaction with the proposed penalty by choosing not to request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\"> If the operator wants to contest 'the alleged violation or if he believes that his particular circumstances warrant a lesser penalty, he need only request a hearing and briefly describe the issues in dispute. Such a request puts the Secretary to his burden in a hearing of proving both the violation and the appropriateness of the penalty. Following the hearing the Secretary has the statutory responsibility for preparing a \u201cdecision incorporating his findings of fact therein.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">The legislative history of Section 109(a)(3) supports the foregoing interpretation of the statute with respect to the decision requirement. Both the Senate and House bills, in the form in which each bill passed its respective house, required a formal decision only after a hearing had been conducted. The House bill provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-13\">Upon written request made by an operator within thirty days after re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>ceipt of an order assessing a penalty under this section, the Secretary shall afford such operator an opportunity for a hearing and, <em>in accordance with the request, </em>determine by decision whether or not a violation did occur or whether the amount of the penalty is warranted or should be compromised.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">The Senate bill read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-5\">An order assessing a civil penalty under this subsection shall be issued by the Secretary only after the person against whom the order is issued has been given an opportunity for a hearing and the Secretary has determined by decision incorporating findings of fact <em>based on the record of such hearing </em>whether or not a violation did occur and the amount of the penalty, if any, which is warranted. Section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code shall apply to any such hearing and decision.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">The italicized language demonstrates that under both the Senate and the House bills the requirement for a formal decision was clearly tied to the operator\u2019s request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Following passage in both houses, the respective bills were referred to a Conference Committee on the disagreeing votes between the two houses. Although the Conference Committee \u201cadopt [ed] the Senate provision,\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the Committee deleted the language italicized above. Thus the italicized language did not appear in Section 109(a)(3) of the Conference bill which eventually was enacted. The only explanation for this section appears as follows in the Conference Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\">Both the Senate bill and the House amendment provided an <em>opportunity </em>for a hearing in assessing such penalties, but the Senate bill required a record hearing under 5 U.S.C. 554. The conference substitute adopts the Senate provision with the added provision that, where appropriate, such as in the case of an appeal from a withdrawal order, an effort should be made to consolidate the hearings. The commencement of such proceedings, however, shall not stay any notice or order involving a violation of a standard.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">We do not believe that the Conference Committee\u2019s deletion of the italicized language from the Senate bill reflected an intent to alter the procedural requirements of the bill. The Committee\u2019s concern was that the Act afford an <em>opportunity </em>for formal adjudication under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 and the Conference Report emphasized that \u201c[bjoth the Senate bill and the House amendment provided an <em>opportunity </em>for a hearing. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> If, as plaintiffs suggest, the Committee intended to alter the bill\u2019s procedural requirements to require a formal decision where the operator did not avail himself of the opportunity for formal adjudication, one would expect the Committee to mention the change in the Conference Report. Their failure to do so, together with their statement that they adopted the Senate provision, indicates that the Committee deleted the italicized language because they considered it sur-plusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">The district court expressed concern that the preliminary procedures adopted by the Secretary \u201cwould shift the initial burden to the mine operator charged with a violation,\u201d and that \u201cCongress chose not to adopt such an approach when it was expressly proposed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>\u2018administration bills\u2019 of the proposed legislation.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We do not share the district court\u2019s concern. Requiring the operator to request a hearing and briefly describe the issues in dispute does not impose a significant burden upon the operator. At the hearing the burden remains with the Secretary to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Furthermore, the legislative history does not reflect congressional disapproval of the procedures adopted by the Secretary. Although the administration bills did specify a procedure similar to that challenged here, the broad procedural requirements ultimately adopted are not inconsistent with the more detailed provisions of the administration bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">The administration bills, as well as the bill approved by the House, specified that a mine operator must request a hearing in writing within 30 days after receipt of an assessment order.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The corresponding section of the Senate bill afforded the mine operator an opportunity for formal adjudication but did not detail the specific procedures for requesting a hearing.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The statement in the Conference Report, set forth above,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> indicates that the Conference Committee considered the only significant difference between these sections of the bills to be the reference in the Senate bill to the Administrative Procedure Act, and that this slight difference was the reason it adopted the language of the Senate bill. In view of the explanation provided by the Report of the Conference Committee, we cannot conclude that Congress intended to disapprove the more specific procedure outlined in the administration bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">We conclude that the Act does not require the Secretary to prepare a formal decision unless the mine operator exercises his right to request formal adjudication. Upon receipt of a proposed assessment order, if a mine operator wants to contest either the fact of violation or the amount of the proposed penalty, he need only request a hearing and briefly describe the issues in dispute. Following such a request the Secretary must provide formal adjudication in compliance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554, including a formal decision. The Act does not require a formal decision where no hearing is requested and no issues are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.

Storer Broadcasting <em>Co., supra, </em>the FCC had denied a license application without a hearing because the application established on its face a violation of a substantive FCC rule. Even though the governing statute required a \u201cfull hearing\u201d before denial of an application, the Supreme Court concluded that where an application clearly contravened substantive rules, a hearing was unnecessary unless the application</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-8\">set forth reasons, sufficient if true, to justify a change or waiver of the <em>Rules. We </em>do not think Congress intended the Commission to waste time on applications that do not state a valid basis for a hearing. If any applicant is aggrieved by a refusal, the way for review is open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 205, 76 S.Ct. at 772. Therefore, the statutorily prescribed \u201cfull hearing\u201d was only required where the applicant demonstrated the existence of a disputed issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-15\">A similar situation exists in the present case. A notice of violation issued to a mine operator evidences a violation of the substantive health and safety standards established by Congress, and the proposed penalty assessment order is based upon the notice of violation. The operator is advised that he has the right to request formal adjudication and he is fully advised of the consequences of a failure to request such adjudication. If any mine operator objects to the notice of violation or to the proposed penalty and desires a formal decision, he need only request formal adjudication. As in the <em>Storer Broadcasting </em>decision, \u201cthe way for review is open.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1076-16\">. United States v. Consolidated Mines &amp; Smelting Co., 455 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1076-17\">. We thus interpret the Act to permit any mine operator who desires a formal decision on the alleged violation or the amount of the proposed penalty to obtain such decision merely by indicating his objection and making a simple request for a hearing. By failing to request a hearing he waives his right to formal adjudication. This procedure is analogous to the procedure in civil litigation where a defendant who fails to answer a complaint may have a default judgment entered against him.
