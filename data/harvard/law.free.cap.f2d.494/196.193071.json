KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The importance of the question presented on this appeal cannot be gauged by reference to the relatively small amount in controversy. Indeed, the more than fourteen thousand dollars of disputed liability arising from the unauthorized use of an executive\u2019s Air Travel Card, issued to Remis Industries, Inc., pales in significance when viewed in the light of the sums which may well depend on our determination of the ambit of statutory credit card protection afforded by the 1970 amendment to the Truth in Lending Act. Since we find that the credit card abuses which Congress sought to eliminate plague all cardholders without meaningful distinction, we decline to interpret Congress\u2019s enactment in a way that would sap the strength of the statutory safeguards it provided. It is our belief that by arbitrarily confining the scope of the Truth in Lending Act\u2019s application to a limited class of cardholders, we would undermine Congress\u2019s purpose to afford a broad\u2019er and more meaningful protection to all who enter the credit card domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Remis Industries is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the sale of hides and other equine by-products. Since 1943 its personnel have been using Air Travel Cards which, although issued in this instance by American Airlines, are accepted by all airlines for the purchase of tickets on credit. Remis entered into a \u201cUniversal Air Travel Plan Subscriber\u2019s Contract\u201d with American and in May, 1971 forwarded a \u201cRequest for Travel Cards\u201d form to American in New York. On May 19, American approved the renewal of its contract with Remis and soon thereafter issued new Air Travel Cards, including one for use by Abraham Lerner, Remis\u2019s Vice President and General Manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In August, 1971 Lerner received a call from a Royal Dutch Airlines representative informing him that there had been an error in the billing of six round-trip tickets from Miami to Curacao charged to his Air Travel Card on August 6. Since Lerner had not purchased these tickets, he immediately realized that his Air Travel Card had either been lost or stolen. Because of this, he promptly notified American of the card\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Much to Lerner\u2019s chagrin, he soon learned that airline tickets totaling $14,008.16 had been charged to his Air Travel Card during the period of its loss and prior to his notification of American. When American duly requested payment of this amount from Remis, the company refused to pay because the charges stemmed from an unauthorized use of the credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">American filed suit against Remis in February, 1972 in New York State Supreme Court. On March 6, 1972, Remis removed the action to United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on grounds of diversity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. In its answer to the complaint, Remis contended that the amount in issue resulted from an unauthorized use of Lerner\u2019s Air Travel Card; that American was negligent in permitting the card\u2019s unauthorized use; and that, in any event, under either Massachusetts law or New York law, liability for the unauthorized use of a credit card was limited to $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">With the issues joined, American moved for summary judgment. It argued that the \u201cUniversal Air Travel Plan Subscriber\u2019s Contract\u201d signed by Remis obligated the company to pay for all tickets charged to its account prior to the receipt by American of notice that an Air Travel Card had been lost. The various affirmative defenses raised by Remis, American contended, were insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">On August 8, 1972, in an opinion reported only in 4 CCH Cons.Cred.Guide jf 99,123, Judge Cannella denied the motion. Finding New York law to be applicable, he held that American had failed to comply with the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>precedent to the recovery of charges resulting from the unauthorized use of a credit card, limited in any case to $50, as contained in N.Y.G.B.L. \u00a7 512. Moreover, in so doing, Judge Cannella rejected American\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 512 was not applicable in this instance because that section, by its language, extends protection only so far as the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601, et seq. \u2014 which in turn, argued American, does not apply to credit cards issued to corporations or to credit cards used for business or commercial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Following Judge Cannella\u2019s decision, the parties stipulated that his order would be considered as granting partial summary judgment to Remis dismissing the complaint in excess of $50, and that the balance of the claim would be voluntarily dismissed by American. On April 23, 1973, this stipulation was embodied in an order issued by Judge MacMahon and, with no claim remaining to be litigated, American appealed from the April 23rd order as a final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Although we cannot agree with the rationale of Judge Cannella\u2019s opinion, we believe his conclusion \u2014 that Remis\u2019s maximum liability for the unauthorized use of its Air Travel Card is $50 \u2014 is correct. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We begin by examining N.Y.G.B.L. \u00a7 512 upon which Judge Cannella relied as the exclusive determinant of Remis\u2019s potential liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">A provision which imposes liability upon a holder for a cash advance or loan or for the purchase or lease of property or services obtained by the unauthorized use of a credit card shall not be enforceable to the extent that it imposes a greater liability upon the holder than is imposed under the provisions of the act of Congress entitled \u201cTruth in Lending Act\u201d and the regulations thereunder, as such act and regulations may from time to time be amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">McKinney\u2019s Cons.Laws of N.Y. Cumulative Pocket Suppl. for 1973-1974. The reference to the Truth in Lending Act is quite clear. Judge Cannella construed that reference as defining the dollar amount of maximum liability under New York law \u2014 $50, pursuant to \u00a7 133(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1643(a) \u2014 but not the scope of section 512\u2019s coverage. That, he concluded, was governed by the definitions contained in the New York Act, N.Y.G.B.L. \u00a7 511, which on their face include all credit card holders, natural persons as well as corporations, without exception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, without interpreting the range of the Truth in Lending Act as a whole, the district judge determined that \u00a7 512 imposed a liability limitation on the Air Travel Card issued to Remis. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that the plain language of a statute offers the primary guidance to its meaning. Indeed, the New York Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">[Where] the language found in the statute is clear and unambiguous, . the intent of the framers \u201cis to be sought first of all, in the words and language employed, and if the words are free from ambiguity and doubt, and express plainly, clearly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>distinctly, the sense of the framers of the instrument, there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d McCluskey v. Cromwell, 11 N. Y. 593, 601-602.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Meltzer v. Koenigsberg, 302 N.Y. 523, 525, 99 N.E.2d 679 (1951). <em>See also </em>Roosevelt Raceway v. Monaghan, 9 N.Y. 2d 293, 304, 213 N.Y.S.2d 729, 174 N.E. 2d 71 (1961); Daniman v. Board of Education, 306 N.Y. 532, 543, 119 N.E.2d 373 (1954). We believe that the clear language of \u00a7 512, by referring without qualification to the <em>\u201cprovisions </em>of the act of Congress entitled \u201cTruth in Lending Act\u2019,\u201d simply does not support the selective incorporation approach adopted below. Accordingly, although New York\u2019s statutory definitions are sufficiently broad to cover Remis, and the statutory predecessors of \u00a7 512 applied without distinction to corporate and individual credit card holders, we believe that the language of the present statute requires a determination of Remis\u2019s liability under the Truth in Lending Act. If New York intended a more restricted applicability of that Act, as Remis urges, it is for the New York legislature and not this Court to amend the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">When the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 et seq. was enacted on May 29, 1968, it contained no reference to credit card transactions. Rather, its limited though important purpose was, in the words of the Act itself, \u201cto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The statement of purpose reveals that Congress was focusing its attention on credit transactions involving the consumer \u2014 transactions \u201cin which the party to whom credit is offered or extended is a natural person, and the money, property, or services which are the subject of the transactions are primarily for personal, family, household, or agricultural purposes.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(h). Corporate debtors or individuals who secure credit for business or commercial purposes were thought to be amply sophisticated \u2014 that is, sufficiently able to satisfy the Act\u2019s goal of utilizing credit in an \u201cinformed\u201d manner, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\u2014 so that mandatory disclosure requirements were not warranted for that genre of credit transaction. <em>See </em>Warren &amp; Larmore, Truth in Lending: Problems of Coverage, 24 Stan.L.Rev. 793, 809-810 (1972). And, in fact, the report of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">Most businesses or corporations are in a good position to judge the relative worth of alternate credit plans and by and large do not require the special disclosure protections provided by the bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">S.Rep. No. 392, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1967). Accordingly, to implement this view, the Truth in Lending Act includes a provision, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603, which reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">This subchapter does not apply to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">(1) Credit transactions involving extensions of credit for business or commercial purposes, or ... to organizations [defined to include corporations and partnerships].</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">Although the original Truth in Lending Act included no provisions governing the expanding world of credit card use, the House of Representatives, at least, had begun to examine this aspect of the credit field as early as 1967. In that year, Representative Wright Pat-man introduced the first bill, H.R. 12646, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), designed to regulate the mailing of unsolicited credit cards, and chaired the hearings before the House Committee on Banking and Currency on this subject. <em>See </em>Weistart, Consumer Protection in the Credit Card Industry: Federal Legislative Controls, 70 Mich.L.Rev. 1476, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>1483-1485 (1972). The following year, the Senate commenced an investigation of the credit card field, the initial hearings beginning in October, 1968 before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968). <em>Id. </em>at 1485-1486 n. 37. By 1970, these hearings bore fruit in the form of legislation, the purposes of which were threefold: (1), to prohibit the distribution of unsolicited credit cards; (2), to limit the liability of a cardholder for the unauthorized use of his card to $50; and (3), to make the fraudulent use of a credit card a crime punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both. For its own esoteric reasons, Congress enacted this legislation as an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act, adding definitional subsections, 15 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602(j-o), and substantive sections, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1642-1644.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Section 1643(a), of principal concern in this case, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa-dedup-0\">A cardholder shall be liable for the unauthorized use of a credit card only if the card is an accepted credit card, the liability is not in excess of $50 ., and the unauthorized use occurs before the cardholder has notified the card issuer that an unauthorized use of the credit card has occurred or may occur as a result of loss, theft, or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The term \u201ccardholder\u201d is broadly defined as \u201cany person to whom a credit card is issued,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 (m); with the term \u201cperson\u201d defined in the Act\u2019s original definitions as \u201ca natural person or an organization,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(d), and \u201corganization\u201d defined to include a corporation, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(c). Thus, upon putting together this definitional jigsaw puzzle, one finds that \u00a7 1643(a) protects all credit card holders \u2014 individual and corporate alike. Clearly, this would appear to limit Re-mis\u2019s liability from the unauthorized use of its Air Travel Card to $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">American argues, however, that we must read \u00a7 1643(a), which after all was an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act, in the light of \u00a7 1603, the section to which we have already referred, which exempts from the Act\u2019s purview \u201ccredit transactions involving extensions of credit for business or commercial purposes, or . . .to organizations.\u201d American\u2019s brief accordingly urges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">[S] ince it is beyond dispute that American extended credit to \u25a0 Remis Industries for business or commercial purposes, and that Remis Industries is a corporation, the exemption contained in section 104 of the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603] precludes Re-mis Industries from invoking the limitation of liability contained in section 133 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1643(a)],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As9\">American\u2019s argument founders not only on well-established principles of statutory construction but also on the uniform and contrary interpretation of the relationship between \u00a7 1603 and the 1970 credit card amendment voiced by both the Federal Reserve Board, <em>see </em>37 Fed.Reg. 24339, and the Federal Trade Commission, <em>see </em>In re Credit Card Service Corp. d/b/a Credit Card Service Bureau, CCH Trade Reg.Rep. f[ 20, 215 &lt;Jan. 19, 1973), appeal docketed, No. 73-1357, D.C.Cir. (Apr. 6, 1973). The rule of statutory construction to which we turn in this instance has been enunciated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">[T] he provisions introduced by the amendatory act should be read together with the provisions of the original section that were . . . left unchanged, as if they had been originally enacted as one section. Effect is to be given to each part, and they are to be interpreted so they do not conflict. If the new provisions and the ... unchanged portions of the original section cannot be harmonized, the new provisions should prevail as the latest declaration of the legislative will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">1A J. Sutherland,' Statutes and Statutory Construction, jf 22.34, p. 196 (4th ed. C. Sands 1972). We are of the view that by applying \u00a7 1603 to limit the scope of both the original disclosure provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the credit card provisions added in 1970, as American suggests, we would produce such statutory obfuscation that it would surely thwart the intent of Congress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To avoid this cacophony, \u00a7 1603 cannot be construed as circumscribing the salutary protection afforded by the credit card amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We note, for example, that application of \u00a7 1603 to \u00a7 1643(a) would raise a threshold question for which the Act at least provides no ready answer: at what point in the credit card process does a transaction involving the extension of credit occur? Since the likely response is at the time the credit card issues,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> confusion would prevail over the classification of cards issued to natural persons. Were the cards issued for business or commercial use and thus excluded from protection, or were they for personal use and hence covered under \u00a7 1643(a)? To be sure, a predominant use test might provide a solution, <em>cf. </em>Brill v. Newport National Bank, 4 CCH Cons.Cred.Guide If 99,057 (S.D.N.Y. 1973). But the extensive, overlapping use of some types of credit cards, e. g. to purchase gasoline or meals in a restaurant, would make this test wholly unwieldy in application.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In addition to producing needless uncertainty, engrafting the scope limitations of \u00a7 1603 upon the 1970 credit card provisions would replace the uniform safeguards demanded by the nature of the problems which Congress addressed with a crazy-quilt design of cardholder protection. The \u201cdeep pocket\u201d theory might provide a superficial basis for distinguishing corporate from individual cardholders. But, more persuasive considerations, such as the preferential position of the card issuer to insure against the risk of card loss, see Weistart, <em>supra </em>at 1517, and the incapacity of corporations and individuals alike to prevent the unsolicited distribution of credit cards, suggest that Congress intended to protect all credit card holders without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Nor do we find particularly cogent American\u2019s argument that, unlike consumers, corporations and individuals who use credit cards for business or commercial purposes do not need the statutory safeguard of limited liability for they are capable of apportioning the risk of loss by contract. Indeed, the facts here furnish a convincing answer to this contention. In order to obtain its Air Travel Cards, Remis was required to sign a contract entitled <em>\u201cUniversal </em>Air Travel Plan Subscriber\u2019s Contract.\u201d (emphasis added). It would not be illogical to presume, based on this appellation, that, in the case of Air Travel Cards and, we suspect, in the credit card field in general, bargaining is a rather euphemistic characterization of what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>essentially a take-it-or-leave-it method of contract formulation. Thus, any differential in bargaining power or sophistication among cardholders would appear to be effectively neutralized by the use of form contracts in lieu of negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Finally, a statutory construction limiting the applicability of the \u00a7 1603 exemptions to the Truth in Lending Act as originally enacted, is surely buttressed by the concurrence of both the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission in that interpretation. The Board, charged with prescribing regulations pursuant to the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, amended its so-called \u201cRegulation Z\u201d to make explicit that the Act\u2019s protection extends to corporate cardholders as well as to cards issued for business or commercial purposes. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.-13(a)(4) (1973) (amended Nov. 2, 1972). Although this amendment was adopted subsequent to the transaction at issue, the timing does not detract one whit from the relevance of the Board\u2019s views. The language of the amendment is precise in stating that the amendment\u2019s purpose was merely to clarify the existing statutory language. <em>See </em>37 Fed.Reg. 24339 (1972). Similarly the Federal Trade Commission, the agency with primary enforcement responsibilities under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607, has also held that the Act\u2019s credit card provisions apply to all cardholders. In re Credit Card Service Corp. d/b/a Credit Card Service Bureau, <em>supra. </em>Since these administrative expressions concerning the Act\u2019s proper construction should be given great weight, Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 210, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972), and especially so, where, as here, Congress delegated broad power to the supervising agencies, Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 371-373, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973), we believe that any abstruseness caused by the Truth in Lending Act\u2019s ambiguities should be resolved in favor of these sound agency interpretations. Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 133(a) of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1643(a), limiting liability exposure to $50 where the credit card use has been unauthorized, applies to all credit card holders. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">. Since neither party disputes Judge Cannel-la\u2019s finding that New York law governs here, we have no occasion to examine the validity of that finding on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\">. \u201cHolder\u201d is defined in \u00a7 511(4) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">a person to whom such a credit card is issued or who has agreed with the issuer to pay obligations arising from the use of a credit card issued to another person ;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">And, \u201cperson,\u201d in turn, \u00a7 511(2), as :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ary-dedup-0\">an individual, corporation, partnership or association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest or any other legal or commercial entity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\">. No legislative history could be found to illuminate congressional intent with respect to the relationship, if any, between \u00a7 1603 and the 1970 credit card amendment. Appellant proffers two statements by Senator Prox-mire, both uttered during hearings conducted more than one year following passage of the credit card legislation on a bill at best distantly related to the credit card provisions here in question, in which he suggests that further amendment of the Truth in Lending Act would be required to eliminate the applicability of \u00a7 1603 to the credit card provisions. <em>See </em>Hearings on S. 652 Before the Subeomm. on Banking, nousing and Urban Affairs, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess., at 78, 113 (1971). Suffice to say, as the Court did in United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 348-349, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1733, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963) quoting United <em>States </em>v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S.Ct 326, 4 L.Ed.2d 334 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-14\">[T]he views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-15\">. The alternative would be at the time the credit card is used. Appellant can hardly find solace in this choice however, for it would then appear even more clearly that \u00a7 1603 does not apply to \u00a7 1643(a) since the unauthorized use of a credit card does not result in an extension of credit to the <em>\u201ccardholder.\" </em>Thus, the exemptions contained in \u00a7 1603 would have no relevance to \u00a7 1643(a) \u2014unless, of course, one must look to the <em>unauthorized </em>user to determine whether credit has been extended for business or commercial purposes as distinguished from personal needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
