While near the driveway one officer noticed that the rear end of Thompson\u2019s car was abnormally low. He shined a flashlight into the car and, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>cause the back seat was ajar, saw liquor bottles in the trunk. Then he pried open the trunk and seized the liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The officer\u2019s search and seizure are amply justified under the plain view doctrine. He had a lawful right to be on the premises, and he saw the liquor simply by peering into the car. The liquor\u2019s presence in an automobile, coupled with the lack of advance knowledge that it would be there, created exigent circumstances that justified its seizure. <em>See </em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 1971, 403 U.S. 443, 468, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2039, 29 L.Ed.2d 564; Harris v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067; Trupiano v. United States, 1948, 334 U.S. 699, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 92 L.Ed. 1663; Walker v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 1018. The liquor\u2019s seizure was also authorized by the officer\u2019s search warrant, which described the stolen liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
