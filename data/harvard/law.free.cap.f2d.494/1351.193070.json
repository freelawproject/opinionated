T.C.A. \u00a7 28-304 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-4\">Actions . . . for injuries to the person . . . [and] civil actions for compensatory or punitive damages, or both, brought under the federal civil rights statutes, shall be commenced within one (1) year after cause of action accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">The District Court ruled that the action under the civil rights statutes (42 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985) was barred by the Tennessee statute of limitations, but that the action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 was not so barred. The theory of the Court was that the claim under Section 1343 was for constitutional violations, whereas the Tennessee statute of limitations refers only to civil rights statutes. These civil rights statutes, however, authorize suits for constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">But the Tennessee statute of limitations expressly applies \u201cfor injuries to person\u201d. In our opinion plaintiff has pleaded an injury to his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">We so held in Madison v. Wood, 410 F.2d 564 (6th Cir. 1969), where we construed the Michigan three-year statute of limitations which applied to \u201cactions to recover damages for injuries to person- or property . . . \u201d We held that this statute barred recovery under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">This is also the law of Tennessee, where the Supreme Court held that the phrase \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d was not limited to physical injuries to members of the body. Emerson v. Machamer, 221 Tenn. 739, 431 S.W.2d 283 (1968); Brown v. Dunstan, 219 Tenn. 291, 409 S.W.2d 365 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">In our opinion plaintiff could have asserted his cause of action on May 28, 1969. Hodge v. Service Machine Co., 438 F.2d 347 (6th Cir. 1971). Plaintiff did not file the present suit until June 16, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
