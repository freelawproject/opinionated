The plaintiffs complained that because of material misrepresentations and omissions, they were persuaded to enter into contracts <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the chinchilla corporations under which those firms sold chinchillas to the plaintiffs at prices many times in excess of .their true market value. The plaintiffs agreed to raise and breed these chinchillas in accordance with the corporations\u2019 directions. The chinchilla corporations agreed to repurchase the offspring for $100.00 per pair. The plaintiffs maintain, in part, that they were misinformed by the defendants that it was a simple task to raise chinchillas and that the venture would be highly profitable. They assert that in reality, chinchillas are difficult to raise and have a high mortality rate. More importantly, they contend that the market for chinchillas is such that the venture could return the promised profits only if the defendants repurchased the offspring at the $100.00 price and, in turn, resold them to other prospective chinchilla raisers at an inflated price. Thus, they assert, in essence, that the defendants were operating a pyramiding scheme under which profits could be made by the plaintiffs only if the defendants were successful in encouraging new victims to buy into the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">The plaintiffs claimed that these contracts for the sale of chinchillas were investment contracts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as such were sold in violation of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 10b-5 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-20\">In an amendment to the complaint filed in May of 1973, the plaintiffs added the Mills County State Bank as a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>fendant. The plaintiffs asserted that the Bank was acting in concert with the defendants to defraud them and that it aided and abetted in the violations of the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The Bank filed a motion to dismiss asserting that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the contract for the sale of chinchilla animals and a promise to purchase their offspring is not a security under the provisions of either the 1933 or 1934 acts. Other motions not here relevant were also filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The District Court treated the Bank\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. It held that the contracts in question were not investment contracts because they were \u201cclearly not passive investment interests.\u201d It concluded that summary judgment for the defendants was appropriate</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">* <em>* * </em>since the sole basis for the Court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over these securities law violations are 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77v, 78aa, both of which are premised upon the existence of securities and which are thus inapplicable since no security is herein involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The court reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts,in raising the chinchillas were so important to the success or failure of the venture that characterization of the contracts as investment contracts would be improper under the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of that term in Securities &amp; Exch. Com. v. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298-301, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). The court declined to consider the common law claims as they were premised on pendent jurisdiction and the court had found it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">We consider the fundamental question before us \u2014 whether the contracts were investment contracts and hence securities subject to the federal securities laws \u2014in the context of a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See, </em>10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2713, at 402-406 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The starting point in this determination is the Supreme Court\u2019s definition in <em>Howey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">* * * [A]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\"><em>Id., </em>328 U.S. at 298-299, 66 S.Ct. at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">The Ninth Circuit recently held that the word \u201csolely\u201d should not be read as a strict or literal limitation on the definition of an investment contract. Securities &amp; Exchange Com\u2019n v. Glenn W. Turner Ent., Inc., 474 F.2d 476 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 414 U.S. 821, 94 S.Ct. 117, 38 L.Ed.2d 53 (1973). It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">* * * [i]n light 0f the remedial nature of the legislation, the statutory policy of affording broad protection to the public, and the Supreme Court\u2019s admonitions that the definition of Securities should be a flexible one, the word \u201csolely\u201d should not be read as a strict or literal limitation on the definition of an investment contract, but rather must be construed realistically, so as to include within the definition those schemes which involve. in substance, if not form, securities. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-18\">* * * Thus the fact that the investors here were required to exert some efforts if a return were to be achieved should not automatically preclude a finding that the Plan or Adventure is an investment contract, -x- -x- -x- Rather we adopt a more realistic test, <em>whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which af-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>feet the failure or success of the enterprise. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We are convinced that the definition of investment contract in <em>Turner </em>is consistent with congressional intent and that it does not represent an impermissible departure from the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Howey.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The District Court recognized the teachings of Turner but was apparently convinced that the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts were so substantial that even under the <em>Turner </em>test the chinchilla contracts were not investment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> We have reviewed the record <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in the light of the principle that all doubts on jurisdictional points must be resolved in favor of a plenary trial rather than dismissal at the pretrial stage. <em>See, </em>Zunamon v. Brown, 418 F.2d 883, 886 (8th Cir. 1969). We are convinced from this review that it was inappropriate for the District Court to have concluded at the pretrial stage that the contracts were not investment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The record shows that the plaintiffs invested money in a common enterprise with the expectation that they would profit if the defendants secured additional investors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It also shows that the plaintiffs would not profit from the venture unless they exerted efforts in raising the chinchillas. But this fact does not preclude the conclusion that they had entered into investment contracts because the plaintiffs have alleged: (1) that the defendants persuaded them to invest by representing that the efforts required of them would be very minimal; and (2) that if they did diligently exert themselves, they still would not gain the promised profits because those profits could be achieved under the scheme only if the defendants secured additional investors at the inflated prices. If these allegations are true, and we must so assume here, the defendants by their own actions have admitted that the plaintiffs\u2019 contributions to the scheme were nominal, and what the plaintiffs really purchased was the defendants\u2019 skill at persuading others to become chinchilla raisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">In determining whether the plaintiffs\u2019 contributions were nominal or significant, the issue is not what efforts, in fact, were required of them. Rather, it is what efforts the plaintiffs were reasonably led to believe were required of them at the time they entered into the contracts. <em>See, </em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm. v. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 353, 64 S.Ct. 120, 124, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943), where the Court, in finding an investment contract subject to the Securities Act of 1933, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">In the enforcement of an act such as this it is not inappropriate that the promoters\u2019 offering be judged ' as being what they were represented to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-17\">Viewed in this context, it becomes apparent that the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts in raising the chinchillas are really of no more significance to the venture\u2019s ultimate success than were the efforts of the investors in <em>Turner. </em>There, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>investor to profit had to contribute three things: \u201chis money, his effort to find prospects and bring them to the meetings, and whatever it costs him to create an illusion of his own affluence.\u201d Securities &amp; Exchange Com\u2019n v. Glenn W. Turner Ent., Inc., <em>supra, </em>474 F.2d at 482. Here, the investors had to contribute two things: his money and his efforts in raising the chinchillas. The latter contribution is alleged to have been represented as being minimal. In both cases, the investor\u2019s profit was dependent upon the defendants\u2019 efforts to persuade additional persons to invest in the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The effort to persuade others to invest was held to be the \u201cundeniably significant\u201d one in <em>Turner, </em>and we are convinced on the record before us that it was the significant one here. If it develops at a later stage in the litigation that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are not supported by the evidence, the District Court can so find. But, we have no alternative now but to reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">.
