Newman petitions for review of an order of the National Transportation Safety Board holding he had violated 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.170(a) (the Regulation) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and suspending his commercial pilot certificate for 30 days. The Board found that Newman, in operating aircraft covered by the Regulation, had committed violations in two respects : First, he had flown aircraft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>whose altimeters had not been timely tested, and second, Newman had not first made sure, as he was required to, that permanent records had been kept of safety inspections of the altimeters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Newman argues to us that the proof at the administrative hearing that the altimeters had not been checked was insufficient. (Newman says they had been tested, with the results entered on \u201cyellow tags\u201d affixed to the altimeters themselves.) But the absence of logbook entries confirming the inspections made out a prima facie case of failure to inspect and shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence to petitioner. Against this, Newman maintains that Federal Aviation Administi\u2019ation inspectors were invited to examine the yellow tags and should have done so. In light of our holding, infra, that the tags were not permanent records, the shift of burden was proper. Nor was the burden satisfied. Despite fair opportunity to present testimony at the hearing, Newman failed to produce a single witness who was willing to swear that the inspections had in fact taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Newman also claims that the \u201cyellow tags\u201d met the \u201cpermanent record\u201d requirement. Even if this were correct, it would not be controlling for Newman does not contend that he examined the tags before operating the aircraft. More importantly, the claim that the tags were permanent records is unsound. The Regulation incorporates the requirements of Appendix E, 14 C.F.R. part 43, which provides that the results of inspections be entered both on the altimeter itself and also in the \u201cairplane log or other permanent record.\u201d See note 1 supra. Unless this phrase is mere surplusage, which we refuse to hold, the tags allegedly affixed to the altimeters did not constitute permanent records under the Regulation. This interpretation accords with the purpose of the record-keeping requirement which is, as the administrative law judge indicated, to enable airmen conveniently to determine whether safety inspections have been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">We have carefully considered petitioner\u2019s other arguments, and they are all without merit. The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1303-14\">. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.170(a) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-15\">No person may operate an airplane in controlled airspace under [instrument flight rules] unless, within the preceding 24 calendar months, each static pressure system and each altimeter instrument has been tested and inspected and found to comply with Appendix E of Part 43 of this chapter. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-16\">Appendix E provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-17\">Each person performing the altimeter system tests and inspections required by \u00a7 91.170 shall comply with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-30\">(c) Records: Comply with the provisions of \u00a7 43.9 of this chapter as to content, form, and disposition of the records.
