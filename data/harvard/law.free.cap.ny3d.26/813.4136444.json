The decision of the Appellate Division majority to affirm despite reversible error that occurred when the trial court permitted rebuttal testimony on a collateral matter was an act outside its authority under the Criminal Procedure Law, had no record basis, and was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. <em>(People v Concepcion, </em>17 NY3d 192; <em>People v LaFontaine, </em>92 NY2d 470; <em>People v Oden, </em>36 NY2d 382; <em>People v Pavao, </em>59 NY2d 282; <em>People v Harris, </em>57 NY2d 335; <em>People v McLaughlin, </em>291 NY 480; <em>People v Hanley, </em>5 NY3d 108; <em>People v Zabrocky, </em>26 NY2d 530; <em>People v Jenkins, </em>24 NY3d 62; <em>People v Kims, </em>24 NY3d 422.) II. The trial court abused its discretion as a matter of law or failed to exercise discretion by permitting a social worker to testify about Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome, after the jurors\u2019 answers during voir dire demonstrated that the topic was not outside their ken. <em>(People v Carroll, </em>95 NY2d 375; <em>People v Donk, </em>259 AD2d 1018, 93 NY2d 924; <em>People v DeLong, </em>206 AD2d 914; <em>People v Spicola, </em>16 NY3d 441; <em>People v Williams, </em>20 NY3d 579; <em>People v Diaz, </em>20 NY3d 569; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431.) III. The trial court erred by admitting prejudicial evidence of prior bad acts at trial without issuing a limiting instruction to the jury. <em>(People v Bassett, </em>55 AD3d 1434; <em>People v Stanard, </em>32 NY2d 143; <em>People v Scarola, </em>71 NY2d 769; <em>People v Molineux, </em>168 NY 264; <em>People v Alvino, </em>71 NY2d 233; <em>People v Resek, </em>3 NY3d 385; <em>People v Hudy, </em>73 NY2d 40; <em>People v Santarelli, </em>49 NY2d 241; <em>People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350; <em>People v Wlasiuk, </em>32 AD3d 674.)

On the merits, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting rebuttal testimony intended to provide evidence of defendant\u2019s sole witness\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate. We further reject his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>challenges to several other trial court evidentiary rulings, as well as his assertion that his trial counsel was ineffective. Therefore, the Appellate Division order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Defendant, Christopher Nicholson, challenges his conviction, after a jury trial, on one count of course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.75 [1]), arising from his sexual abuse of his daughter, D.N. The evidence at trial demonstrated that defendant and his first wife have two children, D.N. and a son, who is 18 months\u2019 D.N.\u2019s senior. After defendant and his wife separated in 1995, D.N.\u2019s mother had physical custody of the children and defendant had regular visitation at his home. D.N., who was 16 years old at the time of trial, testified that commencing in 1998 when she was six years old, and until she turned eight, her father repeatedly raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objection the court permitted D.N. to testify about defendant\u2019s violent nonsexual conduct towards her and her brother, ostensibly for purposes of explaining why D.N. delayed reporting the sexual abuse. The court also permitted D.N.\u2019s mother to testify about certain aspects of these incidents. According to this testimony, in 1998, D.N. was in kindergarten and defendant would often pick up the children from a school they attended near his residence. One day in April, defendant arrived at the children\u2019s school enraged over some confusion regarding who would pick them up that day. Defendant entered the principal\u2019s office where the children were waiting, grabbed the children by the neck and pulled them out of the school. During the drive back to his home defendant smacked D.N. across the face and punched her brother. D.N. testified that she felt afraid because she thought that defendant\u2019s rage \u201cwould become so bad that maybe one day he would kill us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Mother testified that after learning about this incident, she called the police and got a temporary no-contact order against defendant from Family Court. However, she eventually permitted the children to resume visitation with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">D.N. and her mother both testified to another violent incident involving defendant\u2019s son on October 1, 1998. D.N. stated that on that day defendant threw her brother and his clothes out of defendant\u2019s home, and left him waiting in the rain for mother to pick him up. Describing what precipitated the ejection from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>defendant\u2019s residence, D.N. testified that defendant beat and hit her brother before throwing him out because he stood up for his mother against defendant\u2019s verbal negative statements about her. Following this incident, D.N.\u2019s brother never again visited defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">However, D.N. continued to visit defendant and, at his request, on occasion stayed overnight. While she did not generally remember details of the several sexual assaults, she testified to two in particular, including the first, which occurred on Halloween of 1998 when she was in the first grade. On that day defendant forbade D.N. to go trick-or-treating with the family, and told her to stay home and help with a party he was planning. D.N. acquiesced because she was afraid of defendant. After D.N. finished helping with the party setup she went to her room upstairs and read until she fell asleep. After the party ended, D.N. woke up to defendant yelling for her. She went downstairs and found herself alone with defendant. He then started hitting her in the face and pulling her by her arms. D.N. testified that defendant was incoherent and very angry, and she felt \u201cvery fearful\u201d after he hit her because she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what was going to happen next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Defendant slammed D.N. onto the living room floor and proceeded to rape her. Afterwards, D.N. was in extreme pain and when defendant stopped she ran back to her room and hid under the bed, where she fell asleep until the following day when she went back to her mother\u2019s home. D.N. testified that at the time she did not tell her mother about the first rape because she was afraid defendant would hurt or sexually abuse her, or fulfill threats he made to kill her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">D.N. described another rape which she remembered because it occurred on New Year\u2019s Eve 1999. On that night, defendant left D.N. alone while he went to a bar with friends. When he returned he called for her, and she came downstairs. She was frightened by the look in his eyes, and believed he was going to hurt her so she tried to run away, but he caught up with her, grabbed her and tackled her as she entered the living room. Defendant then proceeded to rape her, and afterwards left her on the floor and went upstairs. D.N. did not call her mother because she \u201cwas told not to.\u201d She further testified that she did not tell anyone about the rape the next day \u201cbecause I figured it would keep continuing and there was nothing that I could do about it\u201d and because she wanted to make sure her mother would not get hurt. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>to why D.N. did not tell her mother about what was going on in general, D.N. answered that she stayed silent because she believed defendant when he \u201ccontinuously threatened me and said that he would kill my mother and make me watch.\u201d She further testified that she \u201cfelt like [she] could never overcome\u201d the fear he had instilled in her.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Defendant continued to rape D.N. throughout her first, second and third grade years, and up until a few weeks before her eighth birthday. At trial she testified that she told her mother at that time \u201cthat I didn\u2019t want anything to do with my father anymore because I was tired of him hitting me and being mean to me and I just wanted to be home with mommy and my brother.\u201d Although D.N. wanted no contact with defendant, he called constantly wanting to know why she no longer visited him.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">In 2008, when D.N. was in the 11th grade, she disclosed the sexual abuse to her school counselor. She testified that she waited to reveal the abuse even after she lived with her mother, and no longer saw defendant, because she was afraid he would come after her and her other family. D.N. explained that she eventually decided to come forward because she wanted to protect her younger sister from defendant doing the same to her, because she \u201cwanted people to know the truth ... so that he can\u2019t go and do it to someone else,\u201d and because she wanted someone to help her keep from killing herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Prior to this disclosure, D.N. was extremely depressed and suicidal. Unable to deal with the pain inside and the lies she told about how no one ever hurt her, she began to medicate and self mutilate by cutting herself with razors and knives. After she told the counselor, D.N. received psychiatric inpatient services.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The People also presented expert testimony from a social worker on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS). The expert testified that it is very common for child victims of sexual abuse to delay disclosure because they believe that they are to blame for the abuse, or that their silence protects other individuals from the consequences of the disclosure. He also testified that children who have been abused can have difficulty remembering specific details due to disassociation, where the child attempts to \u201cnot remember\u201d the traumatic event.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">After the People rested, defendant called as his sole witness his former girlfriend, Jill Marincic. She testified that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>romantically involved from 1995 until around 2003 or 2004, and that they lived together in a house her father helped them purchase in 1998. This was the house where D.N. stayed when she visited defendant. Marincic further testified that from 1998 to 2000 she never witnessed or heard any violence against D.N. during her stays at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">On cross-examination, Marincic claimed that since her breakup with defendant she had not been romantically involved with him. She admitted that she visited him in jail up to four times a month, that he called her from jail at least once a week, and that he discussed the trial with her. She further admitted that she has a friend relationship with defendant, cares about him, and did not want him to go to jail. In addition, she acknowledged that although she knew about the charges, she did not go to the police and tell them she was present in the house at the times the sexual abuse allegedly occurred. She also stated that she and defendant broke up because she cheated on him and that after their breakup he began a relationship with his future second wife, who at the time of trial he had recently divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The prosecutor then elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] And that\u2019s when you came back into the Defendant\u2019s life, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-8\">\u201c[Witness:] No. I had always been friends with him all along, even when he was married with her. We are still friends, but that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] And you are friends of the nature where you go and visit him in jail; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-10\">\u201c[Witness:] Yes, I\u2019ll visit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Afterwards, the prosecutor sought to call defendant\u2019s second ex-wife as a rebuttal witness. The court permitted the witness over defense counsel\u2019s objection based on the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-12\">\u201c[Court]: [Prosecutor], what is the expectation regarding the testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: The witness testified specifically she has been friends with the Defendant the entire time, including the time after she broke up with him, and he was with [rebuttal witness] up to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>present date. I am calling the [rebuttal] witness to rebut that statement that they were friends this entire time, because that\u2019s not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-5\">\u201c[Court]: That is the limited purpose, that they were or were not friends during that period; is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: So we are clear, she is not asking whether this witness and [defendant] were friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-8\">\u201c[Court]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: She is trying to rebut the assertion by Ms. Marincic that [defendant] and Ms. Marincic were friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-10\">\u201c[Court]: That\u2019s correct. If this witness has information regarding that limited testimony, it is proper rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Except it is not relevant. Again, it is a collateral matter. Whether or not they [were] friends after 2003 is collateral to the issues that we have at hand here. It becomes irrevelant and distracting at this point. If that\u2019s the sole purpose of calling a witness to say that in her opinion they weren\u2019t still friends, these other two people weren\u2019t still friends, how is that relevant to the testimony we just heard? That is the one and only purpose they are calling her for, and the Court is allowing it for what purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">\u201c[Court]: During what period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That would have to be from 2003 on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-14\">\u201c[Court]: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Which is almost three years after any allegations that are before this jury to consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-16\">\u201c[Court]: Does the testimony postdate the time period involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u201c[Prosecutor]: Yes, [Y]our Honor, but I was asking this witness about her present relationship with the Defendant, and she indicated that she has been friends with him since that time period to [the] present date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">\u201c[Court]: And the rebuttal witness will controvert; that is what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Yes, [Y]our Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-7\">\u201c[Court]: Supposedly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-9\">\u201c[Court]: Then it is proper rebuttal. This is brought out on the Defendant\u2019s case. It is proper rebuttal, again, limited to that narrow scope of testimony. Is that the sole purpose of the witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-10\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Yes, IY]our Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-11\">\u201c[Court]: All right. I understand your argument, [defense counsel], but I don\u2019t agree with it so long as that is the offer of proof regarding the proposed testimony. Have the jury enter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">The People\u2019s rebuttal witness testified that she was previously married to defendant, but they were now divorced, and she had met defendant after he broke up with Marincic. She further testified that Marincic and defendant spoke at the beginning of her own relationship with defendant but, to the best of her knowledge, such contact ceased when she expressed her displeasure to defendant. The rebuttal witness also attempted to testify that Marincic had sought to \u201cget back\u201d with defendant, but those questions were objected to and the answers stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on the sole count of course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree. The court originally sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 11 to 22 years\u2019 incarceration, but upon resentence reduced the term to a determinate 16 years followed by five years of post-release supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The Appellate Division affirmed in a 3-2 decision (118 AD3d 1423 [4th Dept 2014]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Court rejected defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court should have precluded evidence of prior bad acts, that testimony regarding CSAAS was irrevelant and unnecessary, and that his trial counsel was ineffective. A majority of the Court also concluded that the trial court properly granted the People\u2019s request to present evidence that the defense witness lied about her friendship with defendant because such proof was relevant to her bias or motive to fabricate. The dissenting Justices would have reversed and granted a new trial based on the trial court\u2019s error in allowing the People to call a witness to testify solely about collateral matters <em>(id. </em>at 1426-1427). A Justice of the Appellate Division granted defendant leave to appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Defendant raises the same claims of trial court error that he asserted unsuccessfully before the Appellate Division. For the reasons discussed below we hold these claims, to the extent preserved, to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">A. Appellate Division Authority under CPL 470.15</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Defendant contends that the Appellate Division exceeded its authority under CPL 470.15 (1), and violated the rule set forth in this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>LaFontaine </em>and <em>Concepcion, </em>because the Court based its decision that the People\u2019s rebuttal witness testimony was admissible on a ground different from that of the trial court. According to defendant, the trial court\u2019s sole basis for permitting the rebuttal testimony was for the limited purpose of establishing that Marincic lied when she testified that she was friends with defendant during the time he was married to his second wife, up until the time of trial. He complains that the Appellate Division affirmed on the wholly separate ground that the rebuttal testimony permitted an inference of Marincic\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate. The People respond that the rule in <em>LaFontaine </em>and <em>Concepcion </em>is not implicated here because the Appellate Division did not render its decision on an \u201centirely distinct alternative ground\u201d from the trial court. Rather, both courts rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that the rebuttal evidence was collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Under CPL 470.15 (1), \u201c[u]pon an appeal to an intermediate appellate court from a judgment, sentence or order of a criminal court, such intermediate appellate court may consider and determine any question of law or issue of fact involving error or defect in the criminal court proceedings which may have adversely affected the appellant.\u201d This provision is <em>\u201ca </em>legislative restriction on the Appellate Division\u2019s power to review issues either decided in an appellant\u2019s favor, or not ruled upon, by the trial court\u201d (LaFontaine, 92 NY2d at 474 [citations omitted]). Thus, CPL 470.15 (1) \u201cbars [the Appellate Division] from affirming a judgment, sentence or order on a ground not decided <em>adversely </em>to the appellant by the trial court\u201d <em>(Concep</em>cion, 17 NY3d at 195). Such a restriction applies in equal force to this Court which itself has \u201cno broader review powers\u201d <em>(id., </em>citing CPL 470.35 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Defendant relies on a flawed and overly narrow construction of the statutory limits of 470.15 (1) as applied to the Appellate Division\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. The record indicates the trial court determined that testimony in contravention of the defense witness\u2019s statement that she was defendant\u2019s friend was admissible as \u201cproper rebuttal.\u201d Defendant\u2019s challenge to that ruling required the Appellate Division to consider whether the People\u2019s articulated purpose \u2014 to establish the lack of a friendship relationship \u2014 was permissible given the defense witness\u2019s testimony. Defendant argues that the People sought only to demonstrate that the defense witness lied, which constituted a collateral matter. Defendant is, of course, correct that the People sought to present evidence that the defense witness was not telling the truth about her relationship with defendant. However, the Appellate Division\u2019s review of defendant\u2019s challenge required that it do more than recognize the obvious. The Appellate Division had to determine whether the purported lie had a particular meaning given the defense witness\u2019s testimony on direct and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Where a trial court does not identify the predicate for its ruling, the Appellate Division acts appropriately in considering the import of the trial judge\u2019s stated reasoning. Moreover, nothing in the language of CPL 470.15 (1), or this Court\u2019s construction of that provision as discussed in <em>LaFontaine </em>and <em>Concepcion, </em>prohibits an appellate court from considering the record and the proffer colloquy with counsel to understand the context of the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination, as it did in defendant\u2019s case. Unlike the case where the Appellate Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>renders a decision on grounds explicitly different from those of the trial court, or on grounds that were clearly resolved in a defendant\u2019s favor \u2014 the type of appellate overreaching prohibited by CPL 470.15 (1) <em>(see Concepcion, </em>17 NY3d at 195) \u2014 the Appellate Division here affirmed the evidentiary ruling on the ground relied on by the trial court, namely to establish the defense witness lied that she and defendant were merely friends, as well as the unspoken, record-supported inferences that can be drawn from that testimony. We therefore conclude that the Appellate Division acted within its statutory appellate review power.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Any other interpretation of CPL 470.15 (1) would require a trial judge to state every analytic step underlying a determination to admit or deny evidence, no matter how obvious the reasoning from the record. This approach demands a heretofore unexpected level of descriptive technical exactitude. It would require the judiciary to participate in a laborious exercise, without obvious commensurate benefit to the parties or our system of justice. We do not mean that a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings may go unexplained, that the Appellate Division may hypothesize the basis for a judge\u2019s determination where a record is wholly devoid of reason, or that an appellate court may comb through the entirety of a record solely to cobble together some theory for the trial court\u2019s conclusion. There must be sufficient articulation of a \u201creviewable predicate\u201d <em>(cf. Concepcion, </em>17 NY3d at 195, citing <em>LaFontaine, </em>92 NY2d at 472 [Appellate Division may consider \u201conly reviewable predicates\u201d for the lower court\u2019s decision]). Thus, where the trial court\u2019s decision is fully articulated the Appellate Division\u2019s review is limited to those grounds, but where the trial court gives a reason and there is record support for inferences to be drawn from that reason, the Appellate Division does not act beyond the parameters legislatively set forth in CPL 470.15 (1) when it considers those inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if the Appellate Division acted within the proper scope of its authority, there is no basis for the inference that the rebuttal testimony was intended to demonstrate Marincic\u2019s romantic involvement with defendant. On cross-examination, the prosecutor elicited testimony from Marincic that while defendant was in jail she visited him almost once a week, and initially spoke with him daily by telephone, although she claimed that over time the conversations became less frequent and occurred weekly. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>also admitted that she spoke with him about the case, and knew about the charges against him, and admitted that she cared for him. This testimony suggested that her interest in defendant was more than platonic and that they had a close and intimate relationship. Nevertheless, the prosecutor\u2019s pointed question about whether Marincic reentered defendant\u2019s life upon his divorce eventually led to her testimony that she was friends with defendant all along, even when he was married, and that they were friends at the time of trial \u201cbut that\u2019s it.\u201d The People\u2019s proffer in support of the rebuttal testimony that she was not a friend thus aligned with the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination that sought to demonstrate that defense witness and defendant were romantically involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Moreover, apart from the potential bias suggested by Marincic\u2019s admission that she was defendant\u2019s friend and that she cared for him, the People had much to gain by presenting evidence that permitted an inference of a romantic relationship between defendant and Marincic. In other words, by demonstrating that Marincic was intentionally mischaracterizing her relationship with defendant, the prosecutor could argue that she harbored a bias more significant than a friendship, and one that would lead to fabrication of testimony under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that this inference was appropriate and based on testimony that was \u201cproper rebuttal\u201d has record support. We therefore have no basis to disturb this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">B. Expert Testimony on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted testimony from the People\u2019s expert on CSAAS. Defendant\u2019s claim is quite limited. He does not challenge the admissibility of expert testimony on CSAAS as a general matter, that a determination on the admission and scope of such testimony is ultimately within the discretion of the trial court, or the expert qualifications of the People\u2019s witness. Instead, defendant\u2019s sole contention is that expert testimony on CSAAS was unnecessary and irrevelant once voir dire demonstrated that the prospective jurors in his case understood the reasons for a child sexual assault victim\u2019s delayed disclosure of the perpetrator\u2019s acts. The People argue that the expert testimony admitted in this case is wholly permissible under our case law and nothing in the voir dire indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Admission of expert testimony is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and \u201cdependent on whether the expert testimony \u2018would help to clarify an issue calling for professional or technical knowledge, possessed by the expert and beyond the ken of the typical juror\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Williams, </em>20 NY3d 579, 583-584 [2013], quoting <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296, 307 [1983]). We have previously held that expert testimony on CSAAS is admissible, like other psychological syndromes, because it helps to explain victim behavior that might be puzzling to the jury <em>(id. </em>at 583-584; <em>People v Spicola, </em>16 NY3d 441, 465 [2011]). The expert educates the jury on a scientifically-recognized \u201cpattern of secrecy, helplessness, entrapment [and] accommodation\u201d experienced by the child victim <em>(Spicola, </em>16 NY3d at 453 [internal quotation marks omitted]). This includes assisting the jury to understand \u201cwhy a child may wait a long time before reporting the alleged abuse\u201d <em>(Williams, </em>20 NY3d at 584, citing <em>Spicola, </em>16 NY3d at 466-467), fail to report at all, and deny or recant claims of sexual assault <em>(Spicola, </em>16 NY3d at 453-454). As we recognized in <em>Spicola, </em>the testimony is properly admitted for the legitimate purpose to counter an inference that the victim is not credible <em>(id. </em>at 465).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">As the record demonstrates, D.N. disclosed the sexual assaults 10 years after defendant first raped her in the living room of his home. Under our case law, CSAAS expert testimony was appropriate to assist the jury in assessing D.N.\u2019s credibility by \u201cexplaining victims\u2019 subsequent behavior that the factfinder might not understand, such as why victims may accommodate abusers and why they wait before disclosing the abuse\u201d <em>(Williams, </em>20 NY3d at 584). Nevertheless, defendant argues that the voir dire responses demonstrate that the jury did not require expert testimony on the reasons for delayed reporting because a child victim\u2019s behavior was apparently within the ken of the jurors in his case. We reject this claim on multiple grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">First, defendant has failed to demonstrate that the members of the empaneled jury actually held an appropriate understanding of this syndrome since not every prospective juror affirmatively responded to questions regarding behavior associated with CSAAS. Second, there is no consistent juror viewpoint discernable from voir dire. Those who responded to questioning said that they would not be shocked or surprised by a child\u2019s delay in disclosure, and provided a variety of reasons for why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>they felt this way. For example, in response to counsel\u2019s question, one prospective juror explained delayed disclosure as attributable to a very traumatic experience, another said the victim could have been frightened and embarrassed, and yet another asserted that people express feelings differently. Given the range of answers, the Judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that expert testimony describing a pattern of complex psychological behaviors would provide useful information upon which to judge D.N.\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Third, even if responses from certain prospective jurors appear to reflect a basic appreciation of some of the behaviors described by CSAAS, that does not translate into a high level of comprehension of \u201cthe dynamics of sexually and physically abusive relationships within a family\u201d at issue in this case and which are generally not as familiar to the lay juror <em>(People v Taylor, </em>75 NY2d 277, 288 [1990]). Here, the expert described the five categories of CSAAS and explained why a child victim might delay disclosure of her father\u2019s sexual abuse, as well as what might eventually motivate a victim to reveal the abuser\u2019s conduct. Furthermore, the expert testified about matters not explored during voir dire, such as \u201cdisassociation,\u201d whereby the victim disassociates the mind from the experience, which ultimately affects a child victim\u2019s recollection of events. Thus, the expert\u2019s testimony, grounded in his professional knowledge and training, provided relevant information outside the ken of the jurors and was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">C. Evidence of Prior Bad Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Defendant claims that the trial court erred by admitting, without a limiting instruction, evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, specifically violent actions observed or experienced by the victim, which the prosecutor argued would explain that she delayed reporting out of fear of defendant\u2019s potential violent reaction towards her, her mother, and her brother. Generally, \u201call relevant evidence is admissible unless its admission violates some exclusionary rule\u201d <em>(People v Scarola, </em>71 NY2d 769, 777 [1988]). Evidence is considered relevant \u201cif it has any tendency in reason to prove the existence of any material fact\u201d <em>(id.). </em>However, even relevant evidence is not admissible if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the potential for prejudice\u201d <em>(People v Harris, </em>26 NY3d 1, 5 [2015], quoting <em>People v Mateo, </em>2 NY3d 383, 424-425 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">The record demonstrates that the testimony was relevant to explain the victim\u2019s delayed disclosure, and was limited to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>personal observations and experiences. Given the trial court\u2019s careful balancing of the probative value of the testimony against its potential for prejudice, we hold that there was no abuse of discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Defendant\u2019s additional claim that the court\u2019s failure to provide a limiting instruction to the jury constitutes reversible error is unpreserved because defendant failed to make a specific request for such instruction <em>(People v Becoats, </em>17 NY3d 643, 650 [2011] [\u201cthis Court does not consider claims of error not preserved by appropriate objection in the court of first instance\u201d]). Defendant claims, however, that under <em>People v Payne </em>(3 NY3d 266, 273 [2004]), the issue is properly before us because the trial court had an opportunity to review the issue and understood the need for a curative instruction. Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Payne </em>is misplaced because in that case the Court held that where the trial court reserves decision on a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the preservation rules do not bar review of defendant\u2019s claim. Here, the court did not admit the testimony contingent on its instruction to the jury. Nor did the court otherwise state at any point that it <em>would </em>give a limiting instruction. Instead, the Judge ruled that he was allowing D.N.\u2019s testimony on the prior bad acts to explain her delayed disclosure, and \u201cif necessary\u201d he could provide an appropriate limiting instruction. Since counsel never asked for such instruction, there was no request for the trial court to reserve judgment on, no claim of trial error for the court to review, and no opportunity for the court to grant the relief sought. Defendant\u2019s failure renders his present claims unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Defendant asserts numerous complaints about his defense counsel\u2019s representation in support of his claim that he was denied a fair trial, under both the Federal and State Constitutions, due to his lawyer\u2019s mistakes. The People assert that no errors establish the level of ineffectiveness warranting reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Under the federal standard ineffective assistance of counsel requires both that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and that the \u201cdeficient performance prejudiced the [defendant]\u201d <em>(Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 687 [1984]). However, under our State Constitution \u201c[t]he core of the inquiry is whether defendant received meaningful representation\u201d <em>(People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998] [internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>marks omitted]). In making that assessment, the Court must view counsel\u2019s performance in its totality <em>(see People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]). Defendant, of course, bears the burden of establishing his claim that counsel\u2019s performance is constitutionally deficient <em>(People v Barboni, </em>21 NY3d 393, 406 [2013]). Thus, defendant must demonstrate the absence of strategic or other legitimate explanations for counsel\u2019s alleged failure <em>(People v Satterfield, </em>66 NY2d 796, 799-800 [1985]). However, a reviewing court must be careful not to \u201csecond-guess\u201d counsel, or assess counsel\u2019s performance \u201cwith the clarity of hindsight,\u201d effectively substituting its own judgment of the best approach to a given case <em>(Benevento, </em>91 NY2d at 712). The test is \u201creasonable competence, not perfect representation\u201d <em>(People v Modica, </em>64 NY2d 828, 829 [1985] [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Turning to defendant\u2019s specific complaints, defendant alleges that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence of defendant\u2019s prior bad acts elicited from the victim\u2019s mother, in violation of the court\u2019s ruling permitting such testimony solely from the victim. Defendant complains that the mother testified about the school incident in April and defendant\u2019s ouster of their son from his residence in October. Although the mother\u2019s testimony on these matters arguably exceeded the court\u2019s ruling, this does not warrant a finding of ineffectiveness given that the jury heard from D.N. about these two incidents, and the mother\u2019s testimony about events on these dates did not relate to the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Moreover, during defense counsel\u2019s summation, he sought to use the mother\u2019s testimony to defendant\u2019s advantage to support his argument that D.N. lied. Specifically, counsel reminded the jury that the victim immediately complained to her mother about the April incident, that her mother went to the police about defendant, and that as a consequence D.N. did not have to see defendant for quite some time. He argued that because D.N. had no difficulty complaining in April and had observed her mother\u2019s handling of defendant\u2019s conduct at that time, it was not believable that D.N. would feel incapable or fearful of reporting the physical and sexual abuse until years after the fact. Defendant\u2019s related complaint that counsel should have requested limiting instructions similarly fails because he has not demonstrated that counsel lacked a strategic use for the testimony. Thus, these two grounds are insufficient bases to conclude defendant was deprived of meaningful representation <em>(Benevento, </em>91 NY2d at 712).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Defendant next complains that counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s summation comments which he contends amounted to vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility and prosecutorial misconduct. We reject this claim because although the comments were arguably inappropriate, they were not sufficiently egregious to warrant reversal for ineffectiveness <em>(see People v Wragg, </em>26 NY3d 403, 411-412 [2015] [summarizing cases where the prosecutor committed reversible error during summation by \u201cmaking misleading representations about physical evidence, encouraging inferences of guilt based on facts not in evidence, and improperly conveying guilt in uncharged crimes\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Defendant also claims that counsel failed to investigate or call an expert to rebut the People\u2019s expert witness. According to defendant, counsel should have called a witness to \u201cdebunk\u201d the People\u2019s expert\u2019s theory. However, because this Court has held that CSAAS is recognized within the scientific community and the expert here testified generally about CSAAS, and not about its application to D.N. or her specific allegations of sexual abuse, there is no apparent failure in defense counsel\u2019s choice not to call his own expert. To the extent defendant argues CSAAS lacks scientific validity and that counsel should have presented evidence to that effect through a rebuttal expert, or during cross-examination of the People\u2019s expert, defendant\u2019s challenges to counsel\u2019s preparedness depend on matters dehors the record and are not reviewable on direct appeal <em>(People v Cass, </em>18 NY3d 553, 556 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Defendant\u2019s remaining claims are similarly unreviewable on the record before us. His assertion that counsel failed to properly investigate the case, including failing to subpoena medical records \u2014 which the People claim do not exist \u2014 relies on extraneous facts. Furthermore, defendant\u2019s final contention that counsel failed to impeach the victim about the inconsistencies between her trial and her grand jury testimonies is not without some significance, but requires consideration of matters outside the record to determine whether this was trial strategy. For example, counsel could have determined that the jury would treat D.N.\u2019s inconsistencies as an example of understandable memory lapses given the years between the abuse and her testimony, or as an example of the effects of the abuse on her memory and recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In summary, whether considered independently or in combination, none of these complaints about defense counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>representation support a conclusion that he was ineffective based on the totality of the representation under the State Constitution <em>(Baldi, </em>54 NY2d at 147). As a consequence, he also fails to meet the higher threshold for ineffectiveness under the federal standard <em>(People v Caban, 5 </em>NY3d 143, 156 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"AyM\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AMA\">Judges Pigott, Abdus-Salaam, Stein and Fahey concur; Chief Judge DiFiore and Judge Garcia taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-9\"> The Appellate Division, in defendant\u2019s separate appeals, affirmed his original conviction and affirmed as modified the resentence.
