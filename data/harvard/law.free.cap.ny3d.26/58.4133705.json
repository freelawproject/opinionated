We conclude that the particular language of the letter at issue threatened imminent adverse legal consequences and was, therefore, sufficiently coercive as to \u201crequire\u201d action under the meaning of the indemnification clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Decedent James R. Pyne was the founder and sole stockholder of Remet Corporation, a company that manufactures products for use in the investment casting industry. In a purchase and sale agreement entered into in March 1999, Pyne sold to Burmah Castrol Holding, Inc. all of Remet\u2019s stock and facilities, along with real property that he had been leasing to Remet. Because one of the parcels of real property abutted the Erie Canal site in Utica, which had been listed as an inactive hazardous waste site, the sales agreement contained an indemnification provision. In relevant part, that provision obligated Pyne to \u201cindemnify, defend and hold [the] [b]uyer . . . harmless\u201d for \u201cEnvironmental Losses\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cthat arise out of or relate to . . . any environmental remedial, investigatory or monitoring action taken or any other Losses under or relating to any Environmental Law with respect to any of the Company\u2019s Real Properties or the Company\u2019s assets or operations (past or present), as a result of conditions which exist (or previously existed) on or prior to the Closing Date, provided that Losses under this Section . . . shall only be indemnified by Seller if such Losses arise out of or result from actions by any Indemnified Party that such Indemnified Party <em>is required </em>to take <em>under or in connection with </em>any Environmental Law . . . (and such Loss shall not arise out of or result from communications by such Indemnified Party with any Governmental Entity (except to the extent <em>required </em>under any Environmental Law . . . ))\u201d (additional emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>By its terms, the indemnification obligation was to remain in effect for 10 years and \u201cclaims for indemnification asserted prior to the end of such period [ ] . . . [would] survive until final resolution thereof.\u201d Pyne also entered into an environmental escrow agreement pursuant to which he deposited $2.7 million into an escrow account to fund payments arising from his indemnification obligation for environmental losses under the sales agreement. Remet\u2019s current management team ultimately acquired all of Remet\u2019s stock and the indemnification rights under the sales agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In October 2002, Remet received a letter from DEC that is at the heart of this dispute. Labeled \u201cNOTICE LETTER\u201d \u201cURGENT LEGAL MATTER \u2014 PROMPT REPLY NECESSARY,\u201d the letter informed Remet that DEC had documented a release of \u201chazardous substances\u201d <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 9601 [14]; 9602) and the presence of \u201chazardous wastes\u201d <em>(see </em>ECL 27-1301) at the Erie Canal site adjacent to Remet\u2019s real property. The letter further stated that \u201c[responsible parties are liable for monies expended by the State in taking response actions\u201d and that DEC had determined that Remet was \u201ca potentially responsible party [PRP] for the site\u2019s contamination.\u201d In the letter, DEC requested that Remet implement and finance a remedial program for the site, to be memorialized in a consent order. DEC advised that, \u201cif a signed Consent Order [was] not received within 30 days ... , all further discussions [would] terminate,\u201d and DEC would perform the necessary work itself and then seek recovery from Remet, as a PRP. In that event, the PRP letter \u201cserve [d] as a demand for payment of all monies [DEC] may expend,\u201d with interest accruing from the date of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Remet did not sign a consent order within the required time period, but began investigating DEC\u2019s claims and gave notice to Pyne that it was asserting an indemnification claim under the sales agreement. Although Pyne did not assume defense of the claim, his attorneys contacted DEC and cooperated with Remet in undertaking investigative efforts with respect to the Erie Canal site. Pyne died in March 2003. Because none of the PRPs identified by DEC agreed to undertake remediation of the site, DEC determined that it would address the site\u2019s contamination with State funds and seek recovery from the PRPs, ultimately adopting a $12.5 million decontamination plan. Remet filed notices of claim against Pyne\u2019s estate seeking indemnification for environmental liabilities under the sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>agreement, including approximately $550,000 in costs already incurred by Remet. After the Estate objected to a release of funds from the escrow account and insisted that Remet refrain from dealing with DEC directly regarding Remet\u2019s potential liability for remediation of the site, Remet commenced this action, asserting claims for contractual and common-law indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Following joinder of issue, Remet moved for summary judgment, seeking indemnification in the amount of $550,388.60, and a declaration that it was entitled to reimbursement for all future costs that could arise as a result of its investigation into and remediation of the site. Supreme Court, among other things, granted Remet summary judgment on liability and declared that Remet was entitled to indemnification for past and future environmental losses arising out of DEC\u2019S investigation and remediation of the Erie Canal site. On defendant\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed, denied Remet\u2019s motion and granted summary judgment to defendants, declaring that Remet \u201cis not entitled to indemnification from defendants\u201d (112 AD3d 1313, 1315 [4th Dept 2013]). The Court concluded that, because \u201cDEC\u2019s letter merely informed . . . [Remet] of [its] potential liability and sought voluntary action on [its] part, . . . [the letter] did not require [Remet] to take action\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1314 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). We granted Remet\u2019s motion for leave to appeal (23 NY3d 907 [2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The plain language of the governing contractual indemnity provision, together with the language of the PRP letter and the surrounding facts and circumstances, demonstrate that Remet was entitled to indemnification because it was \u201crequired,\u201d within the meaning of the sales agreement, to act in response to the PRP letter <em>(see generally Drzewinski v Atlantic Scaffold &amp; Ladder Co., </em>70 NY2d 774, 777 [1987]). The PRP letter stated that it pertained to an \u201cUrgent Legal Matter,\u201d indicated that a prompt reply was \u201cnecessary,\u201d and set forth the consequences that would flow from Remet\u2019s refusal to act. Regardless of whether Remet was designated a <em>potentially </em>responsible party or a responsible party, the letter demanded either a consent order or payment, and any language indicating that Remet\u2019s response was voluntary must be read in terms of those demands. In other words, the PRP letter \u2014 by its terms\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>effectively marked the beginning of a \u201clegal\u201d process against Remet pursuant to the ECL, in which DEC expressly sought recovery from Remet for any amounts expended in remediating the Erie Canal site.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Additionally, the circumstances surrounding the execution of the indemnification clause include the parties\u2019 awareness that, because the Erie Canal site was listed as an inactive hazardous waste site, the purchaser of the property at issue here risked incurring substantial expenses, and that Pyne accordingly deposited a large sum in escrow to cover at least a portion of those potential expenses. Pyne\u2019s attorneys began cooperating with DEC shortly after the PRP letter was received, and only ceased to do so when their negotiations proved unsuccessful \u2014 indicating that Pyne, the actual signatory to the sales agreement, viewed the PRP letter as requiring action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In short, the PRP letter issued to Remet was sufficiently coercive and adversarial as to \u201crequire\u201d action \u201cunder or in connection with any Environmental Law\u201d pursuant to the sales agreement, given that it threatened litigation and imminent adverse legal and financial consequences pursuant to the ECL <em>(see Borg-Warner Corp. v Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>174 AD2d 24, 35 [3d Dept 1992], <em>lv denied </em>80 NY2d 753 [1992]; see <em>also Carpentier v Hanover Ins. Co., </em>248 AD2d 579, 580 [2d Dept 1998]). Moreover, inasmuch as Remet asserted its claims within 10 years of the closing date of the sales agreement, those claims \u201cshall survive until final resolution thereof.\u201d Accordingly, based on the particular language of the PRP letter and the indemnification clause at issue here, Remet is entitled to contractual indemnification for past and future environmental losses incurred as a result of DEC\u2019S investigation and remediation of the Erie Canal site, and Supreme Court properly granted sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>mary judgment to plaintiff on liability. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Pigott, Rivera, AbdusSalaam and Fahey concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Order reversed, with costs, and judgment of Supreme Court, Oneida County, reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> Other states\u2019 courts have concluded that, given the adverse consequences \u2014 such as large fines, use of the PRP\u2019s noncompliance against it in future litigation to apportion costs, and the potential that the administrative agency may remediate a site at a higher cost and then demand full reimbursement from the PRP \u2014 that can flow from a failure to respond to a PRP letter, \u201c \u2018[fit would be naive to characterize [a PRP] letter as a request for voluntary action. [There is] no practical choice other than to respond actively to the [PRP] letter\u2019 \u201d <em>(R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. v Continental Cas.
