The Appellate Division\u2019s decision does not render section 72 of the Domestic Relations Law unconstitutional, nor does it diminish section 72 (2) to \u201cmere guidance\u201d; rather, it properly interpreted an \u201cextended disruption of custody\u201d in accordance with <em>Bennett v Jeffreys.

II. The Appellate Division did not abuse its discretion as a matter of law in holding that appellants had not proved the existence of extraordinary circumstances as there had not been a prolonged separation of parent and child, relinquishment of care and control, or gross misconduct evidencing utter indifference or irresponsibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>(Matter of Louise E.S. v W.

While psychological trauma grave enough to threaten the child\u2019s destruction may be considered an extraordinary circumstance, the Appellate Division did not hold that such is required to prove extraordinary circumstances. <em>(Matter of Jenny L.S. v Nicole M., </em>39 AD3d 1215; <em>Matter of Michael G.B. v Angela L.B., </em>219 AD2d 289; <em>Matter of Jody H. v Lynn M., </em>43 AD3d 1318; <em>Matter of Vincent A.B. v Karen T., </em>30 AD3d 1100, 7 NY3d 711; <em>Matter of Cote v Brown, </em>299 AD2d 876; <em>Matter of Tucker v Martin, </em>75 AD3d 1087; <em>Matter of Burghdurf v Rogers, </em>233 AD2d 713; <em>Matter of Bailey v Carr, </em>125 AD3d 853; <em>Matter of Black v Johnson, </em>251 AD2d 825; <em>Matter of Lynda A.H. v Diane T.O., </em>243 AD2d 24, 92 NY2d 811.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b546-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b546-6\">Stein, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">This custody dispute between a child\u2019s mother and paternal grandparents concerns the interpretation and application of Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2) and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>(40 NY2d 543 [1976]). We hold that grandparents may demonstrate standing to seek custody based on extraordinary circumstances where the child has lived with the grandparents for a prolonged period of time, even if the child had contact with, and spent time with, a parent while the child lived with the grandparents. Hence, we reverse and remit to the Appellate Division for consideration of issues raised, but not reached, by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>L</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The child at issue here (born 2002) lived with his paternal grandparents, beginning when he was less than 10 days old and continuing until he was almost 10 years old. The child\u2019s father moved out of state in 2004 and has had visitation since then. The child\u2019s mother lived approximately 12 miles from the grandparents for the child\u2019s first few years, until the grandparents moved the mother (and her daughters from a previous relationship) into a trailer that the grandparents purchased and situated in a trailer park across the street from their residence, so she would be close to the child. In a 2006 proceeding in which the grandparents were not involved, the child\u2019s parents obtained a consent order awarding the parents joint legal custody, with primary physical custody to the mother. Nevertheless, the reality of the family\u2019s situation did not change; the child continued to reside with the grandparents. Also in 2006, the grandparents moved to an adjoining county. Due to the distance between their homes, the mother had less contact with the child until late 2008, when the grandparents again helped her move closer to them. The grandparents evidently kept the mother informed of the child\u2019s activities almost daily. In addition, the mother saw the child regularly including, at times, weekly overnight visits and vacations. In 2010, the mother began a relationship with a new boyfriend, and they gradually began making plans to live together. In 2012, after the father sought custody from the mother and a termination of his child support payments to her,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she refused to return the child to the grandparents after a visit, relying on the 2006 custody order granting her primary physical custody. At that time, the mother told the grandparents that they had had the child for many years, it was her \u201cturn now,\u201d and they could no longer see him.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">As a result, the grandparents commenced this proceeding seeking primary physical custody of the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a 10-day hearing, Family Court found that the mother was generally not credible and that \u201cthe grandparents\u2019 version of where the child lived since birth is the substantiated and more accurate representation of reality\u201d (50 Misc 3d 990, 999 [2013]). The court found that there had been an extended disruption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>custody between the mother and the child, and that the mother voluntarily relinquished care and control of him to the grandparents \u2014 through three written documents and through her behavior \u2014 and concluded that this amounted to extraordinary circumstances. The court then considered the child\u2019s best interest and granted joint custody to the grandparents and the father, with primary physical custody to the grandparents and visitation to each parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the grandparents\u2019 petition (128 AD3d 20 [4th Dept 2015]). Specifically declining to disturb Family Court\u2019s credibility determinations, the Appellate Division found the situation to be akin to joint custody, with the grandparents having primary physical custody and the mother having visitation. Nevertheless, the Court held that the grandparents failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances, in light of the mother\u2019s presence in the child\u2019s life, even though he was primarily living with the grandparents. Thus, the Court concluded that the grandparents lacked standing to seek custody and dismissed their petition. This Court granted the grandparents leave and a stay pending appeal (25 NY3d 1063 [2015]).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In the seminal case of <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>we created a two-prong inquiry for determining whether a nonparent may obtain custody as against a parent <em>(see </em>40 NY2d at 546-548). First, the nonparent must prove the existence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d such as \u201csurrender, abandonment, persisting neglect, unfitness, and unfortunate or involuntary disruption of custody over an extended period of time\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 546), \u201cor other like extraordinary circumstances\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 544). If extraordinary circumstances are established such that the non-parent has standing to seek custody, the court must make an award of custody based on the best interest of the child <em>(see id. </em>at 548).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Consistent with that case, Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2) contains a specific example of extraordinary circumstances. Originally, Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 addressed only grandparent visitation. However, in recognition of the important role of grandparents and the increasing number of grandparents raising their grandchildren, the legislature amended the statute in 2003 to include a second subdivision, pertaining to custody <em>(see </em>L 2003, ch 657, \u00a7 2; <em>Matter of Carton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>v Grimm, </em>51 AD3d 1111, 1112 n [3d Dept 2008], <em>lv denied </em>10 NY3d 716 [2008]). That subdivision provides that \u201c[w]here a grandparent . . . of a minor child . . . can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court the existence of extraordinary circumstances, such grandparent . . . may apply to family court [for custody],\u201d and the court \u201cmay make such directions as the best interests of the child may require, for custody rights for such grandparent ... in respect to such child. <em>An extended disruption of custody, as such term is defined in this section, shall constitute an extraordinary circumstance\u201d </em>(Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 [2] [a] [emphasis added]). The statute then defines \u201cextended disruption of custody\u201d to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201cinclude, but not be limited to, a prolonged separation of the respondent parent and the child for at least [24] continuous months during which the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child and the child resided in the household of the petitioner grandparent or grandparents, provided, however, that the court may find that extraordinary circumstances exist should the prolonged separation have lasted for less than [24] months\u201d (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 [2] [b]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The legislative intent, as stated in the bill enacting this amendment, was \u201cto provide guidance regarding the ability of grandparents to obtain standing in custody proceedings involving their grandchildren,\u201d but was \u201cin no way intended to limit the state of the law as it relates to the ability of any third party to obtain standing in custody proceedings\u201d against a birth parent (L 2003, ch 657, \u00a7 1). The sponsors\u2019 memoranda articulate the purpose of the bill as being \u201c[t]o define an extraordinary circumstance with respect to the legal rights of certain grandparents who wish to petition the court for custody of their grandchildren\u201d (Senate Introducer Mem in Support, 2003 NY Senate Bill S4224A; Assembly Sponsor\u2019s Mem, 2003 NY Assembly Bill A8302B; <em>see Matter of Carton, </em>51 AD3d at 1113). The sponsors emphasized that the bill specifically states that it is not intended to overrule existing case law relating to third parties obtaining standing in custody cases <em>(see </em>Senate Introducer Mem in Support, 2003 NY Senate Bill S4224A; Assembly Sponsor\u2019s Mem, 2003 NY Assembly Bill A8302B). In addressing the law as it existed before the amendment, the sponsors stated that the \u201c[c]urrent statute does not specifically grant grandparents standing to petition the court for custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of their grandchildren [,] nor does [it] give specific guidance to the court in regard to extraordinary circumstances as they might apply to children who have resided with their grandparents\u201d (Senate Introducer Mem in Support, 2003 NY Senate Bill S4224A; Assembly Sponsor\u2019s Mem, 2003 NY Assembly Bill A8302B).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Although the mother contends otherwise, the statute is entirely consistent with <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>in that it requires that grandparents prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances in order to demonstrate standing when seeking custody against a child\u2019s parent. Indeed, the budget report on the bill indicates that it \u201csimply clarifies in statute that grandparents specifically can petition for custody\u201d (Budget Rep on Bills, Bill Jacket, L 2003, ch 657 at 5). Thus, the purpose of the statute is plain \u2014 it creates a clear path, or procedural mechanism, for grandparents to obtain standing when seeking custody <em>(see Matter of E.S. v P.D., </em>8 NY3d 150, 157 [2007]; <em>Matter of Wilson v McGlinchey, </em>2 NY3d 375, 380 [2004]; <em>see also Debra H. v Janice R., </em>14 NY3d 576, 597 [2010]). The statute does not create new rights for grandparents, but merely clarifies a method by which grandparents may exercise those rights, and defines an alternative type of extraordinary circumstance applicable only to grandparents \u2014 specifically, an extended disruption of custody \u2014 in view of their special status <em>(see Matter of Tolbert v Scott, </em>15 AD3d 493, 495-496 [2d Dept 2005] ).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2) sets forth three \u201celements\u201d required to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstance of an \u201cextended disruption of custody,\u201d specifically: (1) a 24-month separation of the parent and child, which is identified as \u201cprolonged,\u201d (2) the parent\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of care and control of the child during such period, and (3) the residence of the child in the grandparents\u2019 household. Regarding the third element, inasmuch as both Family Court and the Appellate Division found that the child primarily lived with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the grandparents for almost 10 years, and that factual finding is supported by the record, we may not disturb it <em>(see Matter of E.S., </em>8 NY3d at 158; <em>Matter of Gabrielle HH., </em>1 NY3d 549, 550 [2003]). Consequently, only the first two elements are seriously in dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The mother argues that the separation of the parent and child must be nearly complete and that the parent must relinquish <em>all </em>care and control, with little or no contact between the parent and child, in order for the first two elements to be established. She contends that no prolonged separation occurred here because she had regular contact with the child. She also contends that she did not relinquish care and control because she cared for the child on regular visits, including overnights and vacations, and because the grandparents obtained, and acted with, her permission when making decisions about him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Contrary to the mother\u2019s contention, a lack of contact is not a separate element under the statute. Indeed, there is no explicit statutory reference to contact or the lack thereof. Rather, the quality and quantity of contact between the parent and child are simply factors to be considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances when determining whether the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child, and whether the child actually resided with the grandparents for the required \u201cprolonged\u201d period of time. Indeed, some Appellate Division cases have identified a variety of factors for courts to consider in determining whether extraordinary circumstances exist, such as \u201cthe length of time the child has lived with the nonparent, the quality of that relationship and the length of time the biological parent allowed such custody to continue without trying to assume the primary parental role\u201d <em>(Matter of Bevins v Witherbee, </em>20 AD3d 718, 719 [3d Dept 2005]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>see Matter of Curless v McLarney, </em>125 AD3d 1193, 1195 [3d Dept 2015]; <em>Matter of Aida B. v Alfredo C., </em>114 AD3d 1046, 1048 [3d Dept 2014]; <em>Matter of Marcus CC. v Erica BB., </em>107 AD3d 1243, 1244 [3d Dept 2013], <em>appeal dismissed </em>22 NY3d 911 [2013]; <em>Matter of Michael G.B. v Angela L.B., </em>219 AD2d 289, 294 [4th Dept 1996]). All of these factors are components of the totality of the circumstances for the court to consider, and also relate to the enumerated elements under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">It would be illogical to construe the statute to mean that, in order to establish an extended disruption of custody, the grandparent must demonstrate that the parent had no contact with the child for 24 months. If that were the case, the statute would be superfluous or redundant of the extraordinary circumstances specifically enumerated in <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys. </em>Indeed, the level of contact between the parent and child is relevant to several different categories of extraordinary circumstances under that case. For example, <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>refers to abandonment as an extraordinary circumstance <em>(see </em>40 NY2d at 546). Pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (5), abandonment occurs \u2014 in the context of a complete termination of parental rights \u2014 when a parent evinces an intent to forgo parental rights and obligations as manifested by a failure to visit the child and communicate with the child or guardian. This Court has held that, for purposes of determining whether extraordinary circumstances exist to demonstrate standing to seek custody of a child, the definition of abandonment does not differ from the traditional definition <em>(see Matter of Dickson v Lascaris, </em>53 NY2d 204, 209 [1981]). Similarly, <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>refers to persistent neglect as a variety of extraordinary circumstances <em>(see </em>40 NY2d at 546). Persistent neglect requires proof that the parent \u201cfailed either to maintain <em>substantial, </em>repeated and continuous <em>contact </em>with a child or to plan for the child\u2019s future\u201d <em>(Matter of Ferguson v Skelly, </em>80 AD3d 903, 905 [3d Dept 2011] [emphasis added], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 710 [2011]; <em>see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [7]). Thus, where a parent has no significant contact with his or her child for 24 months, the avenues of persistent neglect or abandonment presumably would be available under <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>even without the benefit of Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In view of the foregoing, if we interpret the definition of \u201cextended disruption of custody\u201d under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2) to mean that the parent must not have had any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>contact, or at least any significant contact, with the child for at least 24 months, then this statutory ground of extraordinary circumstances would essentially be eviscerated, or at best redundant and unnecessary. This would contravene the legislative purpose, and would be contrary to the well-established rule that courts should not interpret a statute in a manner that would render it meaningless <em>(see Matter of Brown v Wing, </em>93 NY2d 517, 523 [1999]; <em>Matter of Industrial Commr. of State of N.Y. v Five Corners Tavern, </em>47 NY2d 639, 646-647 [1979]). Consequently, to give meaning to the separate statutory avenue of establishing standing, Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2) must be available for a grandparent even if the parent has had some contact with the child during the requisite 24-month period. To hold otherwise would not only conflict with the legislature\u2019s intent, but would also deter grandparents from promoting a relationship between the parent and the child while the child resides with them, contrary to this state\u2019s public policy of encouraging and strengthening parent-child relationships.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While courts must determine on a case-by-case basis whether the level of contact between the parent and child precludes a finding of extraordinary circumstances, it is sufficient to show that the parent has permitted \u2014 as reflected in the statutory designation of the particular extraordinary circumstance at issue \u2014 an \u201cextended disruption of custody\u201d (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 [2] [a] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">For essentially the same reasons, a parent need not relinquish <em>all </em>care and control of the child. Even if the parent exercises some control over the child \u2014 for example during visitation \u2014 a parent may still, as a general matter, have voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child to the grandparent to the extent that the grandparent is, in essence, acting as a parent with primary physical custody. The key is whether the parent makes important decisions affecting the child\u2019s life, as opposed to merely providing routine care on visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Here, the mother argues that the grandparents were only acting with her permission when making decisions regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the child. She concedes that she signed three documents, each giving the grandparents permission to make such decisions, including medical and educational decisions, without any time limitation, but contends that the documents prove that she retained ultimate control over all decisions. Family Court concluded that the documents, and the mother\u2019s conduct, showed that she relinquished her authority and responsibility to make the decisions. The Appellate Division, on the other hand, concluded that the grandparents relied on the mother\u2019s permission (128 AD3d at 25). In our view, Family Court\u2019s interpretation of the documents, and their implications here, is more accurate. The grandparents obtained the documents because there was no custody order giving the grandparents the legal right to make such decisions, although the child was in their physical custody a majority of the time, and they needed to be prepared for all types of situations. Nevertheless, the mother freely signed over virtually all decision-making rights indefinitely \u2014 she did not limit the permission to times when she was unavailable \u2014 demonstrating her intent that the grandparents \u201cpermanently assume the parental responsibility\u201d of caring for the child <em>(Matter of Michael G.B., </em>219 AD2d at 294).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As for the parties\u2019 conduct, the grandparents spoke with the mother almost daily about the child. The mother claims that they did so to seek her permission before making decisions about the child. However, the evidence is more consistent with Family Court\u2019s conclusion that the grandparents made all decisions about the child and merely kept the mother informed of the decisions that they had made or were about to make. For example, the mother and her boyfriend testified that, at least as early as 2011, she wanted to enroll the child in a school in the district where she lived, rather than the district of the grandparents\u2019 residence. The grandparents desired to keep the child in their district, where he had always attended school. The mother did not make any change in the child\u2019s school enrollment until the summer of 2012, after this proceeding had commenced. In addition, the mother could have expressly revoked her written permission, or specifically limited the authorization to making medical decisions in emergency situations, but she never did so. Instead, her conduct, and that of the grandparents, supports Family Court\u2019s finding that \u201cin reality [the mother] relinquished her parental control and decisionmaking authority in writing and in practice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>grandparents\u201d (50 Misc 3d 990, 1006 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Furthermore, while there arguably may have been a reason for the mother to refrain from seeking physical custody during the time that she was caring for her own ailing parents, that situation did not arise until 2006, several years after the child began living with the grandparents. Additionally, although one of the mother\u2019s parents died and the other went into a nursing home in 2009, the mother allowed the grandparents to continue raising the child thereafter and she did not seek physical custody of him until 2012. No reasonable explanation was provided for her failure to attempt to gain physical custody after 2009 <em>(see Matter of Michaellica Lee W., </em>106 AD3d 639, 639-640 [1st Dept 2013]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In sum, the evidence more closely comports with Family Court\u2019s finding that the mother voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child for more than 24 months, even though she had regular contact and visitation with him <em>(see Matter of Curless, </em>125 AD3d at 1196; <em>Matter of Battisti v Battisti, </em>121 AD3d 1196, 1197-1198 [3d Dept 2014]; <em>see also Matter of Marcus CC., </em>107 AD3d at 1244). The mother allowed the grandparents to assume control over, and responsibility for the care of, the child while he resided with them for a prolonged period of years, during which she assumed the role of a noncustodial parent in virtually every way <em>(see Matter of Traci M.S. v Darlene </em>C., 37 AD3d 1083, 1084 [4th Dept 2007]). Where, as here, the mother has effectively transferred custody of the child to the grandparents for a prolonged period of time, the circumstances rise to the level of extraordinary, as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>under our law to confer standing upon the grandparents to petition the courts to formally obtain legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We reiterate that the conferral of standing, through the demonstration of extraordinary circumstances, is only the first step of the inquiry where a nonparent seeks custody against a parent. The second step addresses the best interest of the child. Here, Family Court found that it was in the child\u2019s best interest to remain in the primary physical custody of the grandparents. However, inasmuch as the Appellate Division did not reach that question, it must do so on remittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In conclusion, the grandparents established their standing to seek custody of the child by demonstrating extraordinary circumstances, namely an extended disruption of the mother\u2019s custody, in accordance with <em>Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys </em>and Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2). Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed, without costs, and the matter remitted to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Pigott, Rivera, AbdusSalaam and Fahey concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Order reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. Although the father was regularly paying child support to the mother, she did not provide the grandparents with any money for the child\u2019s care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">. The father withdrew his custody petition against the mother and supported the grandparents\u2019 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. To the extent the grandparents and attorney for the child argue that the Appellate Division decision could be read as finding the statute to be unconstitutional, we note that the statute\u2019s constitutionality was not challenged in either that Court or Family Court. Moreover, our reading of the Appellate Division decision leads us to conclude that the constitutional issue was not addressed therein. Thus, that issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. The mother also erroneously argues that the standard for extraordinary circumstances requires the parent to engage in gross misconduct or utter irresponsibility. This Court has used such language, but we did so in a case decided almost 20 years before Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (2) was enacted. That case involved a mother who had turned her child over to potential adoptive parents after agreeing to an adoption \u2014 which would have resulted in a permanent termination of all parental rights \u2014 and, soon thereafter, changed her mind and tried to regain care and control of her child <em>(see Matter of Male Infant L., </em>61 NY2d 420, 427 [1984]). The language requiring gross misconduct or utter irresponsibility should not be taken out of context to further heighten the standard for establishing standing in all nonparent custody cases, where the parents \u2014 although potentially being deprived of custody \u2014 otherwise retain their parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">. Here, the grandparents called the mother nearly every day to keep her updated on the child\u2019s activities. They also brought the mother and her daughters on family vacations, invited them to family holiday gatherings, and relocated them twice. This conduct, primarily initiated by the grandparents, kept the mother in closer contact with the child. It would be incongruous to then deny the grandparents standing based on their efforts at facilitating that contact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">. For purposes of determining extraordinary circumstances, this situation can be distinguished from those in which a parent has a compelling reason to allow a nonparent to assume custody for a more limited and defined period of time. For example, no extraordinary circumstances were found where a father asked a grandfather to assume custody while the father \u201cgot [his] life together,\u201d after which the father completed substance abuse treatment, anger management, and parenting classes and obtained steady employment \u2014 all while continuously attempting to maintain contact with the children \u2014 before he tried to regain custody (see <em>Matter of Ferguson v Skelly, </em>80 AD3d 903, 904-905 [3d Dept 2011], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 710 [2011]). Similarly, it may be necessary for a single parent who is enlisted in the military to cede custody while deployed. In such situations, a parent can enter into an agreement memorializing a period of temporary custody, or can include limiting language in written authorizations \u2014 unlike the authorizations here, which explicitly stated that they were \u201copen and ongoing\u201d and had \u201cno expiration date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
