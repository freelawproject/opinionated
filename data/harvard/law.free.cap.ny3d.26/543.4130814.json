Where the evidence is determined to have been intentionally or wilfully destroyed, the relevancy of the destroyed documents is presumed <em>(see Zubulake, </em>220 FRD at 220). On the other hand, if the evidence is determined to have been negligently destroyed, the party seeking spolia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>tion sanctions must establish that the destroyed documents were relevant to the party\u2019s claim or defense <em>(see id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">On this appeal, we are asked to decide whether the Appellate Division erred in reversing an order of Supreme Court that imposed a spoliation sanction on the defendants. We hold that it did, and remand the matter to the trial court for a determination as to whether the evidence, which the Appellate Division found to be negligently destroyed, was relevant to the claims asserted against defendants and for the imposition of an appropriate sanction, should the trial court deem, in its discretion, that a sanction is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In 2005 and 2006, plaintiffs Pegasus Aviation I, Inc., Pegasus Aviation IV, Inc. and Pegasus Aviation V, Inc. (collectively, Pegasus) leased cargo planes to defendant Varig Logistica S.A. (VarigLog), a Brazilian air cargo company. Shortly thereafter, the MP defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purchased VarigLog out of a Brazilian bankruptcy. In early 2007, a dispute arose between one of the MP defendants (MP Volo) and its Brazilian shareholders concerning the distribution of proceeds from the sale of one of VarigLog\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries. In July 2007, the Brazilian shareholders denied the MP defendants access to VarigLog\u2019s offices, and shareholder litigation ensued. The end result was that the MP defendants were, in effect, \u201cfrozen out\u201d of VarigLog\u2019s affairs from July 2007 until April 1, 2008, when a Brazilian court removed the three Brazilian shareholders and appointed MP Volo to \u201ctake over the administration and management\u201d of VarigLog under the supervision of a judicial oversight committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">During the shareholder litigation, and while the MP defendants were \u201cfrozen out\u201d of VarigLog, VarigLog defaulted on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>leases with Pegasus. In February 2008, Pegasus commenced litigation against only VarigLog in Florida state court for, among other things, breach of the lease agreements. Later, Pegasus voluntarily discontinued the Florida action and filed suit against both VarigLog and the MP defendants in New York County Supreme Court in October 2008. As relevant here, Pegasus sued VarigLog for breach of contract and conversion, and sought to hold the MP defendants liable for VarigLog\u2019s conduct on an alter ego theory. In March 2009, VarigLog filed for bankruptcy. At all relevant times, VarigLog and the MP defendants were represented by separate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Pegasus served a notice to produce documents pursuant to CPLR 3120 that, as relevant here, sought electronically stored information (ESI) concerning Pegasus\u2019s claims and VarigLog\u2019s relationship with the MP defendants. VarigLog produced some documents in response, but that production was unsatisfactory to Pegasus, particularly with regard to the ESI.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Supreme Court appointed a discovery referee to assist Pegasus and VarigLog in resolving the dispute. During the first conference, which occurred in January 2010, counsel for VarigLog reported that VarigLog had experienced one or more computer \u201ccrashes\u201d that impaired its ability to provide the requested ESI. VarigLog\u2019s counsel later explained that between 2000 and 2008, VarigLog did not have a system of preserving emails, that emails were routinely stored on the computers of individual employees and that employee computers were returned empty when an employee left the company. Counsel also explained that beginning in March 2008, VarigLog had established a system whereby VarigLog\u2019s ESI was backed up on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, but that computer crashes that occurred in February and March 2009 resulted in the loss of much of the ESI, and that data recovery efforts had proven unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Pegasus then moved for the imposition of sanctions against VarigLog and the MP defendants. It sought an order holding VarigLog in contempt for failing to comply with court orders, striking VarigLog\u2019s answer, and imposing a trial adverse inference against the MP defendants for their failure to properly preserve electronic and paper records relevant to the action and within their control, albeit in the possession of their subsidiary, VarigLog. Pegasus argued that the MP defendants controlled VarigLog and therefore had a duty to impose a \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve certain VarigLog paper documents but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Supreme Court granted Pegasus\u2019s motion, holding that VarigLog\u2019s failure to issue a \u201clitigation hold\u201d amounted to gross negligence as a matter of law, such that the relevance of the missing ESI was presumed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Supreme Court also found that the MP defendants, having been charged by the Brazilian court with the duty to \u201cmanage\u201d and \u201cadminister\u201d VarigLog, were in \u201ccontrol\u201d of VarigLog for purposes of putting a \u201clitigation hold\u201d into place to preserve the ESI, and their failure to do so amounted to gross negligence. The court therefore struck the answer of VarigLog and imposed a trial adverse inference sanction against the MP defendants with regard to ESI and paper records relevant to the action and within the MP defendants\u2019 control. The MP defendants appealed the order of Supreme Court to the Appellate Division insofar as it granted Pegasus\u2019s motion for a trial adverse inference instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">A divided Appellate Division reversed insofar as appealed from on the law and the facts and denied Pegasus\u2019s motion for a trial adverse inference instruction (118 AD3d 428, 428 [1st Dept 2014]). The majority held that the record supported Supreme Court\u2019s finding that the MP defendants had sufficient control over VarigLog so as to trigger a duty on their part to preserve the ESI, but that it could not be said that their \u201cfailure to discharge this duty was so egregious as to rise to the level of gross negligence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 432). It rejected Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the MP defendants\u2019 failure to institute a litigation hold amounted to gross negligence per se, and held that the facts of the case supported, at most, a finding of simple negligence <em>(see id. </em>at 432-434). Further, according to the majority, because Pegasus failed to prove that the lost ESI would have supported Pegasus\u2019s claims, a trial adverse inference sanction could not stand <em>(see id. </em>at 435).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Justice Andrias concurred with the majority on the issue of the MP defendants\u2019 control over VarigLog and their duty to preserve the ESI, and also agreed \u201cthat upon a contextual assessment of all pertinent facts\u201d the MP defendants\u2019 \u201cfailure to discharge [their] duty did not rise to the level of gross negligence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 436). However, in his view, because Supreme Court possessed the discretion to impose a spoliation sanction for negligent destruction of evidence, the matter should have been remanded to Supreme Court \u201cfor a determination as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the extent to which [Pegasus has] been prejudiced by the loss of the evidence, and the sanction, if any, that should be imposed\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 436-437 [Andrias, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part]).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Justice Richter dissented in full, arguing that the MP defendants\u2019 \u201cfailure to take any meaningful steps to preserve evidence constitute [d] gross negligence\u201d and that the adverse inference sanction should be affirmed <em>(id. </em>at 438 [Richter, J., dissenting]). She based her determination not only on the fact that the MP defendants failed to initiate a litigation hold, but also \u201con a close review of the specific facts of th[e] case\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 440).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The Appellate Division granted Pegasus\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, and, in its certified question, asks this Court to determine whether the Appellate Division\u2019s order, which reversed Supreme Court, was properly made (2014 NY Slip Op 90118 [U] [1st Dept 2014]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Our state trial courts possess broad discretion to provide proportionate relief to a party deprived of lost or destroyed evidence, including the preclusion of proof favorable to the spoliator to restore balance to the litigation, requiring the spoliator to pay costs to the injured party associated with the development of replacement evidence, or employing an adverse inference instruction at the trial of the action <em>(see Ortega v City of New York, </em>9 NY3d 69, 76 [2007] [citations omitted]; CPLR 3126 [if a trial court determines that a party has destroyed evidence that \u201cought to have been disclosed . . . the court may make such orders with regard to the failure or refusal as are just\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Here, the order of the Appellate Division reversed the order of Supreme Court \u201con the law and the facts\u201d (118 AD3d at 428). In its certified question to this Court, the Appellate Division certified that the \u201cdetermination was made as a matter of law and not in the exercise of discretion.\u201d However, we are not bound by the Appellate Division\u2019s characterization in its certification order, and instead \u201clook to see whether the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>late Division\u2019s decision, regardless of its characterization, nonetheless reflects a discretionary balancing of interests\u201d <em>(Andon v 302-304 Mott St. Assoc., </em>94 NY2d 740, 745 [2000] [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The trial court (which had presided over and supervised the discovery in the case for several years) and the Appellate Division reached different conclusions concerning the MP defendants\u2019 level of negligence in failing to preserve the ESI. The trial court conducted a review of the facts, determined that the MP defendants exercised sufficient control over VarigLog,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and held that the failure of the MP defendants to institute a litigation hold amounted to gross negligence. On appeal, all five Appellate Division Justices agreed with Supreme Court\u2019s assessment that the MP defendants possessed \u201ccontrol\u201d over VarigLog such that it had a duty to preserve the ESI, but the three-Justice majority found that \u201c[t]he facts of this case\u201d did not support a \u201cfinding of gross negligence\u201d (118 AD3d at 432). A fourth Justice made a \u201ccontextual assessment of all pertinent facts\u201d and reached the same conclusion <em>(id. </em>at 436 [Andrias, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part]). The dissenting Justice\u2019s conclusion that the MP defendants were grossly negligent was \u201cbased on the unique facts of [the] case and the significant control [the MP defendants] had over VarigLog at the time this action was commenced\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 440 [Richter, J., dissenting]). Thus, whether the MP defendants\u2019 \u201cculpable mental state\u201d rose to the level of gross negligence, as opposed to ordinary negligence, constituted differing factual determinations by the trial court and the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Where the Appellate Division reaches a factual conclusion different from that reached by the trial court, \u201cthe scope of our review is limited to determining whether the evidence of record . . . more nearly comports with the trial court\u2019s findings or with those of the Appellate Division\u201d <em>(Friedman v State of New York, </em>67 NY2d 271, 284-285 [1986]). In our view, the record evidence comports more with the Appellate Division majority\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The trial court found that it was the lack of a litigation hold, and not the computer crashes themselves, that resulted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>destruction of the requested documents. However, the trial court incorrectly stated that the MP defendants were part of the Florida litigation, and that once they were, they were required to ensure that a litigation hold was in place, pointing to the fact that because the MP defendants were ordered by the Brazilian court to \u201cmanage and administer\u201d VarigLog, the MP defendants were running VarigLog and therefore had the means of implementing a litigation hold. However, in this instance, the failure to institute a litigation hold did not amount to gross negligence per se, as the trial court held. Rather, a party\u2019s failure to institute a litigation hold is but one factor that a trial court can consider in making a determination as to the alleged spoliator\u2019s culpable state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In contrast to the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the Appellate Division majority noted that Pegasus did not adduce evidence that any steps were taken to defeat the computer backup system in the months leading up to the crashes, nor did Pegasus claim that the MP defendants themselves caused the crashes. The Appellate Division majority considered a number of factors in reaching its ultimate holding that the MP defendants\u2019 conduct in failing to preserve the ESI was not grossly negligent. Pertinent to that finding was the fact that VarigLog was represented by its own counsel when the MP defendants were brought into the litigation in April 2008, and there was no evidence that the MP defendants had reason to believe that VarigLog\u2019s counsel was not providing VarigLog adequate advice concerning ESI preservation. Another factor relied on by the majority was that the MP defendants adequately responded to all of Pegasus\u2019s discovery demands directed at them, thus negating any inference that the MP defendants were reckless concerning Pegasus\u2019s demands made on them. Finally, the majority found that notwithstanding the fact that the MP defendants had exercised practical control over VarigLog, the record evidence indicated that VarigLog and the MP defendants were separate entities, with each possessing their own offices, staff, operations and computer systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">These aforementioned facts substantiated the Appellate Division\u2019s ultimate conclusion that, at most, the MP defendants\u2019 failures amounted to \u201ca finding of simple negligence\u201d (118 AD3d at 432-433). The evidence in the record adequately comports with the Appellate Division majority\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On this record, we see no reason to disturb the unanimous finding of the lower courts that the MP defendants had suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ficient control over VarigLog to trigger a duty on its part to preserve the ESI. Nor is there any basis to disturb the findings of fact by the Appellate Division that the MP defendants were negligent in failing to discharge that duty. The Appellate Division majority erred, however, to the extent that it determined that Pegasus had not attempted to make a showing of relevance (118 AD3d at 433 n 7) and chose to conduct its own analysis of the relevance issue without taking into account Pegasus\u2019s arguments in that regard, which were contained in its appellate brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, although the Appellate Division possesses the authority to make findings of fact that is as broad as the trial court, in this instance, where it all but ignored Pegasus\u2019s arguments concerning the relevance of the documents, we conclude that the prudent course of action is to remit the matter to Supreme Court for a determination as to whether the negligently destroyed ESI was relevant to Pegasus\u2019s claims against the MP defendants and, if so, what sanction, if any, is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Finally, the Appellate Division erroneously stated that a trial adverse inference charge in an alter ego case such as this one would be \u201ctantamount to granting [Pegasus] summary judgment\u201d (118 AD3d at 436). Such adverse inference charges have been found to be appropriate even in situations where the evidence has been found to have been negligently destroyed <em>(see e.g. Strong v City of New York, </em>112 AD3d 15, 22-24 [1st Dept 2013] [stating that adverse inference charge at trial \u201cmay be . . . appropriate\u201d where the evidence was negligently destroyed]; <em>Marotta v Hoy, </em>55 AD3d 1194, 1197 [3d Dept 2008] [holding that Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the plaintiff was entitled to an adverse inference instruction as a sanction for negligent spoliation]; <em>Tomasello v 64 Franklin, Inc., </em>45 AD3d 1287, 1288 [4th Dept 2007] [adverse inference charge appropriate sanction for negligent spoliation]). Contrary to the Appellate Division majority\u2019s contention, a trial adverse inference sanction would not be akin to granting summary judgment to Pegasus on its alter ego claim, since such a charge is permissive and can be appropriately tailored by the trial court <em>(see </em>PJI 1:77; <em>see also Gogos v Modell\u2019s Sporting Goods, Inc., </em>87 AD3d 248, 255 [1st Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and the certified question is answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">.

MP Volo and three Brazilian shareholders/co-investors formed Volo do Brasil, S.A. (VdB), a Brazilian corporation, which purchased VarigLog out of a Brazilian bankruptcy proceeding in 2006. Brazilian aviation law requires that Brazilian citizens or entities must control at least 80% of the voting interest in a Brazilian airline and, as a result, the Brazilian shareholders controlled 80% of the voting interest in VdB while MP Volo owned the remaining 20%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\">. VarigLog did not appeal Supreme Court\u2019s order and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. Because the Appellate Division focused solely on the destruction of ESI and did not address the issue concerning the paper records, our analysis is similarly limited to the ESI evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\">. Our utilization of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d for purposes of this opinion is solely in reference to the issue of whether the MP defendants possessed sufficient control over VarigLog so as to trigger a duty on the MP defendants\u2019 part to see to it that VarigLog was preserving the ESI.

Indeed, Pegasus made a motion to reargue addressing this error, and, rather than granting that motion, the Appellate Division granted Pegasus leave to appeal to this Court (2014 NY Slip Op 90118[U] [1st Dept 2014]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b657-4\">Stein, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5q\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. The majority properly relies upon <em>VOOM HD Holdings LLC v EchoStar Satellite L.L.C. </em>(93 AD3d 33, 45 [1st Dept 2012]) for the proposition that a party seeking sanctions for spoliation of evidence must establish three facts: (1) that the party with control over the destroyed evidence had the obligation to preserve it; (2) that the evidence was destroyed with a culpable state of mind; and (3) that the evidence was relevant to \u2014 or, in other words, would have supported \u2014 the party\u2019s claim. Like the majority, I conclude that the courts below correctly determined that the MatlinPatterson (MP) defendant firms and entities had sufficient control over Varig Logistica S.A. (VarigLog) to trigger a duty to preserve electronically stored information (ESI) and the computer hardware on which it was stored. However, I part ways with the majority over its determination that the MP defendants\u2019 \u201cculpable state of mind\u201d amounted to, at most, simple negligence. I would hold that defendants acted with gross negligence in failing to preserve the ESI.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">I further disagree with the majority\u2019s view that relevance is not to be presumed because the evidence was not intentionally or wilfully destroyed. The majority endorses the conclusion of the First Department in <em>VOOM </em>and the case upon which it <em>relies </em>\u2014 Zubulake <em>v UBS Warburg LLC </em>(220 FRD 212, 220 [SD NY 2003]) \u2014 that, \u201c[w]here the evidence is determined to have been intentionally or wilfully destroyed, the relevancy of the destroyed documents is presumed\u201d (majority op at 547). However, the majority neglects to mention that <em>VOOM </em>further held that \u201cdestruction that is the result of gross negligence\u201d also \u201cis sufficient to presume relevance\u201d <em>(VOOM, </em>93 AD3d at 45). Inasmuch as, under <em>VOOM, </em>the MP defendants\u2019 gross negligence gives rise to a presumption of relevancy, I would remit to the Appellate Division for consideration of whether, in its discretion, a sanction is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The basic facts are largely undisputed and reflected in the record as described by the majority. The MP defendants were \u201cfrozen out\u201d of VarigLog\u2019s affairs by Brazilian shareholders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>with whom they shared ownership of VarigLog\u2019s parent corporation, Volo do Brasil, S.A. (VdB); during that time frame, VarigLog breached its aircraft lease agreements with plaintiffs, leading to the commencement of a now-discontinued Florida action and then this action. Prior to the commencement of this action, one of the MP defendants was granted authority over the \u201cadministration and management\u201d of VarigLog by a Brazilian court. Thereafter, VarigLog suffered two computer crashes resulting in the loss of much of the ESI that plaintiffs sought in discovery. After the loss was disclosed, plaintiffs sought sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Supreme Court \u2014 which, as the majority notes, \u201chad presided over and supervised the discovery in the case for several years\u201d (majority op at 552) \u2014 determined that the MP defendants\u2019 culpable state of mind amounted to gross negligence, warranting an adverse inference charge at trial. In contrast, the Appellate Division concluded that the record supported only a finding of ordinary negligence and not gross negligence (118 AD3d 428, 432-433 [1st Dept 2014]). Because the Appellate Division reversed the trial court\u2019s factual determination in this regard, our review is limited to a consideration of \u201cwhich court\u2019s determination more closely comports with the evidence\u201d <em>(Glenbriar Co. v Lipsman, </em>5 NY3d 388, 392 [2005]). In my view, Supreme Court\u2019s determination does so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">While I concur with the majority\u2019s basic outline of the underlying facts, I note that the following facts \u2014 which were omitted from the majority\u2019s highly selective version \u2014 are also relevant to an analysis of which of the determinations below more closely comports with the record. Although the Brazilian shareholders nominally owned 80% of the voting stock in VdB, a Brazilian court concluded that they did not make any financial contribution and \u201cwere inserted into the company by [Volo Logistics LLC, an MP defendant (MP Volo)] ... to circumvent\u201d Brazilian aviation law. The MP defendants not only owned an equity stake in VarigLog, but they also advanced capital to VarigLog in the form of loans. The dispute that led to the MP defendants being \u201cfrozen out\u201d of VarigLog\u2019s affairs in July 2007 arose when the Brazilian shareholders refused to authorize repayment of the MP defendants\u2019 loans and instead transferred cash to bank accounts owned by VarigLog and located in Switzerland. MP Volo then sued VarigLog for breach of its obligations under the relevant loan agreement in New York, Switzerland and Brazil <em>(see Volo Logistics LLC v Varig </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>Logistica </em>S.A., 51 AD3d 554 [1st Dept 2008]). The parties do not contest that it was as a result of this dispute that the Brazilian shareholders denied the MP defendants access to VarigLog\u2019s offices and systems and prohibited the MP defendants from involvement in VarigLog\u2019s business affairs from July 2007 until April 2008. In litigation commenced in Brazil by the Brazilian shareholders seeking invalidation of the shareholder agreement with the MP defendants, the Brazilian court found that the shareholders had used VarigLog funds during that time for their personal benefit, rather than for the company\u2019s maintenance. It was also during that time frame that VarigLog began to breach its lease agreements with plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Ultimately, the Brazilian court excluded the Brazilian shareholders from having any role in the management and operations of VarigLog, and vested \u201cadministration and management\u201d in MP Volo beginning April 1, 2008. MP Volo remained subject to judicial oversight until December 9, 2008, when the judicial administrators were relieved of any further duty to supervise and control MP Volo\u2019s management and administration of VarigLog.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite the judicial oversight, the Appellate Division, in affirming Supreme Court\u2019s finding of the requisite control, stated that \u201cit cannot be ignored that the MP defendants, as the sole shareholders of VarigLog at this time, selected VarigLog\u2019s directors, and the record establishes that, during the period in question, employees and consultants of the MP defendants were <em>closely monitoring VarigLog\u2019s operations\u201d </em>(118 AD3d at 431 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Indeed, during the relevant time frame, Peter Miller, a former principal of defendant MatlinPatterson Global Advisers, LLC, was first president and then a member of VarigLog\u2019s Board of Directors. Chan Lup Wai Ohira, the sister of an MP Volo director, Lap Chan, became president of VarigLog\u2019s Board of Directors immediately after Miller and, from November 24, 2008 through at least October 19, 2011, she was the CEO of VarigLog. Miller was directly involved in the negotiations over the aircraft leases that are in dispute. In fact, he testified at his examination before trial that he told plaintiffs that their planes would be returned once the past-due amounts that VarigLog owed plaintiffs were settled \u2014 that is, Miller informed plaintiffs that reaching an agreement on any outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>amounts that VarigLog owed plaintiffs under the leases was a prerequisite to the physical return of plaintiffs\u2019 planes. Regarding the MP defendants\u2019 day-to-day management of VarigLog, Miller also testified that Lap Chan led a team of MP defendant employees and consultants who worked at VarigLog, including an information technology (IT) consultant. Notably, although VarigLog maintained a separate computer system from the MP defendants, the IT consultant recommended that VarigLog\u2019s IT operating costs be reduced by 60% within three to four months of MP Volo being imbued with authority over the management and administration of VarigLog. To be sure, as the majority states, VarigLog and the MP defendants were represented by separate counsel. However, it is undisputed that, once the MP defendants became responsible for the administration and management of VarigLog, they replaced VarigLog\u2019s counsel, including in the prior New York action <em>(Volo Logistics LLC v Varig Logistica S.A., </em>51 AD3d 554 [2008], <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Significantly, the computer crashes that resulted in the loss of the ESI at issue occurred on February 15, 2009 and March 24, 2009 \u2014 approximately 10 to 11 months <em>after </em>the MP defendants obtained control of VarigLog pursuant to the Brazilian court order, four to five months after this action commenced, several months after judicial oversight terminated, and shortly after plaintiff served VarigLog with its first set of requests for the production of documents. As noted by the dissenting Justice at the Appellate Division, it is undisputed that, even \u201cafter the first crash occurred, MP . . . took no additional action to ensure the preservation of data going forward\u201d (118 AD3d at 439 [Richter, J., dissenting]). Rather, it hired a company that unsuccessfully attempted to recover the data, and then waited more than 10 months to disclose the fact that the crashes had occurred. Critically, while the MP defendants were \u201cclosely monitoring VarigLog\u2019s operations\u201d (118 AD3d at 431), VarigLog failed to maintain the affected disks and applications following the crashes. That is, this case involves not only a failure to preserve electronic data but, even more importantly, the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to preserve the affected disks and applications involved in the crashes that plaintiffs could have had examined to determine if the ESI could be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">As noted above, my primary disagreement with the majority centers on its analysis of the record evidence regarding the MP defendants\u2019 culpable state of mind \u2014 i.e., the extent of their negligence. In concluding that the Appellate Division\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s conduct constituted ordinary negligence, rather than gross negligence, more closely comports with the record, the majority fails to articulate what it actually means by the phrase \u201cgross negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In accordance with this Court\u2019s traditional definition of gross negligence, the proper standard is \u201cthe failure to exercise even slight care,\u201d and whether a party\u2019s conduct amounts to gross negligence generally presents a factual question <em>(Food Pageant v Consolidated Edison Co., </em>54 NY2d 167, 172 [1981]; <em>see also Dalton v Hamilton Hotel Operating Co., </em>242 NY 481, 487 [1926]). Upon a complete review of the entire record before us, I conclude that the evidence more closely comports with a finding that the MP defendants failed to use even slight care \u2014 i.e., that they were grossly negligent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">While VarigLog\u2019s obligations to preserve evidence may have arisen prior to the time the MP defendants acquired control of that company, the data losses in question occurred long after the MP defendants assumed management and administration of VarigLog. Moreover, once the MP defendants\u2019 close monitor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ing of VarigLog\u2019s operations commenced, Miller \u2014 an employee of the MP defendants \u2014 was directly involved in the unsuccessful negotiations between VarigLog and plaintiffs over the leases at issue. Nevertheless, although the MP defendants should have anticipated litigation with plaintiffs at that point, they failed to institute any litigation hold, as the majority concedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Furthermore, VarigLog may have had its own, separate computer systems and counsel, but once the MP defendants were authorized to manage VarigLog, their consultant sought to downsize VarigLog\u2019s IT department and the MP defendants replaced VarigLog\u2019s counsel with attorneys of their own choosing, one of whom admittedly failed to consider the possibility of a computer crash. The computer crashes occurred well after this action commenced, after discovery requests were made, and after judicial oversight of VarigLog had terminated. Thus, at the time of the first crash, the MP defendants were administering VarigLog without oversight, yet they took no steps thereafter to ensure the preservation of the remaining data that survived the first crash, despite the fact that litigation was ongoing. Most troubling of all, the hardware and software \u2014 the affected \u201cdisks and applications\u201d \u2014 involved in the crashes were discarded after the second crash without any notice to plaintiffs, thereby \u201cdepriv[ing] [plaintiffs] of the opportunity to have their own expert examine the computer to determine if the deleted files could be restored\u201d <em>(Harry Weiss, Inc. v Moskowitz, </em>106 AD3d 668, 670 [1st Dept 2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Regardless of whether the MP defendants responded to the discovery demands directed at them, the foregoing evidence more closely comports with the trial court\u2019s finding that they were grossly negligent in their oversight of VarigLog\u2019s discovery obligations <em>{see id. </em>at 669-670; <em>see also AJ Holdings Group, LLC v IP Holdings, LLC, </em>129 AD3d 504, 505 [1st Dept 2015]; <em>Ahroner v Israel Discount Bank of N.Y., </em>79 AD3d 481, 482 [1st Dept 2010]; <em>see generally Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp. v Banco BRJ S.A., </em>304 FRD 178, 182-184 [SD NY 2014]). Therefore, I would reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s finding of ordinary negligence and reinstate the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the level of negligence displayed. The MP defendants\u2019 grossly negligent conduct gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the spoliated evidence was relevant <em>(see AJ Holdings, </em>129 AD3d at 505; <em>VOOM, </em>93 AD3d at 45). Accordingly, inasmuch as the Appellate Division placed the burden on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>plaintiffs to demonstrate relevance when it should have placed the burden on the MP defendants to disprove it, I would remit to that Court for a determination of whether the MP defendants rebutted the presumption of relevance and, if not, for a discretionary determination of what sanction, if any, is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Although the issue of relevance should be revisited, I emphasize that it should be considered by the Appellate Division, rather than the trial court. I further take this opportunity to express my disagreement with the majority\u2019s characterization of the Appellate Division\u2019s analysis of relevance as having been performed \u201cwithout taking into account [plaintiffs\u2019] arguments in that regard, which were contained in [their] appellate brief\u201d (majority op at 554). In my view, the Appellate Division properly considered plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and concluded that plaintiffs incorrectly asserted that \u201cthe motion court found that the evidence established that the lost documents . . . were relevant\u201d (118 AD3d at 435 n 9 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Although the Appellate Division correctly concluded that plaintiffs did not attempt to show relevance in the first instance \u2014 which would be their burden if the MP defendants\u2019 conduct amounted only to ordinary negligence <em>(see VOOM, </em>93 AD3d at 45) \u2014 plaintiffs argued in their appellate brief that the MP defendants failed to successfully <em>rebut </em>the presumption of relevance of several enumerated categories of documents, by showing how those documents were relevant. The Appellate Division expressly addressed and rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments concerning the documents, performing a detailed analysis of the relevance of all of the enumerated categories of documents set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 brief (118 AD3d at 433-434). Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s claim \u2014 made in an apparent attempt to provide a rationale for remitting this case to the trial court, rather than the Appellate Division \u2014 that the Appellate Division \u201call but ignored [plaintiffs\u2019] arguments\u201d (majority op at 554). However, even if the Appellate Division did overlook plaintiffs\u2019 arguments concerning relevance \u2014 which it plainly did not \u2014 the correct remedy would be a remittal to that Court, not to the trial court, for consideration of those arguments.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Abdus-Salaam and Fahey concur; Judge Stein dissents in an opinion in which Judge Rivera concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Order reversed, with costs, case remitted to Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. Approximately three months after judicial oversight terminated, VarigLog filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. Although the majority concludes that \u201cthere was no evidence that the MP defendants had reason to believe that VarigLog\u2019s counsel\u201d \u2014 hired by the MP defendants \u2014 \u201cwas not providing VarigLog adequate advice concerning ESI preservation\u201d (majority op at 553), any inquiry in that regard may have revealed cause for concern, given that counsel later conceded that he \u201cdid not discuss backing up existing electronic data that was being preserved . . . , nor did the possibility of a computer crash that might eradicate such data enter [his] thinking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. In determining the MP defendants\u2019 culpable state of mind, the Appellate Division defined \u201cgross negligence\u201d as \u201c \u2018conduct that evinces a reckless disregard for the rights of others or smacks of intentional wrongdoing\u2019 \u201d (118 AD3d at 433, quoting <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v Holmes Protection Group, </em>250 AD2d 526, 527 [1st Dept 1998]). As plaintiffs argue, that definition was inapt because it was drawn from an unrelated context involving the rule that contractual waiver of liability for gross negligence is forbidden as a matter of public policy <em>(see Hartford Ins. Co., </em>250 AD2d at 527; <em>see also Abacus Fed. Sav. Bank v ADT Sec. Servs., Inc., </em>18 NY3d 675, 683 [2012]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. Although I believe that the majority has overlooked significant facts in the record that evince the MP defendants\u2019 gross negligence, I agree that the trial court erred in concluding that the failure to institute a litigation hold amounts to gross negligence per se. Rather, \u201cthe failure to adopt good preservation practices [is but] one factor [to be considered] in the determination of whether discovery sanctions should issue\u201d <em>(Chin v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>685 F3d 135, 162 [2012] [internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
