The prosecutor\u2019s refusal to grant immunity to a witness who was prepared to offer testimony that she \u2014 not respondent\u2014 was driving the car and caused the accident was an abuse of discretion and deprived respondent of his due process right to a fair trial, where the witness\u2019s testimony was critical to the defense, the prosecutor would only have been immunizing the witness from prosecution for a traffic offense, and the prosecutor offered no other reason for his refusal (US Const Amends V, VI, XIV; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6; CPL 50.30). <em>(People v Adams, </em>53 NY2d 241; <em>People v Owens, </em>63 NY2d 824; <em>People v Priester, </em>98 AD2d 820; <em>People v Shapiro, </em>50 NY2d 747; <em>People v Ballard, </em>167 AD2d 895; <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673; <em>People v Allen, </em>50 NY2d 898; <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Schaeffer, </em>56 NY2d 448.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b559-6\">Chief Judge Lippman.</author>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The central issue in this case is whether an unavailable witness\u2019s statement to a defense investigator \u2014 that she, not defendant, was the driver at the time of the accident and that she fled the scene \u2014 should have been admitted as a declaration against interest. Because the witness was aware at the time she made the statement that it was against her interest, the four prongs of the test described in <em>People v Settles </em>(46 NY2d 154 [1978]) were met and the statement should have been admitted as a declaration against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Around midnight on July 11, 2010, police officers were called to the scene of an automobile accident in the Bronx. A witness who lived down the street from where the accident took place stated that, while he was sitting on his front porch, he saw defendant driving at 15 miles per hour up and down the block before colliding with a parked vehicle. The witness saw no one else in the car with defendant and as the witness approached defendant\u2019s car, he found defendant in the driver\u2019s seat. When police arrived, they detected alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath, noticed his slurred speech, and arrested defendant for driving while intoxicated. A breath analysis test administered at the police station revealed defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level to be .22%. At the station, defendant stated, \u201cI started drinking when I got lost. I f-\u2014 up. I couldn\u2019t drive for s \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Lamar Larson, who worked with defendant as a New York City bus driver, testified at trial that he chanced upon defendant at the Pelham Bay Diner near the bus depot in the Bronx at 11:45 p.m. that same night. Larson went to the diner to pick up something to eat for his night shift when he saw defendant in his car with a young woman inside. The woman was in the driver\u2019s seat and defendant was in the passenger seat. During their brief conversation, Larson noticed that defendant was slurring his speech and was drunk. Larson leaned into the window and said to the young woman, \u201c[m]ake sure he gets home, please,\u201d and the woman promised that she would. Larson saw the woman drive out of the parking lot with defendant beside her in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Two weeks after the accident, a young woman by the name of Janny Hunt told defendant\u2019s investigator that she was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. Hunt was 19 years old at the time, had no criminal history, and possessed only a learner\u2019s permit. Hunt met defendant that day on the bus he drove and they planned to go out that night. Defendant picked up Hunt in his car and they went to the diner at which point Hunt agreed to drive so that defendant could have a few drinks. As they were leaving the diner, Hunt recounted meeting defendant\u2019s friend Larson in the parking lot and promising to drive defendant home safely. On the way home, Hunt took a turn \u201ctoo fast\u201d and hit the parked car. Defendant yelled and cursed at Hunt, who \u201cgot scared\u201d because \u201c[i]t was late\u201d and her \u201cparents didn\u2019t know [she] was [out] with [defendant].\u201d Hunt \u201csaid to [defendant], T have to go, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t talk to you now.\u2019 \u2019\u2019According to Hunt, \u201c[defendant] was busy looking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>at his car and he waved [her] to leave.\u201d Hunt took a cab home. About a week later, Hunt ran across defendant on the bus and he told her that he had been arrested because they thought he had been driving the car. She agreed to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">While Janny Hunt recounted the events leading up to the accident, the investigator took notes. After the conversation, the investigator asked Hunt if she would sign the notes as her own words.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Hunt then expressed concern that \u201cshe would potentially get in trouble for the things that she was saying\u201d about the accident. She \u201cwas concerned about her parents . . . fin[d]ing out about the accident because she was in the car\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t driving her own car.\u201d According to the investigator, Hunt asked \u201cagain and again\u201d if the investigator was a lawyer, and asked to be put in touch with a lawyer when the investigator could not answer Hunt\u2019s questions. The investigator did not tell Hunt \u201canything about the specific trouble she might get into.\u201d Despite her concerns, Hunt reviewed and signed the written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When trial commenced, defense counsel indicated that he would call Hunt as a witness. Because her testimony could qualify as an admission to leaving the scene of an accident and traffic violations, the court appointed an attorney for Hunt. Defense counsel asked the People to grant Hunt immunity should she invoke her right to remain silent, a request the People refused. After the close of the People\u2019s case, Hunt\u2019s attorney invoked the Fifth Amendment on her behalf. After being refused immunity, defense counsel moved to dismiss the case. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Defense counsel then requested that Hunt\u2019s statement be admitted as a declaration against interest. The court ordered a hearing outside the presence of the jury, at which the investigator who took Hunt\u2019s statement testified. Following the hearing, the court remarked that whether a statement may be admitted as a declaration against interest \u201cdepends upon the assurance of reliability that comes from the person\u2019s awareness that what they are saying could get them in trouble [with] the law.\u201d The court \u201c[did] not believe that [Hunt], either at the time she made it or even immediately following, assuming that that\u2019s considered contemporaneous, was aware that her declarations could expose her to prosecution for a traffic offense.\u201d Finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that the declarant did not give \u201cany expression of that awareness until after the statement [was] given,\u201d the court concluded that the statement was inadmissible as a declaration against interest. The court further held that \u201cthe interest which the declaration compromises must be one of sufficient magnitude or consequence to the declarant to all but rule out any motive to falsify,\u201d relying on <em>People v Maerling </em>(46 NY2d 289, 298 [1978]), and determined that Hunt\u2019s minor violation, in contravention of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 600, did not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The jury convicted defendant of aggravated driving while intoxicated and driving while intoxicated. The Appellate Division reversed and ordered a new trial, holding that the declarant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cexpressions, at the time of or immediately after her statement, of apprehension that she could get in trouble for her conduct, including repeated inquiries about consulting with a lawyer, sufficed to satisfy the requirement that \u2018the declarant must be aware at the time of its making that the statement was contrary to his [or her] penal interest\u2019 \u201d (113 AD3d 153, 161 [2013]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Other evidence assured the reliability of Hunt\u2019s declaration inasmuch as Larson testified to seeing Hunt driving defendant home 15 minutes before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The dissenters would have affirmed the conviction on the basis that Hunt was not aware, at the time she made the declaration to the investigator, that her statement \u201cwas adverse to her penal interest\u201d and \u201cthe statement was not sufficiently reliable\u201d (113 AD3d at 162-163 [Clark, J., dissenting]). The dissenters also found the statement untrustworthy because \u201cit involves the potential exposure to a minor traffic infraction and, unlike the situation where a defendant confesses to a violent crime, the penal consequences resulting from the statement are not obvious, especially to a 19 year old with no criminal history\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 164-165). A dissenting Justice of the Appellate Division granted the People leave to appeal (2014 NY Slip Op 63495[U] [1st Dept 2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The declaration-against-interest exception to the hearsay rule \u201cflows from the fact that a person ordinarily does not reveal facts that are contrary to his own interest\u201d unless those facts are true <em>(Maerling, </em>46 NY2d at 295; <em>People v Brensic, </em>70 NY2d 9, 14 [1987]). A statement qualifies as a declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>against interest if four elements are met: (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify as a witness; (2) when the statement was made, the declarant was aware that it was adverse to his or her penal interest; (3) the declarant has competent knowledge of the facts underlying the statement; and (4) supporting circumstances independent of the statement itself attest to its trustworthiness and reliability <em>(People v Settles, </em>46 NY2d at 167).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Here, the first and third factors are not in dispute. Hunt was unavailable to testify because she had invoked her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, and the People refused to grant her immunity, despite defense requests. The third factor was met because Hunt would have had direct knowledge as to whether she was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident. The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal focus on the second and fourth elements for admissibility, namely, whether Hunt was aware that the statement was against her penal interest at the time she made it and whether the statement was sufficiently reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">As the Appellate Division appropriately concluded, the second factor was satisfied. Seconds after she made the statement to the defense investigator, Hunt asked if she could get into trouble and asked for an attorney. Only the most constricted reading of the contemporaneity requirement could support excluding Hunt\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The trial court failed to apply the proper standard when it ruled that the statement was not sufficiently against Hunt\u2019s penal interest. We have never held, as the trial court concluded, that the declaration-against-interest exception is limited to serious penal consequences. Rather, until 1970, when this Court decided <em>People v Brown </em>(26 NY2d 88 [1970]), the converse was true \u2014 only declarations against pecuniary or proprietary interests were admissible. Although leaving the scene of an accident that caused property damage constitutes a mere traffic violation, there is no requirement that a statement against penal interest involve a particularly serious crime <em>(see Basile v Huntington Util. Fuel Corp., </em>60 AD2d 616, 617 [2d Dept 1977] [admitting to reckless driving sufficient]). Moreover, the record here is replete with evidence regarding Hunt\u2019s awareness of the potential criminality of her actions; Hunt verbalized her concern that she would get in \u201ctrouble\u201d as a result of her actions of driving the vehicle during the accident and fleeing the scene, and she repeatedly requested legal advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>(see People v Fields, </em>66 NY2d 876, 877 [1985]). That Hunt also worried how her parents would react further demonstrates her understanding of the consequences, rather than exhibits her lack of comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The fourth factor was also satisfied because Lamar Larson\u2019s testimony corroborated Hunt\u2019s statement. In <em>Settles, </em>concerned with the possibility that someone might fabricate a declaration against interest, this Court held that, before a declaration against interest is admissible, \u201cthere must be some evidence, independent of the declaration itself, which fairly tends to support the facts asserted therein\u201d <em>(Settles, </em>46 NY2d at 168). Statements offered against the defendant are \u201csubjected to even more exacting standards\u201d and are admissible only when \u201cthe interest compromised is of sufficient magnitude or consequence to the declarant to all but rule out any motive to falsify\u201d <em>(Brensic, </em>70 NY2d at 14-15 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">By contrast, declarations that exculpate the defendant, as here, are subject to a more lenient standard <em>(Brensic, </em>70 NY2d at 15). In such circumstances, a defendant need not show that the penal consequences to the declarant were of such magnitude that they \u201call but rule out any motive to falsify\u201d (id.; <em>Maerling, </em>46 NY2d at 298). Rather, \u201c[s]upportive evidence is sufficient if it establishes a reasonable possibility that the statement might be true\u201d <em>(Settles </em>at 169-170). We explained that even \u201c[Circumstances of seeming indifference\u201d that \u201charmonize\u201d the statement may be sufficient to \u201cfurnish the necessary link\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 169). In addition, it is irrevelant whether the court believes the statement to be true: \u201c[i]f the proponent of the statement is able to establish this possibility of trustworthiness, it is the function of the jury alone to determine whether the declaration is sufficient to create reasonable doubt of guilt\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Larson said he saw a young woman driving defendant\u2019s car shortly before the accident occurred. That defendant was seen driving the car at the time of the accident presents a credibility issue for the jury, as this Court made clear in <em>Settles (id.). </em>Further, defendant and Hunt had no previous relationship that would provide Hunt with a motive to fabricate <em>(see Brensic, </em>70 NY2d at 25). Under the circumstances presented here, the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In light of the foregoing, we need not reach defendant-respondent\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> The majority of the Appellate Division so found, based upon the investigator\u2019s direct testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b565-4\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ace\">(dissenting). Because there is record support for the trial court finding that declarant, Janny Hunt, was unaware that her statement was against her penal interest at the time it was made, I dissent and would reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Defendant, who was employed as a city bus driver, was arrested and charged with four counts of driving while intoxicated after defendant\u2019s car struck a parked car. A witness at the scene called 911 and approached the car within seconds of the accident. At that point, the witness saw defendant \u201cdancing\u201d in the driver\u2019s seat with the radio turned up. Two weeks later, defendant encountered Hunt on a city bus and lamented that he had been arrested for driving while intoxicated. According to Hunt, defendant asked her if she could \u201chelp him out.\u201d Hunt agreed to do so by giving a statement to defendant\u2019s investigator. In that statement, Hunt claimed that it was she, and not defendant, who was driving defendant\u2019s car at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Hunt refused to testify at trial, citing Fifth Amendment concerns. Defense counsel requested that Hunt\u2019s hearsay statement to the investigator be introduced in evidence as a declaration against penal interest. At the court\u2019s direction, defense counsel called the private investigator to authenticate Hunt\u2019s statement. The investigator testified that she did not apprise Hunt of the consequences of her statement because the investigator herself was unaware of what penal consequences, if any, Hunt faced as a result of her admissions. In her statement, Hunt claimed that she left the scene of the accident because she did not want her parents to know that she was with defendant. The statement indicates that Hunt was concerned only about what her parents would think. Significantly, as the investigator\u2019s hearing testimony bears out, it was not until <em>after </em>Hunt signed her statement that she asked whether she could get in trouble for leaving the scene of the accident and reiterated her concern about her parents finding out that she was driving defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">During cross-examination, the investigator testified that her conversation with Hunt followed this progression: (1) Hunt spoke generally about the accident; (2) the investigator asked if she could write it down; (3) Hunt signed the statement; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(4) after Hunt signed the statement, Hunt had some questions about what could happen to her. The investigator specifically explained that \u201c[w]e went over [the statement] together and she signed it. At the end, she asked me a couple of questions that I did not know how to answer. I said to her she could speak to a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">On redirect examination, the investigator testified that \u201cat the beginning of the statement, no she did not express any concerns. <em>They came out at the end\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The investigator explained that Hunt \u201casked if she could get in trouble for the accident\u201d and stated that \u201cshe was concerned about her parents . . . fin[d]ing out about the accident because she was in the car. . . . <em>And just generally like how much trouble [sjhe can get into\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The trial court properly ruled that Hunt was not aware that the statement was against her penal interest at the time it was made. Our holding in <em>People v Settles </em>(46 NY2d 154 [1978]) concerning the \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d requirement is dispositive: \u201cwhen the statement [is] made the declarant <em>must </em>be aware that it [is] adverse to his [or her] penal interest\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 167 [emphasis supplied]). This awareness is premised on the conclusion that any reasonable person would have known at the time the statement was made that it was against his or her penal interest <em>(see People v Thomas, </em>68 NY2d 194, 199-200 [1986]).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Hunt admitted to committing a minor traffic infraction, i.e., leaving the scene of a property damage accident <em>(see </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 600 [1] [a]), while defendant, a city bus driver whose employment was in jeopardy, was facing four counts of driving while intoxicated. There is no indication from either the content of Hunt\u2019s statement or the investigator\u2019s testimony that Hunt was even remotely concerned about the penal consequences of her statement. It is this \u201ccontemporaneousness\u201d factor that renders a declaration against penal interest reliable. The trial court deemed Hunt\u2019s hearsay statement to be unreliable precisely because she was not aware of the penal consequences of her statement when it was made. In my view, there was no basis for the Appellate Division, which deemed this particular factor \u201cmore problematic\u201d than the others (113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>AD3d 153, 160 [1st Dept 2013]), to disturb the trial court\u2019s determination that Hunt\u2019s statement did not meet the contemporaneousness requirement.</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-5\">Judges Rivera, Abdus-Salaam, Stein and Fahey concur; Judge Pigott dissents in an opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> This is what the dissent at the Appellate Division determined (113 AD3d 153, 163 [1st Dept 2013, Clark, J., dissenting]), as do I.
