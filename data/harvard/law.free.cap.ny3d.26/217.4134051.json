A trial court has no \u201cdiscretion\u201d to unilaterally construe an inherently ambiguous jury note as \u201cministerial\u201d without according the defendant his fundamental constitutional rights to notice, presence, and the opportunity to be heard. <em>(People v Walston, </em>23 NY3d 986; <em>People v O\u2019Rama, </em>78 NY2d 270; <em>Rogers v United States, </em>422 US 35; <em>Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97; <em>People v Kisoon, 8 </em>NY3d 129; <em>People v Harris, </em>76 NY2d 810; <em>People v Ochoa, </em>14 NY3d 180; <em>People v Lykes, </em>81 NY2d 767.)

Defendant\u2019s claim that automatic reversal was required for the failure to provide adequate notice of the jury\u2019s fourth note fails both because the note constituted a ministerial request not requiring notice and because the court in any event disclosed the entire contents of the note in time for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>error to be cured. <em>(People v O\u2019Rama, </em>78 NY2d 270; <em>People v Damiano, 87 </em>NY2d 477; <em>People v Ochoa, </em>14 NY3d 180; <em>People v Lykes, </em>81 NY2d 767; <em>People v Kadarko, </em>14 NY3d 426; <em>People v Collins, </em>99 NY2d 14; <em>People v Jackson, </em>105 AD3d 607; <em>People v Green, </em>82 AD3d 593; <em>People v Griffin, </em>241 AD2d 501; <em>People v Davis, </em>260 AD2d 726.)

Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in taking such actions, necessitating reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Based on his alleged shooting of Wayne Peacock and Darion Brown, which resulted in Brown\u2019s death, defendant Rhian Taylor was indicted and tried on charges of murder in the second degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]), attempted murder in the second degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00; 125.25 [1]), assault in the first degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 120.10 [1]), assault in the second degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 120.05), reckless endangerment in the first degree <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 120.25) and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (see Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 [1] [b]; [3]). According to the People\u2019s proof at trial, the shooting occurred during a dispute outside the location of a party in Queens.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Specifically, on the night of August 10, 2007, Brown drove Peacock, as well as their friends Seprel Turner and Anthony Hilton, to the site of the festivities. Upon their arrival and while they remained in the car, Brown tried to flirt with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>friend of Hilton\u2019s, despite Hilton\u2019s admonition not to do so. A man, whom Turner and Hilton later identified as defendant, purportedly took offense at Brown\u2019s actions and shot into the car, striking Brown repeatedly in the torso. One shot also hit Peacock, who immediately woke from a nap in the passenger seat and hence did not see the shooter\u2019s face. Brown frantically drove away but soon hit a nearby pole, and he was knocked unconscious. Peacock, Turner and Hilton scattered. Turner and Hilton then met up at Turner\u2019s house. About 10 minutes later, Hilton and Turner returned to the scene of the shooting, and although the police had already arrived, the men did not speak to the officers. The officers retrieved Brown from the car, and he was rushed to the hospital, where he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Within a couple of days, Peacock led the police to Turner, who was shown a photo array and identified defendant as the shooter. Acting on this identification, the police searched for defendant, who eventually surrendered. On August 14, Turner identified defendant in a lineup. Meanwhile, Hilton learned that the police were looking for him, and he decided to speak to them; in Hilton\u2019s telling, \u201c[b]ecause they w[ere] riding around [the] neighborhood with [his] picture\u201d and he was \u201cgoing to court for a case,\u201d he \u201cfelt [he] needed to take care of it.\u201d Hilton informed the police of his observations of the crime, and he identified defendant in a photo array as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Months later, in 2008, Hilton was arrested on unrelated charges. Because Hilton was already on probation in connection with another criminal matter, he was charged with violating his probation. When Hilton appeared in court to answer the specifications of a probation violation, the prosecutor who handled the instant case also attended that court appearance and requested that no bail be set in Hilton\u2019s case. In August 2009, Hilton pleaded guilty to the violation without any negotiated plea. The court returned Hilton to a five-year term of probation. While he continued serving his probation term, Hilton shoplifted a scarf from a store, leading to his arrest and eventual conviction on a charge of criminal possession of stolen property. Hilton also had prior convictions for menacing and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">As for Turner, over a year after the shooting, in late 2009, he was arrested for unlawfully possessing a weapon. Thereafter, the People and Turner negotiated a plea agreement, under which Turner would plead guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, a felony, and to criminal posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>sion of a weapon in the fourth degree, a misdemeanor, and if he testified truthfully at defendant\u2019s trial, the felony charge would be dismissed and Turner could replead to the misdemeanor charge, resulting in a purely probationary sentence. On February 25, 2010, Turner pleaded guilty to the aforementioned charges and executed a written cooperation agreement memorializing the bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">At trial, Turner acknowledged that he would obtain other benefits as a natural consequence of the deal. For example, by receiving only a misdemeanor conviction, he could not be sentenced as a second felony offender on any future crime that he might commit. And, Turner, who was pursuing a career as a rap artist, would avoid incarceration, thereby ensuring that he would not jeopardize his recently signed contract with a record label due to imprisonment. As previously noted, Turner and Hilton were the only witnesses who identified defendant as the man who shot Brown and Peacock.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">After the presentation of proof of the foregoing facts at trial, the parties presented their summation arguments. In his summation, defense counsel argued that Hilton and Turner had been motivated to testify falsely against defendant, and in addition to the People\u2019s written cooperation agreement with Turner, counsel cited Turner\u2019s testimony about the additional benefits he would naturally receive from his plea and Hilton\u2019s testimony about the People\u2019s intervention at his probation hearing as proof of the witnesses\u2019 bias in favor of the People. Counsel also argued that Hilton had a motive to kill Brown out of jealousy over Brown\u2019s flirtation with Hilton\u2019s friend, and counsel denounced Turner and Hilton as untrustworthy criminals whose testimony should be discounted. In her summation, the prosecutor countered that the only material benefits which Turner had received were those set forth in the cooperation agreement, and she insisted that the People\u2019s advocacy for Hilton\u2019s release without bail in his case did not give Hilton a motive to testify favorably to the People in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Prior to the start of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the parties agreed that the court could submit any exhibits in evidence to the jury upon request without having to reconvene the parties and the jury in open court. The next day, the deliberations commenced, and before any proceedings occurred in open court, the jury issued three notes. The first note said, \u201cWe would like to see all the People\u2019s exhibits of the car inside, outside, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the scene in evidence collected.\u201d The second note said, \u201cWe would like to see two photo arrays. We would also like a sketch of the scene.\u201d The third note stated, \u201cWe would like a readback of Anthony Hilton\u2019s testimony and S. Turner\u2019s testimony with regard to their stories about being in the car prior to and up to just after the shooting.\u201d When proceedings resumed on the record, the court read the three notes to the parties and explained that the first two had already been \u201ccomplied with pursuant to [the parties\u2019] agreement.\u201d With respect to the third note requesting a readback of Hilton\u2019s and Turner\u2019s testimony, the court announced that it was ready to respond with the read-back. The parties did not object to the court\u2019s responses to the notes, either as previously delivered or proposed, and the court had the testimony requested in the third note read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The next day, prior to the start of proceedings on the record, the jury issued its fourth and fifth notes. The fourth note declared, \u201c[W]e would like to see the benefits offered to Mr. Hilton and Mr. Turner, please.\u201d The fifth note stated, \u201cWe would like to have definition of reasonable doubt.\u201d In response to the fourth note asking to see the benefits offered to the witnesses, the court sent the jurors the written cooperation agreement between the People and Turner, without consulting the parties. Thereafter, on the record, the court allowed the parties to inspect the two notes, and it read the contents of the notes aloud.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Defense counsel objected to the court\u2019s response to the fourth note. Counsel essentially asserted that the response was incomplete without a readback of Turner\u2019s and Hilton\u2019s testimony about the benefits they had received outside the context of the written cooperation agreement, such as the career-related and sentencing benefits to Turner and the pretrial release obtained by Hilton in his probation matter. The court replied that the jurors \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for that\u201d and had \u201cgotten the agreement,\u201d adding, \u201cIf they want anything more I\u2019ll be there to listen.\u201d When the court returned the jurors to the courtroom, it said, \u201cI believe we sent in to you the cooperation agreement with Mr. Turner. That\u2019s what is in evidence.\u201d Next, the court proceeded to answer the fifth note, stated, \u201cWe will be here if you need anything,\u201d and sent the jurors back to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Outside the presence of the jury, the court told defense counsel that its comments had accurately indicated to the jurors that they had received only an agreement between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>People and Turner in response to their request and that they could ask for additional materials if they so desired. Referring to the court\u2019s statement to the jury about \u201cwhat [was] in evidence,\u201d counsel responded by suggesting that this statement had been inaccurate because the written cooperation agreement did not represent the entirety of the evidence of the witnesses\u2019 benefits. Counsel reiterated his belief that the jurors had wanted to receive all evidence of benefits conferred upon both witnesses, including the testimony about the benefits not memorialized in the cooperation agreement. The court rejected counsel\u2019s arguments, deciding that the jurors\u2019 use of the term \u201csee\u201d in the fourth note revealed their desire to receive only evidence that could be visually inspected, i.e., the written cooperation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Following the contested fourth note, deliberations continued for just over two more days, and the jury issued, and the court answered, several more notes, including one stating that the jury was deadlocked. Finally, on the fifth day of deliberations, the jury rendered a verdict convicting defendant of second-degree murder, second-degree assault, two counts of second-degree weapons possession and first-degree reckless endangerment. After post-verdict proceedings not relevant to the disposition of this appeal, the court sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of 20 years to life, to be followed by five years of postrelease supervision, and defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions <em>(see People v </em>Taylor, 120 AD3d 842, 842-843 [2d Dept 2014]). As relevant here, the Appellate Division rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court had improperly responded to the fourth jury note by failing to read back Turner\u2019s and Hilton\u2019s testimony about the benefits they received in other cases based on their aid to the People in defendant\u2019s case <em>(see id. </em>at 842-843). Essentially adopting the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the Appellate Division declared,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cWhile it may have been preferable for the court to seek further clarification from the jury with respect to its request to \u2018see the benefits,\u2019 the wording of the subject jury note, particularly when read in conjunction with several other notes, demonstrated that the jury was requesting only the physical exhibit,\u201d and therefore the court\u2019s \u201cresponse did not fall outside the acceptable bounds of its discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and thus satisfied the requirement of CPL 310.30\u201d <em>{id. </em>[citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal, and we now reverse (24 NY3d 1089 [2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">CPL 310.30 provides that, \u201c[u]pon such a request\u201d for evidence or legal instruction from a deliberating jury, \u201cthe court must direct that the jury be returned to the courtroom and, after notice to both the people and counsel for the defendant, and in the presence of the defendant, must give such requested information or instruction as the court deems proper.\u201d Similarly, absent a withdrawal of the jury\u2019s inquiry or similar circumstances, common-law principles of procedural fairness generally require the court to furnish the jury with information requested during its deliberations, and the court has significant discretion in determining the proper scope and nature of the response <em>(see People v Gonzalez, </em>293 NY 259, 262-263 [1944] [\u201cThe general rule in the United States is that \u2018the court may and ordinarily should give the jurors additional instructions on their request\u2019 \u201d], quoting 23 CJS, Criminal Law \u00a7 1376 [c] at 1046 [1940]; <em>see also People v Malloy, </em>55 NY2d 296, 302-303 [1982]). Thus, regardless of whether the issue is framed under CPL 310.30 or common-law rules governing jury deliberations, where, as here, the defendant has preserved for our review a specific objection to the contents of the trial court\u2019s response to a jury note, we must determine whether the trial court acted within the bounds of its discretion in fashioning an answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry <em>(see Malloy, </em>55 NY2d at 302; <em>see also People v Cooke, </em>292 NY 185, 188 [1944] [noting that, under a pre-CPL 310.30 statute, which reflected to some extent the common law, not every refusal to answer the jury in a particular manner constituted reversible error]). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion and committed reversible error, \u201c[t]he factors to be evaluated are the form of the jury\u2019s question, which may have to be clarified before it can be answered, the particular issue of which inquiry is made, the [information] actually given and the presence or absence of prejudice to the defendant\u201d <em>(Malloy, </em>55 NY2d at 302; <em>see People v Steinberg, </em>79 NY2d 673, 684 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In this case, an evaluation of those factors demonstrates that the trial court abused its discretion by declining to provide the jurors with information that they plainly wanted and incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>rectly characterizing the state of the evidence on the subject of their inquiry. In that regard, the form of the jury\u2019s request in the fourth note showed that the jury wished to review all evidence of the benefits which Hilton and Turner acquired as a result of their assistance in the prosecution of defendant. Because the jurors asked to see the benefits offered to \u201cMr. Hilton <em>and </em>Mr. Turner\u201d (emphasis added), the form of their inquiry reflected their desire to examine the evidence of benefits conferred upon both witnesses, and that evidence necessarily included both the written cooperation agreement between the People and Turner and the witnesses\u2019 testimony about the advantages of their cooperation with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s supposition, the jury could not have desired exclusively to receive the written cooperation agreement, as that agreement did not provide any benefits to Hilton and simply memorialized a portion of the benefits received by Turner. Given the jury\u2019s entreaty for all proof of Turner\u2019s and Hilton\u2019s gains related to their assistance in the prosecution of defendant, the court should have supplied the jurors not only with the cooperation agreement, but also with: Turner\u2019s testimony that the cooperation agreement\u2019s provision for a non-prison sentence enabled him to keep a potentially lucrative recording deal; his testimony that his plea to a misdemeanor allowed him to avoid receiving a predicate felony offender adjudication on any future conviction; and Hilton\u2019s testimony that the trial prosecutor in defendant\u2019s case spared him from having to post bail in his probation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Although, as the trial court noted, the jurors\u2019 expressed wish \u201cto see\u201d the pertinent evidence might have implied a desire solely to view an exhibit, this single phrase did not undermine the note\u2019s otherwise clear request for the entirety of the evidence of benefits conferred upon Turner and Hilton, especially in light of the context in which the note was issued. Notably, in their summations, both parties disputed the extent to which the written cooperation agreement <em>and </em>the witnesses\u2019 testimony on the subject of benefits reflected the witnesses\u2019 motives to testify in favor of the People, thereby drawing the jurors\u2019 attention to all of that evidence in a manner that would naturally prompt them to request that proof in its entirety. More importantly, prior to the issuance of the fourth note, the jurors had expressed their desire to visually inspect physical exhibits by specifically referring to particular physical objects, such as \u201cphoto arrays,\u201d \u201csketches]\u201d or \u201cexhibits,\u201d and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>had the jurors wanted to receive only the written cooperation agreement in reply to their fourth note, they presumably would have asked to see \u201cthe agreement\u201d or \u201cthe exhibit\u201d setting forth the benefits to Turner. Instead, the jurors framed their request in terms of evidence of \u201cthe benefits\u201d offered to the witnesses, period, without limiting the inquiry to an \u201cexhibit\u201d or physical object. Given the clear meaning of the note in context, the court improperly focused on the phrase \u201cto see\u201d in disregard of the remaining contents of the note and then proceeded to submit only the cooperation agreement to the jurors <em>(cf. People v Lykes, </em>81 NY2d 767, 770 [1993] [approving the trial court\u2019s handling of a jury note in part because the court \u201cdid not limit or channel the jury\u2019s question\u201d]). The court should have at least inquired as to whether the note in fact meant what its terms and the surrounding circumstances overwhelmingly suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In addition, since the issue about which the jury inquired, namely the People\u2019s favorable treatment of Turner and Hilton, was essential to the jury\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of the sole witnesses to identify defendant as Brown\u2019s killer and Peacock\u2019s assailant, the court\u2019s inadequate response to the jury\u2019s query on that central issue further reflected the court\u2019s abuse of its discretion. Given the lack of any other testimony or physical evidence that defendant was the shooter,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Hilton\u2019s and Turner\u2019s credibility became the key issue at trial, and in light of the witnesses\u2019 respective criminal pasts, the truthfulness of their testimony was subject to serious dispute, calling for particular care in fashioning a fair and complete response to the jurors\u2019 inquiry into the matter. In addition to the written cooperation agreement, the other evidence sought by the jurors had an especially strong bearing on the witnesses\u2019 credibility. Indeed, because the requested testimony showed that the trial prosecutor had helped Hilton to win pretrial release in another case, this testimony suggested that Hilton had a motive to testify falsely in favor of the prosecution at defendant\u2019s trial out of gratitude for the prosecutor\u2019s aid. Likewise, Turner\u2019s testimony that his cooperation with the People enabled him to avoid imprisonment, prevent future adverse sentencing adjudications and continue making a living showed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>had a motive to give false testimony against defendant in order to reap those rewards. That being so, the court abused its discretion by withholding a highly significant portion of what the jury had asked for regarding an essential issue at trial (see <em>generally People v Lourido, </em>70 NY2d 428, 435 [1987]; <em>cf. People v </em>Mercado, 91 NY2d 960, 963 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Moreover, after the court failed to supply the jurors with the full extent of the requested evidence, the court made comments suggesting that the remainder of the sought-after proof did not exist, and the combination of the court\u2019s failure to give the jury necessary information and its inaccurate follow-up remarks prejudiced the defense. Specifically, when the court told the jurors that the written cooperation agreement between the People and Turner was \u201cwhat [was] in evidence\u201d in relation to their note, the court incorrectly indicated that there was no evidence, other than the agreement, regarding benefits received by Hilton and Turner, even though testimony about such benefits did in fact exist. Based on this statement, the jurors may have erroneously believed that either their recollection of the existence of such evidence was faulty or the testimony they had sought was irrevelant, prompting them to cease their inquiry into this important evidence based on false assumptions. Since the People\u2019s proof of defendant\u2019s identity as the shooter was less than overwhelming and the court\u2019s response to the note seriously inadequate, the court abused its discretion as a matter of law, and reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we do not signal any erosion of a trial court\u2019s discretion in answering jury notes. In acting within the bounds of discretion delineated by <em>People v Malloy </em>(55 NY2d 296) and similar cases, a trial court retains leeway to shape its response to the jurors\u2019 inquiry based on the record as a whole and the applicable law, and if the court entertains some doubt as to the meaning of a jury note, it can and should seek clarification from the jury <em>(see Lykes, </em>81 NY2d at 769-770). Additionally, if some of the circumstances here were to arise in isolation in other cases, they might not support the conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in answering a note, for no single factor is dispositive. Thus, we go no further than to hold that, under the totality of the circumstances in this case, the trial court abused its discretion as a matter of law by failing to adequately answer the jurors\u2019 fourth note and creating a false impression of the nature of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Because defendant\u2019s challenge to the substance of the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s fourth note mandates reversal of his convictions, we need not decide whether the court committed a mode of proceedings error by revealing the contents of the fourth note to the parties only after it had sent the cooperation agreement to the jury, and we express no opinion on that matter. For the same reason, we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> Although defendant\u2019s DNA was found on a cigarette filter near several shell casings at the scene of the shooting, this evidence showed that defendant was in close proximity to the shooting and not that he was necessarily the shooter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b330-6\">Rivera, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL6\">(concurring). I concur in the result only, and agree with the majority that defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed, but on different grounds. Moreover, because I find the majority\u2019s analysis an unnecessary and overly broad reading of our case law on the proper handling of jury requests, I decline to join its interpretation of the legal requirements set by this Court in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>People v O\u2019Rama </em>(78 NY2d 270, 276-277 [1991]), this Court held that CPL 310.30 imposes on a court the duty to notify counsel of a substantive juror inquiry, and the duty to meaningfully respond to the jury. In accordance with our interpretation of CPL 310.30, an utter failure to respond cannot be termed \u201cmeaningful\u201d in any sense of the word <em>(see People v Lourido, </em>70 NY2d 428, 435 [1987]). Furthermore, we recently reaffirmed in <em>People v Walston </em>(23 NY3d 986, 989 [2014]) that fulfillment of these duties is a core responsibility of the trial court. Thus, the court\u2019s failure to fulfil these responsibilities constitutes a mode of proceedings error, which does not require preservation <em>(id.; People v Alcide, </em>21 NY3d 687, 692 [2013] [a mode of proceedings error will result where a judge fails to afford meaningful response to the jury]). This error also requires reversal and a new trial <em>(People v Roberites, </em>115 AD3d 1291, 1293 [2014] [court\u2019s failure to provide notice to counsel constituted a mode of proceedings error which requires reversal and a new trial]).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">As the majority correctly describes, the jury note expressed the jurors\u2019 desire to review the evidence of the benefits accorded to Anthony Hilton and Seprel Turner, which obliged the court to provide evidence relating to both witnesses.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, the court failed to provide any information at all regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>benefits granted to Hilton, notwithstanding the existence of testimony in the record readily available to address such a request. Thus, on the facts of this case, the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request to review information relating to Hilton was no response at all, and as such constituted a mode of proceedings error under our <em>O\u2019Rama </em>jurisprudence. That error requires reversal and, therefore, there is no need to consider, as the majority does, whether Supreme Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-4\">Judges Pigott, Stein and Fahey concur; Judge Rivera concurs in result in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Order reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\"> The fact that the inquiries were included in one jury note is irrevelant for purposes of the analysis because a court\u2019s duty to provide a meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>response for each, request remains unchanged, and a complete failure to reply to any inquiry is error (see <em>People v Stocks, </em>101 AD3d 1049, 1051 [2d Dept 2012] [finding <em>O\u2019Rama </em>violation where court failed to provide defense counsel with notice of jury note, which contained, in part, a substantive request]; see <em>also People v Brown, </em>125 AD3d 1550 [4th Dept 2015] [treating one note with multiple requests as separate inquiries and finding no <em>O\u2019Rama </em>violation where defense counsel participated in the formulation of a response to the factual inquiries, and did not preserve for review the court\u2019s response to the part of the note concerning the readback of testimony]; <em>People v Jackson, </em>105 AD3d 607 [1st Dept 2013] [finding no violation but analyzing different parts of one note separately]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
