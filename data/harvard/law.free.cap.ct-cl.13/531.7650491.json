The first retries from the advertisement and accepted proposals, on which it is </em>founded, <em>in containing an indemnity clause \u20181 </em>to protect the contractor while engaged in the fulfillment of this contract.\u201d <em>The second is founded on a military emergency, but is made July </em>17, <em>for hay deliverable at any time from August </em>10 <em>to September </em>25. <em>The contractor is not protected in the fulfillment of the contract. The accounting officers of the Treasury allow him the contract price for hay delivered \u00a1\u00a1also his losses and expenses per ton on hay cut, but destroyed by the public enemy before delivery ; also for his teams captured and destroyed. But having no jurisdiction of claims for unliquidated damages, they refuse to allow him the profits which he might have made if protected in the fulfillment of the contract. He brings his action to recover them. The defendants allege that both contracts were void, and set up a counter-claim to recover bach the moneys allowed by the accounting officers of the Treasury for hay destroyed by the-public enemy and for horses $-c., captured.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-14\">The court kelow holds: (1) That the gratuitous insertion of the indemnity clause in the first contract was void under the <em>Advertisement Act \u2018id March, </em>1861 (12 Stat. L., p. 220, \u00a7 10); (2) That the second contract made witli- ' out advertisement was valid under the <em>Act </em>4#7i <em>July, </em>1864 (13 Stat, L., p. 394, \u00a7 4); (3) That the clause 'to protect thejeontractor in the fulfillment of the contract was of the nature of a contract of indemnity or insurance as to a war risk, which one party or the other must assume, and valid; (4) That the claimant might recover under the indemnity or insurance clause tin; profits which he would have made if duly pro'ected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>in tlie fulfillment of liis contract; (5) That the defendants might recover hack tlie allowances made under the contract now declared void for hay destroyed, horses captured, &amp;e. Judgment for the claimant on tlie second contract and for tlie defendants on the first. Both parties appeal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">Both judgments of the court below are reversed. The Supreme Court holds: (1) That tlie contracts were for the sale and delivery of hay, and not for work and <em>service; </em>(2) That tlie indemnity clause was an obligation to protect the contractor\u2019s person and property while performing, and that the failure to afford such protection renders the defendants Hablo for the value of the property actually lost for the want of it, but not as insurers against loss for the profits which the contractor might have made if enabled to perform; (3) That the approval of the Quartermaster-Gen\u2022eral and action of the accounting officers amounted to a ratification of the indemnity clause, which an assistant quartermaster may not have had authority to make.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\"><em>The Reporters\u2019 </em>statement of tlie case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">It will be observed tliat tlie Supreme Court does not pass upon the principal questions discussed in tlie court below, viz, whether tlie contracts were void tui dor tire advertisement acts; whether an action will lie to recover back money allowed to a contractor by the accounting officers of the Treasury, &amp;c. The court treats both contracts as valid, and discusses merely the true construction to be given to them. Tlie findings of fact on which the Supreme Court adjudged the case are fully set forth in the report of the case in 12 Court Claims lieport, 504. Tlie following-are the contracts on which the suit was brought.

When immediate delivery or performance is required by the public exigency, the articles or service required may be procured by open purchase or contract, at the places and in the manner in which such articles are usually bought and sold or such services engaged between individuals.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">The contract in question here was made after but not pursuant to the advertisement. Neither the quartermaster nor the contractor was compelled to adhere to the advertisement or to the proposal. Either could, and both evidently did, change their minds. The contract is the only evidence of the final agreement \u25a0of the parties, and both the advertisement and the proposal were merged in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">There had been no informal contract. There had been no \u2022contract whatever till the paper under notice was completely signed. Till then, it is quit\u00e9 clear, no one was bound. Indeed, the advertisement had expressly warned the bidders that it was not itself to be taken as a proposal, the acceptance of which, Avith the acceptance of a counter-proposal, would constitute a contract; for the advertisement said: \u201cThe right is reserved to reject, any and all bids, as the interests of the service may require.\u201d But no such reservation was necessary. Had there been no reserA'ation, the officer Avould still ha\\re been en tirely unbound. But if he AAras not bound, Iioav could McKee be bound before a mutual agreement had been arrived at, reduced to writing, and signed by the parties to it? The law required that the contract-should be reduced t\u00f3 AAuiting and signed by the contracting-parties. (ReA\". Stat., p. 743, \u00a7 3744.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\">The true reading of the statute, so far as it here requires construction, makes it mean that the contracts or purchases shall be made after adArertisement, the word \u201cby\u201d here denoting no more than after. (See <em>Speed\u2019s Case, </em>8 Wallace, 77.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-9\">This court, in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Runnels </em>(12 How., 7!)), well holds that, before the rule that a contract in Adolation of a statute is therefore invalid can have application to a statute that does not declare that such shall be the legal consequence of violation, the enactment as a whole must be examined, so as to discover whether or not the legislature meant that a contract out of harmony with it is on that account to be held AToid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We refer also to <em>Bivnh U. 8. </em>v. <em>Bandridge </em>(12 Wheat., 64); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ocm-oll </em>(22 How., 422); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Green </em>(6 Man. &amp; Or., 872, 890); <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Osgood </em>(8 Yt., 279); <em>Pease </em>v. <em>Morriee-</em>(2 Ad. &amp; EL, 96); <em>Bladen </em>v. <em>Philadelphia </em>(60 Penn. St., 466).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">The opinion in this case in the court below says: \u201cThe contract was in form a contract of sale and delivery, but in substance a contract for wort and service. When I employ a man to go upon my land and cut and delivermy hay at so much per ton, the property remains in me, whatever be the form of the agreement, and what I pay him is not for his property in the hay, but for the labor which he has expended upon it. Here the hay indisputably was to be cut upon the public domain, and the property in it was and remained in the defendants. But the point need not be discussed, for it was considered in <em>8peneer,s Case </em>(10 O. Gis. B., 255), and expressly so decided. If the defendants\u2019 officers had arbitrarily refused to furnish a guard, clearly the contractor would have been relieved from his obligation to perform.\u201d- <em>(Porter\u2019s Case, </em>9 C. Cls. B., 356.) In this case, the property in the grass out by McKee was expressly reserved by the United States by article 3 of the- Cherokee treaty of December 29,1835. (Stat L., vol. 7, i&gt;. 478.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">Consideration of the contract dated July 18, 1864, involves-construction of the Act of July 4, 1864, in which we have these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-8\">\u201cWhen an emergency shall exist requiring the immediate procurement of supplies for the necessary movements and opera-tians of any army or detachment, and when such supplies cannot be procured from any established depot of the Quartermaster\u2019s Department, or from the head of the division charged with the duty of furnishing such supplies, within the required time, then it shall be lawful for the commanding officer of such army or detachment to order the chief quartermaster of such army or detachment to procure such supplies during the continuance of such emergency, but no longer, in the most expeditious manner, and without advertisement; and it shall be the duty of such quartermaster to obey such order, and his accounts of the disbursements of moneys for such supplies shall be accompanied by the order of the commanding officer, as aforesaid, or a certified copy of the same, and also by a statement of the particular facts and circumstances, with their dates, constituting such emergency.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-9\">We maintain that the fact that it was not till the 30th of July,. 1864, that Quartermaster-G-eneral Meigs (see General Orders,. No. 30) promulgated the act of Congress here referred- to, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>general orders, for tbe information of tbe officers and agents of tbe Quartermaster\u2019s Department, is a matter to be judicially noticed by tbe court, because it is a matter of pubbe bistory. It is also matter of public bistory tbat tbe organization contemplated by tbe affieady-cited provisions of said statute was not made till tbe following December. (See General Orders, No. 62, dated December 23,1864.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">Section 3 provides for tbe establishment of depots from time to time at places convenient to tbe principal armies in tbe field, but allows tbe Quartermaster-General or tbe beads of divisions to cause supplies to be sent from tbe place of purchase directly to tbe quartermasters of tbe commands for whose use tbe supplies are. procured, where it may be more, economical or advantageous to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">Where supplies are not, so furnished, and when they cannot be procured from any established depot of tbe Quartermaster\u2019s Department or from tbe bead of tbe divisions charged with tbe duty of furnishing them, within tbe time required by an emergency, as contemplated by clause first of section 4, tbe power of tbe commanding general is called into exercise. Tbe findings clearly show tbat this must have happened in tbe case of tbe contract here in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-8\">Tbat tbe action of tbe commanding general was, in point of fact, such as tbe law sanctioned, and tbat tbe subordinate action of Captain Durbin was, in point of fact, such as the law authorized, is, we think, sufficiently set forth in tbe opinion of tbe court, below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-9\">Wo refer, however, to tbe case of <em>Motory </em>v. <em>V. </em>\u25a08. (2 C. Cls. K., 68); in which tbe court said: \u201cA contract to construct 100 railroad cars, 50 to be delivered in 18 days and 50 in 30 days, is an immediate performance within tbe. meaning of tbe act.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-10\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney-General Smith fox </em>tbe United States on cross-appeal:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-11\">Tbe petitioner\u2019s first claim was for damages ari sin g from tbe failure of tbe Government to fully protect 1dm and bis subcontractors in tbe fulfillment of bis first contract, dated June 20,1864, whereby be lost the profits thereof and certain property employed in performing tbe work. Had the quartermaster tbe right to insert, this stipulation for sufficient escort and guards into this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>particular contract? It was made after due advertisement and the reception of proposals; therefore it is based upon them, and its terms are limited by them so far as these things impose limitations upon tiie contents of any contract. If they do not form part of the final contract, they determine what it is that is to be contracted for; and any substantial and vital variation will be the execution of a different contract from that suggested by the advertisement, and for which the bidders sent in their proposals. To malee such a change in favor of the contractor would be unjust toward his competitors, whose bids were based upon the theory of a strict compliance with the advertised terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-4\">The advertisement, proposals, and their acceptance substantially make up the contract which is to be subsequently formally written out and executed. How important the variation was in the present instance is perceived by noting that it constitutes the whole ground of the claim under this first contract. The advertisement offered only such protection as the interests of the public service would permit; the contract stipulated for absolute security; and the failure to afford it arose from the necessities of the public service. Other bidders understood they must take their chances of hostile interference; Mr. McKee is promised complete immunity from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-5\">If the clause which is the basis of his claim was improperly inserted, of course the United States have a right to a refund \u2022of its moneys paid to the claimant without any authority of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-6\">The second contract was entered into, without any previous advertisement, upon the 18th of July, 1804, a fortnight after the passage of tlie.Mci <em>of July </em>4, 1864, c. 394, c. 253, 13 Stats., 394 <em>\u25a0el seq.; </em>see p. 396, \u00a7 4.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-7\">It will be noticed, by referring to this section, that the \u201cemergency\u201d which is to justify the omission to advertise must be one \u201crequiring the immediate procurement of supplies for the necessary movements and operations of an army or detachment,\u201d &amp;c., and not simply for its future support in fort, garrison, or quarters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-8\">That no such emergency existed, requiring the adoption of the course pursued in this case, is evident from the period of time to be covered by the contract and for its general tenor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-9\">Therefore the contract was illegal and invalid, and all sums paid under it, for matters from .which the Government derived no benefit, may be reclaimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The payments made to him by the Treasury Department were not upon any such accounts as its officers a.re authorized finally to adjust. They profess to be for damages, but they cannot be called liquidated damages, because the claimant does not acquiesce in the liquidation, but sues for and recovers more in this action. The items are not those which could be filed in set-off in a suit in court. (St. <em>Louis Ins. Go. </em>v. Homer, 9 Met., 42.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-6\">\u201cBalance of account,\u201d as used in the act conferring jurisdiction upon the county courts, is thus defined by Pollock, C. B.: \u201cThe term \u2018balance of account\u2019 means after payment of part, or after allowance of set-off, as an item in account with the agreement of the parties, which is equivalent to payment of part, and not when the plaintiff claims more than twenty pounds after a simple set-off.\u201d <em>(Avarcls </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>8 Exch., 316.) It shows that the power to determine and act upon a balance of account is confined to items strictly of account, and not to sums stated as liquidation of damages for torts or breaches of contract. <em>(Woodluans v.Heicman, </em>7 O.

The delivery in the one contract to be at Fort Clibson and within seven miles of that fort, and the other at Cabin Creek and Hudson\u2019s Crossing of the Neosho Elver. The locality Avas the Indian country, south of Kansas and west of Arkansas, which was the theater of hostilities. Each contract contained the. following provision, Avliich is the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s claim against the United States uoav under consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">\u201c It is expressly understood by the contracting parties hereto that sufficient guards and escorts shall be furnished by the Government to protect the contractor Avlxilc engaged in the fulfillment of this contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">A large part of the contract was fulfilled by delivery of the hay, and for that McKee was paid. A considerable amount of hay cut and not delivered was destroyed by the enemy, and tor that he was paid. He lost in Avagons, horses, and other personal property, by the attacks of the enemy, over $15,000, and for that he aauis paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In addition to tliis he claims now, and was allowed by the Court of Claims, as profits on the contract for hay never delivered or even cut, $29,559. From this judgment the United States appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The United States made in the court below a claim of set-off for $34,713 wrongfully paid to McKee for his hay destroyed and abandoned before delivery and for his property lost and destroyed while used in the operation of making and delivering-the hay. Of this the Court of Claims allowed the sum of $12,600 j and from this part of the judgment McKee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The opinion of the majority of the Court of Claims, which wre find in the record, goes upon the ground that the soil upon which the hay was to be cut wras the property of the United States, and that the contract was in legal effect, on the part of McKee, to do for a specified compensation the work which was necessary to convert the grass of the United States into hay and for its delivery as required. That this compensation was not for the purchase of the hay from McKee, but for his labor and services expended on the property of the United States. The deduction is made from this proposition that inasmuch as he was ready and willing at all proper times to render these services and perform the labor, and wras prevented by the failure of the United States to give him the necessary protection, he is entitled to recover all that he would have made out of the contract if he had fully performed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We do not see on what foundation it is held that the grass was the property of the United States. The court expressly find that the whole transaction was in the Indian Territory, south of Kansas and west of Arkansas. We know' that this is country set apart for the use of the Cherokee, Olioctawq Chickasaw, and other Indian tribes by treaties, those tribes having been removed there from other localities. We suppose that the possession and usufruct of this land is in the Indians. But if this were otherwise, and it was surveyed and unsold public land, there is nothing in the contract to show that any importance was attached to this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The contract was for the delivery of so many tons of hay. It wras expressly provided that it might be timothy hay or prairie hay. I-Iad the United States any timothy meadows in which these men were to make hay? If they could have bought the hay from another party and delivered it, would they not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>fulfilled their contract.? It was clearly a contract for <em>the sale and delivery of hay </em>aud not for cutting grass and hauling it into the fort.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">What, then, was the obligation assumed by the Government in agreeing to furnish sufficient guards and escorts to protect the contractor while engaged in the fulfillment of the contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The literal terms of the agreement would be satisfied by such a guard as would secure his personal safety, and if such a construction had been insisted on by the Government from the beginning, it would not be void of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The construction which the Government has put upon it, namely, that it is an obligation to protect his person and property while engaged in the effort to perform the contract, and that the failure to afford such protection renders the United States responsible for the value of the property actually lost for want of it, and which would include, perhaps, personal injuries, if any had been sustained, seems to us to be the true one. It was all the contractor could reasonably ask. It is doubtful whether the contracting officer had authority to promise so much. But to this extent the accounting officers of the Government and the Quartermaster-General have ratified and confirmed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">But we can see nothing in the provision itself, nor in the other parts of tlie agreement, nor in the nature of the circumstances under which it was made, to justify the conclusion that the Government was bound as an insurer against all loss from hostile forces, not only arising from destruction of property, but from loss of speculative profits on grass that was never cut and hay that was never made or delivered or owned by the contractor, and for work that was never done.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Let us suppose that such had been the prevailing force of the enemy that the soldiers could only hold the fort and do no more, and such the danger outside that the contractor did not dare to cut a ton of hay, could he, by demanding an additional regiment to protect him and saying I am ready to make the hay if you will keep off the enemy, make a speculative calculation of the profits he would have made if his demand had been complied with, and recover that sum, though he had never done anything more?</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">If the United States was bound by the contract to furnish full protection, and if the measure of damages was these profits, the question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>But, as we have already said, we are of opinion tli\u00e1^; the true measure of damages was the actual value of the property lost by the contractor, and as the Government recognized and acted on this rule, we do not think McKee is entitled to recover for his supposed profits or that the Government should recover of him what it has paid him for these actual losses. The result of these views is that the judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, with directions to dismiss both the petition of claimant and the counter-claim of the United States; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
