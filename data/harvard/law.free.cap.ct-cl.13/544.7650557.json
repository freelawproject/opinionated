In pursuance of this charter-party, the said steamer went from New York into the waters of North Carolina, where she was employed in the service of the United States, under the orders of the chief quartermaster of the military forces in North Carolina, until some time in February, 1863. She was used in transporting stores and men.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-16\">TTT. In the month of December, 1862, said steamer was at New Berne, on theNeuse Biver, in North Carolina, and by the orders of Quartermaster Slaight, of the United States military forces,, she was required to go, with six other boats, on an expedition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>up that river, which was ordered by General Foster, command-' ing the department. Before starting on this expedition the quartermaster sent lumber on board of her, and caused her deck to be strengthened, under the superintendence of a naval officer, by putting stanchions under it and by sheathing it. The day after tins was done she was ordered alongside of one of the naval artillery boats, and a 30-pound Parrott gun and its carriage, such as are used on naval vessels, together with ammunition for the gun, were put on board of her. At this time a commodore told the captain of the Ocean Wave that the boat was to go up the Neuse Biver, without saying for what purpose. The captain protested against her going up the river, and objected to her being used as a gunboat, and he told the commodore that he supposed she was to be used as a gunboat, and that she was not fit for that sendee, nor fit to bear the heavy piece of artillery she had on her, and that she was hired for another service and this was out of the line of transport service. The commodore said, \u201cYou have to go.\u201d After taking the Parrott gun aboard the Ocean Wave returned to New Berne, and took on board seventeen artillerymen, with their small-arms and provisions for the expedition. Fifty bales of hay and two hundred bags of oats were also put on the boat, which were piled around her pilot-house and engine. She left New Berne to go up the Neuse Biver, and at the time of doing so she was under the control of Colonel Manchester, of the Maine artillery, who commanded the expedition, and remained onboard of her till she got about seven miles above New Berne, when he went on board of the Ellison, the leading boat of the expedition, and a lieutenant from a naval gunboat came on board the Ocean Wave and took command of her. The expedition went up the Neuse Biver about fifty miles without molestation. At that point there was a fort occupied by a rebel force, so situated upon a short bend of the river that, owing to the sharpness of the point and the narrowness of the channel, only one of the boats at a time could get the range of the fort. When the fort was reached two boats where ahead of the Ocean Wave, the Ellison being the first* They reached there between sundown and dark. A shot from the fort struck the Ellison\u2019s smoke-stack, and she returned the fire three times; after which, at dark, she hauled back below the point, where the other boats were. When the morning came it was ascertained that the fort had been evacuated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the river having fallen about twenty inches during the night, and there being only six feet of water in the channel, Colonel Manchester gave orders to back down the river, the Ocean Wave being too long to turn. The Ellison and Port Royal, two Army transports, were put one on each side of the Ocean Wave, nnd the three boats were backed down about three miles to a place in the river where they were turned, and then proceeded head first down the river toward New Berne. About twelve miles above that place a volley of musketry was fired into the Ocean Wave by a large bod3r of rebels on the shore, which caused the manning- of the Parrott gun on her, and by the time it ivas manned another volley was received. Their fire was then returned by the gun on the Ocean Wave, which was fired eleven times in quick succession. After the firing of that gun began the rebels ceased firing. The gun was about even with the rail of the gunwale, and the concussion of its firing swept off the bulwarks and netting in the track of the explosion. In passing a sharp turn in the river the gun was trained a little aft of the beam, aixd the effect of the firing then was to start the joiner-work, and to break in some of the panels of the doors, and to take a part of the rail off'. Just after making that turn in the river the boat struck an overhanging tree, which took off a part of the wheel-house, and swept off both of the flag-staffs, and all the awning-stancliions, and did other damage; after which she, passed on down the river, and was not again fired upon by the rebels, nor were the rebels again seen; but at different points, ns she passed down, her gun was fired to keep the enemy back, if there were any more on the line of the river. On the way down the Ocean Wave was used to pull off a gunboat which had grounded. About three miles above Now Berne it was necessary for the Ocean Wave to pass through a part of the river where there were snags and logs, and her starboard wheel ran over one of them and ivas very much broken, but she proceeded on down about a quarter of a mile, where she ran upon a snag on the port side, Avliioli broke a hole in her bottom about the size of a man\u2019s hat, and caused her to sink there, where she lay till the next day, when, with the help of steam-pumps, which were sent to her from New Berne, after lightening her by taking 'off her a large quantity of baled hay and oats and the gun, she \u2022was pumped out and the hole in her bottom stopped, and she -was taken to New Berne, where she was temporarily repaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>by the Government. Duiing the whole time of that expedition the Ocean Wave was managed by a pilot placed on her by the Government officers, and he belonged in that neighborhood and was familiar with the river, and when the boat struck the snags he had charge of her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">IV. After the Ocean Wave had performed the service set forth in the next preceding finding, she was sent, by order of the quartermaster-general of General Foster\u2019s forces, to Beaufort, N. C., as a rendezvous for an expedition to Hilton Head, S. 0. At that time she was in an impaired condition, not fit for the trip. She was in a condition to be injured by ordinary service; but the exigency of the service demanded that she should make that trip, and her captain did not object to her doing so. She went from New Berne to Beaufort. At Beaufort the quartermaster-general ordered her to take on board ammunition and provisions for General Foster\u2019s expedition to Hilton Head. Her captain told the quartermaster-general that she was not then in a seagoing condition; who replied that he could not spare her, and there was no time to put her in sea-going order. In going from Beaufort to Hilton Head it was necessary to make the outside passage by sea, and the Ocean Wave was not fit to go outside, and was hardly fit to run inside. She, however, went with the expedition, and arrived at Hilton Head, where, on the ICth of February, 1863, she passed under the charge of the chief quartermaster of the Department of the South on the staff of General Hunter. By him she was used in the Government service until March 4,1863, when she was condemned by the Government inspectors, and discharged by the chief quartermaster of General Hunter\u2019s forces, by the following written order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">\u201cChief Q.

In consequence of this discharge the Ocean Wave was taken by her captain back to New York, where she arrived on the 30th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of April ,1803. The great length of time taken to go from Hilton Head to New York was mainly owing-to the bad weather, which required the boat to lie by at different places, and to the necessity for her stopping on the way to take in coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-6\">VI. After her return to New York she was immediately put in hand for repairs, and was generally repaired throughout, at the expense of her owner. The whole amount paid by him for repairs was $5,125.70. The repairs were so far completed on the 9th of June following that she was again put to service by her o wner in the waters of Long Island Sound. During the period of her repairs her master and crew were retained in her service and employed in assisting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-7\">VII. For all the time the Ocean Wave was in the Government service, namely, to the date of her discharge at Port Eoyal, her owner was paid the contract price for her services.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-8\"><em>Mr. Thomas J. Durant </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-9\">It is altogether inconsistent with the terms of this contract that the United States made this transport into a gunboat, armed her with a Parrott gun, sent her on a hostile expedition, and employed her in actual offensive operations, as a war-vessel, against the enemy. <em>{Ciarle!s </em>Case, 9 G. Gis. E., 377.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-10\">During this entire trip the charter-party was set aside, and the United States used the Ocean Wave not as charterers, but as <em>owners; </em>and are liable, therefore, for all the resulting damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-11\">Hence it seems quite proper to hold the Government liable for strictly compensatory damages in these cases. This we understand to be the rule announced by this court in. <em>Corliss </em>v. <em>United States </em>(91 U. S. E., 321).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-12\">The Government having taken the Ocean Wave out of the possession and control of the owner and his agents; having armed, equipped, manned, and officered her, and employed her as a part of the naval armament of the United States, and engaged her in actual hostile operations, it seems nothing more than just, if any damage resulted to the vessel from this employment, the United States should liquidate and pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-13\">But it is manifest that the Ocean Wave was <em>permanently </em>injured from the treatment to which she had been subjected, and that the \u201ctemporary repairs\u201d put upon her by the United States entirely failed to make her seaworthy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The finding is, briefly, almost sententiously, \u201cshe is in an impaired condition, not fit for the trip \u201d to Hilton Head. She, however, made the trip outside without accident. The United States officer, when told of her unfitness for sea, said \u201che could not spare her, and there was no time to put her in sea-going order.\u201d The exigencies of the situation will alone palliate the violation \u25a0of all law. <em>Inter arma silent leges.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-6\">The Government still continued to use the Ocean Wave until she was discharged at Port Eoyal, March 4, 3863, being out of order and condemned by the Government inspectors. Entirely disregarding the provisions of the charter-party, the discharge took place at Port Eoyal; and the captain had to take his steamer to New York the best way he could, in an unseaworthy condition, in bad weather, and under the necessity of stopping on the way to take in coal, and the passage lasted fifty-six days. The language of the contract is: \u201c Said steamer to be delivered to the party of the first part in the port of New York, at the expiration of this charter, in as good condition as she now is, ordinary wear and tear, damage by the elements, bursting of boiler, breaking of machinery, excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-7\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney-General Smith </em>for the United States, appellees:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-8\">The parties contracted that the United States should have \u201c the whole and exclusive use \u201d of tire Ocean Wave for the term \u2022of her charter. <em>(lieed </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>11 Wall., 591; <em>Leary </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>14 Wall., 607.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-9\">There was no express limitation as to the nature of that use, nor was any implied from tlielanguage employed, butthe reverse.

To the extent of her capacity, it was the duty of Strong to receive and transport all the \u201cpassengers\u201d' and the \u201c stores, wares, and merchandise \u201d which the GoATernment might send to her. Her use was not limited to any particular waters, and as it was clearly within the contemplation of the contracting parties that she would be employed in aid of\" the military forces then engaged in the war for the maintenance of the Union, sending her to the waters of North Carolina and' there employing her for the transportation of stores and men AAras clearly authorized by the charter-party. Munitions of war-AArere \u201cstores\u201d and soldiers \u201cpassengers,\u201d Avithin the meaning of that instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Nor was it an unauthorized use of- the vessel to send her up the Neuse Elver, with other boats, on the expedition ordered in December, 18C2, by General Foster,- of the Federal forces.. Before starting, a 30-pound Parrott gun and its carriage, such as-are used on naval vessels, together with ammunition for the gun, and seventeen artillerymen, with their small-arms, and provisions for the expedition, were put on board. The presence of the artillerymen on the vessel was not inconsistent with the terms of the charter-party. In reference to the gun, it is claimed by Strong that the vessel had not the capacity to bear safely such a heavy piece of artillery, and, consequently, that such a use of her was prohibited by the charter-party. Her captain objected at the time to the gun being placed on her, but his objections were disregarded. It is not stated in the findings whether the gun was placed on the vessel for her protection or for offensive operations against the rebels. But it is found that after she had left the vicinity of the rebel fort, the reduction of which seemed to be the object of the expedition, the gun was used to meet an attach of rebel infantry, who fired from the shore into the vessel. The concussion of the firing \u201c swept off the bulwarks and netting in the track of the explosion,\u201d and one of the effects was <em>u </em>to start the joiner-work, and to break in some of the panels of the doors, and to take a part of the rail off.\u201d Upon the same occasion she struck an overhanging tree, which took off a part of the wheel-house, and swept off\" both of the flag-staffs, and all the awning-stanchions. Proceeding down the river, and when three miles above New Berne, she struck a snag and sank. She was raised and taken to New Berne, and there \u201c temporarily repaired by the Government.\u201d Casualties such as striking trees and snags and sinking were clearly marine risks, which the owner expressly assumed, and the fact that, during the expedition when they occurred, the vessel was managed by a pilot placed on her by the Government officers, cannot affect the rights of the parties. The captain does not appear to have made any objection to such a pilot, nor is it claimed that the latter was negligent or unskillful in the discharge of his duty. On the contrary, he belonged in the neighborhood and was familiar with the river. In regard to the claim for damages resulting from the firing of the gun, we remark that if such use of the vessel were conceded to be in violation of the charter-party, we should be unable to ascertain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tlie record tbe amount of those damages. How far they were met by the temporary repairs made by the Government upon the return of the vessel from the expedition is not stated. When she reached New York, after having been discharged from service, it is stated in the findings that she was \u201cgenerally repaired throughout.\u201d What portion of these general repairs was chargeable to the injuries occasioned by the marine risks which the owner assumed, and what portion, if any, was chargeable to the injuries caused by war risks which the Government assumed, cannot be determined from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The only question which remains to be considered is that arising on the asserted liability of the Government for the per diem compensation for the time spent in taking the vessel from Port Royal and in repairing her in New York. The charter-party, it is true, expressly provided that she \u201cwas to be delivered to the owner in the port of New York, at the expiration of the charter, in as good condition\u201d as she was at its date, \u201cordinary wear and tear, damage by the elements, bursting of boilers, breaking of machinery, excepted.\u201d In view of this stipulation, was the Government, under the facts established, relieved from the duty of delivering her in New York <em>% </em>We think it was. By the terms of the charter-party-the owner was bound, at his own expense, to keep the vessel tight, stanch, strong, and sound, and her machinery, boilers, and everything pertaining to her in perfect working order, and to provide her with everything necessary for efficient s\u00e9a-service. Any time which might be lost by reason of the machinery not being in order was to be deducted from the amount claimed to be due at the expiration of the charter. Now, it appears that on the 4th March, 1863, the vessel was out of order and condemned by the Government inspectors, and for those reasons was discharged at Port Royal from the service of the Government. It does not appear that this condemnation was improper or unjust. It is not pretended that she was at that time fit for efficient sea-service. The agreement of the Government to pay $200 per day for the use of the vessel was upon the condition \u2014 whether precedent or concurrent is immaterial \u2014 that the o wner would keep her in good order. His neglect of that duty, by reason of which she became unsafe and Avorthless for the purposes for which she had been hired, authorized the Government to abandon the contract and discharge her from its sendee.
