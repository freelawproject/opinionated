Cls. R., 165, 17. Wall. R., 191) tbat these payments made in ignorance of tbe President\u2019s proclamation removing restrictions from commercial intercourse were not voluntary; (2) Tbat receiving tbe cotton freed from tbe payment of all fees and internal-revenue taxes did not constitute a sufficient consideration to support tbe transaction if it were involuntary on tbe part of tbe claimants and exacted <em>colore \u2022officii. </em>Judgment for tbe claimants.

(IRliott </em>v. <em>Sioartout, </em>10 Peters, 137; <em>Gunning-ham </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>15 Gray, 471, and the many cases there cited by Abbott, counsel for the defendants; <em>Mliston </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>40 Ill., 518, 519; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Lefferman, </em>4 Gill, 436; <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Seh.

It would seem that the claimants, acting upon their own volition, brought him their cotton and executed bills of sale of it to him; and he at once reconveyed three-quarters of it, without query, process, threats, or discussion about it. If the United States made any demand upon them, it was in the form of a statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-12\">\u201cNo case.can be found,\u201d says Breese, J., \u201cwhere money has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>been voluntarily paid with, a full knowledge of the facts and circumstances under which it was demanded, which holds that it can be recovered back upon the ground that the payment was under a misapprehension of the legal rights and obligations of the party paying. And it is invariably held that a payment is not to be regarded as compulsory unless made to relieve the person or property from an actual and existing duress imposed upon him by the party to whom the money is paid5 and such is the tenor of all the cases cited by the appellants, from <em>Valpey </em>v. <em>Bate </em>(50 Eng. C. L., 602) to <em>Lazell </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(15 Mass., 207). No well-considered case anywhere has proceeded upon different principles.\u201d <em>Elston </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(40 Ill., 518,519); <em>Newell </em>v. <em>March, </em>(8 Ired., 441), and authorities <em>passim.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-6\">These suits were instituted in the Court of Claims against the Government. If they can there be sustained, it must be because based upon some contract, expressed or implied, between the litigants. (Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1059; <em>Oibhons </em>v. <em>United, States, </em>8 Wall., 269.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-7\"><em>Non constat </em>but that the law was in force at the moment these sums were paid, which the agent received June 13, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-8\">Referring to the constitutional duty of the President to sign such bills as meet his approval, Story, J., says: \u201cIt is the act of approval which makes it a law, and until that act is done it is not a law. The approval cannot look backwards, and by relation make that a law at any antecedent period of the same day which was not so before the approval; for the general rule is <em>lex pros-picit non respieit. </em>The law prescribes a rule for the future, not for the past; or, as it is sometimes expressed, <em>aLex dot forma/m, futuris, non preteritis negotiisP {Ex parte Richardson, </em>2 Story, 580.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-9\">This is one of the very many cases in which it becomes the duty of the plaintiff to show and the privilege of the court to' understand at what hour of the day a law becomes operative. (Gardner v. Collector, 6 Wall., 499.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-10\">Lord Campbell, C. J., said: You must, indeed, regard the fraction in cases where you have to determine the rights of contending parties, each insisting on their portion of the time.\u201d <em>{Regina </em>\\. <em>St. Mary, </em>1 EL &amp; JBL, *827.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-11\">In <em>Chide </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(8 Dowl. Pr. Cas., 340), .the opinion of Pat-teson, J., is in a dozen lines, to wit: \u201cThe good sense of the matter is, that where it is necessary to show which was the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u2022of two acts, tlie court is at liberty to consider fractions of a day. The rule of law would otherwise be absurd. In tlie present case, the rule must be discharged with costs if no action is brought; but without costs, if the parties think proper to avail themselves of their right of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-6\">A day, in legal consideration, is <em>punctum temporil, </em>and the law knows no fractions of it; and yet, when justice requires, this maxim yields,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Brainerd </em>v. <em>Bushnell, </em>11 Conn., 24, lower \u2019half; <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>1 Cowen, 594; <em>Small </em>v. <em>MeChesney, </em>3 Oowen, 19; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>18 Wend., 533,534; <em>Havens </em>v. <em>Dibble, id., </em>Coo; <em>Glutev. Glute, </em>3 Denlo, 204; <em>Blydenburg </em>v. <em>Gotheal, </em>4 N. Y. (Gomst.), 418; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Porter </em>(6 How. Pr., 286.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-7\">There is no evidence at what hour these payments were made. It the horal divisions are not noticed, they must be presumed to have happened contemporaneously with the issuing of the proclamation; \u201cand it has never been disputed, nor was it contended upon the argument, but that the Grown in such cases has priority over the subject. This point is too clear to need .any confirmation by authority.\u201d <em>(Rdwards </em>v. <em>Regina, </em>9 Exch., 632, per Coleridge, J., giving opinion of the court.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-8\">The plaintiffs, setting up the wrongful reception of money, which they say they are entitled <em>ex ceguo et bono </em>to recover, should show it was wrongfully obtaiired. It is not inequitable to retain it, unless at first wrou gfully extorted. Charging this is accusing-the G-overnment and its officers both with wrong-doing. As Before observed, the presumption is that officials and citizens obey the law and do their duty; and although this presumption cannot supply the place of proof of a substantial fact, it may and does make it incumbent on him who disputes it to furnish the requisite proof of the alleged fact. (2 Whart. on Ev., \u00a7 1318, citing nearly forty cases; among them <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>1 Wheat., 486; <em>Phila., &amp;c., R. R.
