Safeway frequently chartered buses from Allentown, and on this date, Thomas St. Jacques,, an employee bus driver of Safeway, chartered a bus from Allentown in Reading,. Pennsylvania, to go south to Oxford, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland, or Washington, D. C. The chartered bus was driven by Earl Muth, an employee of Allentown. On the bus were passengers holding Safeway tickets. The Allentown bus. became involved in a head-on collision on. U. S. Route No. 1 north of Baltimore,. Maryland, with an automobile driven by-Robert A. Jackson, who was slightly injured. A passenger in Jackson\u2019s car, Paul' Dozier, was severely injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-24\">Suits were filed by Jackson and Dozier-against both bus companies and tried in-the Baltimore City Court. The jury disagreed and was discharged. Thereafter,,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Safeway, under protest, by way of settlement, after having asked Allentown to assume the responsibility of amicable adjustment, made an involuntary payment to Paul Dozier of $3,750.00. Allentown did likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">On November 14, 1949, Safeway filed a complaint, No. 4782, Civil Docket against Allentown, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The first count of the complaint rested on the theory that the plaintiff, having been exposed to an action at law because of the negligent activities of the defendant, was forced to pay a sum of money to Paul Dozier and incur various expenses, and, therefore, was entitled to be indemnified for its expenditures. The second count alleged the existence of an agreement whereby the defendant was to be responsible for any claims made 'by third persons growing out of Safeway\u2019s chartering buses from Allentown.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">On December 7, 1949, Allentown filed an answer to the complaint. On December 29, 1949, a complaint was filed by Allentown, No. 4840, Civil Docket, against Safeway, using almost the exact language of Safeway\u2019s complaint. On January 16, 1950, Safeway filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in No. 4840 because of Allentown\u2019s failure to comply with the compulsory counterclaim Rule 13(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">On January 24, 1950, Allentown\u2019s counsel, without any notice to counsel for Safeway, obtained leave of court to file an amended answer and counterclaim in No. 4782. After Safeway\u2019s counsel protested this <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, the District Judge set Safeway\u2019s motion to dismiss and Allentown\u2019s petition to file amended answer and counterclaim, down for hearing on January 27, 1950. At this hearing, the motion to dismiss in No. 4840 was granted, but the amended answer and counterclaim in No. 4782 were allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The case on its merits was heard by the District Judge after counsel waived trial by jury. In the original complaint, a verdict was found on behalf of the defendant, Allentown. In the counterclaim, a verdict was found in favor of Allentown in the sum of $4,861.65 against Safeway. Safewny has appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">The District Judge entered the following as verdict, findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">\u201cThe verdict of the Court, sitting as a jury, is for the defendant, the Allentown <em>&amp; </em>Reading Transit Company, on its counter-claim against the Safeway Trails, Inc., plaintiff, in the amount of $4,861.65, costs to be paid by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">\u201cThe facts with respect to the various parties involved in the collision and how the collision happened; the damage caused thereby, and to whom, and the amounts paid in settlement of the suits for these damages, brought in the Baltimore City Court, are as set forth in the complaint and are made a part of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">\u201cThe Court makes the following additional findings of fact; no agreement was ever made between the parties, either orally or in writing, with respect to liability in the event of collision with a third party. By an entirely verbal understanding Safeway agreed to pay Allentown so much per mile for the hire of the latter\u2019s bus. All of the passengers on the bus at the time in question were Safeway passengers. The operator was continuously subject to Safeway\u2019s control. He took no orders from Allentown. That Safeway could not discharge, in the ordinary sense, the operator of the bus is not conclusive of the agency situation, nor the fact that the operator\u2019s wage or salary was not paid by Safeway but by Allentown. Safeway could lawfully have refused to permit him to operate the bus if Safeway had found reasonable ground for believing that he was not competent so to do, as, for example, if there had been evidence of reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">\u201cIt is not conclusive that Allentown had a certificate to operater over the route in question. Both parties had certificates so to do. They were required by law to have same.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">\u201cTherefore, the Court concludes as a matter of law that the plaintiff, Safeway, must reimburse the defendant, Allentown, for the losses which the latter suffered by reason of the collision in the amount of the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Two questions are presented on this appeal: (1) Did the District Judge commit reversible error by permitting Allentown to file the amended answer containing the counterclaim of Allentown against Safeway? (2) Did the District Judge commit reversible error in finding on the merits of the case in favor of Allentown and against Safeway? We think that both of these questions must be answered in the negative, so the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The counterclaim of Allentown against Safeway is, under Rule 13(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a compulsory counterclaim, since \u201cit arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim\u201d. It must accordingly, under the Rule, be set up in Allentown\u2019s pleading, and, if this is not done, it cannot be later made the basis of a civil action by Allentown against Safeway. Allentown, thus, violated the Rule by filing an answer in 'Safeway\u2019s civil action without setting out the counterclaim in this answer, and then by filing a civil action against Safeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Later, the District Judge allowed Allentown to dismiss its civil action against Safeway and to file an amended answer (which contained the counterclaim) in Safeway\u2019s civil action against Allentown. Safeway protested, without avail, the District Judge\u2019s leave to Allentown to file this amended answer, which was obtained without notice to Safeway\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Rule 13(f), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">\u201cOmitted Counterclaim. When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, he may by leave of court set up the counterclaim by amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">We think, under this rule, there was no abuse of discretion by the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Allentown\u2019s counsel, in the pre-trial negotiations prior to the filing of the suit by Safeway, admitted that he had told Safeway\u2019s counsel: \u201cIf you file suit against us, I will file a counter-suit.\u201d He further stated that he had not read the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and offered apologies for his ignorance. There was no element of surprise on the part of Safeway, which had been duly apprized of Allentown\u2019s intention to interpose its own claim against Safeway, and no undue hardship was imposed upon Safeway. On the other hand, had the' District Judge refused to allow the interposition of Allentown\u2019s counterclaim in the amended answer, a real injustice would have been done to Allentown.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">We now come to the decision below on the merits. In the second count of its complaint in Safeway\u2019s civil action against Allentown, is set out an alleged oral contract providing that Allentown was to assume sole and complete responsibility with reference to any claims, arising out of the operation of the leased bus, made by Safeway ticket holders or by third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Evidence was introduced by Safeway which, if believed, would show the existence of such a contract; but, on the other hand, testimony was put in by Allentown tending to show that no such oral contract ever existed. Thus was presented a pure question of credibility of witnesses. This is peculiarly the province of the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses. Accordingly, we cannot disturb the finding of the District Judge: \u201cNo agreement was ever made between the parties, either orally or in writing, with respect to liability in the event of collision with a third party.\u201d We might remark, however, that, in the light of modern accepted business practices, the leaving of so important a matter to an informal and oral agreement rather than to a written contract, is, to say the least, quite unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">We think that only one other point in this case requires mention. Was Muth, the driver of the hired bus, subject to the control of Safeway, the lessee of the bus?</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">The District Judge, on this point, found: \u201cBy an entirely verbal understanding Safeway agreed to pay Allentown so much per mile for the hire of the latter\u2019s bus. All of the passengers on the bus at the time in question were Safeway passengers. The operator was continuously subject to Safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>way\u2019s control. He took no orders from Allentown. That Safeway could not discharge, in the ordinary sense, the operator of the bus is not conclusive of the agency situation, nor the fact that the operator\u2019s wage or salary was not paid by Safeway but by Allentown. Safeway could lawfully have refused to permit him to operate the bus if Safeway had had reasonable ground for believing that he was not competent so to do, as, for example, if there had been evidence of reckless driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">There was ample evidence to sustain this finding, both in the testimony adduced and in the logic of the surrounding facts and circumstances. This finding, accordingly, must not be disturbed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">In Dippel v. Juliano, 152 Md. 694, at page 699, 137 A. 514, at page 516, it was \u25a0said: \u201cUpon these cases and the reasoning upon which they rest it is difficult to formulate any sounder test for determining whether at the time of the accident the chauffeur was the employee of the owner or the borrower than that of the power of control and direction. * * * And whereupon the evidence that fact depends upon the adoption of one or more varying but nevertheless legitimate inferences which may be drawn from conceded or undisputed facts, * * * the question is usually one for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">See, also, Salo witch v. Kres, 147 Md. 23, 127 A. 643; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Gilbert, 145 Md. 251, 125 A. 692; Salmons Dredging Corporation v. Herma, 4 Cir., 180 F.2d 233; Malisfski v. Indemnity Ins.
