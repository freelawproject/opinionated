The application was examined in the Patent Office as required by law, and the claims presented in the application were rejected as being unpatentable over certain patents cited as references. Preliminary to taking an appeal from the examiner\u2019s rejection to the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office, the applicant presented several amendments for dle purpose of placing his claims in better form for appeal. Newly presented claims <em>39, </em>40, 44, and 45 were held to be allowable, and the appeal to the Board of Appeals was from the final rejection of claims <em>34 to 38, 41, </em>42, 43, 46, and 47. The Board of Appeals affirmed the rejection of the claims on the ground that they are unpatentable over the following United States patents: Pitman, 2,087,480, July 20, 1937; Kassner, 2,089,966, Aug. 17, 1937; Keller, 2,179,261, Nov. 7, 1939. The patent applicant twice petitioned for reconsideration by the board of its decision. Unavailing, he brings the case before us on appeal. R.S. 4911, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 59a; 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"AtJX\">Appellant has consistently contended both within the Patent Office and here that the examiner and later the Board of Appeals failed to understand his invention and consequently misapplied the disclosures of the reference patents to his claims. The applicant appeared <em>pro se </em>at the oral argument here to explain the technical substance of his method, as he stated, because of the misunderstanding which he believes has occasioned the rejection in the Patent Office of the claims at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"Aen\">Appellant\u2019s method relates to subjecting material to a high frequency alternating electrostatic field, and particularly to .applying the energy of the field to selective portions or locations in the material to accomplish a variety of useful results, in-eluding welding or bonding and fusion, The use of high frequency alternating electrostatic fields to heat bodies as in welding or bonding operations is not new with appellant, but by his method of selective application of the energy of the field, he contends that he can induce in the material being treated \u201cphenomena similar to those which occur at higher tempera-tures while the actual temperature of the material remains below that at which they ordinarily occur.\u201d It appears that when a polar substance is subjected to an alternating field, the field exerts a moment of force upon individual molecules corn-prising the body. If the molecules are thought of as having positive and negative charges separated in space along the molecule, it will be seen that the electrostatic field will tend to attract the positive charge toward one electrode and the negative charge toward the other electrode. As the polarity of the alternating field is reversed, the pull on the molecules is also reversed, As the frequency of the alternating field is increased, the molecules have less time after each reversal of polarity to align themselves to the reversed polarity of the field, with the result that the motion of the molecules will begin to decrease as the frequency is further increased. As that phenomenon occurs, an accelerating change in the dielectric constant of the material takes place. The range within the frequency of the alternating electrostatic field at those phenomena occur is the an\u00b0malous dispersion range of the ma-tcrial- At the center frequency of that range, the average of the motions of the molecules induced by the alternating field is at a maximum. <em>In </em>this range maximum energy absorption is said to occur,</p>\n<p id=\"Asbk\">Appellant\u2019s discovery is not the principie of the anomalous dispersion range. Pie determines by known methods the anomalous dispersion range \u201cfor the particular material and for the particular conditions of treatment.\u201d As the field corresponding to the center of that range is first applied, appellant states, \u201cthe temperature of the substance is not abruptly increased as might be expected,\u201d and \u201csince the relaxation time may be different for each molecule and for given molecules in each environment,\u201d he has 'found \u201cthat by the use of this mechanism\u201d he can \u201cselectively induce one sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>stance within a body or material to behave as though it were at a higher temperature than the rest of the body. Thus, appel-i lant states, he \u201cmay cause the surface of a body to fuse without fusing the interior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atf1\">The drawings of the application illustrate an apparatus for practicing appellant\u2019s method as it relates to bonding or welding together two sheets of thermoplastic material. \u201cWhen a homogeneous material is used in this way,\u201d the specification states, \u201cit is found that the molecules at the surface respond more readily to the alternating field, and therefore will have their range of anomalous dispersion at a somewhat higher frequency than the molecules in the interior of the body. Advantageously, therefore, the higher frequency is selected to give a maximum effect at the surface.\u201d The specification then states that \u201cThis effect may be further increased by the use of a surface coating to which the frequency is attuned.\u201d That coating may be a plasticizer with an anomalous dispersion range different from that of the bodies being bonded. There the frequency is one in the anomalous dispersion range of the plasticizer or it may be a complex frequency including one in the anomalous dispersion range of the plastic material as well as one in the range of the plasticizer.</p>\n<p id=\"AEu-\">Where a plasticizer is used, the-rmoplastic sheets are overlapped and passed between the pressure roller electrodes of an apparatus described in the application, The material is exposed to the selected high frequency field, and as the material passes between the rollers, \u201cthere is an instantaneous fusing of the surface\u201d which under the pressure of the rollers produces a bond, the material coming out from between the electrode rollers \u201cwithout overheating and apparently at a temperature below the normal softening point of the thermoplastic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">The specification states that the same procedure may be followed without the use of the plasticizer coating, but that \u201cthe process is more sensitive to exact frequency control since the frequency to which the surface molecules 'respond is closer to that at which the interior molecules respond so that\" uncontrolled variations in the circuit may result in' a softening of' the entire sheet with a consequent squeezing out of material from between the rolls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3Sq\">Claim 34 is illustrative of the subject matter on appeal, and reads as follows: \u00ab34. The method of welding adjoining bodies at least one of which embodies in its substance molecular units responsive to alternating electrostatic fields, those of said units at the surface of said body and in -the area to be welded having an anomalous dispersion range the center frequency of which is different from the center frequency of the corresponding anomalous dispersion range of similar units within the interior of said body, which comprises exposing said body, while the surfaces of said bodies are substantially in contact, to an alternating electrostatic field of frequency at a center frequency of the range of anomalous dispersion for said units at the surface of said body under the conditions of treatment, said welding being completed while the temperatures of said bodies remain below their normal softening temperatures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Asdn\">The patent to pitman reiates to a method \u00a3or cementing shoe parts, such as a leather soje and Upper; foy activating a cement appijed to the surfaces to be bonded with heat generated \u201cwithin and/or adjacent\u201d the cement film by high frequency alternatjng electrical current. Speaking of the frequency of current required, Pitman states that it may vary within wide limits, mentions a specific frequency, and con-dudes: \u201cIt has been found that with each cement an optimum change from electrical energy to heat energy is obtainable * *. * * * the optimum frequency will readjjy foe found by testing a few different values jn the above range; * * *.\u201d With this statement there should be compared applicant\u2019s disclosure of a general procedure for locating the anomalous dispersion range for the particular material to be tested: \u201cWherever a substantial difference appears between the dielectric constant for the material at one frequency and the dielectric constant at the next frequency chosen * \u25a0 * * at least a part of a range of anomalous dispersion lies between the frequencies used in these two tests. By making additional tests more closely spaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>within this area * * * \u201d there will be accurately located, appellant states, the desired central frequency of the anomalous dispersion range.</p>\n<p id=\"AdCN\">The Kassner patent relates to a process for altering the energy content of dipolar substances by subjecting them to rapidly oscillating electromagnetic fields. Kassner states that his process depends on characteristic periods and frequencies of dipolar substances such as (1) the relaxation time of the orientation of the dipoles when exposed to a varying electric field; and (2) the period of natural oscillation relative to each other of the charges constituting a dipole. He teaches that since dipolar molecules are carriers of electric charges they oscillate in the presence of an alternating electrical field and absorb energy from the field. The excitation is especially strong and energy absorption especially great under conditions of resonance. Plotting frequency and energy absorption graphically, he points out that the depicted region of sudden change is the anomalous dispersion region. Kassner teaches that \u201cdipolar substances * * * behave in a thoroughly new and unforseen manner when they are subjected to the action of an electromagnetic radiation field which oscillates mainly or wholly in at least one of the frequencies which is the same as one of the natural frequencies of the said substances * *. The term \u2018natural frequency\u2019 is intended to mean the range of frequency of the anomalous dispersion and resonance dispersions.\u201d He adds, \u201cFrom the previously described connection between resonance frequency and anomalous dispersion position it results that the latter is a suitable indicator for the resonance frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"A29P\">With Kassner\u2019s teaching of the relation of the anomalous dispersion range or region to conditions of resonance there may be compared the statement in applicant\u2019s specification that \u201cWhen the treatment is proceeding the circuit should be tuned to resonance at the particular frequency selected within the anomalous dispersion range and changes in the dielectric between the electrodes or in the spacing of the electrodes will, of course, affect the desired condition of resonance. * * * By means of a tuning motor controlled by a photo-electric relay the circuit may thus be kept in constant resonance and tuned to give the highest efficiency of treatment.\u201d Appellant in his specification elsewhere states&gt; \u201cAlthough I have described above and find advantageous to use a circuit tuned to resonance at the particular in-9ucncy selected, it is also possible to operate ^th de-tuned circuits * * *\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">Keller\u2019s patent relates to a method of heating nonconducting molding materials quickly and uniformly throughout their mass by means of a high frequency field where the material and electrodes comprise a tuning condenser for a power oscillator supplying current. Changes in the capacity of the circuit due to variations of the dielectric constant of the molding material as heating progresses are said to produce corresponding' changes in the frequency of the oscillator, keeping thereby the dielectric loss in the material at a maximum throughout the heating operation. The dielectric constant is described as increasing in magnitude as the temperature of the material rises, but the load circuit is kept resonant to the oscillator frequency by a tuning condenser. In this connection, appellant in his specification states: \u201cA further result of using the high frequencies most suitable to purposes of my invention, is the sensitivity of the circuit to various changes in dielectrie between the electrodes.\u201d He then states that the circuit should be kept resonant as quoted in the preceding paragraph,</p>\n<p id=\"AnCp\">aaim 34 was considered by the Board of Appeals to recite in substance the step of applying an electrostatic field the frequcncy of whidl yie]ds ,the greatest degree 0f energy absorption at the surface of the material being treated. Operating in accordance with Pitman\u2019s process was held by the board to satisfy that step. To appellant\u2019s contention that Pitman\u2019s process heats the <em>layer </em>of cement between the leather elements being united whereas his method agitates the molecules at the <em>surface </em>of the materials being treated, the board held, that in view of the provision in appellant\u2019s specification for the use on the surface of the material of a plasticizer coating with an anomalous dispersion range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>different from that of the material, there was no distinction between Pitman\u2019s surface layer and appellant\u2019s. In view of the teaching of Kassner\u2019s patent of the unique behavior of dipolar substances in absorbing energy at the natural frequency or anomalous dispersion range, and Pitman\u2019s teaching of the use of a frequency yielding an optimum change from electrical energy to heat energy, the board held there was no invention in the process of -claim 34 in requiring the application of a frequency such that the energy is absorbed at the surfaces. In reply to appellant s first petition for rehearing, the board stated that a discovery by appellant that surface molecular units possess an anomalous dispersion range different from similar molecular units within the body concerned did not-warrant allowance of claims substantially providing for the procedural steps involved in Pitman,s process'</p>\n<p id=\"AsK\">Appellant\u2019s position on appeal, as stated in his brief, is that his method is concerned with the selective activation of the molecules at the <em>surface </em>of \u201cthe body which is to be welded,\u2019,\u2019 whereas Pitman is concerned with the activation or heating of the entire <em>layer </em>of cement which would be coated on one of two bodies to be joined together. Pitman\u2019s process, he contends, does not produce selective activation of the molecules at the surface either of \u201cthe body which is to be welded\u201d or the cement layer applied to that body. Appellant states that if his principles were applied to Pit-man\u2019s arrangement, only the molecules at the <em>surface </em>of the cement coating would be energized, and not the entire layer of cement as is Pitman\u2019s -case. That difference is stated by appellant to be the basis of his appeal. The Board of Appeals and the examiner in his view \u201cfailed to recognize, or completely ignored\u201d the distinction he urges between a surface and a layer.</p>\n<p id=\"AQrT\">Appellant in urging the difference between \u201csurface\u201d and \u201clayer\u201d appears to have in mind that the basis of the rejection of claim 34 by the examiner and the board was \u201canticipation.\u201d Thus it is stated in his brief that \u201cthe Pitman patent contains no disclosure anticipating this claim or any other claim here on appeal.\u201d Again, at the conclusion of his brief, appellant states that \u201cthe processes set forth in these claims are not anticipated by any of the reference patents and that the Board of Appeals erred in rejecting these claims.\u201d The rejection by the examiner as well as the decision of the board, however, was that the claims at bar lack invention and thus are unpatentable over the references, not that they lack novelty and are thus anticipated by the references.</p>\n<p id=\"AmW\">Tim issue in this case is not so much the references contain an explicit disciosure that bonding may be accomplished by tbe application of an alternating electric field at a frequency witb.in the anomalous dispersion range of the molecules at thfi ^ of the <em>bodies to be </em>bonded&gt; as it is with a considerat\u00edon 0f whether it amounts to invention for appellant to do that in the face of Pitman\u2019s teaching - respeoting an optimum frequency for changing electrical energy into heat energy in a layer of cement applied to the surface, Kassner\u2019s teaching of the, relationship of anomalous dispersion range to the frequency of an alternating electrostatic field jn producing maximum energy absorption jn a dipolar substance, and Keller\u2019s t\u00e9aching of the maintenance of a resonant circuit when molding materials are subjected to an alternating electrostatic field and the interrelationship of the frequency, dielectric constant, and temperature in such a cir,cujt. In discussing the prior art references jn the forepart of this opinion we have shown that the teaching of each patent appears to be integrated in some measure into appellant\u2019s specification. Basically the principles and techniques set forth by the appellant in, his specification are those disclosed in the references as indicated, with the exception that in none of the references is it suggested that the anomalous dispersion range of a dipolar substance may be one thing for molecules in the interior of the substance and another thing for the molecules comprising a so-called surface layer. This latter, if it is a fact, is concededly appellant\u2019s discovery, at least so far as the record before us is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Does the discovery of that fact and its utilization in the selection of the particular frequency of the alternating electrostatic field to be used in the bonding operation entitle the appellant to a patent on the claims here at bar ? It is admittedly old in the art to pass a high frequency current between electrodes applied to opposite sides of a layer or layers of material to be bonded. The art of record here shows further that it is old to select a frequency from within the anomalous dispersion range of the material most effectively to utilize the energy of the high frequency field. The improvement appellant adds flows from his discovery that the surface molecules of the material have an anomalous dispersion range of their own distinct from that of the molecules in the inner portion of the material. Having discovered that phenomenon of nature, appellant merely uses the well known procedure for bonding by means of a high frequency field, selecting \u25a0the particular frequency his discovery informs him is peculiar to the surface molecules of the material involved under the conditions of treatment. Appellant has not invented any new art or improvement embodying or utilizing his discovery of a scientific or natural principie, rather he has used a well known procedure for bonding by means of a high frequency field and merely selected the particular frequency to be used in that proceden e which the scientific principle he has discovered indicates to be appropriate. That is not invention. Davison Chemical Corp. v. Joliet Chemicals Inc., 7 Cir., 179 F.2d 793, certiorari denied, 71 S.Ct. 45; Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 68 S.Ct. 440, 92 L.Ed. 588; Allen v. Coe, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 135 F.2d 11, In re Walker, 99 F.2d 976, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 739; In re Mason, 87 F.2d 370, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 842 Claim 34 and closely related claims 35, 36, 37, and 38 are accordingly unpatentable.</p>\n<p id=\"AXp\">Claim 41 differs from the preceding claims and calls for a method of selectively fusing one material in the presence of other materials by selecting an alternating electrostatic field frequency near the center of the anomalous dispersion range of the ma-terial which is to be fused, and adjusting the conditions of treatment to compensate for the shift in the anomalous dispersion range produced during the progress of the treatment. The \u201cadjusting the conditions of treatment\u201d portion of the claim is adequately taught by Keller. Kassner provides a sufficient disclosure of the balance of the claim. In view of the rejection of all of the claims at bar as unpatentable over Pit-man in view of either Kassner or Keller, claim 41 must stand rejected. Claim 42, similar to claim 41, is clearly unpatentable over the references. In each of those claims, a frequency within the anomalous dispersion range of the material itself as distinguished from a range peculiar to molecules at the surface of that material, is applied, and such a method as claims 41 and 42 state is taught by the references, Claim 43 adds to claims 41 and 42 the ad-justment feature of claim 41 which as we have seen is met by Keller,</p>\n<p id=\"A29G\">Claim 46 calls for applying energy seleclively to a polymeric hydrocarbon by means 0f a high voltage field increasing thereby the polarization of the hydrocarbon so as to shjft the anomalous dispersion range, and appiying an alternating frequency within tbe shifted anomalous dispersion range, agree with the examiner\u2019s analysis ^at Pitman\u2019s alternative use of vinyl cornpOSiti0ns (hydrocarbons), Kassner\u2019s statement Df the theory of polarization, and Keljer&gt;s discussion of the use of relatively high voltage, preclude the patentability of claim 4g_ Claim 47 is dependent upon claim 46, specifying that the hydrocarbon is subject^ during treatment to \u201ca pressure of be-tween jq ancj |02 Watts per square inch.\u201d That meaninglcss addition to claim 46 fails tQ cQnfer patentability upon the cIaim.</p>\n<p id=\"AIvO\">For e reasons stated, the decision of the Board of APPeals rejecting all of the claims at bar 13 affirmecL</p>\n<p id=\"AIe\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
