Int.Rev.Acts, pages 787, 789. The appeals are from judgments dismissing for insufficiency complaints which alleged that the statutes were unconstitutional because they violated the Fifth Amendment and unlawfully delegated the power of Congress. These objections the plaintiffs specified upon the argument by asserting that the statutes set up an unequal and arbitrary standard of taxation, dependent upon each corporation\u2019s own choice; - that it was oppressive and unreasonable to compel it to use indefinitely the \u201cdeclared value\u201d once chosen, regardless of any change in the actual value of the capital stock; and that in substance power had been delegated to the corporations to tax themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">The statutes were attempts to simplify the administration of an \u201cexcess profits tax\u201d which had caused great confusion and difficulty during the years following the World War. The general theory of the earlier statute had been that the income of a corporation above a percentage on its capital, taken as a standard or norm, should be taxed at a higher rate than the rest; it was an effort to impose added burdens upon that part of the profits which the war alone made possible. In 1933 it was again thought desirable to impose such a tax, and Congress sought to avoid the earlier administrative troubles. To do so it hit upon the device of allowing corporations to appraise their capital stock for themselves, and of imposing upon the appraised value a tax of one-tenth of one per cent, which was the \u201ccapital stock tax\u201d here in question. Obviously there must be some inducement to a fair appraisal, and for that, reason the statutes provided that in addition to the tax so imposed the corporation should pay a tax of five per cent upon that part of its income which exceeded 12%% of the appraised value (\u201cdeclared value\u201d). This was the \u201cexcess profits tax,\u201d eo nomine. The two taxes were in this way ingeniously interlocked so as to-put taxpayers in a deliberately planned dilemma: if they reduced the \u201cdeclared value\u201d of their capital, they reduced pro tanto that part of their income which was exempt from the \u201cexcess profits tax\u201d; if they raised it, they increased the \u201ccapital stock tax.\u201d Apparently the purpose was in this way to secure some correspondence between -the \u201cdeclared value\u201d and the actual value of the capital stock; this is borne out by the provision for yearly adjustments for additions to, and deductio'ns from, capital. Indeed, it is the plaintiffs\u2019 chief complaint that these did not result in keeping the declared and actual values in step; changes in the value of the property were not adequately reflected. But the truth is that, whatever the purpose, the actual value of the capital stock was irrelevant in the scheme, for it could only remotely affect the taxpayer\u2019s determination of the \u201cdeclared value.\u201d In making that determination the optimum for any year would be a value which was' eight times the income of that year; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>actual capital was wholly unimportant save as it might determine income. This was true because in any year in which it was exactly eight times the income, the taxpayer would have neither \u201cexcess profits tax\u201d to pay, nor any \u201ccapital stock tax\u201d above what was exactly necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">We will not say that,' if any adjustment for changes in income had been essential to the constitutional validity of the tax, those provided would not have been enough, notwithstanding the fact that they did not directly concern income at all, and that they were far from complete as to capital. At least there was a rough correspondence between the \u201cadjusted declared value\u201d and the actual capital, and perhaps that was enough. This we need not however decide because we think that no adjustments whatever were necessary. It is quite true that the taxpayer had to choose, once for all, which meant that in substance it. had to forecast its average income for the period during which the statute should remain upon the books. That did indeed impose upon it an impossible duty; but the consequences of failure were not so harsh that the imposition trenched upon the Fifth Amendment. In any year in which the \u201cdeclared value\u201d overshot the mark, the taxpayer would indeed pay a greater tax than it need, but only upon one-tenth of one per cent of the excess. In any year in which the \u201cdeclared value\u201d undershot it, the taxpayer would pay a tax of five per cent upon so much of the income as the \u201cdeclared value\u201d did not cover. The second tax was the heavier and could in practice be reasonably insured against by a liberal allowance for \u201cdeclared value,\u201d the course generally in fact adopted. To say that Congress could not choose a scheme implemented by such mild sanctions, as an alternative to actually computing an \u201cexcess profits tax\u201d with all the uncertainty and litigation which that had involved, would be most unreasonably to circumscribe its powers to establish a convenient and flexible fiscal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The argument addressed to the unlawful delegation of power needs little consideration. It assumes that because the taxpayers could fix their own tax by means of the \u201cdeclared value,\u201d the power to tax was delegated to them. It is quite true that the amount was left to them; practically, they had the privilege of paying a high \u201ccapital stock tax\u201d and no \u201cexcess profits tax,\u201d or a lower \u201ccapital stock tax,\u201d coupled with an \u201cexcess profits tax.\u201d But statutes frequently grant the privilege of an option to those on whom they impinge; and so long as the legislature itself fixes the alternatives within which the choice must be made, it has never been considered that there is an unlawful delegation of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The question has come up very often, though never before in a circuit court of appeals; it has always been decided in favor of the constitutionality of the statutes. The Court of Claims has passed upon it three times. Chicago Telephone Supply Co. v. United States, 23 F.Supp. 471; Allied Agents, Inc., v. United States, 26 F.Supp. 98; Tennessee Consolidated Co. v. United States, 89 Ct.Cl. 542. There have been fourteen decisions in the district courts, besides those here on appeal. Rosoff Tunnel Corp. v. Higgins, D.C.S.D. N.Y., 28 F.Supp. 880; Midvale Paper Board Co. v. United States, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 31 F.Supp. 851; Mountain Iron Co. v. United States, D.C.Minn., 31 F.Supp. 895; Isthmian Steamship Co. v.
