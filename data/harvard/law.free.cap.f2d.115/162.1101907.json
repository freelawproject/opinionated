The petitioner-appellant, as its cognomen indicates, is a baking company and in the preparation of the staff of life purchased large quantities of flour from two milling companies. These latter were, of course, subject to the processing taxes of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 609(a), the stormy economic and legal history of which is familiar. For the first three years of the Act, the miller added the tax ($1.38 per barrel) to the price paid by the baker. In the next three years the country recovered from its state of economic shock and first out of the shelters, as always, were our enterprising barristers. So in those three years the miller was asked to and did deposit the taxes in escrow pending a test of the law\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">That test (successful for the taxpayer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) left considerable legal and financial confusion in its wake. Large sums had been paid into the Treasury and they had not been legally due. The Congress canceled its mistake of law and provided for the return of these monies. To that end, the Revenue Act of 1936 included Title VII, \u201cRefunds of Amounts Collected Under The Agricultural Adjustment Act,\u201d 7 U. S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 643-659. In so doing they immediately and inevitably ran into a most baffling problem in economics. We say inevitably because Congress rightly wanted only those who had suffered to benefit. Its desire in that respect is embodied in the rather elaborate provisions of Section 902 of the above cited Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 644, now in suit. It has been argued that the recovery should run not against the United States but against the farmers to whom the assessments had been passed on.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 56However that may be, to find the \u201cactual sufferers\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from any tax has been a task which has disturbed both the savants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the judges, and they have not always agreed. Impact is plain \u2014 incidence is obscure. So it is not surprising that the legislative efforts and their judicial interpretations have not met with universal approval.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">The injustice here complained of proceeds from the obverse of the medallion. The petitioner feels that the incidence has fallen upon it and accordingly that it should recover the unjust enrichment. Its feelings can be expressed in the words of the writer of a law review note who commented on one of the Circuit Court of Appeals cases above cited, F. &amp; F. Laboratories v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 104 F.2d 563, in the following language :</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">\u201cThe right of the petitioner to recover in the instant case was dependent upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the interpretation placed by the Court on the statute providing for refunds. The result while clearly within the Congressional intent, seems unfortunate, and the legislation inequitable in denying recovery to the one who has borne the burden of the tax. Yet the instant statute is in accord with the general policy of Congress.\u201d \u25a0 Taxation \u2014 Refunds Where Taxing Statute is Unconstitutional \u2014 Status of Claimant to Whom Burden is Shifted by Intended Taxpayer, 17 New York University Law Review 138, 139 (note).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">This contention overlooks several things. The recovery of illegally paid taxes is solely a matter of governmental grace. It is true that the element of compulsion takes it out of the ancient rule of payments under a mistake of law (the practical reason underlying this seemingly harsh doctrine stems from a preference for making the citizenry and not the courts certain of the law). It is also true, however, that mistakes in favor of the sovereign, whether of law or fact, have the same quality that inheres in other dealings with supremacy. As the state taketh away, so it giveth back, and all we can do is bless the name of the state and hope for the best. The quality of mercy has strengthened with the quality of democracy and of late years the recovery of illegal taxes has received both legislative and judicial impetus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>-</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">That impetus has not extended to the circumstances of the principal case. The statute is explicit in its inclusion of the specific word \u201ctax\u201d. It could have stopped, but did not, with the use of the more general term \u201camount\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If there is ever a word of art, \u201ctax\u201d is certainly such a one. From the days of the feudal barons to the present the tax collector has represented authofity in its most trying form. Every judicial definition of tax or taxation includes some reference to an \u201cenforced contribution of money assessed by authority of sovereign state\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It imports, then, a particular relationship (necessary but unpleasant) between the individual (corporate or otherwise) and his, her, or its government. There is no such relationship here and \u2022 the statute cannot be stretched to cover some other relationship.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">It is not our business to uphold the wisdom of the Congress. Since, however, the petitioner stresses what he feels to be a patent unfairness, we might add this. Congress has chosen that the revenue should deal on recovery, as on payment, with the only person with whom it deals at all, the taxpayer. It has <em>only </em>made certain that such person has a case in good conscience. That does not mean it wishes the Treasury to deal with all others having cases in good conscience. As we have seen, that equity depends on incidence and is hard enough to determine in any particular case. If all the alleged sufferers are to be given access to the till, the difficulty of determination becomes insuperable. On what is known as the \u201cdiffusion theory\u201d of taxation every inhabitant is affected and so theoretically eligible for a refund.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even on more scientific principles of price structure,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the spread is great and the number of potential litigants many. Did our aggrieved appellant by any chance include the tax', of which it generously relieved the miller, in the morning toast? If it did, it might make an attempt to secure relief in some form of action analogous to a stockholder\u2019s bill against offending corporate directors with the milling companies in the roll of an unwilling board.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The order of the United States Processing Tax Board of Review dismissing the petition is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> Anniston Mfg.
