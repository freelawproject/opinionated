We have to determine whether or not an incipient controversy between them had become so dead by the time this action was brought as not to furnish a case for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-23\">On February 4, 1939, defendant\u2019s attorney addressed a letter to the plaintiff Edith Lances \u2014 with ydiom the other plaintiffs do business under the firm name of Edith Lances Brassieres \u2014 asserting that the-cut of plaintiffs\u2019 brassiere was an infi-ingement of defendant\u2019s patent No. 1,942,250 and stating that the purpose of the letter was \u201cto inform you of the fact that Miss Letz will adopt any and all legal means and procedure provided by the civil law to restrain the infringement of her patent, and for the recovery of any damages which she has sustained or may sustain in connection with such infringement by anyone.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cHowever, in view of the circumstances, if you would prefer to take up the subject matter on a basis amicable both to you and to Miss Letz, I would appreciate hearing from you.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 response to this opening was decidedly reserved. On March 22, their attorney wrote defendant\u2019s counsel that the garments manufactured by his clients did not infringe any claims of the patent, that plaintiffs\u2019 article in question was in public use prior to defendant\u2019s patent application, that defendant copied the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>tiffs\u2019 brassiere, and that they had \u201cstill other evidence\u201d to show that defendant\u2019s claims were \u201centirely invalid\u201d because of prior art. And this letter closed: \u201cIf you should care to take this matter up with me further, I will be glad to have you call upon me.\u201d On July 6, new counsel for defendant addressed plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, calling attention to the previous correspondence as to \"the alleged infringement\u201d and saying, \u201cOur client is anxious to litigate this matter but in view of the statements in your letter, we would prefer to have a conference with you on the question of noninfringement and invalidity before proceeding, if you will please assemble for our inspection the material mentioned in your letter of March 22nd. Trusting to see you at an early date, we are,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">And so the inspection was duly had on August 28, but by still another attorney on behalf of the defendant, who avers that his only duty was to look and report back, which he did. Plaintiffs assert, by affidavit of their counsel, that this latest attorney agreed to \u201clet me know within a week or two his client\u2019s disposition in this matter.\u201d There being complete silence from defendant or anyone representing her, plaintiffs commenced this action on November 17, 1939,- to test the validity of defendant\u2019s patent by way of a declaratory judgment. The district court dismissed the action on summary judgment after answer was filed, stating that whether or not a controversy between the parties was initially disclosed, it was not -shown to have continued to the date of commencement of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">We believe it a fair interpretation of the remedial provisions of the declaratory judgment statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 400, and of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, that one cannot so brashly initiate a controversy by such extensive threats of litigation as were here involved and then avoid the risk of judicial adjudication by mere nonaction. One of the situations where the declaratory judgment is most helpful is that of patent litigation where a threat of suit for infringement has been made and not pressed for the attention of a court. \u201cThis has had a, most beneficial effect in curing what had become a racket. For patentees, none too sure of the validity of their patents, had often notified customers or licensees of their rivals or competitors of their intention to bring suit against all who dealt in the product in question.\u201d Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, 9 Brooklyn L.Rev. 1, 30, 1939; cf. Leach v. Ross Heater &amp; Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 104 F.2d 88, 91; E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Byrnes, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 14; Zenie Bros. v. Miskend, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 10 F.Supp. 779; Mitchell &amp; Weber, Inc. v. Williamsbridge Mills, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 14 F.Supp. 954; 45 Yale L.J. 160, 1935, 1287, 1936. And when the threat of action is made, we do not believe plaintiffs must go further and show that infringement notices have already been sent to the trade; the position of peril and insecurity for plaintiffs already exists. Borchard, Judicial Relief for Peril and Insecurity, 45 Harv.L.Rev. 793, 1932; Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, 1934, 5, 307.; 45 Yale L.J. at 163; Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. International Harvester Co., 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 769, at page 773; Interstate Cotton Oil Refining Co. v. Refining, Inc., D.C.Nev., 22 F.Supp. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Here the initial threat was even emphasized when defendant continued to maintain her position through successive counsel. Defendant asserts that all these movements were only exploratory, that the changes in counsel came because the first ones were not patent experts and the second were in the enviable position of being too busy to make the inspection tour in person, and that the lack of further affirmative action on her part showed that the controversy was not being pressed. But there certainly was nothing in the situation, so far as the plaintiffs knew or were informed, to make unreasonable a conclusion on their part that she was lying in ambush to use her claim of patent infringement when it would be most damaging. In truth, she does not even disclaim this possible maneuver in her answer herein, for she simply states, rather disingenuously, that, after receiving the report of her attorney, she \u201cdetermined temporarily to do nothing further in the matter until she could consult again with\u201d her lawyers (the ones who were previously too busy to act) \u201cand secure their opinion.\u201d And she adds that she \u201cdoes not know\u201d whether or not the plaintiffs\u2019 brassieres are an infringement of her patent and that she \u201chas relied wholly in this matter\u201d upon these attorneys. Since her answer was filed, these attorneys have given way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>yet new counsel. We think the time has come when this lady must either repudiate her original claims or consent to an adjudication of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
