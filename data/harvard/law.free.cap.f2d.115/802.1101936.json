No application was made to the court for the appointment of a trustee (\u00a7 832) to control and manage the property (\u00a7 841 et seq.). The matter was referred to a referee, to whom the debtor petitioned to have appellees Kirkpatrick and Burks removed as trustees under the trust deeds, which application was refused. Appellant made several proposals to the secured creditors, which failed to secure the number of acceptances required by \u00a7 868. At the time the first proposal was refused, the referee vacated a restraining order theretofore granted to appellant, and ordered that the rents of the various properties be paid to the creditors, but gave permission to the debtor to file a second proposal. This, and subsequent proposals, were likewise refused by the majority of the secured creditors, who then moved to dismiss the proceedings. The referee held that under the provisions of \u00a7 881 the petition must be dismissed, upon- the ground that there was no proposal pending and no probability that any proposal would be accepted by the creditors. Upon petition to review, the District Court confirmed the action of the refere\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">One of appellant\u2019s principal grievances was that the referee denied his application for the removal of Kirkpatrick and Burks as trustees under the trust deeds; but the appellant did not apply for the appointment of a trustee. This was the remedy available to him to protect his statutory rights against the claimed hostility of the trustees under the trust deeds. While the appointment of a trustee is discretionary with the court, under \u00a7 832 appellant was entitled either to have the court appoint a trustee subject to the control of the court, or to continue m possession of his property,\u201d and to \u201chave all the title and exercise all the powers\u201d of a trustee appointed under the statute (\u00a7 844) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Appellant was entitled to collect the rents if no trustee was appointed, and the referee erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to be permitted to collect the rents (\u00a7 844). While denial of this motion was a substantial grievance, the statute does not make protection of the debtor\u2019s rights in this particular a jurisdictional prerequisite (Cf. Hoyd v. Citizens Bank of Albany Co., 6 Cir., 89 F.2d 105) nor forbid dismissal of the petition until the debtor either has been protected by the appointment of a trustee or by the continuation of possession of the property in his own hands. On the other hand, \u00a7 881 manditorily requires that if an arrangement is withdrawn or abandoned prior to its acceptance, and no other arrangement is pending, or if no arrangement is accepted, the court shall, \u201cwhere the petition was filed under section 822 of this title, enter an order upon hearing after notice to the debtor, the creditors, and such other persons as the court may direct, either adjudging the debtor a bankrupt and directing that bankruptcy be proceeded with pursuant to the provisions of this title or dismissing the proceeding under this chapter, whichever in the opinion of the court may be in the interest of the creditors.\u201d The case falls squarely within this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">We cannot say that upon this record as presented the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition. Kunze v. Prudential Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 106 F.2d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\"> Title 11, U.S.O., \u00a7 832, 11 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">\u201cThe court may, upon the application of any party in interest, appoint a trustee of the property of the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">\u00a7 844. \u201cWhere no trustee is appointed, the debtor shall continue in possession of his property and shall have all the title and exercise all the powers of a trustee appointed under this chapter, subject, however, at all times to the control of the court and to such limitations, restrictions^ terms, and conditions as the court may from time to time prescribe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
