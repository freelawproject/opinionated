In our judgment the increasing legislative enlistment of middlemen such as processors, distributors, etc., as intermediaries for the collection of taxes will bring a corresponding\u2019 increase in similar litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\">The appellant, a gasoline distributor, sold gasoline to the Incandescent Supply Company on credit. At that time the appellant paid the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania the sum of $22.51 which was assessed against it on the sale under the Liquid Fuels Tax Act of Pennsylvania of May 21, 1931, P.L.(Pa.) 149, as amended, 72 P. S. \u00a7\u00a7 2611a to 2611x. The Incandescent Supply - Company subsequently was -adjudged bankrupt and the appellant claimed a priority for $22.50 on the ground that it-was subrogated to the Commonwealth\u2019s rights by reason of its payment of this sum. The referee\u2019s order disallowing the priority was affirmed by the District Court. This recital makes it plain that the differences between the earlier case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the case at bar are formal. The tax here is gasoline, not processing; the tax has not been illegally collected, the appellant who paid the tax is suing his consumer; and the bankruptcy of the latter makes the right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>if any, by way of subrogation rather than direct. In essence, however, the problem of the two cases is the same. How much has the legislative body adhered to mechanics and how little to equity? Has it been more interested in collection and less in burden ?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The writings of the tax theorists indicate a steady abandonment of taxation according to benefit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether that tendency has been wise or not is beyond our scope. Here, as elsewhere, the selfish forces on each side avoid the golden mean. The revenue for roads affords an illustration of the full turn of the wheel. The toll road and the toll gate figure in much of our literature, legal and otherwise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a child, the writer remembers many such around his Mother\u2019s home in Harrisburg in this State. The pendulum swung to the public road system and the right of everyone to ride at the expense of the community.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the last twenty years it has swung partly back again and we have the Holland Tunnel, the Camden Bridge, the new Pennsylvania Highway, and the gasoline tax.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We say partly because our Federal system and the temptation movement toward diversion preclude any scientific evaluation of road use and the payment therefor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The mechanics of tax collection become complicated in proportion to the number and triviality of transactions. Incidence goes according to economic theory; impact is a matter of legislative selection. Where the theory prescribes many and little, the lawmaker shifts to fewer and larger. We find one of the draftsmen of the first (Oregon) gasoline tax saying: \u201c \u2018After he had prepared the bill and submitted it to the committee, and then to the House, it was thought that the method of collection of the tax would be too expensive. I then prepared a bill changing the plan of collection from the local' gas seller to the source of distribution, viz., the wholesaler of gas. As I remember it, at that time there were but four wholesale distributing plants. This bill became the law.\u2019 \u201d Crawford, Motor Fuel Taxation in the United States (1939) p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-19\">That pattern has been generally followed and is followed in our statute. In fact our statute is significant in that it marks a change of policy. The original act adopted the administratively difficult theory of attempting to have impact and incidence coincide and \u201ctaxed\u201d the consumer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> *****Furthermore, the present Act even softened the customary gesture towards equity and substituted a mild \u201cand shall be borne by the consumer\u201d for the original provision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">We think that this statute points even more plainly than the refund provision of the- Agricultural Adjustment Act. The person in the tax relation to the state is identified in meticulous detail. The principal section of the statute reads: \u201cDistributors shall be liable to the Commonwealth for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this act. The tax imposed by this act shall be collected by the distributor at the time the liquid fuels are used or sold and delivered by the distributor and shall be borne by the consumer\u201d. <em>72 </em>P.S. \u00a7 261 Id, par. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-21\">In its supplementary sections, the law advises the distributors that (1) they must obtain a permit and furnish a bond, <em>72 </em>P. S. \u00a7 2611c; (2) they must pay the tax and report such payment, 72 P.S. \u00a7 26Ilf; (3) they must keep records and have them available for examination, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2611h, 261 li; (4) they and they alone are entitled to refunds, 72 P.S. \u00a7 261 lq. That relationship is not altered by any attempt to shift according to the true incidence or by any legislative expression of what that true incidence is. In the analogous statute of the State of New York, the language shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the incidence is more vigorous,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and yet even here the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denies priority and so subrogation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">There being no primary obligation, we are not concerned with the rather confused state of this phase of the law of subrogation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-14\"> The first case is New Consumers Bread Company v.
