HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">This appeal brings up a deficiency in income taxes assessed against the taxpayer for the year 1935, and depends upon what shall be taken as the \u201cbasis\u201d in calculating her gain or loss upon the sale in that year of certain shares of stock, inherited from her father as part of a remainder, limited to her in a testamentary trust. He died on August 16, 1915, having devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate to his executors in trust for the life of his wife, the taxpayer\u2019s mother; they upon her death \u201cto transfer, deliver and pay over to my daughter, Elsie Van Vranken\u201d (the taxpayer) \u201cif she shall outlive my wife, the remaining equal one-half part of the remainder of my estate. * * * If my daughter, Elsie Van Vranken, should die during her mother\u2019s lifetime, leaving lawful issue her surviving, then upon the death of my wife, I order and direct my said Executors and Trustees to transfer, deliver and pay over the remaining one-h\u00e1lf part to the issue of my daughter, Elsie Van Vranken, in equal shares.\u201d The testator\u2019s wife outlived him and died on April 26, 1930; shortly thereafter the trustees delivered to the taxpayer the shares now in question, which, as we have said, she sold in 1935. The only question is whether the \u201cbasis\u201d for computing her gain or loss is the value of the shares at the time of the testator\u2019s death or at the time of his wife\u2019s. In the first event there would be a gain; in the second, a loss. The Commissioner held that the date of the testator\u2019s death fixed the \u201cbasis,\u201d and so the Board found, basing its decision, however, upon the law of New York under which it held that the remainder was vested. We do not find it necessary to consider that question because we think that the testator\u2019s death is the proper date, even if the remainder . was contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-24\">Section 202(a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 229, defined the \u201cbasis\u201d for the sale of property \u201cacquired\u201d by will or descent as its value \u201cat the time of * * * acquisition\u201d; and the Acts of 1924 and 1926 (\u00a7 204(a) (5) ) 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, pages 8, 152, were the same. In 1928 this was changed; specific bequests and all real property, whether passing by devise or descent, were valued as of the death of the decedent, and so was all property passing from him to his \u201cestate\u201d; but all else was valued as of \u201cthe time of the distribution to the taxpayer.\u201d \u00a7 113(a) (5), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, p. 380. The Act of 1932 was in the same form, 26 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 515, but in 1934 Congress went back to the original, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 697, which it has repeated in the Acts of 1936 and 1938, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 860, 1048. The phrase, \u201cat the time of acquisition,\u201d seems to have been borrowed from the regulations promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1918 (Art. 56 of Regulations 45) where it first appeared. Very shortly thereafter the Commissioner construed this regulation as meaning the death of the testator, when the remainder was vested, and the occurrence of the limiting condition, when it was contingent. The first intimation to the contrary was in the regulations of 1934, which provided that the date of the decedent\u2019s death should be that of \u201cacquisition\u201d whether the remainder was vested or contingent (Article 113(a) (5), Regulations 86) and this all later regulations have repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">There had, meanwhile, grown up a large body of judicial construction of the acts before <em>1934 </em>which uniformly accepted the administrative ruling and which we cite in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the well-recognized canon of statutory construction that the reenactment of a statute incorporates \u25a0 preceding judicial interpretations, a strong case can therefore be made against the regulation of 1934, which Judge Soper put most persuasively in Reynolds v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 114 F.2d 804. Moreover, although an argument the other way might have been based upon the change in 1934 from \u201cdistribution\u201d back to \u201cacquisition,\u201d the Senate Committee Report shows that Congress was then concerned only to end the option which \u201cdistribution\u201d had given to executors to choose the most profitable time for setting up testamentary trusts. Brewster v. Gage, 280 U.S. 327, 50 S.Ct. 115, 74 L.Ed. 457, had decided that under the statute before 1928 a legatee \u201cacquired\u201d his bequest at the death of the testator, aqd Congress wished to make this the date for trustees in all cases. Were it not for the change in the attitude of the Supreme Court towards the common-law distinction between contingent and vested remainders (Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 60 S. Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604, 125 A.L.R. 1368) we should therefore find it difficult to escape the force of the reasoning in Reynolds v. Commissioner, supra (114 F.2d 804).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">It is true that the question before the Supreme Court was very different from that at bar; it did not even concern income taxes at all; it was whether a remainder limited upon a life estate could be said to have passed by a transfer \u201cintended to take effect in possession or enjoyment\u201d at the settlor\u2019s death, when that event, by determining that the remainderman was the survivor, ended the possibility that the settlor might take the property. But in deciding that question the court declared that the whole distinction of the common law between vested and contingent remainders was irrelevant; it was enough that the remainder, which had before been subject to defeat, became indefeasible by the settlor\u2019s death; that .alone was a \u201ctransfer.\u201d The supposititious difference between an existing interest, subject to a condition, and an interest, non-existent before condition fulfilled, was said to preclude \u201ca fair and workable tax system\u201d; the \u201celusive and subtle casuistries\u201d which it involved might \u201chave historic justification,\u201d but were of no moment \u201cfor tax purposes\u201d (309 U.S. page 118, 60 S.Ct. page 450, 84 L.Ed. 604, 125 A.L.R. 1368). In the case at bar we have substantially the same question though in a different form; we are to say whether a remainderman \u201cacquires\u201d any .interest before it becomes certain that he will ever enjoy it. Whether one is forced to regard conditional existence as non-existence is after all a question in ontology which judges are ill fitted to answer. Practically a conditional interest \u201cexists\u201d in the sense that the holder can sell it and \u2014 if the condition is not his own survivorship \u2014 can bequeath it; and, as a new matter divorced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>from history, we should say that its \u201cacquisition\u201d dates from the time when he achieves that much control over it, like an unconditional interest whose enjoyment is merely postponed. But the problem is not that, for nobody disputes that under the rulings on which the taxpayer relies a \u201cvested\u201d remainder, \u201csubject to be divested,\u201d is \u201cacquired\u201d when it \u201cvests.\u201d We may start with that as datum and have only to say whether there is any difference for the purposes of taxation between such a remainder and one which the common law would have regarded as \u201ccontingent\u201d ab initio ; the choice is not between a conditional and an unconditional interest simpliciter, but between conditional remainders as they were differently classified by the phantom casuistry of the common law. That distinction we understand the Supreme Court to have repudiated as a determinant of tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">It may indeed be reasonable \u00e1 priori to say that our fiscal system was meant to fit upon the old mould as a whole; convenience in administration might make up for the lame 'correspondence between concept and polity. If Helvering v. Hallock, supra (309 U.S. 106, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604, 125 A.L.R. 1368), had merely decided that the later cases were erroneously decided under the ancient rubrics, its decision would not be helpful here. But that was not the measure of the holding; it meant to jettison the distinction as an archaism no longer appropriate to existing needs; and it is as little appropriate to \u00a7 113(a) (5) as to \u00a7 302(c) of the Estate Tax. Moreover, quite aside from the asymmetry which its survival would create, it would be particularly unsuitable for salvage here. Any increase in value between the testator\u2019s death and the death of the life holder \u2014 or whatever other event may put an end to the condition upon the remainder \u2014 is certainly a \u201cgain\u201d if it is \u201crealized.\u201d One may debate the propriety of taxing it to the remainderman rather than to the estate; but one cannot dispute that it is properly taxable to some one under the system as it stands. Nor is this conclusion shaken by the fact that the doctrine will permit the deductions of losses as well as the addition of gains, for prima facie all \u201crealized\u201d changes in value are factors in computing income.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The canon which the taxpayer invokes is sometimes a help, but w.e must never ignore the more important, though impalpable, factors. Indeed, nothing is so likely to lead us astray as an abject reliance upon canons of any sort; so much the whole history of verbal interpretation teaches, if it teaches anything. At times one is more likely to reach the truth by an unanalyzed and intuitive conclusion from the text as a whole, than by following, step by step, the accredited guides. Therefore, while without Helvering v. Hallock, supra (309 U.S. 106, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604, 125 A.L.R. 1368), we should probably have felt obliged to hold that the statute incorporated the earlier rulings of the lower courts, it appears to us that, with that decision before us, we should not preserve what would now be no more than an egregious exception in the fiscal scheme as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\"> Chandler v.
