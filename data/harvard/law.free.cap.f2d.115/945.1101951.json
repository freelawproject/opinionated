D.C.Code, Supp. V, Tit. 20, \u00a7 970f, allowed as a credit against the business privilege tax \u201cany tax on tangible personal property * * * levied against, and <em>paid by, </em>the taxpayer to the District * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It appears affirmatively from the record and from admissions in open court that the personal property tax in question was not paid until after the Board\u2019s decision. Consequently, there was not at the time any right to the credit. D.C.Code, Supp. V, Tit. 20, \u00a7 974, allows an appeal to the Board \u201cprovided such person shall <em>first pay </em>such tax * * * It is plain that there had been no overpayment and the Board was without jurisdiction. The stipulation of the parties could not confer it. The order denying refund is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-22\"> Emphasis supplied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
