Appellee also makes no reply to appellant\u2019s brief in opposition, thus throwing an unwarrant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>able burden on opposing counsel and this court, the impropriety being heightened by appellee\u2019s taking advantage of our rule to submit the matter without aiding the court by argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">It is not shown that appellee ever applied to the district court, much less that it applied within ten days of the entry of judgment for the amendment of its findings under Rule 52 (b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. Rule 75 (h) gives to the district court and to this court power to correct the record only as to \u201cwhat occurred in the district court\u201d not to add or cause to be added to the record findings which were never made. This court has no general authority over the district court to require any such judicial act as the making of findings at the request of one not appealing from the district court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The motion is an unwarranted attempt by appellee to \u201cmend its hold\u201d on the appeal after failing to exercise its rights in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Petition denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">MATHEWS, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
