Dye, 2 Cir., 108 F.2d 38. At that time we said that it lay in the discretion of the judge whether to allow the mortgagee to foreclose when the proceeding was only three weeks old. That, we thought, was scarcely long enough to determine that no \u201cplan of reorganization\u201d was possible. However, we concluded by saying: \u201cwe do not suggest that, in the absence of some very radically different change in the prospects, it would be justifiable to hold off the mortgagee any longer.\u201d That was on December 11, 1939, and the mortgagee moved again on February 5, 1940. The judge concluded that, due to the war, the value of the ship had much increased since the last motion, so that she was then worth $220,000; and that, as the sum of the principal and interest of the mortgage was about $200,000, there was an equity to be saved, which justified holding off the mortgagee still longer. Moreover, the trustee alleged that he had an offer in writing of $257,000, on which the proposed buyer had made a substantial deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-19\">We left open in Re Murel Holding Corporation, 2 Cir., 75 F.2d 941, whether under \u00a7 77B, sub. b(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207, sub. b(5), which has now become \u00a7 216(7), 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 616(7), the general creditors of the debtor might force a senior lienor into a \u201cplan of reorganization\u201d without his consent, although the four possibilities left to the debtor in such a case are in fact scarcely more than ways, either of paying off the lien, or of not affecting the substance of the lienor\u2019s rights. We shall again assume, arguendo, that there may be a \u201cplan of reorganization\u201d into which the mortgagee can be forced in invitum, but it must certainly contain more than holding him off at the mortgagor\u2019s convenience. Chapter X, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 501 et seq., was not intended merely to give mortgagors a moratorium upon foreclosure. When the order now on appeal was made, the proceeding was fourteen months old, and the debtor had not put forward any plan; indeed it does not now even intimate that there ever will be any beyond selling the vessel. Such a showing does not justify further delay; moreover, we can see no reason why the mortgagee should not be allowed to foreclose in due course, if so advised, and not be confined to a sale in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-20\">Order reversed; leave granted to foreclose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
