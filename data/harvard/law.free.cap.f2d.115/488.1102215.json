HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">This is an appeal from a judgment dismissing a complaint for insufficiency on its face and must therefore be decided solely upon its allegations. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was an unincorporated labor union whose members are engaged in producing electrical machinery and the like, and which had been chosen as collective bargaining representative \u201cby numerous employees,\u201d and certified by the National Labor Relations Board \u201con numerous occasions\u201d; so that now it is the representative \"of the majority of employees in the said industry and certified as such in a vast majority of the cases wherein such disputes had arisen.\u201d The defendant, International Brotherhood, is also an unincorporated labor union whose members are engaged \u201cprimarily * * * in the installation of electrical equipment.\u201d Two other defendants are locals of the Brotherhood, and all the corporate defendants except the National Electric Products Corporation are \u201cengaged in the handling and installing of electrical machinery\u201d; the National Electric Products Corporation is a manufacturer of such machinery. All the defendants have conspired \u201cto deprive the plaintiff of the right conferred upon and guaranteed to it\u201d by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., \u201cas the representative of its members and other workers in the said industry for collective bargaining.\u201d To carry out tjiis conspiracy the defendants agreed among themselves and with others; (a) \u201cnot to allow\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s members and other workmen \u201cto freely choose their own representatives for the purpose of bargaining collectively * * * but to coerce them to designate\u201d the Brotherhood, or its creatures; (b) to prevent members of the Brotherhood from installing any electrical machinery made by workmen who had chosen the plaintiff as their bargaining representative; and (c) to notify all employers that unless they refused to bargain collectively with the plaintiff when it was chosen as bargaining representative, they would not install the products of these employers and would prevent their installation. That, further to carry out the conspiracy the defendants (d) boycotted all products made by these employers, among which were those made by the plaintiff\u2019s members employed in shops in which it had been chosen the bargaining representative; and (e) had notified \u201call dealers and jobbers in electrical machinery\u201d of the boycott, because of which many of those notified stopped handling such products.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">These objects the defendants carried out (1) by. \u201cagitation, propaganda, and other organizational work, in order to wean away the members of the plaintiff from their allegiance\u201d; (2) by \u201cslander and vilification of the plaintiff\u201d to induce other workmen to join the Brotherhood and, again, \u201cto wean away\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s members; (3) by the employer-defendants\u2019 discharging such of their employees as had become members of the plaintiff; (4) by spreading rumors that unless the employees of the employer-defendants chose the Brotherhood as bargaining representative, they would boycott the products of any employer who recognized any other representative. By these means many employees who would otherwise have chosen the plaintiff had been led to choose the Brotherhood as bargaining .r\u00e9presentative, by which the plaintiff had suffered damage in the amount of $250,000. (Although the complaint said nothing about interstate commerce, we shall assume that the industry in which the .plaintiff\u2019s members were employed and suffered the putative wrongs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>was interstate in such sense as to be subject to the National Labor Relations Act.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">We shall first try to state the plaintiff\u2019s legal position as we understand it. Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act did not \u201ccreate a new right,\u201d but \u201csecured\u201d an old one; and for this reason it did not limit the remedies available \u2022 for its protection to those laid down in the act itself; that is, recourse to the Board and to the courts only through the Board. It is true that as to \u201cunfair labor practices,\u201d the Board\u2019s powers are \u201cexclusive,\u201d \u00a7 10 (a) ; but the very fact that they were expressly made so in that instance should be taken to indicate that they were not to be exclusive as to other \u201crights,\u201d and especially as to the \u201cright secured\u201d by \u00a7 7. While \u00a7 9 gives the Board power to investigate \u201cand decide controversies as to who is the true bargaining representative of the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit or subdivision thereof,\u201d and while the Board\u2019s certificate may be reviewed incidentally to the review of an order forbidding \u201can unfair labor practice,\u201d \u00a7 9 (d), that is not a remedy for the violation of the \u201cright secured\u201d by \u00a7 7. Moreover, it is not to be supposed that because no remedy was expressly given, none was intended; on the contrary there is a remedy for the violation of every right, and here there is none unless the federal courts can give it. Those courts therefore have a jurisdiction under \u00a7 24 (1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(1), because the action \u201carises under the * * * laws of the United States.\u201d (Incidentally, it is not necessary that the amount in controversy should be $3,000, because the action also arises under a \u201claw regulating commerce,\u201d \u00a7 24 (8). But that it is not necessary so to decide, because in any event the amount at stake is far more than the necessary amount.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The plaintiff in saying that \u00a7 7 did not \u201ccreate\u201d a new \u201cright,\u201d but merely \u201csecured\u201d an old one, borrows from the language used in Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., 309 U.S. 261, 263, 60 S.Ct. 561, 84 L.Ed. 738, but we think that it has misapplied what the court said. Before 1935 the states had generally recognized that employees had a \u201clegally protected interest\u201d in collective bargaining, but they differed as to the extent to which the conflicting interest of the employer was an excuse for its invasion. The National Labor Relations Act spoke to that background and \u201csecured\u201d the existing \u201cright,\u201d but by more than the bestowal of new remedies. When by \u00a7 7 Congress declared that the interest of employees in collective bargaining should be protected, it fixed by its own fiat what conflicting .interests, if any\u2014 whether of employers or others \u2014 should be excuses for invading it. And while a pufist might indeed insist that that \u201ccreated\u201d a new \u201cright,\u201d the meaning of the court is entirely clear; it was speaking of . the fact that Congress did not legislate in vacuo. Two consequences follow from this: One, that the plaintiff\u2019s action here \u201carises under the * * * laws of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 24 (1) of the Judicial Code; and the other, that the statute did not merely give new remedies for violations of rights created by, the states, but set up a procedure to protect a right which the act itself had basically reconstructed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As to the merits, we think that the procedure set forth in the act is the full measure of the remedies available to the plaintiff. We agree that if \u00a7 7 had made up the whole statute, the customary remedies would probably have been open to an injured party. Indeed, in Texas &amp; New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks, 281 U.S. 548, 50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034, the Supreme Court went much farther. Having before it the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., a highly articulated piece of legislation which gave wide powers to the Board of .Mediation, it nevertheless held that \u00a7 2, sub. \u201cThird,\u201d which protected the right of collective bargaining against \u201cinterference, influence, or coercion,\u201d implicitly gave the customary judicial remedies to any party aggrieved. And again in Virginian Railway v. System Federation No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, 57 S.Ct. 592, 81 L.Ed. 789, the court held that under the Railway Labor Act of 1934, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., the decision of the Board of Mediation was enforcible by mandatory injunction, though Congress had not provided any legal remedy whatever. It is apparent therefore that no general principle forbids recourse to a court under a statute of this general purport, and that the case at bar must be decided by an analysis of the National Labor Relations Act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">As to at least one of the defendants, the National Electric Products Corporation, there can be no doubt. Its part in the alleged conspiracy was clearly an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201cunfair labor practice\u201d under \u00a7 8 (1), and as such it was justiciable only by the Board under \u00a7 10 (a). The same may be true as to the other employer-defendants, for, while they are not employers of the plaintiff\u2019s members, it is at least arguable that \u00a7 2 (3), 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152, subd. 3, makes it an \u201cunfair labor practice\u201d for the employers of employees who install electrical machinery \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce\u201d the employees of employers who make it. However, since that would still leave unanswered the complaint as to the defendant unions, we pass ,the point, because in any event the plaintiff has no cause of action as against those unions. We need not say that no one but an employer can violate the \u201cright- secured\u201d by \u00a7 7; violations by a competing union may indeed become crucial in the Board\u2019s action. We are concerned only whether, assuming that there is a violation, the usual remedies are open to employees in the federal courts; and we agree that the fact that those courts may not be open to employers is not conclusive. Congress might have thought that violations by others stood outside the general scheme, and have left them to the courts to deal with like other wrongs. Indeed, if there be violations which lie so far outside the scope of the Board\u2019s general powers that the judgment of a court would not interfere with the discharge of its functions, they may be justiciable in the usual way. But here we have to deal with the efforts of a competing union to obstruct the free choice of another union as bargaining representative; and we think that -to allow courts to decide that issue might impair, and on occasion actually nullify, the plan as a whole. It is true, as the plaintiff says, that the Board has no preventive jurisdiction over unlawful acts of the defendant unions; it cannot order them \u201cto cease and desist,\u201d and for that reason a court alone could nip the plaintiff\u2019s wrongs in the bud and protect it from losing members, to the damage of its pocket and its prestige and to the loss of its position as bargaining representative. It is, however, not true that the Board has no kind of jurisdiction; \u00a7 9 (c) gives it complete power over the choice of bargaining representatives ; it may investigate all disputes \u201cconcerning the representation of employees\u201d and \u201ccertify\u201d the winner \u2014 ordering a new election if need be. In such an investigation it would be charged with the duty of examining whether the \u201cright secured\u201d by \u00a7 7 had been violated; an election secured by unlawful means is no election at all, and the Board would be bound to cancel it and take proper measures to eliminate from the new election the effect of past wrongs, as much when they emanated from a competing union, as when they did from an employer. The issues determined by the judgment here will therefore be, or at least may be, the same as those which the Board must determine if and when the plaintiff, having been displaced, seeks to reestablish itself as bargaining representative. From this it is evident that if a judgment here would be res judicata in such sense as to conclude the Board, the action must certainly fail; Congress meant above all to entrust to it the choice of bargaining representatives, subject only to such review as might be possible under \u00a7 9 (d) ; it would certainly circumscribe its authority to subject it to the estoppel of a judgment inter partes. If on the other hand the judgment would not be res judicata as to the Board, it would, if successful, control the conduct of the defendants meanwhile; before the question reached the Board in a proceeding under \u00a7 9 (c), it would enjoin them from proselytizing on the theory that they were violating the \u201cright secured\u201d by \u00a7 7. But that would as much obstruct the exercise of the Board\u2019s functions as though the judgment were an estoppel, because the Board might not agree with the court that the conduct enjoined did in fact violate the \u201cright secured\u201d by \u00a7 7. Yet when the Board came to choose the bargaining representative under \u00a7 9 (c), the defendants would have been cut off from electioneering which the .court thought wrongful' but which the Board did not, and it would not appear what effect that might have had upon the election. The Board would be faced with a status quo which it could not remedy, but which it would not have countenanced if it could have helped. We are not clear that Oberman &amp; Co. v. United Garment Workers, D.C., 21 F.Supp. 20, must be construed otherwise, but if so we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> We do not hold that the plaintiff has no recourse to any court for the loss of its members; that may; or may not, be so. But if it has, the suit does not \u201carise under the * * * laws of the United States,\u201d the only basis of jurisdiction here put forward; its gravamen must be a violation of the law of a state. But \u00a7 7 does not protect a union against that kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>wrong committed by a competing union except as an incident to the determination by the Board of its right to act as a bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
