Stewart, the deceased, was a switchman in the employ of appellant. February 12, 1937, he was engaged at East\" St. Louis, Illinois, in coupling up certain cars on track No. 12 in appellant\u2019s yards. Several of said cars contained goods which were en route in interstate commerce from various states of the United States to various other states of the United States. While engaged in such duties, Stewart\u2019s arm was crushed by impact between the couplers of two cars of the train. It was charged by appellee that he died on February 14, 1937 as a result of such injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-21\">The suit is based upon an alleged violation of the Safety Appliance Act, Act of March 2, 1893, c. 196, Sec. 2, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2, as amended by Act of March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 943, c. 976, 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 8-10, and is brought under the Federal Ehiployers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-22\">Mary Steyvart, plaintiff below, and the original appellee in this court, was the wife of deceased, and brought this suit April 20, 1937, to recover damages for the alleged wrongful death of the deceased as an-employee of the appellant railroad, and also, for his conscious pain and suffering proximately caused by the alleged violation by said appellant of the provisions of the Federal Safety Appliance Act, in furnishing on its line any car \u201cused in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-23\">After the filing of the suit Mr. H. B. Haun, assistant general claim agent of the appellant' Southern Railway Company, made a number of attempts, by personal contact and through others, at his request, to enter into negotiations for the settlement of this cause; and, during this period, amounts in settlement from $1,000 to $5,000 were tentatively offered to Mrs. Stewart, but not accepted. Finally, according to the testimony of Haun, he learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that one Henry Hamm, the husband of a daughter of plaintiff, was, by his opposition, blocking the settlement. Hamm at that time was a switchman in the employ of the Terminal Railroad Association, which is owned by sixteen proprietary lines, of \"which appellant herein is one. The Terminal Association therefore readily accedes to all proper requests of the individual carriers. Mr. Haun testifies that when he learned of Mr. Hamm\u2019s attitude he called on Mr. J. L. Howell (now deceased), attorney for the Terminal Association, with offices at the Union Station in St. Louis, Missouri. To Mr. Howell,. Haun testifies he said: \u201cMr. Howell, we oftentimes have cases where we have our own employees who are blocking these settlements. Here we haveAa case where we know that is what has happened, and I wish you would talk to Mr. Hamm about it\u201d. Mr. Howell then called up the east side office of the Southern Railway, where Hamm was employed, and requested that \u201cthey have Bill Hamm come in and see me at his first opportunity\u201d. When Hamm came in Howell referred to the death of the deceased, and the claim of the widow and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">\u201c \u2018They are offering to pay her five thousand dollars clear and she is willing to take it, but they say that you are standing in the way.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c \u2018Yes\u2019, he said, \u2018I am, because I don\u2019t want that woman gypped out of what money she gets.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cI said, \u2018How about the five thousand dollars ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201cHe said, \u2018That is the reason; that is all right to settle for that, if she gets the five thousand dollars.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cI said, \u2018What would it take to convince you that she would get the five thousand dollars ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201c \u2018Well\u2019, he said, \u2018I want it put in writing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201c \u2018Well, now\u2019, I said, \u2018they can\u2019t do that. Railroads don\u2019t do that, put things in writing like that. It is not right. 'If the Southern tells you that they will pay your mother-in-law five thousand dollars clear, you can depend on what they tell you.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t know whether he could or not. I said, \u2018You know Bruce Campbell, don\u2019t you?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">\u201cHe said, \u2018Yes, I do\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">\u201cI said, \u2018If Bruce Campbell tells you that they will see that your mother-in-law gets five thousand dollars clear, and they stand all other expense, would you not believe him?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-15\">\u201c \u2018Well\u2019, he said, T would rather it would be put in writing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">\u201c\u00cd said, \u2018Would you believe me if I would tell you right now ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-17\">\u201c \u2018Yes, if you tell me that I will believe it\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-18\">\u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Campbell will tell you the same thing\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-19\">\u201cHe said, \u2018If he will do that, that is all right.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-21\">\u201cI turned around to my desk and called Bruce Campbell. I talked with Bruce Campbell and stated, in Mr. Hamm\u2019s presence, re-stated what I had already stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-22\">\u201cMr. Campbell says, \u2018That is correct.\u2019 He said, \u2018Is Hamm there?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-23\">\u201cI said, \u2018Hamm is right here now, listening, and Hamm says it is all right, that he thinks five thousand dollars is a reasonable settlement, if she gets that much money, and I have myself guaranteed him that she will get that, if you say so.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-24\">\u201cHe says, \u2018Why not have him come right up here ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-25\">\u201cI said, \u2018That would be fine.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-26\">\u201cI said to Hamm, \u2018Hamm, can you go right up to Mr. Campbell\u2019s office?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-27\">\u201cHe said, \u2018Sure\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-28\">\u201cI said, \u2018Hop on a car.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-29\">\u201c \u2018Go on, Hamm, and whatever Bruce Campbell tells you I will guarantee\u2019, and he went out of the office. He said goodbye, shook hands, and away he went. That was the whole conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-30\">\u201cAt that time I was under the impression that it was an accident, and they were settling it up. I knew nothing more about it, or heard nothing more about it, until Mr. Noell called me up on the telephone and had a conversation about the suit. I said I didn\u2019t know there was a suit. I think the next morning I saw in the paper that there had been a suit filed\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-31\">On November 30, 1937, there was a meeting in the office of. Kramer, Campbell, Costello &amp; Wiechert, attorneys for appellant, for the purpose of effecting a settlement with Mrs. Stewart on account of the death of her husband. Those present were Mr. Wiechert, attorney for appellant, Mary Stewart, widow of deceased, her daughter, Mrs. Henry Hamm, and her husband, Henry Hamm. It appears in the testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Mrs. Stewart had not previously agreed to this settlement, but did so finally, whereupon Wiechert, Mrs. Stewart, and Mr. and Mrs. Hamm repaired to the Probate Court of St. Clair County, Illinois, at Belleville, in which court the administration of the estate of John R. Stewart, deceased, was pending. The petition of Mrs. Stewart for leave to settle the case against appellant and relieve the latter from further liability in the premises was filed. The amount of the settlement consisted of $5,150, which included an attorney\u2019s fee of $150, which was paid to a Mr. Felsen, an attorney called in by Mr. Wiechert to represent Mrs. Stewart, instead of Mr. Noell, her attorney who filed the suit. The Probate Court, on that day, made its order approving said settlement. At a later date Mrs. Stewart filed in the said Probate Court a petition to set aside the previous order of that court authorizing and approving said settlement of November 30, 1937, alleging that the papers signed by her, praying for authority to settle, were signed as a result of fraud and duress on the part of appellant, and its agents and attorneys. After hearing in the Probate Court, her motion to set aside the approval of said settlement was denied. * Subsequently, at the trial of this cause in the District Court, Mrs. Stewart testified that she was induced by fraud and duress to file the petition and procure the order of compromise in the Probate Court because of her fear, induced, in part at least, by a statement of Mr. Wiechert which she took to mean that if she declined to do so, her son-in-law Hamm might lose his position with the Terminal Railroad Association, in which case it would be difficult, if not impossible, to secure other employment, and his wife, Mrs. Stewart\u2019s daughter, and their children, would be reduced to privation and suffering thereby. The testimony of her daughter, Mrs. Hamm, corroborated that of Mrs. Stewart. At this point the offer of appellant to introduce evidence of the alleged compromise and that its setting aside was rejected by the Probate Court was denied upon objection by counsel for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The case was duly tried in the district court, notwithstanding said purported settlement, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee in the sum of $17,500. Hamm did not testify at the trial. From the judgment entered upon that finding this appeal is taken. After the submission thereof, the death of Mary Stewart, administratrix, was duly suggested, and, pursuant to stipulation of courfeel, Clarence A. Stewart, as administrator of the estate of John R. Stewart, deceased, was substituted as appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">1. The first point urged by appellant in its brief and argument is that the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict because, (a) the record contains no evidence that the deceased attempted to open the coupler knuckles by using the pin-lifter, an appliance provided to operate the automatic coupler, and (b) because the record contains no evidence that an inefficient coupler was the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">2. The next following points and authorities concern the error assigned because of the action of the trial court in disregarding, and, in effect, setting aside the action of the Probate Court in allowing the compromise settlement referred to, and in refusing to set the same aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">3. It is insisted that neither fraud nor duress may be predicated on the facts and circumstances in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">4. Error is assigned to a part of the court\u2019s charge that, in the absence of evidence that Stewart did not use the pin-lifter, the law presumes that he did use it before going between the ends of the cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">1. With respect to this first specification of error relied upon, of course it must be recognized that the sole charge of breach of duty against defendant-appellant is that it furnished the car or cars, here concerned, equipped with couplers not of statutory requirement. It is only because of its bearing upon this charge that evidence concerning the condition of the pin-lifter there in attendance, and its use, or disuse, by the deceased, is relevant. Direct evidence upon these crucial points is lacking. The absence of such sufficiently direct testimony was apparently recognized by the court, and inspired the adding of the following paragraph to its charge: \u201cYou are instructed that it was the duty of deceased, in the performance of his work, before going between the cars mentioned in the evidence, to couple the same, to use the device mentioned in the evidence known as the pin lifter, extending on the outside of the car, and in the absence of any evidence that he did not use the pin lifter, the law presumes that he did use the pin lifter before going between the ends of the cars, if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>find he did go between the ends of the cars\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The only parts of the record that could bear upon the condition of the pin-lifter is the testimony of the witness Stogner, especially that found upon pages 29, 31, 34, 36 and 40 of the \u2022 transcript. The Supreme Court has held that the statute must be liberally construed so as to give a right of recovery for every injury the proximate cause of which was failure to comply with the Act. The jury may not be permitted to speculate as to the cause of the injury, and \u201cthe case must be withdrawn from its consideration, unless there is evidence from which the inference may reasonably be drawn that the injury suffered was caused by the negligent act of the employer\u201d. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Toops, 281 U.S. 351, 354, 355, 50 S.Ct. 281, 282, 74 L.Ed. 896. We are asked to declare that, on the record before us, the motions of appellant for a directed verdict and for a verdict in its favor non obstante veredicto should have been sustained; but in view of that record we cannot say that the inference might not reasonably have been drawn by the triers of the fact that there was probable cause to believe that the injury suffered was caused by the breach of duty charged. As hereafter shown the court\u2019s charge, to which exception is urged, was erroneous, and necessarily potentially prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">2. The main contention of appellant that the tidal court erred in refusing to recognize the order and judgment of the Probate Court of St. Clair County, Illinois, is based upon the insistence that the action of the wife of the deceased to recover for the death of her husband, especially his pain and suffering, was an asset of decedent\u2019s estate of which the Probate Court had jurisdiction; and that its orders and judgments cannot be attacked collaterally in the federal trial court. The argument of appellee that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction over the claim of appellant is based upon the consideration that, \u201cWhere, as here, the death action is one under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act [45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq.], it is governed exclusively by the federal law. The personal representative does not sue by his inherent right as representative of the estate of the decedent, but by virtue of statutory designation and as trustee for the person or persons on whose behalf the act authorizes recovery. And the recovery is not for the benefit of the estate, is not an asset thereof, but is for the personal benefit of the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the statute\u201d. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. Co. v. Wells-Dickey Trust Co., 275 U.S. 161, loc. cit. 163, 48 S.Ct. 73, 72 L.Ed. 216, 59 A.L.R. 758; Taylor v. Taylor, 232 U.S. 363, 34 S.Ct. 350, 58 L.Ed. 638; Mann v. Minnesota Electric Light &amp; Power Co., 10 Cir., 43 F.2d 36; American Car &amp; Foundry Co. v. Anderson, 8 Cir., 211 F. 301, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The widow was not compelled by law to apply to the Probate Court for authority respecting the compromise of this case, and we think the action of the trial court in rejecting the evidence of approval by the Probate Court of the compromise settlement was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">3. The testimony that the acts of the attorneys and claim agent of the appellant constituted a threat to deprive the son-in-law of Mrs. Stewart of his job with the Terminal Association was not strongly in support of the charge of fraud and duress. Nevertheless, it disclosed circumstances which may well have impressed the jury with their impropriety in consideration of the relationship of the various parties concerned. It is to be noted that the entire defense of the appellant was conducted by attorneys for the Terminal, and that the settlement of the suit was initiated by the Terminal attorney. The attorney who filed. the suit was not consulted with respect to the settlement. Counsel for appellant insist that \u201cneither fraud nor duress may be predicated on the facts and circumstances in evidence\u201d. But we think they meet the requirements of the charge, as heretofore declared by this court in Winget v. Rockwood, 69 F.2d 326, 330:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * There is no legal standard of resistance with which the victim must comply at the peril of being rem\u00e9diless for a wrong done, and no general rule as to the sufficiency of facts to produce duress. The question in each case is whether the person so acted upon, by threats of the person claiming the benefit of the contract, was bereft of the quality of mind essential to the making of a contract, and whether the contract was thereby obtained. In other words, duress is not to be tested by the character of the threats, but rather by the effect produced thereby on the mind of the victim. The means used, the age, sex, state of health, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>mental characteristics of the victim are all evidentiary, but the ultimate fact in issue is whether such person was bereft of the free exercise of his will power.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u201cThe trend of modern authority is to the effect that a contract obtained by so oppressing a person by threats as to deprive him of the tree exercise of his will may be voided on \u2019the ground of duress. What constitutes duress is a matter of law, whether duress exists in a particular transaction is usually a matter of fact\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We think that, at least this point should be left to the consideration of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">4. The charge of the court to which an express specification of objection is preserved is, as has been said, erroneous for the reason that it is inconsistent with the burden of proof imposed by law upon a plaintiff. The Supreme Court has settled this question, as we think, finally and conclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u201cIn an action for damages for personal injuries while the defendant has the burden of proof of contributory negligence, the plaintiff must establish the grounds of defendant\u2019s liability;- and to hold a master responsible a servant must show by substantive proof that the appliances furnished were defective, and knowledge of the defect or some omission in regard thereto. Negligence of defendant will not be inferred from the mere fact that the injury occurred, or from the presumption of care on the part of the plaintiff. There is equally a presumption that the defendant performed his duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> \u201cA plaintiff in the first instance must show negligence on the part of the defendant. * * * The negligence of a defendant cannot be inferred from a presumption of care on the part of the person killed. A presumption in the performance of duty attends the defendant as well as the person killed. It must be overcome by direct evidence. One presumption cannot be built upon another.\u201d Looney v. Metropolitan Railroad Co., 200 U.S. 480, 487, 488, 26 S.Ct. 303, 50 L.Ed. 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The errors assigned have been fully considered and the conclusion is that the judgment below must be reversed and remanded for a new trial in conformity with the views herein expressed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
