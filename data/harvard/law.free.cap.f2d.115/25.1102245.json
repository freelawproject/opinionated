Before issuing specifications and calling for bids for the construction of this tunnel, the District had made a geological study and report. Core drilling was done and an exploratory drift was made at the West portal. The information thus gained was used as the basis for a report as to what the probable conditions of work would be. Both the information and the report were made available to bidders with a provision of the contract later considered protecting the District from a claim that the report is its representation of the existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">The specifications, as advertised, and as later embodied in the contract, called Public Works Contract, contained a clause, \u00a7 7, providing that if at any time the Chief Engineer of the District should be of the opinion that the performance of the contract was unnecessarily or unreasonably delayed, the Chief Engineer, acting on behalf of the District, might by written notice instruct the contractor to discontinue all work under the contract or any part thereof. In any such case the District might take charge of the work and complete it by a new contractor or by force account. In so doing, the District was empowered to take possession of and use any of the materials, plant, tools, -equipment, supplies and property of every kind provided by the contractor for the purposes of his work. It was further provided that when any particular part of the work was being carried on by the District, under the provisions of this clause, the contractor should continue the remainder of the work in conformity with the terms of his contract, and in such manner as in nowise to hinder or interfere with the persons or workmen employed by the District to do any part of the work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Under the circumstances outlined, the Company bid upon the work and was found to be low bidder. Thereupon, for the purpose of establishing the financial responsibility of the Company, a contract referred to as the Supplemental Agreement was negotiated and subscribed by the parties concurrently with the execution of the \u201cPublic Works Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">By the terms of this Supplemental Agreement the Company was required to establish and maintain a construction fund of $250,000 to which should be added all progress payments made by the District to the Company. Against this fund could be charged money expended in the purchase of materials and supplies and in the payment of labor costs for the work to be done under the \u201cPublic Works Contract.\u201d Any difference of opinion as to the propriety of charging a given item against the fund was to be finally determined by the Chief Engineer of the District. The Company covenanted to restore to the fund upon request any money improperly charged against the fund and the District was authorized to withhold sufficient money falling due under the public works contract in an amount equal to any depletion in the event of the Company\u2019s refusal to make the demanded restoration.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The Company commenced construction but from the beginning delays occurred in the progress of the work because the conditions under which the work was performed were much more difficult than had been anticipated when the time for completion had been agreed. There was also evidence that the Company\u2019s methods of meeting the unexpected difficulties were not of the needed and practicable engineering requirements. On December 3, 1934, the District\u2019s engineer notified the Company that the work was unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed and that unless progress improved by January 15, 1935, the District would take over the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">On January 9, 1935, the District, by letter, notified the Company that, according to information available to the District, the construction fund had been depleted in an amount exceeding the progress payment next due, and advised that it was the intention of the District to withhold payment of the December progress payment pending receipt of the full information called for by the notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Finally, on January 15, 1935, the District\u2019s engineer issued his opinion that the work was unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed and instructing the Company to discontinue all work under the contract. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>mand was made for the possession of all property being worked and all materials and equipment used in such work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon the Company\u2019s refusal, a suit was brought by the District to secure possession of the tunnel. The Company was successful in resisting the District\u2019s application for an injunction pendente lite; the District thereupon took possession of the tunnel and appellant\u2019s plant and equipment on February 12, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The Company brought a suit for specific performance of the contract to require possession to be restored to it. That suit was dismissed upon motion of the District on March 11, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">This suit was brought against the District on January 8, 1937, on three counts: (A) Damages for breach of express contract; (B) In quantum meruit for value of materials furnished and work done independent of express contract; and (C) Money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Pursuant to stipulation, the trial court ordered the issue of liability of the District to be tried first, the issue of damages to be tried in the event that liability should be established. The court found against the Company on all three counts and ordered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">A. The Company Not Entitled to Recover for Breach of an Express Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The Company\u2019s theory of recovery under the first count is that both the service upon it of the notice of suspension of work of January 15, 1935, and the subsequent ejectment of the Company on February 12, 1935, from the works were unauthorized acts of actual prevention of performance, either of which constituted a final breach of the contract warranting a recovery on the basis of a prevented full performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The opinion of the District\u2019s Chief Engineer that the work on the tunnel was unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed was final and conclusive upon the Company in the absence of fraud. American-Hawaiian Engineering &amp; Construction Co. v. Butler, 165 Cal. 497, 504, 513, 133 P. 280, Ann.Cas.l916C, 44; Connel v. Higgins, 170 Cal. 541, 150 P. 769; Gray v. Cotton, 166 Cal. 130, 136, 134 P. 1145; Martinsburg &amp; Potomac R. R. Co. v. March, 114 U.S. 549, 551, 552, 5 S.Ct. 1035, <em>29 </em>L.Ed. 255; United States v. Gleason, 175 U.S. 588, 607, 20 S.Ct. 228, 44 L.Ed. 284. The finding of the District Court that the opinion was not fraudulent is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The Company contends that the District did not have the right to suspend the work because:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">(1) The District by its own acts was estopped to assert that the Company had unreasonably and unnecessarily delayed the work of construction of the San Jacinto Tunnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">(2) The District by misrepresenting the physical conditions to be encountered in performing the work was precluded from legally terminating the contract on the ground of unreasonable delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">(3) The District by withholding the December progress payment on January 9, 1935, breached the contract and while the District was thus in default, it could not take over the work under section <em>7 </em>of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The first contention, that of estoppel, which the Company seeks to raise is based on a previous certificate executed by an engineer of the District on December 25, 1934, as follows: \u201cI certify that the materials have been received by me in good condition and in the quantity and quality specified, or the work performed as stated; that the stipulations of the contract and specifications have been complied with; and that there is now due upon this claim the amount stated, no part of which has been paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">That this certificate does not raise the estoppel charged is apparent from the provisions of the contract, numbers 37 and 38, that false or erroneous certificates of completion of work should not estop the District from showing the true condition of work and that acceptance of work by the District would not act as a waiver of any requirement of the contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Under these contractual provisions, the issuance and payment by the District to the Company of the progress estimates contained the foregoing certificate raised no estoppel against the District and constituted no waiver of its right. Mercantile Trust Co. v. Hensey, 205 U.S. 298, 307, 27 S.Ct. 535, 51 L.Ed. 811, 10 Ann.Cas. 572; General Fireproofing Co. v. L. Wallace &amp; Son, 8 Cir., 175 F. 650, 653, certiorari denied 217 U.S. 607, 30 S.Ct. 697, 54 L.Ed. 900; see Monson v. Fischer, 118 Cal.App. 503, 518, 519, 5 P.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The second contention, that of misrepresentation of the physical conditions of work to be encountered in performing the work, is based on the provisions of the geological report setting forth the probable conditions of work and the provisions of the specifications with regard to the materials probably needed. This claim of misrepresentation is insupportable. This court in Six Companies of California v. Joint Highway District No. 13, 9 Cir., 110 F.2d 620, 623, held 'that such reports and specifications do not constitute a warranty or representation of the existence of the conditions as represented by such reports in the presence of an exoneration clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The present case comes within the rule laid down in the Six Companies case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The third contention is that the District could not give its notice of suspension and taking over of the work because the District was guilty of a prior default in withholding the December progress payment due January 9, 1935. The public works contract provides in sections 32 and 33 for the payment of partial estimates \u201cin order to assist the Contractor to prosecute the work advantageously.\u201d Estimates for the period-May 15, 1933, to November 25, 1934, totaling $1,081,568.85, were paid to the Company. The monthly estimate for the period November 25, 1934, to December 25, 1934, was, under the terms of the contract, due and payable to the Company on January 9, 1935. At that time there had been no suspension of the contract and the Company was still engaged in the work. Prior to January 9, 1935, the monthly estimate for the aforesaid period had been prepared and certified by the District\u2019s engineers as correct and due and that the stipulations of the contract and the specifications had been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The delivery of the letter on January 9,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the day the estimate was due and payable, declaring that it was the intention of the District to withhold the amount of the December progress payment pending the receipt of full information as to the status of the construction fund required to be set up under the terms of the supplementary agreement,. and the action of the District in withholding this payment are relied upon by the Company as a breach of contract by the District. From that time on, the Company claims, the District was in default. The argument of the Company continues : \u201cAppellee having thus breached the contract, and having failed and refused to pay appellant the December estimate, even though such failure was promptly called to its attention, was in default under the contract and could not require appellant to perform it. Therefore the demand of January 15, 1935, by the General Manager and Chief Engineer of appellee, that appellant forthwith deliver up possession of the tunnel works together with its plant, tools and equipment to appellee, was a nullity which appellant was justified in disregarding. Undoubtedly the act in serving this notice of January 15, 1935, upon appellant, while appellee was already in default under the contract, constituted a second breach of the contract in the nature of prevention of performance. Appellant again could have abandoned the work and sued appellee for damages for prevention of performance of the contract, and also in quantum meruit for the value of its services and materials furnished. It did not immediately choose to take this course of procedure, but promptly protested the giving of such notice of January 15, 1935, and again called appellee\u2019s attention to the fact that appellee had first breached the contract by its failure to pay appellant its December estimate.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>It is not necessary to determine the merits of the contention that the District was in default by reason of its withholding of the December progress payment. Assuming, for the purposes of this decision, that there was a breach of the covenant to make an installment payment, we cannot agree that this, of itself, was a breach of the entire agreement frustrating any further rights of the District under it. The Company does not contend that the withholding of the December progress payment prevented the performance of the contract. Whether or not it warranted a rescission by the Company, the Company admits no such rescission was attempted prior to the Engineer\u2019s decision that the Company had unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The act of the District in suspending the work for unnecessary and unreasonable delay was pursuant to the provisions of section 7 of the contract<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and was not converted into an act of abandonment by the District as a result of the alleged prior breach of January 9 in withholding the December progress payment. The ejectment of the Company from the works was not in contravention of the contract as it was merely the exercise of its right under the contract to possession of the works. The Company\u2019s cause of action under the first count, based as it is on prevention of performance of the.contract, is predicated on the theory that the contract had an existence after the alleged breach of January 9. Since the contract continued in existence, the Company was not relieved from the duty of performing its obligations to surrender possession in accordance with its terms. Dyer Bros. G .W. I. Works v. Central Iron Works, 72 Cal.App. 202, 207, 237 P. 386; Weber Chimney Co. v. Itasca Paper Co., Mo.Sup. 1917, 199 S.W. 141, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Other California cases upon which the Company relies are not in opposition to this rule of law. In San Francisco Bridge Co. v. Dumbarton Land &amp; Improvement Co., 119 Cal. 272, 51 P. 335, suit was in quantum meruit after a contract for the performance of the work had been duly rescinded because of defendant\u2019s breach. Likewise, in Gray v. Bekins, 186 Cal. 389, 199 P. 767, suit was in quantum meruit and not for recovery on the express contract. The holding of the court in Sterrett v. Curtis Corp., 206 Cal. 677, 680, 275 P. 792, that the failure of the defendant to act with the promptness required by the contract raised a waiver of the usual condition that time is of the essence is not authority for raising a waiver of other and different elements of a contract from the fact of the breach of one condition <em>or </em>covenant therein. Nor does it follow from the rule that \u201cone party cannot compel another to perform while he himself is in default under the contract\u201d (Rathbun v. Security Mfg. Co., 82 Cal.App. 793, 796, 256 P. 296, 297) that, if the injured party decides to stand upon the contract, he is relieved of the obligation of performing according to the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">There is language in the case of Henderson Bridge Co. v. O\u2019Connor, 88 Ky. 303, 11 S.W. 18, 22, 957, subsequent appeal, sub nomine, O\u2019Connor v. Henderson Bridge Co., 95 Ky. 633, 27 S.W. 251, 254, 983, which appears to support the Company\u2019s contention. The court, in the second appeal, however, clarified its position by stating (27 S. W. 254) : \u201cBesides, upon reconsideration, we think that as the company [here the District] was in default, by reason of failure to estimate and pay for work done and materials delivered, without which the contractors could not further comply with and perform all the terms of the contract, it had no right to annul [here take over the work].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">As so qualified by the court, this rule does not support the Company\u2019s claim of recovery in the instant proceeding. The Company at no time contended that the failure to make payment of the progress payment on January 9, 1935, was responsible in any way for the delay in proceeding with the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">B and C. The Company Not Entitled to Recover on the Count in Quantum Meruit or that for Money Had and Received.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">There remains for consideration the Company\u2019s claim that' the District Court improperly denied it judgment on the second and third counts for recovery aside from the contract. In addition to the acts of the District in giving the notice of suspension and ejecting the Company from the works, the Company relies upon the act of the District of January 9, 1935, in withholding the December progress payment as supporting its suit in quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Although under the California rule in building contracts the failure to pay an installment when due is not such a breach as will support an action on the contract for full performance, it will support a rescission of the contract and recovery in quantum meruit. Cox v. McLaughlin, 54 Cal. 605, 608, 609, 610; Cox v. McLaughlin, <em>76 </em>Cal. 60, 62, 63, 18 P. 100, 9 Am.St. Rep. 164; Porter v. Arrowhead Reservoir Co., 100 Cal. 500, 502, 503, 35 P. 146; San Francisco Bridge Co. v. Dumbarton Land &amp; Improvement Co., 119 Cal. 272, 274, 51 P. 335; see Fairchild-Gilmore-Wilton Co. v. Southern Ref. Co., 158 Cal. 264, 274, 110 P. 951, and Connel v. Higgins, 170 Cal. 541, 150 P. 769, 772; Monson v. Fischer, 118 Cal.App. 503, 519, 5 P.2d 628. Rescission of the contract in such case, however, must be within a reasonable time of the breach. Cal. Civil Code, \u00a7 1691; Brown v. Domestic Utilities Mfg. Co., 172 Cal. 733, 736, 159 P. 163; Bancroft v. Woodward, 183 Cal. 99, 107, 108, 190 P. 445; Davis v. Rite-Lite Sales Co., 8 Cal.2d 675, 682, 67 P.2d 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Assuming that it was still reasonable for the Company to elect to rescind the contract because of the alleged breach of January 9, 1935, after the District had served its notice of suspension of work under the contract and had ousted the Company from the work, the fact remains that such an election was never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On February 18, 1935, the Company brought a suit in equity for specific performance of the contract to require possession to be restored to the Company, in an attempt to regain possession of the tunnel so that it might continue the work. Following the dismissal of this suit upon motion of the District on March 11, 1935, the Company took no further action with respect to the contract until January 8, 1937, when the case at bar was filed. The first amended complaint, on which trial occurred, was filed May 24, 1937. By neither of these pleadings did the Company allege that it had abandoned the contract or had rescinded it. The Company offered no proof at the trial that it had in fact rescinded the contract and, in the face of the record, the trial court\u2019s finding that no rescission occurred cannot be set aside. Hollenbach v. Schnabel, 101 Cal. 312, 35 P. 872, 873, 40 Am.St.Rep. 57; Cf. Palmer v. Fix, 104 Cal.App. 562, 567, 286 P. 498, hearing denied by Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The Company seeks to bring itself within the doctrine of election of remedies by which the injured party may wait until the time of trial before electing between the right to recover in quantum meruit for the work done or on the contract for full performance. Adams v. Burbank, 103 Cal. 646, 649, 37 P. 640; House v. Piercy, 181 Cal. 247, 251, 183 P. 807; Restatement of the Law of Contract, \u00a7 381. The election presented in this case, however, is one of substantive rights rather than remedies: to rescind the contract and recover on the common counts for work performed or to stand on the contract and waive the breach, demanding full performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Not only was there a failure on the Company\u2019s part to rescind within a reasonable time but there was a change of position which would render it inequitable to allow the Company to recover on the basis of a contract rescinded as of the date of the present suit. From a consideration of section 7 of the contract,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it appears that the acts complained of did not effect a complete termination of the contract but only a suspension of the work under that contract. Certain obligations of appellant continued under the contract after the notice of suspension. If the expense of the work after the notice of suspension exceeded the amount which would have been due the Company under the contract if the same had been completed by it, the Company was under the obligation to pay the amount of such excess to the District. Further, all the Company\u2019s material and plant equipment were subject to use by the District without additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The continuing nature of the Company\u2019s obligations under the provisions of section 7 is similarly illustrated by the terms of the notice of suspension given in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">If the Company at this late date can recover in a suit in quantum meruit, grounded on a breach of contract which invested it with an election to rescind, the District would be liable for the use of the Company\u2019s equipment and plant material after the date of the notice of suspension or of the ouster from possession of the equipment and works. The failure of the Company to make a timely rescission would thus redound to its benefit and the prejudice of the District. Every justification here exists for enforcing the requirement that rescission for breach of contract be within a reasonable time of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Since the action of the District in retaking possession of the work was pursuant to the contract and any right of the Company to rescind the contract because of the alleged breach of the District in withholding the December progress payment was lost by the Company\u2019s failure to give notice of rescission within a reasonable time of the date of the withholding, judgment in the District Court on the issue of liability was properly for the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The Company assigns as error' the action of the District Court in admitting the testimony of the District\u2019s accountants as to the status of the construction fund and in refusing to allow the Company to amend its first amended complaint so as to charge a breach of warranty and misrepresentation of the conditions of work. Consideration of these assignments of error is unnecessary under the views postulated above. The error, if any, could not be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-14\"> \u201c7.
