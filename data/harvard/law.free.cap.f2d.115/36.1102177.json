This application was denied on the ground that 'the land in question had previously \u201cbeen patented by the United States as a confirmed private-land claim\u201d, and that decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of the General Land \u25a0 Office. An-appeal was taken to the Secretary of the Interior, who has postponed action on the matter. The appellant brought this action in the District Court seeking an order in the nature of a mandamus to (1) compel issuance of a lease, or (2) compel action on the application. The District Court dismissed the complaint and from that order this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-24\">In hen complaint the appellant alleges that she filed \u201ca due and proper application for an oil lease\u201d and that she is therefore entitled to such lease or a negative decision by the Secretary. Under \u00a7 17 of the Act of February 25, 1920, as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *and regulations adopted pursuant thereto,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leases are only granted on application in respect to \u201clands * * * not within any known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field\u201d. Unless the oil lease she seeks relates to such land, the appellant\u2019s complaint is meaningless for lands \u201cwhich are known or believed to contain oil or gas deposits\u201d are leased to \u201cthe highest * * * qualified bidder. by competitive bidding under general regulations\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Assuming, without deciding, that her allegation that she has made \u201ca due and proper application for an oil lease\u201d necessarily avers by implication that the subject matter is land \u201cnot within any known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field\u201d we pass to a consideration of whether the appellant has otherwise stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>In one prayer for relief she seeks a.n order compelling the Secretary to issue <em>her the </em>oil lease applied for. In United States ex rel. Roughton v. Ickes, 69 App. D.C. 324, 101 F.2d 248, however, we held that under the applicable statutory provisions the courts may not compel the issuance of oil leases, confided by Congress to the discretion of the Secretary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We adhere to that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We come then to the appellant\u2019s alternative prayer that the Secretary be compelled to take action on her application for a lease. Assuming that under some circumstances he might be so compelled, the appellant\u2019s complaint presents no such case. She makes no allegation that the Secretary has granted any lease in derogation of such preferential rights as she may have under the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even if we assume a \u2018legal right\u2019 in the appellant, it must be remembered that the statute leaves entirely to the Secretary the procedure preliminary to decision on an application for an oil lease.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, an order in the nature of a mandamus to compel decision will not lie where his refusal to act is not clearly arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s complaint charges only that the Secretary has neither granted nor denied her application for a lease. It cannot be doubted that under many circumstances withholding action on such applications for a rather extended period would be eminently proper, if not essential to wise administration. The appellant sets forth no factual allegations from which it could be inferred that the Secretary acted arbitrarily or capriciously in withholding his decision here, indeed she does not charge that he has so acted. In the absence of such allegations it must be assumed that the Secretary has withheld decision on her application for a good and sufficient reason,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>it would be clearly improper for the courts to compel his action in such a case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We conclude that the appellant\u2019s complaint failed to state a cause of action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The order of the District Court dismissing the complaint must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-26\"> 49 Stat. 676, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 226..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-27\"> 1 Fed.Reg. 373.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-28\"> 49 Stat. 676, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> See also Warm v.

Dunn et al., A. 21766, in which you again request a hearing before the Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-20\">\u201cIn response to a previous request we wrote you on May 27, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-21\">\u201c \u2018As you are aware, S. <em>3. </em>Res. Nos. 83 and 92 and H. <em>3. </em>Res. Nos. 176 and 181 are now pending in Congress. As a result of the enactment of one of these resolutions or some similar resolution it is anticipated that the courts will be called on to settle the question of the ownership of the oil or other minerals in the lands under the ocean and within an area covered by territorial waters of the United States. One of the questions which may be raised in such action as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>may be brought may be the one whether, even if it be assumed that full title to the lands be not in the United States, the United States, nevertheless, owns the mineral rights therein. In your appeals you raise a similar question. For these reasons your eases are being held in suspense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201c \u2018Under these circumstances I do not believe that an oral hearing at this time would serve any useful purpose. Tour request for a hearing is accordingly denied.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cYou now write:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\u201c \u2018As now all resolutions were permitted to lapse, we understand, in the committees, we are asking that we be given a hearing by the Secretary forthwith on these appeals.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">\u201cSo far as this Department is aware, S. J. Res. Nos. 83 and 92 and H. J. Res. Nos. 176 and 181 are still pending in Congress and the Committees to which they were referred have not reported thereon. There has been no material change in the status of the legislation since we wrote you on May 27 and, accordingly, your request for a hearing is again denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">\u201cVery truly yours, -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">\u201c(Sgd.) Harry Slattery,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4g\">\u201cUnder Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">It may be noted in connection with this communication that the Senate Committee on Public Lands favorably reported S. J. Res. 92, May 15, 1940, with amendments. (S.Rep. No. 1612, 76th Cong. 3rd Session).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">The care with which the appellant has avoided charging the Secretary with arbitrary or capricious action in the matter is due, apparently, to a commendable desire to restrict her allegations to the facts. The appellee has requested us to take judicial notice of the above communication, but that is not necessary to our disposition of the Case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b102-16\"> Cf.
