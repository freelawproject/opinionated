Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 131(a) (1), a taxpayer may credit upon his income tax \u201cthe amount of any income, war-profits, and excess-profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to any foreign country.\u201d The taxpayer at bar, a domestic stock insurance company doing a fire and marine business in the United States and Canada, became liable in the year 1934 for a Canadian excise upon its Canadian premiums of $5,-404.94; and it is conceded that this tax was not within \u00a7 131(a) (1). It was also liable in the same year for a Canadian income tax of $6,924.05. The difference between this sum and the excise was $1,519.11, which was all that the Commissioner allowed as a credit upon the taxpayer\u2019s income tax, on the theory that only so much Canadian income tax had accrued or had been paid. The taxpayer maintained on the other hand that, although the Canadian excise was applied as a credit upon the amount due as Canadian income tax, the whole income tax had nevertheless been paid, and should be credited upon the United States income tax. The Board agreed with this position, and the Commissioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-21\">The taxpayer\u2019s position must be that the same sum paid both the Canadian excise and the Canadian income tax. Theoretically that might be true, but the Canadian act did not say so; on the contrary it said the taxpayer might deduct the excise from the income tax \u201cthat would otherwise be payable by him,\u201d which meant, that as things were the income tax was not payable pro tanto. If so, it did not accrue, and he did not pay it. If the Canadian statute had happened to say that the taxpayer might deduct the income tax from what would otherwise be payable as excise, the opposite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>result'-would have followed; and that, no doubt, is somewhat capricious, but the caprice, if there is any, is that of our own law, which allows the one credit and not the other. That puts it upon the taxpayer to prove that he has paid an actual income tax, not that an income tax would have been payable, if facts had been \u201cotherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
