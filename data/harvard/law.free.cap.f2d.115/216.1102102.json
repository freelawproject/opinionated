United. States, 112 F.2d 417, and in an able opinion were overruled. The state of Oklahoma is situated in the Tenth Circuit. For that reason the opinion of that court construing the Oklahoma law is, in the absence of an authoritative decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, of peculiar weight. We would not be justified in refusing to follow that opinion, unless satisfied that it is erroneous. Grain Belt Supply Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 Cir., 109 F.2d 490, 492. We have examined the brief of appellants and have considered their arguments with care, and have reached the conclusion that the decision of the Tenth Circuit is correct. It would be useless, therefore, to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>this opinion for the purpose of discussing appellants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The judgments appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
