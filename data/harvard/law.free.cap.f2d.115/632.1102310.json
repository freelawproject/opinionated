The actions were consolidated for trial and separate special verdicts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>returned, favorable to each plaintiff, which were modified and reduced by the trial court and the judgments then entered thereon. Defendant appeals from both judgments, and plaintiff Gary, in her appeal, challenges the ruling of the court which reduced her verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The appeals were consolidated for argument and will be disposed of in one opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b697-6\">EVANS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The appeals raise three major questions: (1) Does the evidence support the jury\u2019s verdict that it was defendant\u2019s truck that was involved in the accident? (2) Was the trial court justified in reducing, by ten per cent., the amount of damages fixed by the jury, because of the contributing negligence of one of the plaintiffs \u2014 the driver of the automobile ? (3) Did the court err in reducing the jury\u2019s award to Gary from $1,000 to $467?</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Plaintiff Gary, in partnership with another, owned a dress shop in Milwaukee. She had a \u201cdrawing account or salary\u201d of $35 a week from the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">On July 20, 1938, she was on her way to Chicago, with Miss Bertrand, a teacher, and two others, to buy a dress for Miss Bertrand and a coat for one of the other women. Miss Bertrand was driving Miss Gary\u2019s car. They testified they had been driving behind a red truck for about fifteen minutes when Miss Bertrand decided to pass it and sounded her horn. When her front wheels were abreast the trailer\u2019s rear wheels the truck veered into the passing lane to avoid a stalled truck ahead of it, and the .plaintiff\u2019s car was forced off the road and struck a culvert, causing the accident and injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-31\">(1) <em>Identity of Truck Involved in Collision. </em>Despite the unsatisfactory identification proof, we are, nevertheless, satisfied that a jury question on this issue was presented. With equal certainty we are satisfied that the evidence both as to plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s negligence necessitated presentation to and determination by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-33\">Plaintiff Gary identified the truck by col- or and the word \u201cConsolidated\u201d printed on the back of the trailer. A state transportation inspector remembered seeing a Consolidated truck passing south of the scene of the accident shortly before the accident came to his attention. As against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>fendant\u2019s accused driver\u2019s testimony that he passed the scene of the accident more than an hour later, and that he knew of no accident, these facts seem fragmentary. There was almost no rational explanation other than the truck was defendant\u2019s. We are, of course, not making independent findings, but merely holding that the evidence was such that a jury might well have found, as they did find, that it was <em>defendant\u2019s </em>truck that turned into the 'left lane as plaintiffs were attempting to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">(2) <em>Reduction of Damages by Ten Per Cent for Plaintiff\u2019s Negligence. </em>On the negligence issues there was ample evidence of neglect on the part of both the driver of the truck and the driver of the car. Again it is not a case of weighing evidence, or determining veracity.' We must assume that the jury could and did accept plaintiffs\u2019 testimony. On such assumption defendant\u2019s negligence was established. Likewise, and with equal certainty, we are convinced that the jury was well-sustained in finding that the driver of the automobile was, herself, also negligent. (Answer to Question 4(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s negligence consisted, so the jury found, in persisting in her effort to pass the truck when it was apparent to her that the truck was in the left lane. Her persistence in this respect, led to her driving her car off the cement and ultimately into the culvert. It is true, defendant may have been negligent in taking the left lane in view of plaintiff\u2019s sounding her horn and her effort to pass him. That, however, did not justify plaintiff in continuing her effort to go when doing so was at the cost of safety and a resulting collision with a culvert.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The evidence sustained the jury\u2019s finding that ten per cent, of the negligence \u201cproducing her injuries was attributable\u201d to her. Accepting the verdict as to her negligence, we are satisfied that the percentage of damage attributed t\u00f3 her fault was at least as great as ten per cent. However, as this percentage of fault issue is, like the negligence issue, a jury question, we (as did the District Court) leave this finding undisturbed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">More doubtful was the trial court\u2019s action in changing the answer of the jury to question 5 (c) of the special verdict. The jury found defendant negligent. It also found plaintiff negligent in driving the passenger car. It found that ten percent, of plaintiffs\u2019 damages were produced by the driver\u2019s negligence. It then answered the alleged causal relation question in the negative. This last answer, the trial court changed because not sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">An examination of the evidence upon which the jury found plaintiff negligent makes it impossible for us to reconcile its answer to subsection c of question 5 of the special verdict with the answer to question 4, subsection c which found plaintiff negligent.'hn the manner of overtaking and attempting to pass the truck.\u201d If this answer to question 4 (c) be accepted, and it must be, both on the evidence (and its acceptance thereof by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel), there was no controverted issue to go to the jury as to the \u201cnatural result\u201d thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">This was the trial court\u2019s conclusion as stated in his memorandum supporting the ruling which changed the answer to 5 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">If plaintiffs were negligent as the jury found, it was quite impossible for that negligence to have no causal relation to the accident. It was (on the evidence showing .negligence in this case) one of the,proximate causes of the accident. The court properly changed the answer to this question. This, of necessity, resulted in a ten percent, reduction of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">(3) <em>Reduction of Gary\u2019s Damages for Wages and Earnings from $1,000 to $467.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">The trial court apparently allowed the full wage loss from July 20 to October 21, a period of thirteen weeks and two days, at $35 per week, but disallowed for later and intermittent absences from October, 1938, to November, 1939, which absences numbered approximately seventy-five days. See answer to Question 9 d.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The only testimony in regard to loss of earnings came from Miss 'Gary, who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-15\">\u201cQ. Now, in your business did you have a drawing account of so much a week, or did you get a salary? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-16\">\u201cQ. How much was that? A. $35. I went back to work on October 21. I went back to work as soon as I was able. * * * A. I have not been able to continue my work steady since I returned to my employment on October 21, 1938. At the request of my counsel I have prepared from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>my books of account a statement showing the full days I was unable to be at my place of business because of my illness. (This was the exhibit which listed 75 days\u2019 absence.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">There was no direct evidence that the business suffered from her absence, save as one may infer that some loss was sure to occur. But how much? What facts afford a basis for a verdict of $1,000 for loss of wages <em>and earnings </em>in addition to damages for medical expense, personal injuries, and damage to automobile? In the trial court\u2019s opinion, there was no evidence to sustain an alleged loss of earnings, after he had made an allowance for wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Defendant also here argues that the loss was one which the partnership, rather than the plaintiff Gary, suffered. In other words, the Wisconsin decisions (Verhelst Const. Co. v. Galles, 204 Wis. 96, 235 N.W. 556; Culbertson v. Kieckhefer Container Company, 197 Wis. 349, 222 N.W. 249; and Campbell v. Sutliff, 193 Wis. 370, 214 N.W. 374, 53 A.L.R. 771), which hold that the payment to an employee of the latter\u2019s wage during illness, does not prevent the employee from recovering such damages from a tort-feasor, are distinguishable. This question, we need not decide, in view of our conclusion that the evidence of earnings was not sufficient to sustain an award which included them.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Other issues have been duly considered, but we think they need not be separately discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-18\"> \u201c1.
