Code, \u00a7 1400 et seq. )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A labor union and several employees sued an employer, alleging the employer violated this law by failing to provide notice before ordering about 90 employees not to return to work for four to five weeks. The employer countered that the California WARN Act was inapplicable because its action was a temporary furlough and not a \"mass layoff.\" All parties recognized there was no liability under the parallel federal WARN Act because the federal law applies to a temporary layoff only if the layoff \"exceed[s] 6 months.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(B).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties filed cross summary judgment/adjudication motions raising primarily the duty issue: did the employer have a statutory duty to notify the affected employees even though the layoff was temporary, rather than permanent? The superior court concluded the California WARN Act did apply to the employer's temporary layoff, and therefore the employer owed a statutory notification duty to the affected workers. The court thus granted summary adjudication in plaintiffs' favor on this issue. The court then held a one-day bench trial on damages issues. After trial, the court entered judgment in plaintiffs' favor, awarding the workers $211,405 in backpay and lost pension benefits. The court denied plaintiffs' request for statutory penalties,\n   finding the employer acted in good faith because the legal issues were \"unsettled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the employer contends the court erred in interpreting the California WARN Act as applying to temporary layoffs. We affirm. Based on our analysis of the statutory language, statutory scheme, legislative history, federal WARN law, and policies underlying the California WARN Act, we determine the employer had a duty to provide statutory notice under the particular circumstances of this case, even if the layoffs were not permanent and were for less than six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   NASSCO Holdings Incorporated and National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (collectively NASSCO) employs thousands of workers in its ship\n   building and repairing business. NASSCO employees are represented by The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers, and Helpers, Local 1998 (the Union). NASSCO's staffing requirements change frequently, and its collective bargaining agreement contains rules applicable to terminations and short-term unpaid work stoppages. The agreement refers to a short-term work stoppage as a \"layoff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By early 2014, NASSCO determined it would need to temporarily reduce its labor force because there would be a lull in its shipyard production work. On March 3, 2014, NASSCO notified about 14 employees on the day they reported to work that they were not to return to work for at least three weeks. The written notice characterized the reduction as a layoff. NASSCO later notified these employees the layoff would be extended by several weeks. On March 17, 2014, NASSCO notified about 76 additional employees they were laid off for at least three weeks. They were not given prior notice of the layoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between March 3, 2014 and March 17, 2014, a total of about 90 NASSCO employees were laid off, without work or pay (except for the reporting time pay on the day they were told not to return to work) for three to five weeks. Some of the laid-off employees returned to work on April 7, 2014, with the remainder returning on April 14, 2014. When the workers returned to work, they returned to their same job classifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 17, 2014, the Union president wrote to NASSCO, claiming NASSCO's action in laying off more than 50 workers within a 30-day period triggered statutory notice protections. Later that day, NASSCO responded that it had not implemented a \"layoff,\" and instead it was a \"furlough[ ]\" or a \"manpower reduction,\" and that\n   <em>\n    under the federal WARN Act\n   </em>\n   , notice is not required \"when the layoffs are for less than a 6 month period.\" NASSCO said it was aware of the impact the \"furloughs may have on its employees. Therefore, ... NASSCO has continued to extend certain benefits to these furloughed employees,\" including that it has \"1) continued to pay BOTH the employer contribution\n   <strong>\n    AND\n   </strong>\n   the employee portion of the health care premiums; and 2) allowed employees to continue to accrue seniority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite the representation regarding the health care premiums, the workers were initially charged for and paid their own health care obligations. However, they were later reimbursed for these payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During their time off, the employees were not paid any wages (except for a few workers who elected to use their accrued vacation wages), nor did they earn vacation pay or accrue service credit for purposes of pension benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In December 2014, the Union and three individual employees (Alberto Florian, Gustavo Perez, and Jose Rodarte) sued NASSCO alleging it violated the California WARN Act and seeking back pay and millions of dollars in statutory penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment/adjudication claiming the undisputed facts showed NASSCO (1) had a statutory duty under the California WARN Act to give 60 days' notice before the March 2014 layoffs; (2) breached that duty; and (3) failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into whether its actions would violate the California WARN Act. In its cross-motion, NASSCO argued the undisputed facts showed (1) it had no statutory duty to provide notice of the layoffs and thus did not breach any duty; and (2) it was not subject to statutory penalties because it conducted a reasonable investigation in good faith as to whether it was required to give 60 days' notice under the California WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their moving and opposing papers, the parties agreed NASSCO is a \"covered establishment\" under the California WARN Act; the short term labor force reduction was the result of a lack of work; and the reduction was not necessitated by a physical calamity or an act of war. They also agreed that NASSCO did not provide 60 days' notice of the layoff to the employees. Both sets of parties also recognized the duty issue was dependent on the court's interpretation of the California WARN Act provisions, and each submitted numerous documents reflecting the Act's legislative history, of which the court took judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After considering the arguments and written submissions, the court denied NASSCO's summary judgment motion, and granted plaintiffs' summary adjudication motion, finding the undisputed facts showed NASSCO violated its statutory obligation to provide advance notice of the layoffs under the California WARN Act. The court then conducted a trial on the damages issues. At the close of evidence, the court ruled that the laid-off employees were entitled to backpay and lost pension benefits, but declined to award civil penalties. The court then entered final judgment in plaintiffs' favor for $211,405 plus interest, costs, and attorney fees. NASSCO appeals, challenging the court's denial of its summary judgment motion and the court's grant of plaintiffs' summary adjudication motion. Several business organizations filed a joint amicus curiae brief supporting NASSCO's position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Review Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if \"all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" ( Code Civ.

A court shall grant a summary adjudication motion on a duty issue if the undisputed facts show the \"defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the ... plaintiffs.\" ( Code Civ.

Section 1401, subdivision (a) states: \"An employer may not order a mass layoff, relocation or termination at a covered establishment unless, 60 days before the order takes effect, the employer gives written notice of the order to the following: [\u00b6] (1) the employees of the covered establishment affected by the order; [and] [\u00b6] (2) [specified public officials and agencies].\" Section 1401, subdivision (b) provides: \"An employer required to give notice of any mass layoff ... under this chapter shall include in its notice the elements required by the federal [WARN] Act.

(a).) \" 'Employer' means any person ... who directly or indirectly owns and operates a covered establishment.\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd.

(c).) Other statutes identify additional exceptions, including for certain industries (e.g., the motion picture industry) ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (g)(1) ); for certain employees (e.g., seasonal employees or employees hired for a limited project) ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (g)(1), (2) ); and for certain circumstances when the employer is \"actively seeking capital or business\" (this latter exception is applicable only to a \"relocation\" or \"termination,\" and not a mass layoff) (\u00a7 1402.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Remedies: Civil Damages, Penalties, and Attorney Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section 1402 governs the effect of a failure to provide the required notice. Section 1402, subdivision (a) states that an employer who violates the notice requirement \"is liable to each employee entitled to notice who lost his or her employment,\" and the damages consist of \"back pay\" and the value of any lost benefits to which the employee would be entitled to \"if his or her employment had not been lost.\" Section 1402, subdivision (c) provides that the amount of the employer's liability is reduced by \"[a]ny wages ... paid by the employer to the employee during the period of the employer's violation,\" and any other voluntary, unconditional, or specified third-party payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Sections 1403 and 1405 concern civil penalties. A failure to provide notice to the specified public officials and agencies may subject the employer to a penalty of no more than $500 \"for each day of the employer's violation,\" unless the employer pays the employees within three weeks from the date of the layoff/relocation/termination order. (\u00a7\u00a7 1403, 1401, subd. (c).) Additionally, the penalties may be reduced if the \"employer conduct[s] a reasonable investigation in good faith, and had reasonable grounds to believe that its conduct was not a violation of [the California WARN Act].\" (\u00a7 1405.)

But this is not where we begin because the statute specifically defines the term. (See\n   <em>\n    Duty v. Abex Corp.\n   </em>\n   (1989)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4369799\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/214/742/#p750\">\n    214 Cal.App.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2013\">\n    263 Cal.Rptr. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\" ' \"When a statute prescribes the meaning to be given to particular terms used by it, that meaning is generally binding on the courts.\" ' \"].) The California WARN Act defines a \"layoff\" to mean \"a\n   <em>\n    separation\n   </em>\n   from a position for lack of funds or lack of work.\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (c), italics added.) Under its plain meaning, \"separation\" means an action of moving apart, and does not contain a temporal component. Under a commonsense understanding, a separation can be permanent or it can be temporary. Thus, the fact that the work stoppage was temporary does not logically take the action outside the scope of the statutory duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by the statutory context in which the word \"separation\" appears. The Legislature used the phrase \"from a position\" immediately after the word \"separation.\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (c).) The concept of being separated\n   <em>\n    from a position\n   </em>\n   does not suggest a requirement that the employment\n   <em>\n    relationship\n   </em>\n   be severed. The Legislature could have defined a layoff to mean an \"employment termination\" or even \"separation from employment.\" But the Legislature did not use these words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In one of the leading cases interpreting the California WARN Act, the court found the \"from a position\" definitional phrase to be critical. (\n   <em>\n    MacIsaac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 134 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1084-1087,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20650\">\n    36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In\n   <em>\n    MacIsaac\n   </em>\n   , the court addressed the issue whether there had been a \" 'mass layoff' \" under the California WARN Act if employees were transferred from one employer to another under circumstances in which they performed the same work at the same rates of pay and retained the same benefits. (\n   <em>\n    MacIsaac\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 1079-1081,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20650\">\n    36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The plaintiff argued this action was a \" 'layoff' \" because the employees were separated from the existing employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1085-1086,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20650\">\n    36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Finding the statutory definition of the term \" 'layoff' \" to be \"unambiguous,\" the court rejected this argument, explaining: \"The statute defines 'layoff' as 'a separation\n   <em>\n    from a position\n   </em>\n   for lack of funds or lack of work.' [Citation.] In contrast to [this] plain language ..., [the plaintiff] focuses on whether the employee was separated from a particular\n   <em>\n    employer.\n   </em>\n   But under the Legislature's express definition, that is clearly the wrong question. Under the Legislature's chosen definition of 'layoff,' the determining factor is whether the employee has been separated from 'a position,' not whether the employee is separated from an 'employer.' [Citation.] [\u00b6] The Legislature might easily have chosen to define 'layoff' in language that would yield [the plaintiff's] desired interpretation. For example, the Legislature might have defined 'layoff' by reference to severance of the relationship between an employee and an 'employer' rather than by reference to severance of the relationship between an employee and 'a position.' Or, the Legislature could have defined 'layoff' by tying the term\n   to the cessation of an employee's work at a particular 'covered establishment.' (Cf. \u00a7 1400, subd. (f) ['termination' defined as 'the cessation or substantial cessation of industrial or commercial operations in a covered establishment'].) But the Legislature did not do so, and we are bound to apply the express definition drafted by the Legislature to the facts of this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1086,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20650\">\n    36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We agree with this reasoning as applied to the facts of this case. The \"separation\n   from the position\" definition does not suggest a severance from the employment relationship must occur before the notice duty triggers. Instead it encompasses a temporary job loss, even if some form of the employment relationship continues and the employees are given a return date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This conclusion is consistent with section 1400's other statutory definitions. In defining the terms, the Legislature knew how to impose restrictions when it wanted to do so. For example, nearly all of the other definitions contain explicit time restrictions. A \"[c]overed establishment\" is an \"industrial or commercial facility ... that ... has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons.\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (a).) A \"Mass layoff\" is \"a layoff during any 30-day period of 50 or more employees.\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (d).) And an \"[e]mployee\" is \"a person employed by an employer for at least 6 months of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is required.\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (h).) The fact that the Legislature included time limitations in many of section 1400's definitions, but chose\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to include any similar limitations in specifying the length of a \"layoff\" is evidence that the Legislature intended for the statute to apply to the type of \"separation from position\" that occurred in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Our plain-meaning interpretation is consistent with the views of legal commentators who have recognized that a \"mass layoff\" is not limited to a permanent termination under the California WARN Act. In two respected treatises, the authors observed the statutory notification duty can arise even if the intended layoff will be temporary. (See Chin et al., Cal Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (The Rutter Group 2016) \u00b6 6:792, p. 6-97 [\"The California [WARN Act] does not state how long the employees must be off the job to constitute a 'layoff.' [\u00b6] ... Presumably, therefore, notice may be required even where the employer plans to and does\n   <em>\n    rehire\n   </em>\n   the affected employees within a few weeks or months.\"]; Kline &amp; Olson, Cal. Bus. Law Deskbook (2016) \u00a7 20:4 [same].) Although the opinions of these commentators are not binding, they confirm our conclusion that when viewing the plain meaning of the statutory language, there does not appear to be any permanency requirement contained in the California WARN Act's \"layoff\" or \"mass layoff\" terms. ( \u00a7 1400, subds. (c), (d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   NASSCO asserts various points in support of its argument that the plain meaning of the California WARN Act did not apply to its temporary layoffs (which it characterizes as \"furloughs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, NASSCO contends statutory notice is required only if the employee \" 'lost his or her employment,' \" quoting from section 1402, subdivision (a). We agree that a \"lost ... employment\" requirement, viewed in isolation, might suggest a stricter standard, but disagree that this phrase triggers liability under the California WARN Act. Section 1402 governs the\n   <em>\n    consequences\n   </em>\n   of \"fail [ing] to give\" the required notice and specifically refers to the statutory notice as that \"required by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1401,\" which includes the definitions contained in section 1400. (\u00a7 1402, subd. (a).) Reasonably read, section 1402 does not reflect the Legislature's intent to use the code section governing damages to alter the meaning of the \"mass layoff\" and \"layoff\" triggers already defined in the statute. Moreover, as will be discussed below, the federal WARN Act (on which the California WARN Act was patterned), defines \"employment loss\" to include a\n   <em>\n    temporary\n   </em>\n   loss of employment (a layoff for more than six months). (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   NASSCO alternatively relies on dictionary definitions and judicial decisions to\n   support its view that a \"separation\" under section 1400, subdivision (c) means a complete termination of the employment relationship. Although a statutory term should be construed consistent with its \" 'well-established\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   meaning' \" (\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456745\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/63/335/#p351\">\n    63 Cal.4th 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    203 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513188\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/202/711/\">\n    371 P.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), these authorities do not support that a \"separation\" has the fixed legal meaning attributed to it by NASSCO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   NASSCO cites Black's Law Dictionary, which defines \"separation\" to mean: \"1. An arrangement whereby a husband and wife live apart from each other while remaining married .... 2. The status of a husband and wife having begun such an arrangement .... 3. Cessation of a contractual relationship, esp. in an employment situation.\" (Black's Law Dict. (10th ed. 2014) p. 1572, col. 1.) The first two definitions do not support that a \"separation\" means a termination of a legal relationship, and instead suggest the contrary: that a separation can occur while the parties remain in a legal relationship (married). The third definition does imply a more permanent employment action by referring to a \"cessation\n   <em>\n    of a contractual relationship.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.,\n   </em>\n   italics added.) But in enacting the California Warn Act the Legislature did not identify the triggering event as a \"cessation of a contractual relationship\" or even \"separation of a contractual relationship\"; it said \"separation from a position.\" By using this latter phrase, the Legislature expressed an intent that is broader than Black's Law Dictionary's third definition. When applying dictionary definitions, we do not consider the\n   statutory words in isolation; we must read the language as it is placed in the code section, and in the context of the entire statutory scheme.

The plaintiff rejected this accommodation, and sued the county for disability discrimination and violation of several statutes, including Government Code section 31721, subdivision (a), which provides a county \"may not separate because of disability a member otherwise eligible to retire for disability but shall apply for disability retirement of any eligible member believed to be disabled ....\" In response to the county's argument that she was never \"separated\" from her employment because she still worked for the county, the employee relied on a related statute that used the word \" 'dismissed' \" as the triggering event for the county's duty, and argued that because the Legislature used two different words in two different statutes, it must have intended a different meaning.

The court rejected this argument, noting that although\n   the terms \" 'separate' and 'dismissed' \" when used generally in employment law are not necessarily interchangeable because dismissed refers to a termination at the employer's election whereas separate does not suggest which party initiated the\n   <em>\n    ending of the relationship\n   </em>\n   , when reading the terms \"\n   <em>\n    in the context of the\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    particular statute\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   ],\" the Legislature \"intended the term 'dismissed' in [Government Code] section 31725 and 'separate' in [Government Code] section 31721, subdivision (a) to mean the same thing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 879-880,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20469\">\n    151 Cal.Rptr.3d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mooney\n   </em>\n   support that a separation from employment in the retirement disability context means a permanent end to the employment relationship, the courts' conclusions were tethered to the particular statutory schemes at issue and do not reflect a settled understanding of the \"separation\" term in other areas of employment law. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 19996 [\"[a]ny such employee may be temporarily separated from the state civil service through layoff [or] permanently separated through resignation or removal for cause\"]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 19998.3 [referring to a \"layoff\" as a \"temporary separation\"]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 19143 [referring to \"temporary separation\"]; Unemployment Ins. Code, \u00a7 13028.5 [same].) Moreover, we are required to construe \"separation\" in the context of the language in the same statute, particularly the phrase \"separation from a position\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (c) ), which does not appear in NASSCO's cited authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   NASSCO's lengthy discussion of the differences between a \"layoff\" and a \"furlough\" is also unhelpful. No portion of the California WARN Act uses the term \"furlough,\" nor do any of the judicial decisions interpreting the California WARN Act. Our focus must be on the statutory language, and not on the terms later used by the parties in characterizing their actions. In this regard, NASSCO's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Professional Engineers in California Government v.

In the portion of the opinion discussed by NASSCO, the high court examined whether the Governor had the authority to impose the furlough under Government Code section 19997, which authorizes a state employer to \" '\n   <em>\n    lay off\n   </em>\n   ' \" state employees for \" 'lack of ... funds.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Professional Engineers\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 1033-1036,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20480\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20P.3d%201186\">\n    239 P.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The court concluded that although a \"furlough\" could be superficially viewed as a less drastic version of a layoff, the two actions\n   were functionally dissimilar under Government Code section 19997 because this statute provides specific procedures for laying off less senior employees that do not apply to an across-the-board employee furlough. (\n   <em>\n    Professional Engineers\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 1034-1036,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20480\">\n    116 Cal.Rptr.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20P.3d%201186\">\n    239 P.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <em>\n    Professional Engineers\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that a furlough and a layoff may be treated differently for purposes of evaluating the executive branch's authority to reduce public employee wages\n   without legislative approval. This conclusion does not logically support NASSCO's contention that its own action did not constitute a \"layoff\" under the California WARN Act because it now labels its action a \"furlough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In its opening brief, NASSCO argues the California WARN Act applies only when there is a \"severance\" or \"termination\" of the \"relationship between employer and employee.\" In its reply brief NASSCO proposes a different construction, acknowledging that a temporary \"seven-month ... absence from work\" could trigger a statutory notification duty. NASSCO explains its view that \"the California WARN Act embodies the presumption that a prolonged absence\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a 'separation' severing the employment relationship,\" and thus asserts that the California WARN Act applies only when directing employees to take more than \"minimal time off of work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There is no statutory support for this construction. The California WARN Act does not state a separation must occur for a specified time period, and there are no statutory grounds for determining the scope of such a proposed rule. Although an employer may view a five-week break as minimal, a worker who is living paycheck-to-paycheck may not. As discussed below, the California Legislature did not include the federal WARN Act's rule that the notification duty is triggered only when the layoff is for more than six months. Given this omission, there is no reasonable basis to interpret the statute to mean a four-or five-week layoff does not constitute a \"separation from position,\" but a six- or seven-month layoff does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Other Statutory Construction Tools\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even assuming the relevant language of the California WARN Act is ambiguous, the legislative history and underlying public policy support the conclusion that an employer has the obligation to provide notice even if the intended layoff is temporary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In 1988, Congress enacted the federal WARN Act to require 60 days' notice before any \"plant closing or mass layoff.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202102\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).) About 15 years later, in 2003, the California Legislature enacted its own version (the California WARN Act), believing the federal law was ineffective in various respects and seeking to \" 'supplement' \" the law to provide stronger worker protections.

In expanding the protections, the Legislature was concerned primarily that the federal WARN Act had limited application, requiring advance notice only when a large employer (with more than 100 employees) implements a large\n   employee layoff (33 percent of the workforce or 500 employees).

The Legislature thus enacted new minimums: the California WARN Act requires notices for layoffs of 50 workers (regardless of the percentage of the workforce), and applies to employers that employ 75 or more persons.

The federal WARN Act law then defines \" 'employment loss' \" to mean one of three things: \"(A) an\n   <em>\n    employment termination\n   </em>\n   , other than a discharge for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement, (B)\n   <em>\n    a layoff exceeding 6 months\n   </em>\n   , or (C)\n   <em>\n    a reduction in hours of work\n   </em>\n   of more than 50 percent during each month of any 6-month period.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Under these statutory definitions, Congress did not limit a \"mass layoff\" to an employment termination. To the contrary, under the (B) and (C) subdivisions, a layoff occurs if the employment relationship continues, but the employer directs the employees not to return to work for a period \"exceeding six months\" or the employees remain in their positions but their hours are reduced (by the specified numbers). (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(B), (C).) As noted by the Department of Labor, the statutory terms \"termination\" and \"layoff\" are distinguishable \"and ... have their common sense meanings. Thus, for the purposes of defining 'employment loss,' the term 'termination' means the permanent cessation of the employment relationship and the term 'layoff' means the temporary cessation of that relationship.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016042\">\n    54 Fed.

Although the parties have not cited, nor have we found, any specific explanation in the legislative history materials for this change, we can draw some reasonable inferences from the redefinition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, we presume the California Legislature did not intend to adopt the exact same definition of a \"mass layoff.\" By using different words, it is reasonable to conclude the Legislature intended some change from the federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, we can infer the Legislature necessarily understood that the term \"layoff\" under the federal law did not require an employment termination and instead encompassed temporary layoffs and certain specified reduction in hours.

Therefore, we find unconvincing NASSCO's insistence that a layoff is normally (or in modern times) defined to mean only a complete termination of employment and thus the California Legislature must have intended to use this definition. We are required to consider statutory terms in context of related statutes, which the federal WARN Act certainly is. (See\n   <em>\n    Pennington,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513692\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/448/#p795\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   3 Cal.5th at p. 795,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513692\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/448/#p795\">\n    221 Cal.Rptr.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513692\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/221/448/#p795\">\n    400 P.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dieckmann v.

Thus we must presume that in enacting the California WARN Act the legislators understood the term layoff (in the framework of a \"mass layoff\" notice requirement) can encompass a temporary work stoppage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Third, the entire thrust of the legislative effort in enacting the California WARN Act was to provide greater protection to California workers than was afforded under the federal law. Otherwise there would have been no need for\n   a state law. When the statute was enacted, both temporary and permanent unannounced layoffs were causing economic problems in California. (Cal. Labor and Workforce Development Agency, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2957 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 13, 2002, at pp. 5-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The federal law expressly required notice before a temporary layoff (of six months or more) could be effectuated. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).) It would be contrary to the fundamental legislative purpose seeking to better protect California workers to conclude the Legislature intended to completely eliminate the temporary-layoff notice requirement. Mindful of the federal WARN Act, if the Legislature wished to include only permanent layoffs, the Legislature could have defined the term \"layoff\" as a \"permanent separation from a position.\" Or if it wished to maintain the six-month minimum, it could have defined \"layoff\" as a \"separation from a position for six months.\" The Legislature did not include either of these limitations. Instead, the Legislature used the broader \"separation from a position\" phrase. ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (c).) Under a reasonable interpretation, this language reflects the Legislature's decision to incorporate the first two prongs of the federal definition but without the six-month limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   NASSCO and its amici contend that a temporary layoff does not promote the public policies underlying the California WARN Act because the \"primary\" purpose of the notice requirement was to assist workers who become unemployed. However, the legislative history documents reflect the Legislature had several objectives in enacting the law, including to: (1) provide \" 'affected employees the greater ability to make plans and adjustments to\n   their new situation as well as seek other employment and educational opportunities' \"; (2) \" 'allow for local resources to be utilized helping to ease the strain caused by a layoff or plant closure on the community' \"; and (3) \"place local governments and other concerned entities 'in a better position to retrain and offer placement services to those affected' \" (\n   <em>\n    MacIsaac, supra,\n   </em>\n   134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1090,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20650\">\n    36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   These objectives are implicated when a temporary layoff occurs. As occurred in this case, workers who temporarily lose their wages may be unable to pay their rent or mortgage, child support, alimony, car payments,\n   utility bills and groceries. Two months' notice would assist workers to find alternate funding sources for these fixed obligations, and provide them with the opportunity to make plans and adjustments and explore educational and/or short-term employment opportunities. Additionally, the notice would serve the statutory objectives by allowing local government agencies the opportunity to \"intervene and offer ... services to the employees, as well as pursue alternatives with the employer whenever feasible.\" (Cal. Labor and Workforce Development Agency, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 2957 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 13, 2002, at p. 7.) Although workers subject to a temporary layoff may not need training for a new job, advance notice would provide the workers time to plan and prepare for their sudden wage loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   NASSCO argues the trial court's interpretation would \"do more harm than good\" because it would \"encourag[e] employers to provide near-constant 'rolling' WARN notices, crying wolf so often that a true cry of distress would ultimately be ignored.\" However, these actions would be against the law. As amici acknowledge, the \"federal regulations ...\n   <em>\n    preclude\n   </em>\n   employers from engaging in this kind of 'rolling notice' practice.\" (See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20639.8\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"A ticketed notice, i.e., preprinted notice regularly included in each employee's pay check or pay envelope, does not meet the requirements of WARN.\"];\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20639.8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 639.10(b) [\"Rolling notice ... is not acceptable\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   NASSCO alternatively urges us to write into the statute a six-month limitation for temporary layoffs, asserting this would be a more reasonable standard. The argument is unavailing. As an appellate court we have no power to rewrite a law. (See\n   <em>\n    California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist\n   </em>\n   . (1997)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"341431\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/14/627/#p633\">\n    14 Cal.4th 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20671\">\n    59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20P.2d%201175\">\n    927 P.2d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Additionally, it is not reasonable to conclude the California Legislature intended to adopt the federal law's six-month limitation. If it had, it could and would have used the same language.

With respect to the latter, NASSCO asks: \"What if an employer shuts down or delays opening for a few hours, because of a local event? ... What if a key supervisor is sick or injured and workers are sent home a few hours early? What if a business closes down for a few hours or a full day due to lack of inventory?\" In a similar vein, amici argue that requiring notice of temporary layoffs would be unworkable because no business can account for the \"many 'unexpected circumstances' that cause work slow-downs and stoppages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   These arguments do not provide grounds for refusing to enforce the California WARN Act as it is written. First, we need not speculate about the scope of an employer's obligations under the hypothetical situations because these circumstances are not before this court. The issue here is whether NASSCO's layoff was covered by the California WARN Act. The undisputed facts establish that although NASSCO was aware of the need for layoffs, they did not inform at least 90 workers until the day they reported to work that they would be laid off starting immediately. During the approximate four-to-five week layoff, the 90 employees performed no work, received no wages, earned no vacation time, and accrued no pension service credit. There is no showing NASSCO could not have reasonably provided the notice, or that a notice requirement would be absurd or unworkable under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, contrary to NASSCO's and amici's assertions, there is nothing in the legislative history documents showing the Legislature intended to exclude layoffs resulting from unforeseeable events. The California Legislature made a decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to incorporate the federal law's unforeseeable-circumstances exception and narrowed the federal exception to a \"physical calamity or act of war.\" (\u00a7 1401, subd. (c); see Sen. Com. on Labor and Industrial Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2957 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 17, 2002, p. 3 [in \"Background Responses,\" deleting \"other unforeseeable circumstances\" from proposed bill].) Thus, assuming a brief unforeseeable layoff was the result of \"lack of funds or lack of work\" ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (c) ) and the layoff would not come within the de\n   minimus doctrine or a statutory exception, the employer will need to pay the employees their wages. If the employer compensates the employees within three weeks, the employer will not be subject to any penalties. (\u00a7 1403.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   These provisions reflect a deliberate decision to shift the burden of unexpected, unplanned-even brief-work stoppages for \"lack of funds or lack of work\" to the employer rather than to the employees ( \u00a7 1400, subd. (c) ), and represents the Legislature's judgment that California employers, not California employees, should bear the risk of surprise resulting from an unexpected layoff. Whether this judgment is a wise legislative decision is not before us. The process of weighing the relative benefits of advance notice to California workers against the costs to California employers is an inherently legislative function. The Court of Appeal is not the proper forum for rewriting the California WARN Act to minimize the perceived burdens imposed on California's businesses. To the extent NASSCO or its supporting amici have complaints regarding the high cost of complying with the California WARN Act\n   in its current form, they should direct those concerns to the California Legislature, which is better suited as a policy-making body to consider and respond to those concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, to the extent there is any remaining ambiguity, we are required to favor the employees' interpretation. The California WARN Act is a remedial statute designed to provide protections to workers, their families, and communities. (See\n   <em>\n    Day v. Celadon Trucking Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (8th Cir. 2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334993\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/817/\">\n    827 F.3d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 835 ;\n   <em>\n    Cashman v.
