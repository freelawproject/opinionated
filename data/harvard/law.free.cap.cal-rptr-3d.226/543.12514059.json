This reflected a state policy to curtail perceived abuses of the Community Redevelopment Law (CRL) by which RDAs and their \"sponsor\" entities (usually cities) that created the RDAs and staffed their boards used an increasing share of local property taxes as \"tax increments\" (increases in property tax attributable to RDA projects) for their own benefit.

(See Assem. Bill No. 1484 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) adding Stats. 2012, ch. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 40.) This due diligence review (DDR) (\u00a7 34179.5, subd. (a)) identified \"[t]he dollar value of any cash ... transferred after January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, by the redevelopment agency or the successor agency to [a sponsoring entity] and the purpose of each transfer.\" (\u00a7 34179.5, subd. (c)(2).) Assembly Bill No. 1484 required the successor agency to submit the results of this audit to the successor agency's oversight board (\u00a7 34179.6, subd. (c)) and to the Department, which had the authority to adjust any amounts in the DDR (\u00a7 34179.6, subd. (d)). The bill did not change the general definition of \"enforceable obligations\" that had excluded agreements between a former RDA and its creator, with exceptions. (\u00a7 34171, subd. (d)(2) [\" 'enforceable obligation' does not include any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city ... that created the [RDA] and the former [RDA]\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Assembly Bill No. 1484 clarified the process of winding down the former RDAs.

This case in part involves what the parties loosely refer to as \"clawbacks.\" (See \u00a7\u00a7 34179.5, subds. (b) &amp; (c), 34179.6, subds. (c) &amp; (d).) This refers to the administrative unwinding (via the DDR) of specified RDA transactions that occurred after the Great Dissolution was proposed in January 2011. The period subject to clawbacks is from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. It includes but is not limited to the approximate six-month period referred to by the parties and described in the legislative history as the \"fire sale\" of RDA assets, which lasted until the freeze took effect in June 2011.

The trial court aptly called it an \"umbrella\" agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 17, 2011-during the so-called fire sale period-the City and its RDA entered into two new \"Cooperative Agreements,\" designed to try to insulate certain transactions from the looming Great Dissolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One 2011 agreement pertained to a highway project (Dorsey Project). In part, this agreement (Dorsey Agreement) provided the RDA \"will pay for or reimburse the City for actions undertaken and costs and expenses incurred for and on behalf of the [RDA] or otherwise in furtherance of the redevelopment of the Dorsey Project.\" The Dorsey Agreement anticipated the Great Dissolution by describing what would happen if the RDA were no longer authorized to function \"pursuant to state law.\" The agreement provided the RDA would transfer some $5 million to the City, payable from tax increments or other lawful sources. By January 31, 2012, the RDA had transferred $695,000 in tax increment money to the City under the Dorsey Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The second 2011 agreement at issue (which we refer to as the Omnibus Agreement) provided the RDA would pay the City for several extant projects totaling over $18 million. It, too, anticipated the Great Dissolution and made provision therefor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Department determined these agreements were not enforceable obligations because they were agreements between an RDA and its organic City. (See \u00a7 34171, subd. (d)(2).) Ultimately, the Department required the City to transfer certain money to the County Auditor-Controller.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City paid under protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Other facts will be provided as necessary in the Discussion,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We discuss the issues in a different order than that presented by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The Goods and Services Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court issued a writ commanding the Department to consider whether certain transfers under the 2011 Omnibus Agreement ($307,161 at issue herein) were for \"goods and services\" as that phrase is used in section 34179.5, subdivision (b)(3). That subdivision defines a relevant transfer in the negative as \"the transmission of money to another party that is\n   <em>\n    not in payment for goods or services\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) As we will explain, we agree with the Department's contention in its cross-appeal that the issuance of the writ for that purpose was error, as the City never asked the Department to consider that point during the administrative meet and confer process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The City first raised this issue after the trial court's adverse tentative ruling, and after the trial court had issued a decision in another case addressing goods and services (the judgment later affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Brentwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056000\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/237/488/#p491\">\n    237 Cal.App.4th 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2088\">\n    188 Cal.Rptr.3d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The trial court found the City's failure to raise the issue with the Department via its meet and confer process barred its claim. However, instead of dismissing the claim, the trial court remanded the issue to the Department, without limiting the Department's discretion to find the claim came too late or whether the money was or was not paid for relevant goods and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although we agree with the trial court that the City's failure to exhaust an available administrative remedy precluded the court from considering the issue, we hold that remanding the issue to the Department under these specific circumstances was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 34179.6, subdivision (e) provides in part that certain parties \"\n   <em>\n    may request to meet and confer with the department to resolve any disputes\n   </em>\n   regarding the amounts or sources of funds identified as determined by the department.

Senate Bill No. 107 is \"silent as to its application to the DDR, a process that was, by statute, to be completed over two years before\" it was enacted. Therefore, \"had the Legislature intended retroactive application of [the new] definition of 'enforceable obligation' to determinations\" already made, \"the Legislature would have expressed that intention with absolute clarity.

Therefore, that new definition could not have\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   application if it were prospective. It would be inapplicable to any relevant agreement and thus meaningless. The City elaborates on this point with this pertinent observation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"Further evidence of legislative intent that this new language be retroactive is that it creates a new exception to the rule that most City-RDA agreements are not 'enforceable obligations' for application to the results of [DDR]s required by ... section 34179.5.

However, the issue to be decided in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case-whether the Dorsey Agreement is the kind of project contemplated by the new definition of Senate Bill No. 107-is one that properly would have gone first to the Department, had the new definition been in existence when the City invoked the meet and confer process. In our view, the Department is the appropriate body to consider the issue in the first instance.

It contends the trial court was wrong to treat the 1986 agreement between the\n   City and its RDA as of only marginal relevance, because it was entered into within two years of the City's creation of its RDA. Loan agreements entered into between RDAs and their creators within two years of creation may be enforceable. (\u00a7 34171, subd. (d)(2) [\"Notwithstanding this paragraph, loan agreements entered into between the [RDA] and the city ... that created it, within two years of the date of creation ... may be deemed to be enforceable obligations\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   However, as described\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , the 1986 agreement was an umbrella agreement that set forth the mechanics of the operation of the RDA vis-\u00e0 -vis the City. It permitted the City to \"advance or expend\" funds to the RDA or on its behalf, required periodic statements to the RDA of costs incurred by the City and required the RDA to use available funds to reimburse the City for all costs incurred. But the 1986 agreement did not reference any specific extant or anticipated projects, nor any \"loan agreements\" between the RDA and the City, as contemplated by section 34171, subdivision (d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The City contends: \"A loan requires only [an] identified lender and borrower, an amount, a prepayment obligation, and repayment terms. [Citation.] A loan need not have a fixed amount or repayment schedule.\" But no amounts of any kind or contemplated loans whatsoever are described by the 1986 agreement. Indeed, the authority cited by the City\n   cuts against its position: \"Typically, a contract involving a loan must include the identity of the lender and borrower, the amount of the loan, and the terms for repayment in order to be sufficiently definite. [Citation.] Preliminary negotiations or agreements for future negotiations-so-called agreements to agree-are not enforceable contracts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

This does not mean the agreement was invalid at the time it was entered.

The City reasons that in conducting such audits, the Department may not apply the statutory definitions of enforceable obligations found in section 34171, subdivision (d), because \"that subdivision defines 'enforceable obligation' for\n   <strong>\n    post\n   </strong>\n   -dissolution purposes and therefore does not apply to a [DDR] of pre-dissolution transfers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We do not agree with the City's contention, the thrust of which we previously have rejected in other published cases, which we decline to revisit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As we outlined\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , section 34171, subdivision (d)(2), as adopted by the original dissolution statute, provided (with exceptions) that agreements between a City and its RDA are not enforceable. (Added by Stats. 2011-2012, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 7.) Assembly Bill No. 1484 did not change section 34171, subdivision (d)(2) in any way. But it did add section 34179.5, which in part provided for the DDR, and section 34179.6, which described the procedures following such review. (See Stats. 2012, ch. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Section 34179.5, subdivision (b)(2) provides in part: \" 'Enforceable obligation' includes any of the items listed in subdivision (d) of Section 34171 [and] contracts detailing specific work to be performed that were entered into by the former [RDA] prior to June 28, 2011, with a third party that is\n   <em>\n    other than the city\n   </em>\n   ... that created the former [RDA.]\" (Stats. 2012, ch. 26, \u00a7 17, italics added.)

We disagree. Section 34167, part of the original dissolution bill, provides that an enforceable obligation is \"[a]ny legally binding and enforceable agreement or contract that is not otherwise void as violating the debt limit or public policy.\" (\u00a7 34167, subd. (d)(5).) Similar language appears in the original version of section 34171, which defines several \"enforceable\" obligations, including, \"Loans of moneys borrowed by the [RDA] for a lawful purpose, to the extent they are legally required to be repaid pursuant to a required repayment schedule or other mandatory loan terms\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., subd.

(d)(1)(E)). Section 34169, also part of the original dissolution bill, in part provided: \"Until successor agencies are authorized ... [RDAs] shall do all of the following: [\u00b6] (a) Continue to make all scheduled payments for enforceable obligations, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 34167.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   These provisions must be harmonized with the rest of the dissolution statutes, if possible.

But as we outlined\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , the dissolution component became effective later because of a stay and subsequent judicial\n   reformation of statutory deadlines by our Supreme Court.

To the extent any agreements between the City and its RDA may have been legally enforceable during this window period, their enforceability resulted from the vicissitudes of litigation, not legislative intent. The enforceability of such agreements ended when that window was shut forcefully. We are confident the Legislature intended to apply the postdissolution (i.e., Part 1.85) definitions of enforceable obligations retrospectively, for the reasons stated in our prior cases.
