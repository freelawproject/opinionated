(Cal. Const., arts. XIII A, XIII C, XIII D.) This case concerns the application of these constitutional limitations to a particular\n   kind of local government charge: a statutorily authorized \"ground water charge\" imposed on well operators by a local water conservation district to fund conservation activities such as replenishing groundwater stores and preventing degradation of the water supply. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 75522.) By statute, charges for pumping groundwater for nonagricultural uses generally must be at least three times the charges for pumping water for agricultural uses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 75594.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City of San Buenaventura (more commonly known as the City of Ventura) (City), which pumps large quantities of groundwater for delivery to residential customers, contends that the groundwater pumping charges it pays to its local water conservation district, United Water Conservation District (District), are disproportionate to the benefits it receives from the District's conservation activities. It also contends that it pays a disproportionate share of the costs of those activities by virtue of the three-to-one ratio in Water Code section 75594. The City argues that the charges therefore violate article XIII D of the California Constitution (Prop. 218, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996)), which provides that a charge imposed \"as an incident of property ownership,\" including a \"charge for a property related service,\" may not \"exceed the proportional cost\" of the service that is \"attributable to the parcel\" on which the charge is imposed. ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7\u00a7 2, subd. (e), 6, subd. (b)(3).) In the alternative, the City argues that the charges violate article XIII C of the California Constitution (as amended by Prop. 26, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 2010)), which provides that local government charges are taxes that generally must be approved by voters, but exempts from this category those charges that are limited to the reasonable costs of providing a\n   special benefit or service and that bear a \"fair or reasonable\" relationship to the benefit to the payor of, or the payor's burden on, the government activity ( Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e)(1) &amp; (2)). The City argues that the groundwater pumping charges do not satisfy the criteria for exempt charges, and therefore should be considered unapproved taxes imposed in violation of the Constitution.\n   The Court of Appeal rejected both arguments. We conclude, as did the Court of Appeal, that article XIII C, as amended by Proposition 26, rather than article XIII D, supplies the proper framework for evaluating the constitutionality of the groundwater pumping charges at issue in this case. But because the Court of Appeal did not address the City's argument that the charges do not bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on or benefits from the District's conservation activities, as article XIII C requires, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for consideration of that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The District is a water conservation district formed under the Water Conservation District Law of 1931 ( Wat. Code, \u00a7 74000 et seq. ), to \" 'manage, protect, conserve and enhance the water resources of the Santa Clara River, its tributaries and associated aquifers, in the most cost effective and environmentally balanced manner.' \" The District's territory, which covers approximately 214,000 acres in central Ventura County, encompasses all or part of eight groundwater basins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Like many groundwater basins throughout California, basins in the District's territory have suffered from what is known as \"overdraft\"-meaning that more water is being taken out than is replaced by natural processes, including rainfall and river and stream flow. Overdraft can result in saltwater intrusion into the fresh groundwater supply and can reduce the basin's capacity for groundwater storage. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 75505.) To counteract overdraft and its effects, the District artificially \"recharges,\" or replenishes, the groundwater supply by diverting water from other sources and spreading it over the ground covering certain basins within district boundaries. To reduce the demand for groundwater extraction, the District also provides pipeline deliveries of water derived from other sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Water Code authorizes water conservation districts to finance their activities by imposing a \"ground water charge[ ]\" on \"the production of ground water from all water-producing facilities\" within the district (or within\n   certain zones in the district). ( Wat. Code, \u00a7 75522.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the code, a district may establish different zones for rate-setting purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 75591.) Within each zone, the district must charge a uniform rate for all water pumped for agricultural use, and a uniform rate for all water pumped for nonagricultural use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 75591, 75593.) Subject to an exception not relevant here (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 75595), the rate for nonagricultural use must be between three and five times the rate for agricultural use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 75594.) Consistent with these provisions, the District imposes a volume-based charge on groundwater pumping within its territory. As required by section 75594 of the Water Code, the District's rates for pumping for nonagricultural use are three times those for pumping for agricultural use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the California Constitution, as amended by a series of voter initiatives, local government taxes, fees, charges, and other exactions are subject to several requirements and restrictions. The first of these initiatives, Proposition 13, added article XIII A to the Constitution. Passed in 1978, the purpose of\n   the initiative \"was to assure effective real property tax relief by means of an 'interlocking \"package\" ' consisting of a real property tax rate limitation (art. XIII A, \u00a7 1), a real property assessment limitation (art. XIII A, \u00a7 2), a restriction on state taxes (art. XIII A, \u00a7 3), and a restriction on local taxes (art.

Article XIII D, added by Proposition 218, imposes certain substantive and procedural restrictions on taxes, assessments, fees, and charges \"assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership.\" ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 3, subd. (a).)

Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e).) The definition contains numerous exceptions for certain types of exactions, including for \"property-related fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII D\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20592\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1, subd.

(e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This case arises from a long-running controversy between the City and the District about the District's groundwater\n   pumping charges. In the 1980s, the\n   District planned a major improvement project to divert water from the Santa Clara River for recharge purposes. The District proposed to finance the diversion project by imposing new pumping charges on users within a newly established rate zone comprising areas that would benefit from the project. The City protested, arguing that the proposed zone included a basin on which City wells operated that would not benefit from the project, and filed several lawsuits challenging the District's proposal. In 1987, the parties entered a settlement agreement in which the District agreed to create a second zone for project-related charges in which the rate for nonagricultural use would be set at one-third of the previously announced rate for the first zone-that is, a rate equal to the rate imposed on agricultural users within the first zone. When the settlement agreement expired at the end of 2011, the District eliminated the special zone, resulting in substantially higher pumping rates for groundwater extractors in the affected territory, including the City. After providing notice and inviting comment, the District also increased the general rate for groundwater pumping throughout the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The City again filed suit to challenge the pumping charges, contending that the charges violate either article XIII D or, in the alternative, article XIII C of the California Constitution. In support of its contention, the City alleged that it pays more than its fair share of the costs of the District's conservation efforts, both relative to agricultural users by virtue of the three-to-one ratio required under section 75594 of the Water Code, and relative to other users in the district that pump from basins that receive greater benefit from the District's recharge efforts. The City petitioned the court for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and for a writ of administrative mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and sought declaratory relief as well as a determination of invalidity under Code of Civil Procedure section 860 et seq. (commonly known as a reverse validation action (\n   <em>\n    McLeod v. Vista Unified School Dist.\n   </em>\n   (2008)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835603\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/158/1156/#p1165\">\n    158 Cal.App.4th 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1165-1166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20109\">\n    71 Cal.Rptr.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )). The City challenged the 2011-2012 rates and the 2012-2013 rates in separate actions, which were consolidated in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court ruled in the City's favor.

The trial court concluded, however, that the District's general practice of charging a uniform fee across an area comported with article XIII D's requirement that a property-related fee or charge \"not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel\" ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 6, subd. (b)(3)) because it would be infeasible for the District to attribute the costs of its conservation activities on a parcel-by-parcel basis, and because\n   the charges in the aggregate did not exceed the reasonable costs of the District's conservation activities. But the trial court concluded that the three-to-one ratio mandated by Water Code section 75594 did violate article XIII D's proportionality requirement because the District failed to demonstrate that \"the costs relating to agricultural water as compared with non-agricultural water support [the] differential.\" The trial court entered a declaratory judgment and issued the writs of mandate, ordering the District to refund the City $548,296.22 for charges for the 2011-2012 water year and $794,815.57 for the 2012-2013 water year, plus interest.\n   These represent the amounts the City paid in excess of the District's average costs for all types of water usage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court of Appeal reversed. It held that the pumping charges are not property-related charges or fees within the meaning of article XIII D. The court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Amrhein\n   </em>\n   , on which the trial court had relied, as involving \"a unique set of facts\" not present here. But the court went on to conclude that regardless of the factual setting, \"a pump fee is better characterized as a charge on the\n   activity of pumping than a charge imposed by reason of property ownership.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Orange County Water Dist. v. Farnsworth\n   </em>\n   (1956)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2168217\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/138/518/\">\n    138 Cal.App.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20P.2d%20927\">\n    292 P.2d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Moreover, the Court of Appeal held that even if the charges were \"property-related charges\" for purposes of article XIII D, they would not violate article XIII D's requirement that the fee \"not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel\" by virtue of the three-to-one ratio in Water Code section 75594. ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 6, subd. (b)(3).) The court reasoned: \" Section 75594 does not discriminate between persons or parcels. It discriminates between types of use. [Citation.] If the City chooses to use its groundwater for agricultural purposes, it too can benefit from the lower rates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court of Appeal further held that the pumping charges are not taxes subject to the requirements of article XIII C. The court concluded that the charges fall within the exception for payor-specific benefits and privileges. The court reasoned that the operative question, for purposes of this exception, is whether the charges in the aggregate exceed the District's costs of providing groundwater management services. The court held that this question was effectively answered by the trial court's finding that the pumping charges in the aggregate do not exceed the District's reasonable costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We begin by considering the City's argument that the District's groundwater pumping charges violate article XIII D, added by Proposition 218.

Article XIII D's\n   repeated references to fees and charges imposed \" 'as an incident of property ownership,' \" we explained, \"mean[ ] that a levy may not be imposed on a property owner as such-i.e., in its capacity as property owner-unless it meets constitutional prerequisites. In this case, however, the fee is imposed on landlords not in their capacity as landowners, but in their capacity as business owners.

The court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Amrhein\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the record in this case contains no comparable indication that the majority of property owners in the District's territory obtain water by pumping it from wells. But the court concluded that a pumping fee is in any event \"better characterized as a charge on the activity of pumping than a charge imposed by reason of property ownership.\" This is true, the court concluded, \"even with respect to the individual household that elects to pump water for its own consumption.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We conclude that the Court of Appeal in this case has the better of the argument. The critical question is whether the groundwater charge-a charge for the District's conservation and management services-qualifies as a \"charge for a property related service.\" ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e).) The text of article XIII D provides important indications about what sort of service-related charges the voters had in mind. Article XIII D, section 6 tells us, for example, that revenues derived from the fee may not\n   \"exceed the funds required to provide the property related service\" (subd. (b)(1)); that the amount imposed on any parcel may not \"exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel\" (subd. (b)(3)); and that property owners may not be charged for \"potential or future use of a service\" (subd. (b)(4)) or for \"general governmental services\" (subd. (b)(5)). The lesson\n   that emerges from the text and cases is this: A fee is charged for a \"property-related service,\" and is thus subject to article XIII D, if it is imposed on a property owner, in his or her capacity as a property owner, to pay for the costs of providing a service to a parcel of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Measured by that yardstick, the groundwater pumping charge at issue here falls\n   short. To be sure, the charge is used for the conservation and management of groundwater, and water is, as we said in\n   <em>\n    Bighorn\n   </em>\n   , \"indispensable to most uses of real property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Bighorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 39 Cal.4th at p. 214,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2073\">\n    46 Cal.Rptr.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=138%20P.3d%20220\">\n    138 P.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But not all fees associated with obtaining water are property-related fees within the meaning of article XIII D; otherwise,\n   <em>\n    Richmond\n   </em>\n   , which concerned fees for making connections necessary for obtaining water delivery, would have been decided differently. And while\n   <em>\n    Bighorn\n   </em>\n   holds that fees for supplying water through an established connection are property-related service fees, charges for the service the District provides-that is, the conservation of limited groundwater stores, and remediation of the adverse effects of groundwater extraction-are not property-related in the same way: The District does not \"deliver\" water \"via groundwater\" to any particular parcel or set of parcels, as the City would characterize it. The District instead conserves and replenishes groundwater that flows through an interconnected series of underground basins, none of which corresponds with parcel boundaries. These basins are managed by the District for the benefit of the public that relies on groundwater supplies, not merely for the benefit of the owners of land on which wells are located. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 75521, 75522.) And as this case demonstrates, these two groups are not one and the same; while some well operators extract water for use on their own property, others, such as the City, extract water for sale and distribution elsewhere. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    City of Barstow\n   </em>\n   (2000)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"277039\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/23/1224/#p1240\">\n    23 Cal.4th 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240-1241,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20294\">\n    99 Cal.Rptr.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20P.3d%20853\">\n    5 P.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [contrasting overlying with appropriative water rights].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   All this means that the District's services, by their nature, are not directed at any particular parcel or set of parcels in the same manner as, for example, water delivery or refuse collection services.

Put differently, when the District fulfills its statutory functions it is not providing a service to the City in its capacity as the owner of the lands on which its wells are located, but in the City's capacity as an extractor of groundwater from stores that are managed for the benefit of the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We see no indication that the voters who approved Proposition 218-thereby, among other things, giving property owners the right to block property-related fees and charges by majority protest ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 6, subd. (a)(2))-had this sort of charge in mind. We therefore conclude that the groundwater charge authorized by Water Code section 75522 is not a charge for a \"property-related service\" that falls within the scope of Proposition 218.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We next turn to the City's argument that the District's groundwater pumping charges violate article XIII C, as amended by Proposition 26. As noted, Proposition 26 expanded the definition of \"taxes\" requiring voter approval to include a \"levy, charge or exaction of any kind,\" but exempted certain categories of exactions from its reach, including certain charges imposed for specific government benefits, privileges, services, or products provided directly to the payor. ( Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e)(1) &amp; (2).) \"The local government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity, and that the manner in which those costs are allocated\n   to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20P.3d%20518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1, subd.

Proposition 26 codified both requirements. (See Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e) [to prove fee is not a tax, \"local government bears the burden of proving ... that the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits\n   received from, the governmental activity,\" and \"that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity\"].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Both the trial court and the Court of Appeal concluded that the groundwater pumping charge was exempt from article XIII C's definition of \"tax,\" but for different reasons. The trial court held that the charge falls within the exception for \"[a]ssessments and property-related fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII D.\" ( Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e)(7).) The Court of Appeal concluded that the charge instead falls into\n   the exception for \"[a] charge imposed for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or granting the privilege.\"\n   (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=250%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1, subd. (e)(1).) The court reasoned that the charge is imposed on well operators for the privilege of extracting water from underground reserves, akin to a charge for entrance to a state or local park for purposes of conserving the resource, and that each well operator receives a benefit from the District's conservation activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The City does not dispute that the pumping charge is imposed for a government \"privilege\" or \"benefit,\" or, alternatively, for a \"government service or product\" (which is subject to the same set of requirements as a fee for a government \"privilege\" or \"benefit\" under subdivision (e)(1)) ( Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e)(2)). But the City contends that the pumping charge cannot satisfy the remaining requirements for an exempt charge because the City does not benefit from the District's activities to the same extent as other pumpers, and because Water Code section 75594's three-to-one ratio requires the City and other nonagricultural users to shoulder a disproportionate share of the fiscal burden of supporting the District's activities. The City argues that the charges therefore violate both the requirement that the amount of a nontax charge be \"no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity,\" and the requirement that \"the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activity.\" ( Cal. Const., art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (e).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although the Court of Appeal declared both requirements satisfied, its analysis addressed only the first. The Court of Appeal mentioned the \"fair or reasonable relationship\" requirement only in passing, noting that, \"by imposing fees based upon the volume of water extracted, the District largely\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   charge individual pumpers in proportion to the benefit they receive from the District's conservation activities.\" But, the court concluded, \"[t]hat is more than is required.\" What article XIII C does require, the court reasoned, is simply that the District's pumping charges, in the aggregate, do not exceed the reasonable cost of regulating the District's groundwater supply. In support of this conclusion, the Court of Appeal cited our decision in\n   <em>\n    California Farm Bureau Federation v.

We thus remand the case to the Court of Appeal with instructions to consider whether the record sufficiently establishes that the District's rates for the 2011-2012 and the 2012-2013 water years bore a reasonable relationship to the burdens on or the benefits of its conservation activities, as article XIII C requires.

But I would provide an explicit answer to a question addressed only implicitly by the court. One of the issues on which we granted review was whether Water Code section 75594's requirement for at least a three-to-one ratio of fees on nonagricultural use of groundwater to such fees on agricultural use survives the adoption of articles XIII C and XIII D. The answer, which is apparent from today's opinion, is that the requirement does not survive. There may be\n   circumstances in which the three-to-one ratio is justified, but the justification will not have anything to do with Water Code section 75594. Instead, the justification will be that the fees imposed on ratepayers bear \"a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental activity.\" ( Cal.
