Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 56x/2, par. 1401(b)(2)). He filed a motion to suppress evidence. Following a hearing, the motion was denied, and defendant was found guilty after a stipulated bench trial in the circuit court of Cook County. He was sentenced to serve a prison term of six years.</p> <p id=\"b440-9\" pgmap=\"440\">On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in denying the suppression of evidence. The issues on appeal are: (1) whether the initial encounter between defendant and the law officers was consensual or a Terry-type detention; (2) if the encounter was a Terry-type detention, whether sufficient facts justified the detention; and (3) whether the subsequent search of defendant\u2019s shoulder bag violated his fourth amendment rights.</p> <p id=\"b440-10\" pgmap=\"440(86) 441(13)\">On March 26, 1987, defendant took a one-way flight from Midway Airport in Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On March 29, 1987, he purchased a one-way Amtrak train ticket from Fort Lauderdale to Chicago via Washington, D.C. On March 30, 1987, Officer Christine Kolman, a 13-year veteran of the Chicago police department, learned from the Amtrak police that defendant would arrive in Chicago on Amtrak train No. 29. She also learned that day or the following day that defendant was traveling from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, via Washington, D.C., and that he had made several similar trips in the past.</p> <p id=\"b441-5\" pgmap=\"441\">About 9:10 a.m. on March 31, 1987, defendant and a companion, Edward Borner, arrived at Union Station, 210 South Canal Street in Chicago, on Amtrak train No. 29. At that time, Kolman and other plainclothes narcotics agents were conducting a surveillance narcotics investigation. During the course of her surveillance, Kolman observed defendant and Borner exit the train. Defendant walked without hesitation through the waiting area and the rest of the train station, but he repeatedly turned around, looked behind him, and made eye contact several times with Kolman and one of the other officers. Defendant again made eye contact with Kolman once or twice as he rode up the escalator to the mezzanine level. Defendant stepped off the escalator on the mezzanine level and had walked about 5 to 10 feet away from the escalator when an Amtrak police officer approached him. This was a well-illuminated, crowded public area near the exit doors. Kolman approached defendant, identified herself as a Chicago police officer, and displayed her identification badge. The Amtrak police officer and a special narcotics agent were with Kolman and defendant, but the Amtrak police officer walked away when Kolman and the agent identified themselves. Kolman stood alongside defendant. Neither she nor the other officers touched or grabbed him, nor did they display their weapons. No one was standing in front of defendant; rather, the exit doors were in front of defendant. Defendant was not pinned against any wall or counter.</p> <p id=\"b441-6\" pgmap=\"441(189) 442(85)\">After Kolman identified herself, she asked defendant and Borner whether they would agree to speak to the officers. When they stated that they would, Kolman asked them to produce their train tickets and driver\u2019s licenses or other identification. They then produced their driver\u2019s licenses and travel itineraries. Defendant\u2019s travel itinerary reflected that he flew to Fort Lauderdale from Midway Airport in Chicago on March 26, and that he left Fort Lauderdale on March 29, on a train to Chicago via Washington, D.C. After Kolman read the documents, she returned them to defendant and Borner. She then explained that the officers were conducting a narcotics investigation, and she asked them how long they had been in Florida and whether the trip was for business or pleasure. Defendant stated that he had been on vacation in Florida since the previous Thursday and he asked Kolman what this was all about. Kolman again explained that the officers were conducting a narcotics investigation and she asked defendant and Borner whether they had illegal narcotics in their possession. Both defendant and Borner answered in the negative. Kolman then told them in a conversational tone that they were not under arrest and that they were free to leave at any time. She asked them whether they would consent to a search of their bags and she told them that they had a right to refuse. Borner stated, \u201cYes, go ahead,\u201d but defendant did not answer and began to tremble. Kolman noticed that defendant was trembling and that he was very nervous and asked again whether he would consent to a search of his bags.</p> <p id=\"b442-5\" pgmap=\"442\">At this point, defendant declined to consent to a search. Kolman stated again that they were free to leave and that they were not under arrest. She explained further that she was going to detain defendant\u2019s bag temporarily in order to subject it to a canine sniff test. Defendant then stated, \u201cYou can search my bag, I\u2019ve got narcotics in it but I\u2019m carrying it for somebody else.\u201d The officers were neither touching, grabbing, threatening nor blocking defendant, nor had they drawn their weapons. Defendant did not express any desire to terminate the conversation or to leave the area. Kolman proceeded to search defendant\u2019s bag, found the contraband inside, and placed defendant under arrest. She did not arrest Borner because no contraband was found in his bags. It is undisputed that the officers had no warrant for the search or the arrest.</p> <p id=\"b442-6\" pgmap=\"442\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court noted that the initial encounter was consensual, that the officers had a right to detain defendant\u2019s bag, and that the officers had probable cause for the search and the arrest following defendant\u2019s statement that there were narcotics in the bag.</p> <p id=\"b442-7\" pgmap=\"442\"> A trial court\u2019s finding on a motion to suppress evidence will not be disturbed unless it is manifestly erroneous. (People v. Long (1983), 99 Ill. 2d 219; People v. Reynolds (1983), 94 Ill. 2d 160.) However, under the statute, the burden is upon defendant to prove his allegations at a suppression hearing:</p> <blockquote id=\"b442-8\" pgmap=\"442\">\u201cThe motion shall be in writing and state facts showing wherein the search and seizure were unlawful. The judge shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to determine the motion and the burden of proving that the search and seizure were unlawful shall be on the defendant.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 114-12(b).)</blockquote> <p id=\"b442-9\" pgmap=\"442\">In our view, defendant failed to meet his statutory burden of proof.</p> <p id=\"b442-10\" pgmap=\"442(59) 443(283)\"> The fourth amendment provides that the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d (U.S. Const., amend. IV.) In Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, the Supreme Court authorized a limited, investigative detention short of a full arrest and short of probable cause. However, not all encounters between citizens and law enforcement officers implicate the fourth amendment. (Florida v. Royer (1983), 460 U.S. 491, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229, 103 S. Ct. 1319; People v. Long, 99 Ill. 2d at 229.) A seizure occurs only when a law officer restrains a citizen\u2019s liberty by physical force or show of authority. (People v. Long, 99 Ill. 2d at 229.) Consensual questioning does not implicate the fourth amendment. (See Royer, 460 U.S. at 497-98, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 236, 103 S. Ct. at 1324; Florida v. Rodriguez (1984), 469 U.S. 1, 83 L. Ed. 2d 164, 105 S. Ct. 308.) According to four members of the United States Supreme Court, the fourth amendment is not violated when a law officer merely approaches a person in a public place, asks him whether he is willing to answer some questions, asks him questions if the person is willing to listen, or offers in evidence the voluntary answers to the questions. (Royer, 460 U.S. at 497, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 236, 103 S. Ct. at 1324 (opinion of White, J., joined by Marshall, Powell and Stevens, JJ.); also see People v. Long, 99 Ill. 2d 219; People v. Alcantara (1989), 179 Ill. App. 3d 105.) The mere fact that the officer identifies himself as an officer, without more, does not convert the encounter into a seizure requiring some level of objective justification. (United States v. Mendenhall (1980), 446 U.S. 544, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497, 100 S. Ct. 1870.) Therefore, the threshold question in a case of this type is whether a seizure has occurred.</p> <p id=\"b443-5\" pgmap=\"443(229) 444(16)\"> In Illinois, the test for determining whether a seizure has occurred is an objective one, namely, whether a reasonable person would have believed that he was free to leave under the circumstances. (See People v. Miller (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 620; People v. Brett (1984), 122 Ill. App. 3d 191.) This comports with the test set forth in United States v. Mendenhall (1980), 446 U.S. 544, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497, 100 S. Ct. 1870. There, Justice Stewart, in a portion of the opinion joined by Justice Rehnquist, stated that a seizure has occurred implicating the fourth amendment when, \u201cin view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d (Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 509, 100 S. Ct. at 1877; see also Michigan v. Chesternut (1988), 486 U.S. 567, 100 L. Ed. 2d 565, 108 S. Ct. 1975.) The Mendenhall Court noted the following examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure, even where there was no attempt to leave: (1) the \u201cthreatening presence of several officers\u201d; (2) the \u201cdisplay of a weapon by an officer\u201d; (3) \u201csome physical touching of the person or the citizen\u201d; or (4) the \u201cuse of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 509, 100 S. Ct. at 1877.</p> <p id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444\"> By the same token, the test for determining whether an encounter is consensual also involves an analysis of the totality of the circumstances and is a matter which the prosecution has the burden of proving. (Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 557, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 511, 100 S. Ct. at 1879.) However, the prosecution need not prove that defendant knew he could withhold his consent. Florida v. Rodriguez (1984), 469 U.S. 1, 83 L. Ed. 2d 165,105 S. Ct. 308.</p> <p id=\"b444-6\" pgmap=\"444\"> If a seizure rather than a consensual encounter has occurred, only then should attention be focused on whether the seizure was a full arrest requiring probable cause, or instead a limited investigative stop, commonly called a Terry-type stop. (See Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868.) Although a Terry-type stop does not require probable cause, it does require some adequate objective justification for the intrusion short of probable cause. (Reid v. Georgia (1980), 448 U.S. 438, 65 L. Ed. 2d 890, 100 S. Ct. 2752.) A hunch does not qualify as justification for a Terry-type stop. (Terry, 392 U.S. at 22, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 906, 88 S. Ct. at 1880; see also People v. Long, 99 Ill. 2d at 228.) Instead, justification for a Terry-type stop consists of \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d (Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 906, 88 S. Ct. at 1880.) Another way of stating the rule is that a Terry-type stop \u201cmust be supported at least by a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person seized is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d (Reid, 438 U.S. at 440, 65 L. Ed. 2d at 894, 100 S. Ct. at 2754.) The facts or suspicion must be tested at the moment of the seizure or the search. (Terry, 396 U.S. at 21-22, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 906, 88 S. Ct. at 1880.) In evaluating the validity of a stop, the court should consider the totality of the circumstances. (United States v. Sokolow (1989), 490 U.S. 1, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 109 S. Ct. 1581.) In Illinois, the Terry rules have been codified in sections 107 \u2014 14 and 108 \u2014 1.01 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, pars. 107-14, 108-1.01). Section 107 \u2014 14 provides, in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b444-7\" pgmap=\"444\">\u201cA peace officer, after having identified himself as a peace officer, may stop any person in a public place for a reasonable period of time when the officer reasonably infers from the circumstances that the person is committing, is about to commit or has committed an offense ***.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 107 \u2014 14.</blockquote> <p id=\"b444-8\" pgmap=\"444(21) 445(291)\">According to the above principles, the threshold issue in the instant case is whether the officers\u2019 initial encounter with defendant constituted a seizure. If it was not a seizure, then it is unnecessary to determine whether it was justified by sufficient, articulable facts or by a reasonable suspicion. In our view, the circumstances of defendant\u2019s initial encounter with the officers indicate that the encounter was consensual. He agreed to speak to the officers. They neither cornered him nor otherwise prevented his departure through physical contact, language, or tone of voice, nor did they threaten him physically or verbally or display any weapons. They did not block his way and he could have exited the train station through the doors directly in front of him. They did not retain his driver\u2019s license or his travel itinerary. To the contrary, Kolman immediately returned defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and travel itinerary. If the retention of his driver\u2019s license would have tended to negate his freedom to leave (see Royer, 460 U.S. at 501, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 239, 103 S. Ct. at 1326; People v. Hardy (1986), 142 Ill. App. 3d 108), then immediate return of the driver\u2019s license to defendant should have had the opposite effect \u2014 it should have communicated to defendant that the officers were satisfied with his identification (People v. Brett (1984), 122 Ill. App. 3d 191), and that defendant was free to leave if he chose to do so. (See People v. Claver (1987), 162 Ill. App. 3d 62.) Indeed, Kolman specifically informed defendant that he was free to leave at any time. Furthermore, she specifically informed him that he did not have to consent to a search. This statement is also consistent with the conclusion that defendant was free to leave. People v. Miller (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 620.</p> <p id=\"b445-5\" pgmap=\"445\"> We believe that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have considered that he was free to leave. If defendant believed that he was not free to leave, then his belief was unreasonable. (People v. Brett, 122 Ill. App. 3d at 196.) In our opinion, the State met its burden under United States v. Mendenhall of proving that defendant\u2019s consent was freely and voluntarily given. Although the State did not have to show that defendant subjectively knew he could refuse to consent (Florida v. Rodriguez (1984), 469 U.S. 1, 83 L. Ed. 2d 165, 105 S. Ct. 308), the record discloses that defendant was specifically advised that he was free to leave and that he could refuse to consent. It was only after defendant started to tremble and did not respond to Kolman\u2019s statement that defendant was told his bag would be detained. We conclude that defendant failed to meet his statutory burden of proving the allegations in his motion to suppress and that he was not seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 114 \u2014 12(b).</p> <p id=\"b445-6\" pgmap=\"445(9) 446(67)\"> To summarize, the manifest weight of the evidence discloses that the encounter between defendant and the narcotics agents was consensual rather than a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and the encounter did not taint the search of defendant\u2019s shoulder bag and did not warrant suppression of the cocaine found therein or of defendant\u2019s statement.</p> <p id=\"b446-5\" pgmap=\"446\"> Furthermore, the search of defendant\u2019s shoulder bag did not violate his protected fourth amendment interest in retaining possession of his personal effects and property. United States v. Place (1983), 462 U.S. 696, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637, allows this interest to be overcome and authorizes a limited intrusion if the law officers have reason to suspect that the luggage contains narcotics. Under United States v. Place, probable cause is not a prerequisite for the seizure of luggage; instead, luggage can be seized based upon a reasonable suspicion that it contains narcotics. (462 U.S. at 702, 77 L. Ed. 2d at 117, 103 S. Ct. at 2642.) In the instant case, the manifest weight of the evidence indicates that Kolman reasonably suspected that defendant\u2019s shoulder bag contained narcotics. Moreover, Kolman had probable cause to search the bag and to arrest defendant when defendant volunteered that the bag contained narcotics. We hold that the search of the shoulder bag was neither tainted by the preceding events nor independently amounted to a separate violation of the fourth amendment.</p> <p id=\"b446-6\" pgmap=\"446\">Our conclusions are consistent with the following cases cited in defendant\u2019s brief. For example, we recently noted that People v. DeLisle (1982), 104 Ill. App. 3d 297, follows an outdated analysis and essentially has been overruled. (See People v. Forrest (1988), 172 Ill. App. 3d 385.) In People v. Kiser (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 501, the agents physically blocked defendant\u2019s exit onto an escalator. Considering the reasonable and articulable factor used by the Court in Reid v. Georgia (1980), 448 U.S. 438, 65 L. Ed. 2d 890, 100 S. Ct. 2752, to determine whether an investigatory stop is justified, we must conclude that the encounter in the instant case was consensual, and not an investigatory stop.</p> <p id=\"b446-7\" pgmap=\"446\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b446-8\" pgmap=\"446\">COCCIA, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b446-9\" pgmap=\"446\">JUSTICE PINCHAM,</author> <p id=\"Adk\" pgmap=\"446\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b446-10\" pgmap=\"446(13) 447(35)\">I dissent. The police tactics in the case at bar and their approval by the trial court and this court promote and advance the despicable oppressions known to exist in totalitarian police states in which cherished civil liberties are enjoyed by only the privileged and powerful few.</p> <p id=\"b447-5\" pgmap=\"447\">I</p> <p id=\"b447-6\" pgmap=\"447\">\u201cCAN IT HAPPEN HERE?\u201d</p> <p id=\"b447-7\" pgmap=\"447\">On Thursday, June 29, 1989, at page A4 the following (excerpted) article appeared in the New York Times:</p> <blockquote id=\"b447-8\" pgmap=\"447\">\u201cIN NIGERIA, TO ROT IN JAIL IS A HAZARD OF THE INNOCENT:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-9\" pgmap=\"447\">LAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 a 26-year-old man with no criminal record is picked up by the police while driving near his home. He is not allowed to contact anyone, even his wife, whom he married the day before. He spends the next 8 years in jail, without trial.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-10\" pgmap=\"447\">That was the experience of Joseph Odogu, who was accused of armed robbery in the summer of 1980. Inexplicably, month after month, his trial date was postponed. And because he was arrested under a special decree enacted by Nigeria\u2019s military Government, he could not be free on bail.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-11\" pgmap=\"447\">Tt was a horrid, horrendous, dehumanizing situation,\u2019 said Olisa Agbakoba, Mr. Odogu\u2019s lawyer and chairman of the Lagos-based Civil Liberties Organization. \u2018And while he wasted in jail, his car was stolen, his shop ransacked, his landlord chucked him out, his mother died and his wife deserted him.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-12\" pgmap=\"447\">What Mr. Agbakoba soon discovered after taking on Mr. Odogu\u2019s case last year was that his client had fallen through the cracks of Nigeria\u2019s often harsh and byzantine legal system. Prosecutors, in fact, decided within months of Mr. Odogu\u2019s arrest that he was the wrong man. But no one bothered to tell him, his jailers or the courts.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-13\" pgmap=\"447\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-14\" pgmap=\"447\">Mr. Odogu\u2019s case may seem especially cruel, but Mr. Agbakoba says it is only one of hundreds of such accounts of desperation in various police cells and detention centers across Nigeria.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b447-15\" pgmap=\"447\">Since it was formed two years ago, the Civil Liberties Organization has documented a continuous stream of cases illustrating shortcomings in Nigeria\u2019s judicial and law enforcement systems.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Ah6\" pgmap=\"448\">Sometimes, as in Mr. Odogu\u2019s case, the problems are caused by sloppy police work, albeit on a grand scale.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b448-5\" pgmap=\"448\">Increasingly, however, the group has uncovered alarming evidence of widespread human rights violations.

Times, June 29, 1989, at A4.</blockquote> <p id=\"b448-7\" pgmap=\"448\">No rational person is so bold as to suggest that even remotely similar situations presently occur in our State or in our nation. But is any rational person so bold as to suggest that \u201cIt can\u2019t happen here\u201d? History is replete with fallen democracies and free societies which believed and smugly preached, \u201cIt can\u2019t happen here.\u201d To paraphrase George Santayana, if we fail to remember our mistakes we are condemned to repeat them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b448-8\" pgmap=\"448\">History teaches, if only we will learn it, that no free society was ever totalitarianized from within, suddenly, and without warning. The true danger to constitutional freedom is the gradual, but unrelenting erosion of constitutional guarantees, perpetuated in the name of self-serving euphemistic phrases such as \u201cLAW AND ORDER.\u201d History also fervently teaches that the danger of an encroaching police state is most perilous when the citizens are most complacent. I wholeheartedly agree with that great patriot and libertarian, Benjamin Franklin, who eloquently prophesied that those who would willingly forfeit a little of their freedom for a little more security will end up with neither.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b448-9\" pgmap=\"448(79) 449(7)\">I also endorse Adlai Stevenson\u2019s sage advice: \u201cCarelessness about our security is dangerous; carelessness about our freedom is also dangerous.\u201d The plain and simple truth is we have become and are becoming increasingly careless about our precious freedoms, and the majority opinion is but another example of it. Boyd v. United States (1886), 116 U.S. 616, 29 L. Ed. 746, 6 S. Ct. 524, is now older than a full century. But its teachings are, if anything, more vibrantly relevant today than when they were written:</p> <blockquote id=\"b449-5\" pgmap=\"449\">\u201c[Ijllegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely: by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance.

Ct. at 535.</blockquote> <p id=\"b449-6\" pgmap=\"449\">All this comes down to a simple question, but one well worth contemplating: If the courts refuse to and will not protect and enforce the constitutional guarantees of our citizens, then who will? If on one day a court permits the search of a passenger because he is first off a plane, bus or train, or is \u201cnervous,\u201d is it not \u201clogical\u201d or \u201cconsistent,\u201d or, indeed \u201cstare decisis\u201d for a court on the next day to sanction the search of a passenger because he disembarked last or \u201ccalmly\u201d? This is not at all farfetched, as Justice Marshall observed in his dissent in United States v. Sokolow (1989), 490 U.S. 1, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 109 S. Ct. 1581. There, Justice Marshall made note of the so-called DEA \u201cprofile\u201d and its multiple, \u201cchameleon-like way of adapting to any particular set of circumstances.\u201d He then listed the following authorities as illustrative of those judicially approved flexible adjustments:</p> <blockquote id=\"b449-7\" pgmap=\"449(149) 450(19)\">\u201cCompare, e.g., United States v.

If the Constitution permits indiscriminate searches of persons traveling on interstate planes and trains why not buses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and autos, motorcycles and even bicycles or roller skates? Why, logically, limit such searches to interstate travelers? Surely if the State and Federal constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure permit seizures of interstate travelers and their \u201ceffects\u201d on such flimsy and perhaps fabricated grounds as \u201ceye contact,\u201d or the lack of it, or \u201cthe order of disembarkation,\u201d or the degree of \u201cnervousness\u201d or \u201ccalmness,\u201d or the amount of luggage or type of it or lack of it, they then also permit identical searches and seizures of intracity travelers on buses, subways, taxis and even in private conveyances. Inevitably Americans will become completely insecure on their public streets from police state tactics and they will be secure from the police only while in their own homes, and then (?)...Surely, this is to burn down the house to roast the pig.</p> <p id=\"b450-5\" pgmap=\"450\">Even so, we might debate whether sacred constitutional guarantees should or must yield in order to stamp out what is unquestionably one of the worst man-made plagues ever \u25a0 inflicted upon any people, that of nefarious narcotic usage and trafficking. I say we might debate this matter if history, or even some unreliable statistics, demonstrated that as the rights of personal security and privacy have lessened, the problems of illegal drugs have also somewhat lessened in any related, or even unrelated, proportion. Unfortunately, the proportion simply has been inverse.

And despite all this and much much more,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the law enforcement community and their judicial and other apologists and advocates often wonder or pretend to wonder aloud why it is that ever enlarging segments of society have declining respect for the police. Justice Jackson, a former Attorney General of the United States, gave us the answer many years ago when he wrote:</p> <blockquote id=\"b453-5\" pgmap=\"453\">\u201cUncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government. And one need only briefly to have dwelt and worked among a people possessed of many admirable qualities but deprived of these rights to know that the human personality deteriorates and dignity and self-reliance disappear where homes, persons and possessions are subject at any hour to unheralded search and seizure by the police.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b453-6\" pgmap=\"453\">But the right to be secure against searches and seizures is one of the most difficult to protect. Since the officers are themselves the chief invaders, there is no enforcement outside of court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Brinegar v. United States (1949), 338 U.S. 160, 180-81, 93 L.

And I think it is not serendipitous; not only predictable but inevitable that as the constitutional guarantees of the American people have been diminished, the crime problem has expanded and accelerated. After all, at bottom, crime and particularly drug trafficking evince a disrespect for the law and the worth of the individual. There is no gainsaying that many people simply will not comply with a law unless they respect those who enforce it. Sagacious Justice Brand\u00e9is in Olmstead v. United States (1928), 277 U.S. 438, 72 L. Ed. 2d 944, 48 S. Ct. 564, where, speaking of wiretapping, wisely said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b453-8\" pgmap=\"453(19) 454(84)\">\u201cWill this Court by sustaining the judgment below sanction such conduct on the part of the Executive? The governing principle has long been settled. It is that a court will not redress a wrong when he who invokes its aid has unclean hands. The maxim of unclean hands comes from courts of equity. But the principle prevails also in courts of law. Its common application is in civil actions between private parties. Where the Government is the actor, the reasons for applying it are even more persuasive. Where the remedies invoked are those of the criminal law, the reasons are compelling.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b454-5\" pgmap=\"454\">The door of a court is not barred because the plaintiff has committed a crime. The confirmed criminal is as much entitled to redress as his most virtuous fellow citizen; no record of crime, however long, makes one an outlaw. The court\u2019s aid is denied only when he who seeks it has violated the law in connection with the very transaction to which he seeks legal redress. Then aid is denied despite the defendant\u2019s wrong. It is denied in order to maintain respect for law; in order to promote confidence in the administration of justice; in order to preserve the judicial process from contamination. The rule is one, not of action, but of inaction. It is sometimes spoken of as a rule of substantive law. But it extends to matters of procedure as well. A defense may be waived. It is waived when not pleaded. But the objection that the plaintiff comes with unclean hands will be taken by the court itself. It will be taken despite the wish to the contrary of all the parties to the litigation. The court protects itself.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b454-6\" pgmap=\"454\">Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a law-breaker, it breeds contempt for laws; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means \u2014 to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal \u2014 would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 277 U.S. at 483-85, 72 L. Ed. 2d at 959-60, 48 S. Ct. at 574-75 (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting).</blockquote> <p id=\"b454-7\" pgmap=\"454(11) 455(178)\">One need not be astutely perceptive to recognize that every time a person is unjustifiably harassed and ill-treated by a policeman, that person becomes to a like degree, and at the very least sub silentio, an implacable foe of law enforcement and thereby also a foe of organized society. The principle that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction applies not alone to the physics lab. We must always recall, as Justice Jackson aptly pointed out in Brinegar, the courts only hear about the travelers who had illegal drugs; the instances in which the search was fruitful; the wiretapped conversations that revealed criminality. How many travelers are searched, how many invasions of privacy occur in which no arrests are made, no contraband discovered, and about which the courts never hear? Yet the invasions of privacy of these law-abiding citizens are at least as acute and their degree of disgruntlement undoubtedly more intense than in those incidences where contraband is discovered. Judge John Grady of the United States District Court in Chicago and a former assistant United States Attorney put it this way:</p> <blockquote id=\"b455-5\" pgmap=\"455\">\u201cThe cases which come to court are the ones in which the police-citizen encounter has yielded incriminating evidence. We hear nothing of any encounters where the police are wrong in their suspicions. We hear nothing about instances where the dogs sniffed luggage and did not \u2018alert positively\u2019 for the presence of drugs. The cases in which the police play a mere hunch, which is essentially what they claimed to have done here, and find nothing as a result of the encounter or the search are cases we never see and whose number would be mere speculation. That they exist, however, seems certain, unless one were to indulge the presumption that the police are infallible in their suspicions.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b455-6\" pgmap=\"455(150) 456(69)\">When the police are told that there is a whole area known as \u2018the non-coercive police-citizen encounter\u2019 in which they are free to operate, the possibility of abuse is apparent. Because the question of abuse will arise only in cases where a prosecution ensues, or in the rare case where an aggrieved person might file a civil suit for false arrest, the legal environment experienced by police officers is not one that compels or even necessarily encourages circumspection in their contacts with citizens. One danger is that the police will conduct Terry-type stops where the facts did not justify it, realizing that they will rarely be called into account in situations where \u2018no harm is done.\u2019 If such an attitude exists, it is a short step from there to rationalization of the unjustified stops which pay off in the recovery of contraband. *** For instance, looking at the matter in retrospect, wasn\u2019t the suspect really looking around quite cautiously as he entered the concourse? Didn\u2019t he look back over his shoulder a few times? In the alternative, it would not be too difficult to overlook any threatening aspect of the encounter, so as to justify the argument that the interview was entirely consensual.\u201d (Emphasis added.) United States v. Freymuller (N.D. Ill. 1983), 571 F. Supp. 61, 67.</blockquote> <p id=\"b456-5\" pgmap=\"456\">As Judge Grady pointed out, it is not unknown for the policemen to misrepresent the facts or \u201ccolor\u201d their testimony. For example, in one of the cases relied upon by the majority herein, People v. Forrest (1988), 172 Ill. App. 3d 385, 526 N.E.2d 616, the officer involved, Chicago police officer Boyle, was the same Officer Boyle who testified in Freymuller, and whose testimony Judge Grady specifically and unequivocally disbelieved. Beyond that, Officer Boyle and his partner, Officer Richard Crowley, are the same police officers who recently testified that they observed a defendant deplane at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport carrying luggage when, in fact, the undisputable airline personnel testimony and computer printouts, as well as the defendant\u2019s own testimony, indisputably showed that he was not even on the plane at all, resulting in United States District Judge James Moran sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in United States v.

Yet this invariably occurs when police are permitted to indiscriminately inspect and sift through the luggage of innocent travelers until they find contraband, or audio-video record, who knows how many conversations of restaurant dining guests until the police may hear and record something incriminating from someone. Are the American people really willing to have their homes surveilled by helicopter, their luggage examined by police or sniffed by pointing police dogs, their private and personal conversations, while breaking bread, repasting and imbibing with friends, recorded by government? I think not!

Over 200 years ago the Founding Fathers of this great nation made some monumental decisions and \u201cbalanced\u201d some momentous conflicting rights, principles, guarantees and obligations. Among those rights which the Fathers intended to protect was the right of an American citizen to be secure in his person and in his house, and in his effects against unreasonable search and seizure. The fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, fully binding upon the States by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment (Mapp v. Ohio (1961), 367 U.S. 643, 646 n.4, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 1085 n.4, 81 S. Ct. 684, 1689 n.4) provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b459-5\" pgmap=\"459\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const., amend. IV.</blockquote> <p id=\"b459-6\" pgmap=\"459\">Article I, section 6, of the Constitution of the State of Illinois similarly provides.</p> <p id=\"b459-7\" pgmap=\"459\">To insure that this and every other right and guarantee in the Constitution not be abridged, whittled away, watered down or nullified, the Founding Fathers required that every judge, from the most exalted to the petty, State as well as Federal, take an oath to support the Constitution. When the people of Cook County elected me to fill my present office I took that very oath prescribed by the Founding Fathers in article VI, clause 3, of the Constitution. I regard that oath as profound and sacred as anything I have ever done. That oath demands that I adamantly defend, protect, support, uphold and enforce, not dilute and convolute constitutional privileges and guarantees. I will not violate that solemn oath because of any perceived convenient \u201cswings\u201d in judicial philosophy<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> or because this is a \u201cnarcotic case,\u201d or for the dubious distinction of being a foot soldier in the President\u2019s \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d to be compatible or popular or for any other temporal and transitory reason. To paraphrase the playwrite Lillian Heilman, I will not cut the Constitution or my conscience to fit this year\u2019s fashions. With all due respect for many of my brethren on this court, as well as on many other courts in this State and nation, we are reaching the point where it can be (and already is being) said with more than a modicum of truth that even more deleteriously and adversely affected by drugs than the addict are the judicial decisions stretching and perverting fundamental constitutional freedoms and principles in order to obtain and sustain criminal drug convictions.</p> <p id=\"b459-8\" pgmap=\"459\">Like Clarence Darrow, I fervently believe it is essential that strong men and women be ever vigilant in the never-ending pursuit of freedom. Defending one of his most famous cases, Darrow once said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b460-4\" pgmap=\"460\">\u201cI know that the nation that is not watchful of its liberty will lose it. I know that the individual that will not stand for his rights will have no rights, and I believe the first duty of every American citizen is to protect himself and his country in all the liberties we have and all that we can get.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b460-5\" pgmap=\"460\">You can only protect your liberties in this world by protecting the other man\u2019s freedom. You can only be free if I am free.

Stone, Clarence Darrow for the Defense (1941).</blockquote> <p id=\"b460-6\" pgmap=\"460\">I also applaud Chief Judge Wald\u2019s opening lines in his dissenting opinion in United States v.

A country where a citizen cannot travel without being accosted by petty officers seeking to seize and search?

Prior to trial the defendant made a motion to quash arrest and to suppress evidence. Only one witness, Christine Kolman, called by the defendant, testified on the evidentiary hearing of the motion and her complete testimony is as follows.</p> <p id=\"b462-5\" pgmap=\"462\">Direct Examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b462-6\" pgmap=\"462\">\u201cMy star number is 17864 and I am assigned to the Chicago Police Department Narcotics Section. I was so assigned on March 30, 1987. On that date I was assigned to a special detail in the narcotics section. I was assigned to the Airport Squad which deals with drug interdiction at the airports and train stations.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b462-7\" pgmap=\"462\">On March 31, 1987, I saw Bruce Jones at the Union Station in Chicago, Illinois. I first saw him at approximately 9:10 to 9:20 A.M. as he was leaving a train or getting off a train that had just arrived in the station. I was located in the waiting room area which is just inside from where the trains pull in.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b462-8\" pgmap=\"462\">The first agent that approached Mr. Jones was Captain Farry the Amtrak police. He first approached Mr. Jones at the top of an escalator at the mezzanine area which exits out to the other areas of the station. I observed Mr. Jones as he entered into the station and up until the time that he was approached by the Amtrak officer and this was after he had gone up the escalator to the mezzanine level.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b462-9\" pgmap=\"462\">I then approached him and identified myself to Mr. Jones. I told him I was a Chicago police officer and I showed him my identification from the Chicago Police Department. I was in plain clothes as was Captain Farry. As I was approaching I heard Captain Farry say that he was from the Amtrak police. After I identified myself I questioned Mr. Jones and during the questioning at one point I asked him if I could search his bag. He said he did not wish to give consent. I did not then immediately go into the bag.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b462-10\" pgmap=\"462\">Later I did search the bag which was a carry-on bag that he was carrying. I did not have a search warrant nor did any other officer, nor did we have an arrest warrant. I took statements from defendant after his arrest which was after he was first approached by the Amtrak investigator.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b462-11\" pgmap=\"462\">When I saw him in the Union Station I did not observe him to violate any local ordinance or state statute. Nor was I in any fear of my life or any type of harm from the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b462-12\" pgmap=\"462\">Cross-examination by the assistant state\u2019s attorney:</p> <blockquote id=\"b462-13\" pgmap=\"462(12) 463(64)\">\u201cI have been a police officer 13 years and doing narcotics investigation work for about one year. During those 12 years I was assigned to Youth Special Investigations which was narcotic investigations involving juveniles. Then I was assigned to the narcotics section of the Chicago Police Department, the Conspiracy Task Force, in cooperation with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration and also this Task Force working on drug interdiction at the airport and train stations.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b463-5\" pgmap=\"463\">On this date, I was awaiting the arrival of the train at the Union Station with Officer Glynn and Sergeant Powers of the Chicago Police Department, Captain Farry and Detective Dennis Kroll from the Amtrak Police Force, along with Special Agent Mel Scabilion of the Drug Enforcement Administration. We were awaiting the arrival of Amtrak Train No. 29. We had information from Detective Kroll of Amtrak Police that there was a party travelling from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to Chicago via Washington, D.G. on a one-way ticket from Ft. Lauderdale, and also that this party had made several other trips of this sort before. This particular passenger was Bruce Jones.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b463-6\" pgmap=\"463\">At approximately 9:20 a.m. I saw Bruce Jones de-board that particular train. He was with another male. As Mr. Jones walked through the Union Station he walked without any hesitation through the waiting area through the rest of the station up to the stairwell. But as he was walking through he kept turning around looking behind him and he made eye contact with me several times and the other officers as we were surveiling him through the station. There were possible [sic] hundreds of people in the station at this time. The defendant made eye contact with me several times and I observed him ride up the escalator to the mezzanine level and as he was riding up the escalator he made eye contact with me one or two times.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b463-7\" pgmap=\"463\">When he exited the escalator on the mezzanine level it was at that point when Captain Farry approached him. I joined Captain Farry shortly thereafter. The area where the escalator ended was the mezzanine area and there were exit doors onto other areas onto the street and below to the bank. It\u2019s well lit, well trafficked. There were other passengers going up and down the other escalator and stairs and many people going pass [sic] us. It was very, very crowded at that time.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b463-8\" pgmap=\"463(18) 464(90)\">Upon approaching the defendant I identified myself as a Chicago police officer and I showed him my identification which is my badge. I was standing alongside the defendant but I was not touching him in any way, nor grabbing his arm. No one was standing in front of the defendant and the defendant was not pinned up against the wall or the counter. In front of the defendant as I identified myself were the exit doors. Besides Captain Farry, Agent Mel Scabilion was with me. Neither was Officer Kolman, Agent Scabilion or Captain Farry at any time touching the defendant. I did not display my weapon.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b464-5\" pgmap=\"464\">I asked both gentlemen if they would agree to speak with us and they said yes and agreed to speak with us. At that time I asked both of them for a copy of their train ticket and some identification or driver\u2019s license, and I received an Illinois Driver\u2019s license from both gentlemen and a copy of the travel itinerary, the tickets from Mr. Jones for travel on March 26th via airplane to Ft. Lauderdale and return via train on March 29th. After reading the license I learned that the other man was Edward Borner. I read the documents and returned them to Mr. Jones and Mr. Borner.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b464-6\" pgmap=\"464\">At that time I explained that we were conducting a narcotics investigation and I had asked both of them how long they had been in Florida and if they were there on business or pleasure. Mr. Jones stated that he had been there since the previous Thursday and was there on vacation. March 31, 1987 was a Tuesday. Mr. Jones at that point asked me what is this all about and I again explained that we were conducting a narcotic investigation and I had asked Edward Borner and Bruce Jones if they had any illegal narcotics on their person or in their baggage. Both of them replied no. At that time I told them they were not under arrest, they were free to leave at any time.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b464-7\" pgmap=\"464\">During this conversation my voice was not raised above a conversational tone at any time. At that point I asked Mr. Borner and Mr. Jones if they would give us consent to search their bags. I told them that they had a right to refuse such consent also. At that time, Mr. Borner said, yes, go ahead and search his bag. I then looked toward Mr. Jones and he did not respond to my question but appeared very nervous and he was physically shaking, trembling. Prior to that he had not been shaking or trembling.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b464-8\" pgmap=\"464(38) 465(27)\">Since Mr. Jones did not respond I again asked him if he would give a consent to search his bags and at that time he said he did not wish to give consent. I again told him that they were free to leave and they were not under arrest. And then I further explained that I was going to temporarily detain Mr. Jones\u2019 bag.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">The purpose was to subject it to an inspection by a narcotics detector dog, and if the dog did alert to the bag I would get a search warrant. The dog that would sniff the bag is trained for narcotics detection and this is their means to detect. Mr. Jones then said that I could search his bag, that he had narcotics in it, but was carrying it for someone else. He just blurted this out. No one was touching him or grabbing him at that point. My weapon was not drawn nor did anyone else have their weapons drawn. No one was threatening the defendant in any way. His movement or progress was not blocked in any way at that point. He did not express a desire to leave the area or cease the conversation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465\">I then searched the bag and recovered a clear plastic bag containing white powder. I believed it to be cocaine. I then placed the defendant under arrest. I did not place Mr. Borner under arrest because his bags were searched and there was nothing found in his bags.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b465-7\" pgmap=\"465\">Redirect examination by the defendant\u2019s attorney:</p> <blockquote id=\"b465-8\" pgmap=\"465\">\u201cThe day before this incident I had received information that Mr. Jones was going to be on this particular train. I believed the ticket was purchased through a travel agency but I don\u2019t recall if it was by check or credit card. I do not believe that I was aware on March 30th that Captain Farry of Amtrak had received information that the defendant had purchased a ticket for this trip through an American Express credit card. I know that he had purchased the ticket through a travel agency and there\u2019s nothing wrong with purchasing a ticket through a travel agency. I have no idea how many persons on the train that day had purchased tickets through travel agencies. On March 30th I was given the name of Bruce Jones but was not given any photograph as to what Mr. Jones looked like. When Mr. Jones got off the train he looked at me a number of times, several times.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b465-9\" pgmap=\"465(67) 466(90)\">As Mr. Jones went up the escalator he did not appear nervous but turned around several more times and looked at the surveillance officers, not just me. As far as I know he was looking behind at us which would have been myself and Agent Scabilion. When he got up to the end of the escalator he started walking toward the exit and Captain Farry approached him. There were other people behind Mr. Jones getting off the escalator. Captain Farry and Bruce Jones continued to stand five feet from the escalator and that\u2019s where they stood as I got off. Officer KroII from Amtrak was about 10 or 15 feet away from me and Officer Glynn was a good distance away. I don\u2019t recall him being any where in the near proximity of me and Agent Scabilion. Sergeant Powers was out of my view, I don\u2019t know where he was. Sergeant Powers did not come over.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b466-5\" pgmap=\"466\">I don\u2019t recall whether I received the information that the defendant was travelling from Ft. Lauderdale through Washington to Chicago on the 30th or the 31st. As soon as I identified myself and Agent Scabilion identified himself, Captain Farry walked away from us but stayed within 50 feet. There was nothing unusual about Mr. Jones\u2019 answer that he had been in Florida on vacation since Thursday.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b466-6\" pgmap=\"466\">The first time I asked him whether I could search his bag he didn\u2019t respond. I asked him again and if he would give a consent to search his bag and he stated he did not wish to give his consent. At that time the other officers were still standing there talking to him in the area. Based upon my experience where there are other officers present it is unusual for a person to be nervous in talking to the officers. I opened up the bag and found an item wrapped in plastic. That plastic bag was wrapped in a newspaper and I opened up the newspaper.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b466-7\" pgmap=\"466\">Besides the fact that the defendant appeared nervous, as I have described, glanced over his shoulder a couple of times at me and the other agents, I also considered it unusual that I had previous knowledge that he was travelling on a one-way train ticket, and I observed that he also went down there on a one-way plane ticket, and that he had made several previous trips down to Florida. I considered that unusual on March 31st. The information that I had received came from the Amtrak Police personnel on March 30th and March 31st. I knew that we were investigating somebody named Bruce Jones and I received that information the first time, as I recall on March 30th.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b466-8\" pgmap=\"466\">There was no other testimony or evidence admitted during the motion to suppress evidentiary hearing.</p> <p id=\"b466-9\" pgmap=\"466(29) 467(12)\">Officer Kolman\u2019s foregoing testimony demonstrates a compelling reason why Judge Grady\u2019s admonition in Freymuller should not go unheeded in the instant case, or in the other two practically identical cases by these same officers, hereinafter discussed. Judge Grady warned in Freymuller:</p> <blockquote id=\"b467-3\" pgmap=\"467\">\u201cIt may not be too difficult to recall, after the fact, that the person stopped without an articulable basis for suspicion actually was behaving quite suspiciously before the stop. *** The pressure on a police officer to make an indictable case when he has recovered contraband must be considerable. The temptation to color the facts to support a prosecution of an individual who, after all, has just been found to be violating the law is obvious.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Freymuller, 571 F. Supp. at 67.</blockquote> <p id=\"b467-4\" pgmap=\"467\">It appears from Officer Kolman\u2019s testimony that the officers learned for the first time the identity of Bruce Jones when they stopped and questioned him, and perhaps likewise learned, also for the first time, from him, his traveling itinerary. Significantly, unlike in Draper v. United States (1959), 358 U.S. 307, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327, 79 S. Ct. 329, and the Draper progenies, Officer Kolman did not testify that she, or any other officer was given, or had any race, physical, wearing apparel or any other description of Bruce Jones, from any source. Indeed, no such information could likely have been forthcoming to Officer Kolman via Jones\u2019 ticket purchase, as stated by Officer Kolman. How these officers were able to identify Bruce Jones from among the many passengers who were in the terminal is not revealed in the record before us, except, perhaps, as Judge Grady cautioned in Freymuller, all the information about Jones was first acquired by the officers only after they stopped and questioned him.</p> <p id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">It is also significant that Officer Kolman did not at any time testify that she, or any other officer, had been informed by anyone or had any knowledge whatsoever that defendant Bruce Jones, or his traveling companion, Edward Borner, was in any way or to any degree involved in any narcotics. Yet both these American citizens, alighting from a public conveyance, in a public place, were stopped, interrogated and required to produce and present to law enforcement officers their identification and explain their itineraries to them.</p> <p id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467(84) 468(98)\">These police state tactics and inquisitions, of stopping and grilling two American citizens, and requiring them to justify their travels to the officer, reek of the police state tactics known to exist in Hitler\u2019s Germany, Communist China and the Soviet Union, and totalitarian South Africa, where citizens are prohibited from traveling except by police permission in the form of police-issued traveling passes. I distressfully note that uniformed armed guards, regularly stationed at the entrances to this public building in downtown Chicago, the Daley Center, in which this court and the judges\u2019 chambers of this court are located, prohibit citizens, including the judges, access to the building above the first floor except upon the citizen (judges included) presenting an admission pass issued by the sheriff, or upon the citizen being searched. With equal grief, I also note that identical prohibitions, restrictions and conditions are imposed on American citizens at the downtown, public Everett M. Dirksen Federal Court Building. Americans and other freedom-loving people have freely given their very lives against such police tactics and governmental regimes.</p> <p id=\"b468-5\" pgmap=\"468\">Clearly, the officers had no probable cause to stop Bruce Jones or Edward Borner. The trial court obviously recognized this drastic constitutional deficiency and therefore predicated the validity of this regiment of six armed officers surrounding, stopping, interrogating, demanding identification, threatening to seize and searching Jones\u2019 luggage on the dubious and fallacious ground of consent. I will not express my concerns or speculate on the possible volatile consequences had either Jones or Borner further verbally, or Heaven forbid, physically resisted.</p> <p id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468\">After hearing this testimony, and argument of counsel, the trial court stated and ruled:</p> <blockquote id=\"b468-7\" pgmap=\"468(254) 469(139)\">\u201cWell, I think we really have two issues here; first of all is the issue, which is the simplist as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the issue the right to search the bag the right to touch the bag. There is no question about it. Once they said they were going to hold the bag, relying upon United States v. Blake, they had a right to detain it for a short period of time. They have the dogs sniff it and thereafter obtain the search warrant if the dogs basically came up with anything positive. When the defendant knew this and said \u2018you can search the bag, I\u2019ve got narcotics in it but it doesn\u2019t belong to me, it belongs to somebody else,\u2019 [they] had probable cause for the arrest, and they also had probable cause for the search as well as the consensual search at that time when the defendant was basically \u2014 the narcotics he says it doesn\u2019t belong to him, it belonged to somebody else. The second issue, the main issue, is the initial stop and the cases break down into two key words and is it a seizure or is it what they call in these cases a consensual encounter. We talk about seizures basically which you rely upon is basically one written by Justice McGloon and that basically is People v. DeLise. And that basically says that any stop at all is a freedom of restraint and is a seizure. However, if you look at all the cases which follow thereafter, People v. Myler and also People v. Britt which you cited in your motion, basically nobody follows that case. That case was the initial case. There was one written thereafter by Justice Wilson who attempts to distinguish it but it was all changed by law when the United States Supreme Court came down with Florida v. Rudegast [sic] as well as I believe the Royer case, Florida v. Royer. So based upon the law which I have here I disagree. He was stopped in an area here where it was easily accessible. It was nothing more as the Courts referred to as a consensual encounter as opposed to a seizure. Therefore, based upon the law as I see it at the present time the Motion has to be denied.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b469-5\" pgmap=\"469\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b469-6\" pgmap=\"469\">It is patently clear from Officer Kolman\u2019s testimony that there was no voluntary consent in this case and that the seizure and search of Jones\u2019 luggage was premised on police coercion and duress, expressed and implied.</p> <p id=\"b469-7\" pgmap=\"469\">Presumably, we agree that in order for a custodial arrest and search of the defendant to have occurred, probable cause to arrest him must have existed. However, we need not reach this question, because a divided Supreme Court has held that police officers have a right to approach a complete stranger in an airport, in a bus depot, a train station, on the street, or in any other public place and request permission to speak and/or question the stranger, so long as it is at all times clear to the person so approached that he or she maintains the right at all times to refuse to answer any questions and to walk away. This is exactly what Florida v. Royer held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b469-8\" pgmap=\"469(134) 470(38)\">\u201c[L]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen, or by offering in evidence in a criminal prosecution his voluntary answers to such questions. [Citations.] Nor would the fact that the officer identifies himself as a police officer, without more, convert the encounter into a seizure requiring some level of objective justification. [Citation.] The person approached, however, need not answer any questions put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way. [Citations.] He may not be detained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for doing so; and his refusal to listen or answer does not, without more, furnish those grounds.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. at 497-98, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 236, 103 S. Ct. at 1324.</blockquote> <p id=\"b470-5\" pgmap=\"470\">So I agree that when Officer Kolman approached Bruce Jones and his companion at about 9:10 a.m. on March 31, 1987, at the Union Station in Chicago and identified herself as a police officer and requested permission to speak to them, Officer Kolman was on the fair and legal side of the foul line. Likewise, where the record clearly shows that no force or physical restraint was employed upon the defendant or his companion, and the defendant agreed to answer Officer Kolman\u2019s questions about his vacation, his travel itinerary, etc., Officer Kolman was still within the proper scope of her authority. Officer Kolman next asked the defendant for permission to search his luggage. Again, this was proper on the state of this record, and had the defendant then said at that point, \u201cYou can search my bag, I\u2019ve got narcotics in it but I am carrying it for someone else,\u201d probable cause surely would have immediately existed for the search of the bag, the seizure of the contraband, and the arrest of the defendant. Had that occurred the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress would (and should) have been properly overruled, the defendant properly convicted, and I would not be writing this dissent. But that is not what the record reveals was the sequence of events, though one would believe so from reading the majority opinion.</p> <p id=\"b470-6\" pgmap=\"470\">What occurred is that when Officer Kolman asked the defendant for permission to search his bag, the defendant immediately refused to give his consent. This is made abundantly clear by Officer Kolman\u2019s testimony. After stopping the defendant and questioning the defendant about his whereabouts, the purpose of his trip, etc., Officer Kolman testified as follows, in response to questions put to her by the assistant State\u2019s Attorney:</p> <blockquote id=\"b470-7\" pgmap=\"470\">\u201cQ. Now, at that point did Mr. Jones say anything to you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-8\" pgmap=\"470\">A. Yes, then he asked me what is this all about.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-9\" pgmap=\"470\">Q. What did you say?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-10\" pgmap=\"470\">A. I again explained that we were conducting a narcotic investigation and I had asked Edward Borner and Bruce Jones if they had any illegal narcotics on their person or in their baggage.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-11\" pgmap=\"470\">Q. What was the response to that question?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-12\" pgmap=\"470\">A. Both of them replied no.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-13\" pgmap=\"470\">Q. What, if anything, did you say next?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b470-14\" pgmap=\"470(12) 471(8)\">A. At that time I told them they were not under arrest, they were free to leave at any time.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471\">Q. Now during this conversation, Officer Kolman, was your voice raised above conversation tone at any time?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-6\" pgmap=\"471\">A. No, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-7\" pgmap=\"471\">Q. What, if anything, did you say at that point?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-8\" pgmap=\"471\">A. At that point I asked both Mr. Borner and Mr. Jones if they would give us consent to search their bags.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-9\" pgmap=\"471\">Q. Did you tell them about any rights they would have regarding that consent?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-10\" pgmap=\"471\">A. Yes, I did. I told them that they had a right to refuse such consent also.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-11\" pgmap=\"471\">Q. Okay. What, if anything, did Mr. Borner say at that time?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b471-12\" pgmap=\"471\">A.

That\u2019s correct.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b472-21\" pgmap=\"472(147) 473(74)\">Thus, the record is abundantly and unequivocally clear that the defendant refused to give his voluntary consent to Officer Kolman to search his bag and that he only relented after being told by Officer Kolman that the police would retain his bag. What should have been manifestly clear to Officer Kolman was that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccooperation\u201d with Officer Kolman had ceased and that, in the words of Florida v. Royer, the defendant should not have been further \u201cdetained even momentarily without reasonable objective grounds for doing so.\u201d (Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. at 498, 75 L. Ed. 2d at 236, 103 S. Ct. at 1324.) Officer Kolman should have and must have realized her constitutional obligations and duties at that point \u2014 after all, she was a policewoman with 13 years of considerable and wide-ranging experience, especially in the enforcement of the controlled substances statutes. What Officer Kolman did, however, was immediately inform the defendant upon learning of his refusal to voluntarily consent to the search of his bag that she and the other officers were going to seize the bag forthwith and submit it to a dog-sniff test by a narcotics unit canine. And it was these statements by Officer Kolman which coerced and induced the defendant to involuntarily submit to the search of his luggage.</p> <p id=\"b473-5\" pgmap=\"473\">The proper questions to be resolved, therefore, are whether Officer Kolman possessed the right to seize the bag and hold it and submit it to a dog-sniff test. If the answer to that question is \u201cyes,\u201d then the defendant\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d was irrelevant and his statements were properly obtained; if the answer is \u201cno,\u201d then both the \u201cconsent\u201d and the \u201cstatement\u201d are the product of Officer Kolman\u2019s illegality.</p> <p id=\"b473-6\" pgmap=\"473\">Unfortunately, the trial court did not focus at all on these questions and neither does the majority opinion. Both the trial court and the majority opinion erroneously assume that agents of the law have some inherent right to seize a passenger\u2019s luggage for any reason, or, indeed, for no reason at all, and to submit that luggage to some \u201ctreeing\u201d or \u201cpointing\u201d dog, against the will of the passenger so long as the passenger is himself or herself not seized. However, under either the latest authorities from the United States Supreme Court interpreting the fourth amendment, or under an independent evaluation of Illinois statutory and case law, officers of the law have no such right, as the following discussion clearly establishes.</p> <p id=\"b473-7\" pgmap=\"473\">IV</p> <p id=\"b473-8\" pgmap=\"473\">The seizure of a traveler\u2019s luggage is permitted under the fourth amendment only on facts and to the identical extent that the officer could seize the traveler himself. One might assume that the United States Supreme Court permits the seizure of luggage on some lesser standard than, say, \u201carticulable suspicion,\u201d which is the minimum standard permitted for the seizure of a person under Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, because one might further assume that the United States Supreme Court accords greater privacy rights to the \u201cperson\u201d than to the \u201ceffects\u201d protected by the express terms of the fourth amendment. But such an assumption would be erroneous because the United States Supreme Court specifically declared in United States v. Place (1983), 462 U.S. 696, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637, that no distinction between seizure of a person and the seizure of baggage can be made:</p> <blockquote id=\"b473-9\" pgmap=\"473(9) 474(283)\">\u201cAt the outset, we must reject the Government\u2019s suggestion that the point at which probable cause for seizure of luggage from the person\u2019s presence becomes necessary is more distant than in the case of a Terry stop of the person himself. The premise of the Government\u2019s argument is that seizures of property are generally less intrusive than seizures of the person. While true in some circumstances, that premise is faulty on the facts we address in this case. The precise type of detention we confront here is seizure of personal luggage from the immediate possession of the suspect for the purpose of arranging exposure to a narcotics detection dog. Particular in the case of detention of luggage within the traveler\u2019s immediate possession, the police conduct intrudes on both the suspect\u2019s possessory interest in his luggage as well as his liberty interest in proceeding with his itinerary. The person whose luggage is detained is technically still free to continue his travels or carry out other personal activity pending release of the luggage. Moreover, he is not subjected to the coercive atmosphere of a custodial confinement or to the public indignity of being personally detained. Nevertheless, such a seizure can effectively restrain the person since he is subjected to the possible disruption of his travel plans in order to remain with his luggage or to arrange for its return. Therefore, when the police seize luggage from the suspect\u2019s custody, we think the limitations applicable to investigative detentions of the person should define the permissible scope of an investigative detention of the person\u2019s luggage on less than probable cause.\u201d 462 U.S. at 708-09, 77 L. Ed. 2d at 121-22,103 S. Ct. at 2645.</blockquote> <p id=\"b474-5\" pgmap=\"474(185) 475(34)\">Thus, under the authority of United States v. Place, Officer Kolman\u2019s right to seize the defendant\u2019s luggage for inspection was exactly the same and identical to her right to seize the defendant\u2019s person for the same purpose. We all know that under such authorities as Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, United States v. Mendenhall (1980), 446 U.S. 544, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497, 100 S. Ct. 1870, Florida v. Royer (1983), 460 U.S. 491, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229, 103 S. Ct. 1319, and United States v. Sokolow (1989), 490 U.S. 1, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 109 S. Ct. 1581, the police may temporarily seize a person if they possess reasonable articulable suspicion that the seized person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime. We all also know that under United States v. Place, luggage may be constitutionally seized only if the police possess the same reasonable articulable suspicion that the baggage contains contraband. The proper test for seizure is the same as between a person vis-a-vis his luggage. Thus, the question remains, did Officer Kolman possess a reasonable articulable suspicion that Bruce Jones\u2019 luggage contained contraband at the moment she announced her intention to seize it?</p> <p id=\"b475-5\" pgmap=\"475\">The majority cites the following factors which it deems individually significant and collectively sufficient to justify the seizure of the defendant\u2019s luggage: (1) defendant repeatedly made \u201ceye contact\u201d with the officers in the train station; (2) the defendant\u2019s travel itinerary indicated he had flown to Ft. Lauderdale from Midway Airport in Chicago on March 26, and that he left Ft. Lauderdale on March 29 on a train to Chicago; and (3) the defendant appeared nervous when questioned. None of these \u201creasons\u201d could possibly justify the seizure of the defendant, or, under United States v. Place, supply the articulable suspicion necessary to conclude that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained contraband.</p> <p id=\"b475-6\" pgmap=\"475\">1. Eye contact. How, on this record, eye contact with Officer Kolman could be considered suspicious behavior defies imagination in light of the trial judge\u2019s explicit \u201cfinding\u201d that Officer Kolman is \u201ca nice looking lady.\u201d If it has become suspicious for a man to look at a \u201cnice looking lady\u201d (particularly where the lady is obviously looking back at him), then many judges may find themselves detained. At least one authority (United States v. Pulido-Santoyo (9th Cir. 1978), 580 F.2d 352, 354) has said that eye contact with the police is not suspicious but may well be \u201cquite natural\u201d under these circumstances. This \u201creason\u201d for suspicion is patently flawed.</p> <p id=\"b475-7\" pgmap=\"475(212) 476(10)\">2. Defendant\u2019s itinerary. The fact that the defendant traveled roundtrip between Ft. Lauderdale and Chicago in the space of a few days does not create an articulable suspicion sufficient to seize either the defendant or his luggage. According to Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 27, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 909, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1883, an articulable suspicion is something more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d In United States v. Sokolow (1989), 490 U.S. 1, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 109 S. Ct. 1581, the Court specifically held that a 48-hour trip between Miami and Honolulu during the month of July \u201cis not by itself proof of any illegal conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel.\u201d (490 U.S. at 9, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 11, 109 S. Ct. at 1586.) But if the additional combination of factors which the Court held justified the stop in Sokolow \u2014 paying cash for the tickets from a large roll of $20 bills, and traveling under a false name \u2014 certainly the opposite factors in the case at bar \u2014 Jones\u2019 use of a credit card and his correct name \u2014 create the opposite conclusion. Thus, there was nothing about this defendant\u2019s itinerary which created an articulable suspicion that the luggage contained contraband.</p> <p id=\"b476-3\" pgmap=\"476\">3. Nervousness. Officer Kolman testified that the defendant appeared nervous. The Illinois Supreme Court has specifically held that \u201cnervous\u201d behavior exhibited by one stopped by the police will not justify a subsequent police search. (People v. Reed (1967), 37 Ill. 2d 91, 227 N.E.2d 69.) Nothing in the record suggests that the officers believed the defendant to be armed or otherwise dangerous. See People v. Galvin (1989), 127 Ill. 2d 153, 535 N.E.2d 837; People v. Jones (1989), 181 Ill. App. 3d 576, 537 N.E.2d 395.</p> <p id=\"b476-4\" pgmap=\"476\">Thus, none of the factors relied upon by the majority, taken singularly or jointly, justified the seizure of the defendant or his luggage. It follows, therefore, that when Officer Kolman told the defendant that she was going to seize (and search) his luggage, thereby coercively inducing the defendant to yield, Officer Kolman was acting illegally. That is to say, the defendant\u2019s submission to search his bag was illegally procured and could not serve, within the Constitution, as a valid basis for Officer Kolman\u2019s search of the defendant\u2019s luggage.</p> <p id=\"b476-5\" pgmap=\"476\">When a search is conducted without a warrant, or probable cause, and the validity of the search turns upon the defendant\u2019s purported consent, as here, the State has the burden of proving that the necessary consent was freely and voluntarily given. (Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973), 412 U.S. 218, 233-34, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854, 866-67, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 2051.) The test to be employed in determining the voluntariness of the consent is the totality of the circumstances. Knowledge by the arrestee that he has a right to refuse consent to search is one factor in determining voluntariness, but is not, by itself, determinative. The burden of demonstrating consent based upon the totality of circumstances is on the State. (United States v. Mendenhall (1980), 446 U.S. 544, 557, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497, 511, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 1879.) Furthermore, it is well established that consent extracted in submission to an assertion of lawful authority is not free and voluntary, but rather is duressed and coerced. (Bumper v. North Carolina (1968), 391 U.S. 543, 20 L. Ed. 2d 797, 88 S. Ct. 1788.) And that, of course, is what we have here. It is beyond dispute that this defendant refused to yield to the search of his bag until after Officer Kolman informed him that his bag was going to be retained by them, whether or not he consented. That \u201cconsent,\u201d given then, and only then, was given in submission to Officer Kolman\u2019s demand to seize his bag, and, under Bumper, cannot be considered to be free and voluntary.</p> <p id=\"b477-4\" pgmap=\"477\">Moreover:</p> <blockquote id=\"b477-5\" pgmap=\"477\">\u201c[A] finding that the defendant\u2019s consent to search was voluntarily given is but one step in the determination of the propriety of the search, because even if the consent were voluntary it may still have been obtained by the exploitation of an illegal arrest. *** What is of concern is whether some inculpatory action by an arrestee, albeit voluntary, was obtained by the exploitation of an illegal arrest by a police officer, which as a consequence violates the constitutional safeguards of the fourth amendment so as to require application to the exclusionary rule. The inculpatory action on the part of the arrestee can take the form of a consent to search just as easily as it can a confession, and for purposes of the fourth amendment there is no substantive difference between the two.\u201d People v. Odom (1980), 83 Ill. App. 3d 1022, 1027-28, 404 N.E.2d 997, 1002.</blockquote> <p id=\"b477-6\" pgmap=\"477\">In Odom, the court held that the defendant had been illegally arrested and therefore his \u201cconsent\u201d to search his truck and his jacket which was in the truck was the product of the illegal arrest. (See also People v. Koniecki (1985), 135 Ill. App. 3d 394, 481 N.E.2d 973.) The holding in Odom is in accord with the general principle that the exclusionary rule \u201cextends as well to the indirect as the direct products\u201d of unconstitutional conduct. Segura v. United States (1984), 468 U.S. 796, 82 L. Ed. 2d 599, 104 S. Ct. 3380, quoting from Wong Sun v. United States (1963), 371 U.S. 471, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441, 83 S. Ct. 407; see also United States v. Miller (11th Cir. 1987), 821 F.2d 546, 549-50; United States v. Berryman (1st Cir. 1983), 717 F.2d 651, 656-57; United States v. Delgadillo-Velasquez (9th Cir. 1988), 856 F.2d 1292, 1299-1300.</p> <p id=\"b477-7\" pgmap=\"477\">The defendant\u2019s coerced submission \u201cconsent\u201d was proffered immediately after and only as a direct result of Officer Kolman\u2019s illegality, namely, her expressed threat and intent to seize the defendant\u2019s bag.</p> <p id=\"b477-8\" pgmap=\"477(95) 478(31)\">I conclude on this record that Officer Kolman had no evidentiary support or basis for any articulable suspicion that the defendant was committing, had committed or was about to commit a crime or that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained contraband when she threatened and expressed her intent to seize it; that the defendant\u2019s submission or purported \u201cconsent\u201d to search his luggage was involuntary and was given only in deference to a claim of lawful authority; that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d was the product, \u201cfruit\u201d and direct result of Officer Kolman\u2019s illegal and unconstitutional threat to seize the defendant\u2019s luggage, and therefore the trial judge\u2019s overruling and denying the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress evidence was manifestly erroneous. People v. Stout (1985), 106 Ill. 2d 77, 477 N.E.2d 498.</p> <p id=\"b478-5\" pgmap=\"478\">I am constrained to point out that just a few weeks ago in People v. Nelson (1989), 188 Ill. App. 3d 619, this very court affirmed the trial court\u2019s allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, which police seized from his luggage, on more distinct factors to establish a reasonable, articulable suspicion than the factors on which Chicago police officers Christine Kolman and Robert Glynn and Amtrak security officer Dennis Kroll relied in the case at .bar. Parenthetically, I also note that in Nelson, and in the case at bar, the officers, the train station, the train, the train\u2019s origin and the train\u2019s time of arrival are all the same, and too, the officers\u2019 \u201cboiler plate\u201d factors to establish their articulable suspicions in the two cases are likewise practically identical. The sage condemnation of Justice Walter A. Schaefer in People v. Mitchell (1970), 45 Ill. 2d 148, 158, on the wholesale use of \u201cboiler plate affidavits\u201d has gone unheeded by the learned trial judge and my distinguished brethern in the case at bar.</p> <p id=\"b478-6\" pgmap=\"478\">These officers\u2019 \u201c9:10 a.m. March 31, 1987,\u201d stop and interrogation at Union Station in Chicago of Bruce Jones, who had just arrived on a train from Washington, D.C., was only five weeks after these same officers\u2019 \u201c9:20 a.m. February 24, 1987,\u201d similar stop and interrogation at Union Station in Chicago of Michael Nelson, who also had just arrived on a train from Washington, D.C. I extensively quote Nelson; the Nelson factors are so closely analogous to the instant case they appear to be a script.</p> <blockquote id=\"b478-7\" pgmap=\"478(139) 479(14)\">\u201cThe defendant was traveling on Amtrak from Delray Beach, Florida, to Portland, Oregon. He was required to change trains in Washington, D.C., and again in Chicago. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the defendant presented the testimony of Chicago police officer Robert Glynn. Glynn stated that at 9:20 a.m. on February 24, 1987, he and his partner Christine Kolman observed the defendant exit an Amtrak train at Union Station. Glynn had been informed by Amtrak security that the defendant had paid cash for a one-way ticket from Delray Beach, Florida, that he had occupied a roomette on the train, and that he cancelled his reservations on \u2018a couple of occasions.\u2019 Glynn stated that the defendant was looking around as though \u2018scanning the crowd for surveillance\u2019 and appeared to be leaving the station without putting his bags in storage. He further testified that Florida is a \u2018source state\u2019 for drugs.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b479-5\" pgmap=\"479\">At that time, Glynn and Kolman approached the defendant, identified themselves and asked for identification and the defendant\u2019s train ticket. The defendant produced his Oregon driver\u2019s license and the train ticket which was purchased in his own name. Glynn informed the defendant that he was not under arrest and asked if he would answer some questions. The defendant indicated that he would. When asked where he boarded the train, the defendant answered Washington, D.C. Glynn then asked why the train ticket indicated that he had boarded the train in Delray Beach, Florida. The defendant became nervous, began stuttering and changed his weight from one foot to the other. In response to further questions, the defendant stated that he was once arrested for possession of marijuana and that he was not carrying illegal narcotics. He refused to give the officers permission to search his luggage, and Glynn decided to detain the bags for exposure to a narcotics detector dog. Glynn told the defendant that he was free to leave and gave him a receipt and a phone number he could call for the return of his luggage.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b479-6\" pgmap=\"479\">The defendant left and the bags were inspected by a narcotics detector dog immediately outside of Union Station. The dog indicated the presence of narcotics in one of the bags. A search warrant was prepared and the bag was found to contain two kilos of cocaine.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b479-7\" pgmap=\"479\">The State presented the testimony of Dennis Kroll, an Amtrak security officer who reviews passenger reservations by computer. Kroll stated that the defendant paid $585 in cash for a one-way ticket originating in Delray Beach, Florida. He ordered a sleeping compartment called a roomette, changed his reservation five or six times and did not leave a call-back number. Kroll relayed this information to an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Ava\" pgmap=\"479\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b479-10\" pgmap=\"479(68) 480(20)\">In the case at bar, the State contends that the following factors established a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained narcotics. The defendant purchased a one-way cash ticket from Florida, a \u2018source state\u2019; he occupied a roomette; he changed his reservations several times and did not leave a call-back number; he \u2018scanned\u2019 the area when he exited the train and appeared nervous when questioned by the police; and he was not truthful when he said that he boarded the train in Washington, D.C.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b480-5\" pgmap=\"480\">*** Although the ticket was purchased with cash, which presumably would be done to ensure anonymity, the defendant purchased the ticket in his own name. The officers were aware of this when the defendant produced an Oregon driver\u2019s license bearing his name and photograph. The trial court specifically found that the defendant answered truthfully when he said he boarded the train in Washington, D.C., based on the fact that he changed trains there. Given the fact that the defendant was not from Chicago and had to change trains in Union Station, no significance can be imparted to the fact that he \u2018looked around\u2019 after exiting the train. The witnesses did not explain the significance of the reservation changes or the fact that the defendant occupied a sleeping compartment during his journey from Florida to Oregon. In our view these factors, even when considered together, are insufficient to establish a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained narcotics.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b480-6\" pgmap=\"480\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nelson, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 619-22.</blockquote> <p id=\"b480-7\" pgmap=\"480\">Regarding the factors to establish the officer\u2019s reasonable articulable suspicion, the majority\u2019s holding in the case at bar cannot be reconciled with this court\u2019s opposite holding in Nelson. It is quite apparent that the meager factors in Nelson to establish a reasonable articulable suspicion are far more persuasive than the lesser, scanty factors relied on by Officer Kolman to seize and subject Jones\u2019 luggage to a dog detector test in the instant case.</p> <p id=\"b480-8\" pgmap=\"480(142) 481(69)\">The script continues. Again, on February 3, 1987, again at 9 a.m., again these same officers, Robert Glynn, Mel Scabilion, Dennis Kroll, again at the same Amtrak train station, again identically stopped and questioned defendant, John Sherman and his companion who had alighted from the same Washington, D.C., train, again en route from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Lapeer, Minnesota, and again this same court, on November 2, 1989, affirmed the trial court\u2019s order suppressing as evidence the drugs seized from the defendant\u2019s luggage, in People v. Sherman (1989), 190 Ill. App. 3d 814. In Sherman, this court rejected the State\u2019s contention that the following factors established a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained narcotics: the defendant and his companion occupied a roomette paid for in cash under the name Rosenstock; neither man was named Rosenstock and the call-back number they left was that of a hotel at which no one named Rosenstock was registered; they traveled from Fort Lauderdale, a \u201csource\u201d city for drugs, and walked separately through the Amtrak station. Likewise, in the case at bar, there were no factors which established a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant Jones\u2019 luggage contained narcotics, and Officer Kolman's threat to seize his luggage was clearly constitutionally invalid.</p> <p id=\"b481-5\" pgmap=\"481\">Again, we do not know how many innocent passengers these same and other officers have stopped and interrogated. However, Chicago police officer Richard Crowley recently related that during the past five years, he has been assigned to surveil and interview drug courier profile passengers at Chicago train stations, Midway and O\u2019Hare airports, that he watched \u201cprobably\u201d 20 flights and \u201cprobably talked to a dozen or fifteen people\u201d on a typical 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. day, about 60 people a week for a five-day week, and that \u201cwe don\u2019t come up with narcotics every day, maybe a couple times a week,\u201d and that \u201csome weeks [he was] wrong one hundred percent of the time.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b481-6\" pgmap=\"481\">Chicago police officer Richard Crowley, responding to the revealing examination of attorney Marc W. Martin, so testified on his deposition on October 19, 1989, in the cause United States v. $17,750, No. 87 \u2014 C\u20148706, a forfeiture proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Chicago, Illinois, the Honorable llana Rovner, trial judge. Crowley further disclosed the following on said deposition:</p> <blockquote id=\"b481-7\" pgmap=\"481\">\u201cQ. Now, is there something called a drug courier profile?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-8\" pgmap=\"481\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-9\" pgmap=\"481\">Q. What is that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-10\" pgmap=\"481\">A. It has to do with behavior.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-11\" pgmap=\"481\">Q. Can you be a little more specific?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-12\" pgmap=\"481\">A. Well, counter-surveillance would be a good word.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-13\" pgmap=\"481\">Q. What is a drug courier profile?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-14\" pgmap=\"481\">A. Well, it deals with couriers that are clandestinely carrying, trafficking drugs.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-15\" pgmap=\"481\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-16\" pgmap=\"481\">Q. Would you list those characteristics?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-17\" pgmap=\"481\">A. Well, a clear explanation would be someone pretending to make a phone call when in fact, they were just looking all around the area, with the phone receiver up to their head.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-19\" pgmap=\"481\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b481-20\" pgmap=\"481\">Q. What is counter-surveillance besides pretending to make a phone call?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-3\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Counter-surveillance is when a subject would look around to see if anyone was surveilling him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-5\" pgmap=\"482\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-6\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. What are other parts of it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-7\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Standing off in a corner and hiding in a corner, so to speak, and watching every one else in the area.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-9\" pgmap=\"482\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-10\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. A drug courier profile is a list of things you\u2019re supposed to look out for to see if this person fits the profile, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-11\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-12\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. What are the things you are to look out for?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-13\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Well, we look for couriers coming into Chicago from source cities of controlled substances, or going out of such cities.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-14\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. [What] characteristics do you look for?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-15\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Anything out of the ordinary: a nervous behavior, hiding in a washroom until a plane leaves, possibly.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-16\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. So you don\u2019t know any of the other items in this drug courier profile *** basically involves counter-surveillance, nervous behavior?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-17\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-18\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. How about dress. Does dress have anything to do with it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-19\" pgmap=\"482\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-20\" pgmap=\"482\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-21\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. Type of luggage that anyone is carrying?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-22\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Well, we look for carry-on bags, that lends them to this profile.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-24\" pgmap=\"482\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-25\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Well, a stereotype courier would be a person casually dressed, leaving the plane in a hurry, looking all about, with a small carry-on bag and negating baggage pickup and exiting the airport for a cab.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-26\" pgmap=\"482\">Q. Now, this example you just used, would that type of person fit the profile of a drug courier?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b482-27\" pgmap=\"482\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b482-28\" pgmap=\"482\">Parenthetically, I note that many, and indeed perhaps most, if not practically all current airline travelers fit this profile of a drug courier.</p> <p id=\"b482-29\" pgmap=\"482\">Officer Crowley additionally deposed:</p> <blockquote id=\"b482-30\" pgmap=\"482\">\u201cQ. So you are talking to 60 people a week, 50, 60 people?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-4\" pgmap=\"483\">That\u2019s a fair estimation?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-5\" pgmap=\"483\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-6\" pgmap=\"483\">Q. You say on some weeks you find no narcotics?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-7\" pgmap=\"483\">A. That true.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-8\" pgmap=\"483\">Q. And these 50, 60 people you stop, it\u2019s because they meet the profile?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-9\" pgmap=\"483\">A. The 50 or 60 people that we interview meet the profile somewhat.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-10\" pgmap=\"483\">Q. [Because] they meet the profile, in your estimation?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-11\" pgmap=\"483\">A. They would meet some criteria of the profile. Oftentimes, you will start to conduct an interview and not get very far with it, when we ascertain that they\u2019re not anyone we\u2019re interested in, we\u2019re not any longer interested in interviewing this person any further; like if their papers are in order.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b483-12\" pgmap=\"483\">I additionally parenthetically note that traveling citizens in totalitarian nations are likewise permitted to resume their travel when the Gestapo, Cheks, NKVD, MVD, OGPU and the KGB similarly determine that \u201ctheir papers are in order.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b483-13\" pgmap=\"483\">Officer Crowley further related on his deposition:</p> <blockquote id=\"b483-14\" pgmap=\"483\">\u201cQ. And when you stop these \u2014 or question as you use the word, these 50 or 60 people per week, it\u2019s because something about their behavior made you think they might be involved in narcotics, it that a fair statement, officer?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-15\" pgmap=\"483\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-16\" pgmap=\"483\">Q. And some weeks you\u2019re wrong one hundred percent of the time?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b483-17\" pgmap=\"483\">A. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b483-18\" pgmap=\"483\">This foregoing testimony of Officer Crowley, it has been argued, is a convincing revelation of the utter fallacy of the so-called drug courier profile. It also has been vigorously argued, and based upon Officer Crowley\u2019s foregoing testimony, with some degree of persuasion, that those passengers who agree to a search of their luggage are perceived by the officers as concealing nothing, and their interview is terminated, whereas passengers who object or refuse to agree to the officers\u2019 prying through their most private and personal belongings do so because they have something to hide, prompting the officers to seize and search their luggage. If nothing is found the passenger is permitted to proceed on his journey. Conversely, if drugs are discovered the passenger is arrested and charged.</p> <p id=\"b483-19\" pgmap=\"483(20) 484(20)\">It is noteworthy that the deposed Officer Crowley is the same Chicago police officer Crowley whose testimony United States District Court Judge James Moran rejected in United States v. Bonds and found the defendant not guilty, previously discussed herein.</p> <p id=\"b484-5\" pgmap=\"484\">In United States v. Moya (N.D. Ill. 1981), 561 F. Supp. 1, arising out of Agent Kenneth Labek and Chicago police officer Thomas Kinsella\u2019s drug courier profile interrogation and arrest of defendant Moya at the Chicago O\u2019Hare Airport on March 20, 1980, the court pointed out:</p> <blockquote id=\"b484-6\" pgmap=\"484\">\u201cIndeed, Labek himself testified that he routinely approaches two or three people a day on the basis of similar [drug courier profile] suspicions, but that these stops have led to only 70 or 80 arrests during his three years at O\u2019Hare. Thus, as defendant has pointed out, presuming a 5-day work week and a 50-week work year, stops based on the sort of evidence that led to Moya\u2019s questioning result in arrest only 3-5% of the time.\u201d (561 F. Supp. at 4.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b484-7\" pgmap=\"484\">However, when this same Chicago police officer Thomas Kinsella testified in United States v. Black (N.D. Ill. 1981), 510 F. Supp. 989, arising out of his drug courier profile interrogation and arrest of the defendant Black at the Chicago O\u2019Hare Airport on May 14, 1980, only seven weeks after the Labek-Kinsella arrest of Moya, Officer Kinsella\u2019s arrest success ratio suddenly and unexplainably drastically increased. Kinsella testified in Black:</p> <blockquote id=\"b484-8\" pgmap=\"484\">\u201cHe has been assigned on a full-time basis to O\u2019Hare for one year and prior to March, 1980 he had been assigned to O\u2019Hare on a part-time basis for two years, and he had participated in approximately fifty seizures of narcotics and seventy-five investigatory stops of suspected drug couriers at O\u2019Hare.\u201d (510 F. Supp. at 990.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b484-9\" pgmap=\"484\">In Chicago police officers Rosemary Burzinski and Kinsella\u2019s drug courier profile interrogation and arrest of Black on May 14, 1980, the court pointed out that \u201c[a]t the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest she [Officer Rosemary Burzinski] had been assigned to O\u2019Hare Airport for two months,\u201d and that \u201cOfficer Burzinski had participated in approximately ten seizures and fifty stops at O\u2019Hare prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b484-10\" pgmap=\"484\">Yet, arising out of the same Officer Rosemary Burzinski\u2019s (and Agent Robert Fulkerson\u2019s) drug courier profile interrogation and arrest of the defendant Jose Cantero on April 12, 1982, at O\u2019Hare airport, the court pointed out in United States v. Cantero (N.D. Ill. 1982), 551 F. Supp. 397:</p> <blockquote id=\"b484-11\" pgmap=\"484(20) 485(44)\">\u201cOfficer Burzinski has worked at O\u2019Hare for two and one-half years, has participated in about 200 encounters, and has been involved in about 50-75 seizures. *** In the last two and one-half years assigned to the airport, he [Agent Robert Fulkerson] has participated in four to five [drug courier profile] encounters per week, and in approximately 100 arrests.\u201d (551 F. Supp. at 398.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b485-5\" pgmap=\"485\">The instant and the foregoing cases reveal no explanation, justification or reason for the gross disparity in these officers\u2019 drug courier profile interrogation failures and successes. The explanation is left solely to imaginative speculation.</p> <p id=\"b485-6\" pgmap=\"485\">Justice Schaefer aptly pointed out in Mitchell:</p> <blockquote id=\"b485-7\" pgmap=\"485\">\u201cOne of the difficulties in dealing with this area of the law is that most of the cases with which the courts are concerned involve illegal possession of gambling equipment or narcotics, and the result of the search makes guilt unmistakable. The courts have no way of knowing how many unproductive searches are made upon the basis of false affidavits because those cases do not come before the courts. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b485-8\" pgmap=\"485\">In an atmosphere in which there is widespread concern about narcotics problems it is difficult for a court to enforce constitutional guarantees at the instance of one who is unquestionably guilty. But the constitutional provisions are directed at potential abuses by a tyrannical government and those provisions should not, in my opinion, be so diluted in order to secure convictions in narcotics and gambling cases that they can no longer afford protection against the operations of a Hitler type government. It may be that the constitutional protection is phrased in terms that are considered too sweeping to meet the needs of society today. If so, they should be amended. But it is the responsibility of a court to interpret and apply the constitutional provisions as they exist.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Mitchell, 45 Ill. 2d at 155-56.</blockquote> <p id=\"b485-9\" pgmap=\"485\">As I attempted to make clear in part I of this dissent, it is from small intrusions and slight deviations that the courts must be alert to offer protection. Recently, speaking of exactly these types of searches and seizures the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. $124,570 United States Currency (9th Cir. 1989), 873 F.2d 1240, 1246, cogently proclaimed:</p> <blockquote id=\"b485-10\" pgmap=\"485\">\u201cLiberty \u2014 the freedom from unwarranted intrusion by government \u2014 is as easily lost through insistent nibbles by government officials who seek to do their jobs too well as by those whose purpose it is to oppress; the piranha can be as deadly as the shark.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b486-4\" pgmap=\"486\">\u201cCAN IT HAPPEN HERE?\u201d</p> <p id=\"b486-5\" pgmap=\"486\">The foregoing cited cases, particularly the drug cases, from across the length and breadth of our nation suggest that IT IS HAPPENING HERE. The following \u201ccover story\u201d from the Wednesday, November 15, 1989, edition of the nation\u2019s newspaper USA TODAY, pages 1 and 2A, by Tony Mauro, emphatically buttresses that suggestion.</p> <blockquote id=\"b486-6\" pgmap=\"486\">\u201cTHE WAR ON DRUGS ARE OUR RIGHTS ON THE LINE?
