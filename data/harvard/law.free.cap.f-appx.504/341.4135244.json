California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Rodriguez has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. We further note that to the extent that counsel might argue for the first time on appeal that the district court departed from the recommendation in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) when it imposed a three-year term of supervised release, such argument would be foreclosed under this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329-30 (5th Cir.2012 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
