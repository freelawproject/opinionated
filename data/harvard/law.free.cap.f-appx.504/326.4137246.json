He appeals the denial of his motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines governing crack offenses. Battle disputes the district court\u2019s conclusions that the 90-month sentence was based on a plea agreement pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) and that the only Sentencing Guidelines on which his sentence could have been based were the career offender Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). A court abuses its discretion if it makes an error of law, and legal issues are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 399 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-25\">The record and the Statement of Reasons establish that the sentence was the result of a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. That alone does not preclude a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction because an agreed-upon sentence may still be \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2690-2700, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality and concurrence). Nonetheless, the record further establishes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the only Guidelines relevant to Battle\u2019s sentence are the career offender Guidelines. Even though the district court ultimately reduced Battle\u2019s criminal history category, the sentence remained based on Battle\u2019s career offender status. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 577-78 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that a sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a mandatory statutory minimum sentence, even though it was lowered under another statute); <em>see also United States v. Mitchell, </em>423 Fed.Appx. 365, 365-66 (5th Cir.2011) (holding that a reduced career offender sentence was nonetheless based on the career offender Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Battle has failed to show that he was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
