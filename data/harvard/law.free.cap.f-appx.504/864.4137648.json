Driessen claims that the School Board denied her an opportunity to participate in decisions regarding her handicapped daughter\u2019s education, in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). Driessen sued Ruvin pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that Driessen was deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest in a well-maintained state court docket because, she alleges, that the clerk failed to keep a docket of her dependency hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-21\">The district court granted motions that dismissed the claims on the following grounds: (1) as to Ruvin, Driessen\u2019s factual allegation was patently meritless in light of public records indicating that a docket was kept and, therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction or, alternatively, she failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6); and (2) as to the School Board, Driessen failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing in federal court or, alternatively, she lacked statutory standing as a \u201cparent\u201d under the IDEA as the state court awarded permanent guardianship of the children to the children\u2019s maternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-22\">On appeal, Driessen first argues that the district court erred in granting the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>tions to dismiss because the court failed to obtain and consider the complete record of the underlying state administrative proceedings, as required by the IDEA. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(i) (stating that when a civil action is brought in court to challenge a state administrative decision, the court \u201cshall receive the records of the administrative proceedings\u201d). However, Driessen failed to present this argument to the district court. Even assuming that Driessen did not waive this argument, the IDEA requires Driessen first to exhaust her administrative remedies prior even to bringing her claim against the School Board, which she failed to do. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regarding her claim against Ruvin, the completeness or incompleteness of the IDEA administrative record is irrelevant because Driessen\u2019s claim arose under \u00a7 1983, which does not speak to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Finally, Driessen argues that the court had no personal jurisdiction to grant the motions to dismiss because, she alleges, process was never served on either the School Board or Ruvin. First, the record establishes that the School Board and Ru-vin were properly served. But, even assuming that the School Board and Ruvin were not properly served, the court had personal jurisdiction over them because neither party contested personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. Driessen\u2019s May 5, 2011 complaint stated that her state administrative hearing was scheduled for June 14, 2011 \u2014 more than a month later.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
