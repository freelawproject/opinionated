First, Dovan makes several arguments related to the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>evidence. Second, Dovan argues that the district court abused its discretion in declining to adopt and submit to the jury several interrogatories. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On August 19, 2010, Kaczkowski filed suit in Mississippi state court against Do-van and Alatheia Prosthetic Rehabilitation, LLC, bringing state law claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion, tortious interference with business relations, and constructive trust arising out of Kaczkowski\u2019s association with Dovan in the Alatheia business venture. Kaczkowski alleged that in the late 1990s Dovan induced him to leave his former employment with a different pros-thetics firm and become a partner with Dovan in Alatheia. Kaczkowski further alleged, inter alia, that Dovan fraudulently misrepresented to Kaczkowski that Kacz-kowski was a partner in Alatheia, and that this fraud resulted in financial and other injury. On October 4, 2010, Dovan and Alatheia removed the suit to federal district court based on diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1382,1441.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The case was eventually tried to a jury in January 2012. Prior to submission of the case to the jury, Alatheia was dismissed as a party and all of Kaczkowski\u2019s claims save the fraud claim were dismissed. With respect to the fraud claim, Dovan twice moved the district court for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), first at the close of Kaczkowski\u2019s case in chief and again at the close of all the evidence. On January 17, 2012, the jury returned a verdict finding Dovan liable on the fraud claim and awarding Kaczkowski $168,000 in compensatory damages. The jury found Dovan not liable for additional punitive damages. Accordingly, on January 25, 2012, the district court entered a final judgment against Dovan for the amount of $168,000. Dovan did not renew his motions for judgment as a matter of law following the verdict. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">We first address Dovan\u2019s arguments implicating the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Kaczkowski\u2019s claim and the jury\u2019s verdict. First, Dovan contends that the district court erred in denying his two motions for judgment as a matter of law filed pursuant to Rule 50(a). He argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 50(a) motions because the evidence was insufficient to make out the elements of Kaczkowski\u2019s fraud claim and because the evidence established that the claim was barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further argues that the jury verdict and the final judgment entered on the basis of that verdict should be reversed as against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">However, as Kaczkowski correctly argues, Dovan forfeited his ability to appeal these challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence by failing to file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law post-verdict pursuant to Rule 50(b). See <em>Downey v. Strain, </em>510 F.3d 534, 542-43 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a defendant \u201cwaive[s] his right to appeal on the grounds of sufficiency of the evidence [when] he [fails to] file a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) for judgment as a matter of law after the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d (citing <em>Unitherm Food Sys., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 394, 400-01, 126 S.Ct. 980, 163 L.Ed.2d 974 (2006))). The <em>Downey </em>court explained the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Unitherm </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">In <em>Unitherm, </em>the Supreme Court held that when a party files a Rule 50(a) preverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law but files neither a Rule 50(b) postverdict motion nor a Rule 59 motion for a new trial, the party is precluded from seeking appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict. <em>[Unitherm, </em>546 U.S. at 400-01 [126 S.Ct. 980].] The Court held that the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 50(a) motion cannot form the basis of a party\u2019s appeal because such denial is \u201cmerely an exercise of the District Court\u2019s discretion, in accordance with the text of the Rule and the accepted practice of permitting the jury to make an initial judgment about the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406 [126 S.Ct. 980]; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) (\u201cthe court <em>may </em>determine\u201d that there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis and <em>\u201cmay </em>grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law\u201d) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANq\"><em>Downey, </em>510 F.3d at 543. Accordingly, Dovan\u2019s failure to renew his motions for judgment as a matter of law after the jury\u2019s verdict is fatal to his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We reject Dovan\u2019s contention that <em>Unit-herm </em>does not bar him from arguing on appeal that the district court erred in denying his Rule 50(a) motions with respect to his limitations defense. Dovan contends that his limitations argument presents a question of law, while <em>Unitherm </em>bars only fact-dependent sufficiency challenges. This argument fails to recognize that the district court necessarily and properly weighed the disputed evidence relevant to the limitations issue when deciding not to exercise its discretion to grant Dovan\u2019s Rule 50(a) motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">In ruling orally on Dovan\u2019s second Rule 50(a) motion, the district court noted that \u201c[Dovan] argue[d] strenuously that the statute of limitations has run on the fraud claim[],\u201d but concluded that it \u201cw[ould] allow that claim to go forward to the jury,\u201d after having properly viewed \u201call the evidence in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\u201cUnder Mississippi law, the plea of statute of limitations is an affirmative defense for which the party asserting it has the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Huss v. Gayden, </em>991 So.2d 162, 165 (Miss.2008). In responding to a question certified by this court, the Mississippi Supreme Court recently explained that with respect to the question of when a plaintiffs cause of action accrues for limitations purposes, \u201cMississippi substantive jurisprudence requires questions of disputed fact to be decided by juries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168; <em>see id. </em>at 165 (stating that \u201c[t]he success <em>vel non </em>of the disputed affirmative defense requires a jury determination\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Fulkerson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Odom, </em>53 So.3d 849, 852 (Miss.App.2011) (\u201cconsidering the evidence in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff]\u201d in \u201cfind[ing] [when] his claim accrued\u201d for \u201climitations purposes\u201d at summary judgment).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, as with his arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the elements of Kaczkowski\u2019s fraud claim itself, Dovan forfeited his argument regarding his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the limitations issue by failing to renew it post-verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Having thus determined that Dovan forfeited his evidentiary arguments, we turn briefly to his contention that the district court abused its discretion in declining to adopt special interrogatories proffered by Dovan that would have required the jury to specify which facts Dovan misrepresented and when each of those facts was misrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u201cThis court reviews jury instructions for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Garriott v. NCsoft Corp., </em>661 F.3d 243, 247 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cIf a party wishes to complain on appeal of the district court\u2019s refusal to give a proffered instruction, that party must show as a threshold matter that the proposed instruction correctly stated the law. If a party makes this threshold showing, he must then demonstrate that the actual charge as a whole creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations. But if the charge correctly states the substance of the law, we will not reverse.\u201d <em>Julian v. City of Houston, Tex., </em>314 F.3d 721, 727 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted). Here, we determine that the district court\u2019s instruction on Kaczkowski\u2019s fraud claim correctly stated the law and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The district court\u2019s charge to the jury regarding the fraud claim was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnU\">Plaintiff has asserted a claim for fraud in this case. In order to recover on his claim of fraud, plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence in this case that, one, Defendant Emil Dovan made a representation to plaintiff about a past or present fact; two, that the representation was false; three, that the representation was material; four, that Emil Dovan did know that the representation was false or was ignorant of its truth; five, that Emil Dovan did intend that the representation should be acted upon by Michael Kaczkowski; six, that Michael Kaczkowski did not know that the representation was false; seven, that Michael Kaczkowski did rely on the representation\u2019s truth; eight, that Michael Kaczkowski did have a right to rely on the representation, and; nine, that Michael Kaczkowski suffered damages as a result of his reliance on the representation, then your verdict shall be for the plaintiff. However, if you believe that the plaintiff has failed to show any one of the above elements by a clear and convincing evidence in this case, then your verdict shall be for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">As the district court explained to Dovan\u2019s counsel at the conference on jury instructions, this charge was drawn verbatim from the Mississippi Model Jury Instructions on the elements of a fraud claim, which in turn were based on recent Mississippi Supreme Court jurisprudence. The charge given to the jury mirrored the model instructions and correctly set forth the substantive Mississippi law. <em>See </em>Miss. Prac. Model Jury Instr. Civil \u00a7 21:5 (2d ed.) (citing <em>State v. Bayer Corp., </em>32 So.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>496, 501 (Miss.2010); <em>Bayer Corp., </em>32 So.3d at 501 (\u201c[T]he elements of fraud ... are: (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the speaker\u2019s intent that the representation should be acted upon by the hearer and in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer\u2019s reliance on the representation\u2019s truth; (8) the hearer\u2019s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury.\u201d (quoting <em>Allen v. Mac Tools, Inc., </em>671 So.2d 636, 642 (Miss. 1996)))).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Accordingly, \u201cthe charge correctly state[d] the substance of the law, [such that] we will not reverse.\u201d <em>See Garriott, </em>661 F.3d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-19\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">. \"In Mississippi, a claim of fraud has a three-year statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Sullivan v.
