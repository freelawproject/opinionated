On February 21, 2012, Val Saint, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The court denied his motion, and he appeals, arguing that, since Amendment 750 lowered the base level for his conspiracy offense, his continued incarceration is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or follow proper procedures in making its ruling. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010). A district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless the defendant was sentenced based on a <em>\u201csentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d </em>by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). A reduction, however, is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if it does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline sentence range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A proceeding under \u00a7\u00a7 3582(c)(2) and 1B1.10 does not constitute a full resentencing, in that the court must maintain all original sentencing determinations, with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The court must engage in a two-part analysis when considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 780. First, the court must recalculate the applicable guideline sentence range, using the amended guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>line provision. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Second, the court then must decide, in its discretion, whether to retain the existing sentence or to impose a reduced sentence, within the new sentence range, considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors as well as public safety considerations. <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">When Val Saint was sentenced in 1990 under the 1989 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 2D1.1 calculated either heroin or marijuana equivalencies in order to combine different drugs. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Drug Equivalency Table (1989). Val Saint\u2019s 50 kilograms of powder cocaine and 500 grams of crack cocaine (for which he was held accountable) were the equivalent of 20 kilograms of heroin, which set his base offense level at 36. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4), Drug Equivalency Table (1989). After adding the various enhancements to the base offense level, his total offense level came to 44, which combined with his category III criminal history yielded a sentence range of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4), Drug Equivalency Table (1989); Federal Sentencing Guidelines 1989, Sentencing Table. In 1991, the Sentencing Commission amended the drug equivalency tables to provide conversions only to marijuana, rather than marijuana and heroin. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 396, Reason for Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactive effective November 1, 2011 via Amendment 759, made permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. Following the enactment of Amendment 750, which changed the conversion calculations, the 50 kilograms of powder cocaine and 500 grams of crack cocaine for which Val Saint was held accountable were the equivalent of 11,875.5 kilograms of marijuana, which still fell within the level 36 base offense level category. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(2), Drug Equivalency Table (2011). After applying the applicable enhancements, Val Saint\u2019s total offense level in 2011 remained 44 and, with his criminal history category of III, generated a guideline sentence range of life imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (2011); Federal Sentencing Guidelines 2011, Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Val Saint\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although the court did not explicitly discuss the amended guideline calculations, it correctly concluded that Amendment 750 did not reduce Val Saint\u2019s guideline sentence range. Following the enactment of Amendment 750, Val Saint\u2019s base offense level and total offense level in 2011 remained unchanged, so his guideline sentence range was still life imprisonment, as it was in 1990. Therefore, he was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range; hence, the court was not required to determine whether a reduction was appropriate under the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and considerations of public safety. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The judgment of the District Court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
