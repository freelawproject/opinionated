He challenges on appeal his sentence of 36 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The district court applied United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.1 (Nov. 2011) to calculate Kocis\u2019 base offense level of 12. The court then applied a 2-level enhancement based on Kocis\u2019 role as \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in criminal activity, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), resulting in a total offense level of 14. Combined with a criminal history category of I, the applicable guidelines range was 15 to 21 months imprisonment. However, the fact that Kocis committed his offenses \u201cfor the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain\u201d triggered a 36-month mandatory minimum sentence, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii), which made his guidelines range 36 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The district court sentenced Kocis to the statutory minimum of 36 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">Kocis contends that the district court erred by imposing the statutory minimum sentence of 36 months because the verdict form did not specifically ask the jury to indicate whether it found that he committed the charged offenses \u201cfor the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain\u201d \u2014 the fact that triggered the 36-month mandatory minimum. According to Kocis, that is contrary to <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Because Kocis did not make that argument at sentencing, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. In <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the Court stated that \u201cjudge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maximum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based purely on the facts found by the jury.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2175. However, neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor <em>O\u2019Brien </em>requires a particular format for the verdict form. All that is required is that the jury, not the judge, makes the factual finding that is used to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Here, the district court instructed the jurors that to find Kocis guilty of counts two and three, they \u201cmust find that the Government has proved ... beyond a reasonable doubt ... that the defendant\u2019s motive was commercial advantage or private financial gain.\u201d After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both of those counts. We presume that the jurors followed the instructions the court gave them. <em>Evans v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>699 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2012). If the jury had not found that Kocis\u2019 motive was commercial advantage or private financial gain, it could not have returned a guilty verdict on counts 2 and 3. The fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict on those counts can mean only one thing \u2014 that it found that Kocis\u2019 motive was commercial advantage or private financial gain. Accordingly, the district court did not err\u2014 much less plainly err \u2014 by sentencing Kocis to 36 months imprisonment based on that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
