On appeal, Torres argues that his guilty pleas were not knowing and voluntary because (1) he was never specifically informed that an essential element of Count 1 was that his conduct affect \u201cinterstate\u201d commerce, (2) the indictment failed to provide sufficient specificity in alleging the robbery offense in Count 2, and (3) the indictment charged in Count 3 that Count 2 was the predicate offense while his plea agreement \u201ceffectively amended this charge\u201d by identifying both Counts 1 and 2 as predicate offenses. Torres also argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Counts 2 and 3 because the indictment, which did not allege interference with \u201cinterstate\u201d commerce, failed to charge a federal offense, a jurisdictional defect not waived by his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">We review for plain error constitutional objections not raised before the district court. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005). When a defendant fails to object to a Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>of Criminal Procedure Rule 11 violation, we also review for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 1019. To establish plain error, a defendant must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (8) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If all three conditions are met, we may recognize an error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In the context of a Rule 11 error, prejudice to the defendant means a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the defendant would not have entered the guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">A guilty plea pursuant to Rule 11(a)(1) is the waiver of a number of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and an admission of the elements of the formal criminal charge and must therefore be made knowingly and voluntarily to satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause. <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1171, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). A guilty plea cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts, and, to this end, the court must inquire into the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea, and satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the plea. <em>Id. </em>at 466-67, 89 S.Ct. at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In order to comply with Rule 11, a court accepting a guilty plea must \u201cspecifically address three \u2018core principles,\u2019 ensuring that a defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (8) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019 (citation omitted). We review whether the district court adequately ensured that the defendant understood the nature of the charge on a case-by-case basis. <em>United States v. James, </em>210 F.3d 1342, 1344 (11th Cir.2000). We have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">[f|or simple charges ... a reading of the indictment, followed by an opportunity given the defendant to ask questions about it, will usually suffice. Charges of a more complex nature, incorporating esoteric terms or concepts unfamiliar to the lay mind, may require more explication. In the cases of extreme complexity, an explanation of the elements of the offense like that given the jury in its instructions may be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1345 (citation omitted). In <em>James, </em>we held that the second core concern was not satisfied where, even though the defendant indicated that he understood the nature of the offense, neither the district court nor the written plea agreement specified the elements of a complex charge arising under the Travel Act. <em>Id. </em>at 1345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Section 1951 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code, known as the Hobbs Act, defines the offense of interference with commerce by threats or violence as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX8\">Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). We have held that \u201c[t]wo elements are essential for a Hobbs Act prosecution: robbery and an effect on commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir.2000). The Hobbs Act defines commerce as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALFg\">commerce within the District of Columbia, or any Territory or Possession of the United States; all commerce between any point in a State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>and any point outside thereof; all commerce between points within the same State through any place outside such State; and all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amk\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(3). \u201cThe government needs only to establish a minimal effect on interstate commerce to support a violation of the Hobbs Act.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Finally, \u201c[a]n amendment to an indictment occurs \u201cwhen the essential elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dennis, </em>287 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">There was no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Torres\u2019s guilty pleas because the record shows that he understood the nature of each of the charges against him and that his guilty pleas were fully informed and knowing and voluntary. Torres argues that it was plain error for the district court not to use the word \u201cinterstate\u201d when accepting his plea, but the necessary jurisdictional elements of \u00a7 1915(a) are \u201crobbery\u201d and \u201can effect on commerce.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d at 1244. The indictment, plea agreement, and change-of-plea hearing all correctly contained these elements of Counts 1 and 2. Additionally, before the magistrate judge, Torres stated that his counsel explained the required elements of the charged offenses and that he understood the charges and elements of these offenses. In reference to Count 1, the magistrate referenced the definition of commerce in \u00a7 1951; in reference to Count 2, the magistrate judge indicated that the government would have to show that Torres\u2019s actions \u201cobstructed, delayed, or affected interstate commerce.\u201d The record is clear that Torres was aware that the government would have to prove \u201can effect on commerce\u201d in order to convict him on Counts 1 and 2. In reference to Count 3, the essential elements of this Count were never altered to broaden the basis for the conviction; under the Notice of Facts, Penalty and Elements and the plea agreement, the government was required to prove both Counts 1 and 2 as predicate offenses for Count 3. These predicate offenses were proven by Torres\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Whether an indictment sufficiently alleges a statutorily proscribed offense is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Steele, </em>178 F.3d 1230, 1233 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cAn indictment is sufficient if it: (1) presents the essential elements of the charged offense, (2) notifies the accused of the charges to be defended against, and (3) enables the accused to rely upon a judgment under the indictment as a bar against double jeopardy for any subsequent prosecution for the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233-34 (quotations omitted). We have held that specific reference to the statute on which the charge was based adequately informs the defendant of the charge. <em>United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">A defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary, unconditional plea of guilty waives all non jurisdictional defects in the proceedings, but it does not waive jurisdictional defects. <em>United States v. Tomeny, </em>144 F.3d 749, 751 (11th Cir.1998). A claim is jurisdictional if it can be resolved by examining the face of the indictment or the record at the time of the plea without requiring further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We have held that an indictment\u2019s failure to charge an offense is a jurisdictional defect that is not waived by a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>Congress provided the district courts with jurisdiction, \u201cexclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>to the courts of the States,\u201d of \u201call offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">An effect on interstate commerce is required for Congress to have authority under the Commerce Clause to forbid certain conduct. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 562, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 1631, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (discussing the need for express jurisdictional elements in federal statutes). However, a failure of allegation or proof on an interstate-commerce element does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Ternus, </em>598 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2010). In <em>Ternus, </em>the appellant challenged his plea on the basis that the foreign-commerce element in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 was jurisdictional, and that the district court lacked jurisdiction over his case because there was insufficient evidence as to the foreign-commerce element. <em>Id. </em>We held that Ternus\u2019s argument was a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument, not a jurisdictional argument, and, thus, was waived with his guilty plea. <em>Id.; see also Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734-35 (11th Cir.2000) (holding, in the context of a <em>co-ram nobis </em>proceeding, that the district court had jurisdiction to enter a judgment upon the merits where an indictment alleged violations of the laws of the United States, even where the indictment failed to allege or prove an interstate-commerce element).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The district court had jurisdiction over the charges in Counts 2 and 3 because Count 2 clearly charged a federal offense, namely, a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2. As such, Torres\u2019s argument that Count 3 is fatally deficient for citing Count 2 as a predicate offense is without merit for the same reason. To the extent that Torres argues that insufficient evidence supports the interstate-commerce element of Count 2, that is non jurisdictional and waived by his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Although not raised by either party, we may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment and remand with instructions that the district court correct the errors. <em>See United States v. Campos-Diaz, </em>472 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.2006) (remanding with directions to the district court to correct the clerical error where the judgment stated an incorrect term of imprisonment). Remand for correction of the judgment is appropriate \u201conly if the erroneous entry of the judgment [is] considered a clerical error, and the correction of the judgment would not prejudice the defendant in any reversible way.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1252 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Count 1 of the indictment charged Torres with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and Torres pled guilty to that charge. However, the written judgment was recorded for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) <em>and 2. </em>There is a scrivener\u2019s error as to Count 1 because the indictment did not charge a violation of \u00a7 2 for this Count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">After review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm Torres\u2019s convictions and remand for the limited purpose of correcting a clerical error in the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">. The written judgment and the indictment are consistent as to Counts 2 and 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
