Now Alexander, through counsel, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a further reduction in sentence, one pursuant to Amendment 750 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. For background, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-23\">This appeal presents this decisive issue: Whether the district court abused its discretion by denying Alexander\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as unwarranted based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-29\">Any error in the district court\u2019s failure to recalculate Alexander\u2019s sentence under the amended guideline was harmless because that court found a reduction unwarranted after its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors: a determination that was no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See generally United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-30\">The district court here clearly stated that it would deny Alexander a reduction in sentence (regardless of his eligibility) due to the court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>court\u2019s decision to deny Alexander a reduction was reasonable. The court did not detail in its opinion on the instant motion how the court had weighed the various \u00a7 8553(a) factors in reaching its decision. But it was not obliged to do so. The record reveals that the court was aware of, and took proper account of, the pertinent factors, and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Alexander the requested sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
