The district court imposed a 60-month sentence for each of the six counts to be served concurrently. This sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>constituted an upward variance of 19 months from the upper end of the 38 to 41 month advisory range suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Mr. Gunter contests this sentence as both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Our reasonableness review of a sentence is a two-step process analyzed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The first step of this review requires an examination of the district court\u2019s sentencing decision for any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as ... failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When reviewing the consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we evaluate whether the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for imposing the sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We do not, however, expect the district court to articulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cRather, an acknowledgment by the district judge that he or she has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1281 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Mr. Gunter points to the district court\u2019s discussion of only two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors during his sentencing hearing as a failure to consider all the factors. Our precedent makes clear that although a court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to sentencing, \u201cit need not discuss each of them.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The district court acknowledged Mr. Gunter\u2019s comments and words of contrition before explaining its evaluation of the sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a). The district court was not required to address each of these factors, and its discussion of only a select few \u00a7 3553(a) factors particularly relevant to Mr. Gunter\u2019s case was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The second step of our reasonableness review focuses on whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it ... weighs those factors unreasonably, arriving at a sentence that does not achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>When reviewing a sentence outside the Guidelines, we consider the extent of the deviation and whether the district court had sufficiently compelling justification to support such a variance. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">The district court provided a sufficiently compelling justification for its upward variance. Considering the extent of the fraud committed and its impact on the personal and financial lives of the 18 victims (some of whom were elderly), the court permissibly determined that a sentence within the advisory guideline range would not adequately address the seriousness of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A). The district court also properly considered two significant facts concerning Mr. Gunter: (1) he had committed part of the fraud after he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>arrested in Illinois on unrelated charges, and (2) an armed robbery conviction was not counted towards his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In sum, the court considered and weighed all the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and arrived at a sufficient justification for its sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
