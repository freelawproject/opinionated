No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-21\">Plaintiffs were enrolled as students in MedVance Institute\u2019s Medical Billing and Coding Specialist program. To graduate, MedVance required all students to complete an externship after finishing their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>other course work. Kaplan, Bevacqua, and O\u2019Neill completed student externships, respectively, at Code Blue Billing &amp; Consulting, Inc. (\u201cCode Blue\u201d), Magnetic Medical Management, Inc. (\u201cMMM\u201d), and East Florida Eye Institute, P.A. (\u201cEFEI\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). Plaintiffs neither expected nor received payment for the work they performed during their extern-ships.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Sometime after completing their extern-ships, Plaintiffs each filed a complaint for minimum wage under the FLSA for work they performed during their externship. In essence, Plaintiffs argued that \u2014 given the lack of formal structure and the repetitive nature of the work they were assigned \u2014 they received very little educational benefit from their externships and, instead, they conferred economic benefit on Defendants. As a result, Plaintiffs contend that they qualify as \u201cemployees\u201d under the FLSA and are entitled to minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The district court concluded that neither Kaplan nor O\u2019Neill were \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA. And the court dismissed Bevacqua\u2019s suit as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo; </em>and we view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">First, we conclude that Bevacqua\u2019s suit was barred by the statute of limitations. An action for minimum wages under the FLSA must be brought within two years. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). But the statute of limitations extends to three years if the claim is one \u201carising out of a willful violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That Bevacqua filed his lawsuit more than two years \u2014 but less than three years \u2014 after his cause of action accrued is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Bevacqua argues that the three-year statute of limitations applies in his case because MMM violated willfully the FLSA when it assumed, without investigation, that externs did not need to be paid. To establish a willful violation of the FLSA for purposes of extending the limitations period, Bevacqua \u201cmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [MMM] either knew that its conduct was prohibited by the statute or showed reckless disregard about whether it was.\u201d <em>See Alvarez Perez v. Sanford-Orlando Kennel Club, Inc., </em>515 F.3d 1150, 1162-63 (11th Cir.2008). Where \u201can employer acts unreasonably but not recklessly in determining its legal obligation under the FLSA,\u201d we do not consider its acts willful. <em>Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Edna, </em>495 F.3d 1306, 1324 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Bevacqua failed to demonstrate that MMM\u2019s acts triggered the three-year statute of limitations. Bevacqua does not contend that MMM knowingly violated the FLSA. And \u2014 because MMM knew that Bevacqua would receive academic credit in exchange for his work and that completion of such an externship was required for graduation \u2014 we cannot say that MMM acted recklessly in assuming that Bevacqua could be unpaid. Thus, Bevacqua\u2019s complaint was subject to the two-year statute of limitations and was dismissed properly as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">On appeal, Kaplan and O\u2019Neill argue that the district court erred in concluding that they were not \u201cemployees\u201d under the FLSA. Whether a person is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>\u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a question of law that we review <em>de novo, Villarreal v. Woodham, </em>113 F.3d 202, 205 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists under the FLSA, we must consider the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d of the relationship, including whether a person\u2019s work confers an economic benefit on the entity for whom they are working. <em>See Donovan v. New Floridian Hotel, Inc., </em>676 F.2d 468, 470 (11th Cir.1982). But, when a person works for his own advantage or personal purpose\u2014 particularly when his work provides no \u201cimmediate advantage\u201d for his alleged \u201cemployer\u201d \u2014 he is not an \u201cemployee\u201d under the FLSA. <em>See Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., </em>330 U.S. 148, 67 S.Ct. 639, 641-42, 91 L.Ed. 809 (1947) (explaining that the FLSA\u2019s broad definition of \u201cemployee\u201d \u201ccannot be interpreted so as to make a person whose work serves only his own interest an employee of another person who gives him aid and instruction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Although Kaplan and O\u2019Neill argue that their externship experiences were of little educational benefit, they did in fact engage in hands-on work for their formal degree program. Kaplan and O\u2019Neill also received academic credit for their work and, by completing an externship, were eligible to earn their degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">Kaplan and O\u2019Neill argue that, because they were performing tasks for Defendants\u2019 businesses, Defendants benefitted economically from their work. The undisputed evidence, however, demonstrates that Defendants\u2019 staff spent time \u2014 time away from their own regular duties \u2014 training Plaintiffs and supervising and reviewing Plaintiffs\u2019 work. Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs caused Defendants\u2019 businesses to run less efficiently and caused at least some duplication of effort. Defendants received little if any economic benefit from Plaintiffs\u2019 work. Thus, under the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test, Plaintiffs were not \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA. <em>See New Floridian Hotel, Inc., </em>676 F.2d at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">This conclusion is also supported by guidance from the Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Administrator. The Administrator has identified six factors \u2014 derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Portland Terminal </em>\u2014 pertinent to determining whether a trainee qualifies as an employee under the FLSA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under [the FLSA], while not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>trolling upon courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d <em>Dade Cnty. v. Alvarez, </em>124 F.3d 1380, 1385 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The externship programs at Code Blue and EFEI satisfy all six of the Administrator\u2019s criteria. The training provided was similar to that which would be given in school and was related to Plaintiffs\u2019 course of study. The training benefitted Plaintiffs, who received academic credit for their work and who satisfied a precondition of graduation. Both Kaplan and O\u2019Neill were supervised closely and did not displace Defendants\u2019 regular employees. Defendants received no immediate advantage from Plaintiffs\u2019 work and, at times, were impeded by their efforts to help train and supervise Plaintiffs. And both Kaplan and O\u2019Neill admit that they were unenti-tled to a job after their externships and that they understood that the externship would be unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Because no genuine issue of material fact exists, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-6\">. The FLSA defines \"employee\u201d as \"any individual employed by an employer.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(e)(1). And the phrase \"to employ\u201d is defined as \"to suffer or permit to work.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">.
