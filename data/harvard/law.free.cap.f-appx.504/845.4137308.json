According to the complaint, Plaintiffs are minority shareholders of Apex Radiology Inc. (\u201cApex\u201d), a Florida corporation. Plaintiffs sued the law firm of Singerman, Mills, Desberg &amp; Kauntz Co., L.P.A. (\u201cSinger-man Mills\u201d) and eight individual shareholders of Singerman Mills (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d), alleging numerous claims arising out of Defendants\u2019 representation of Apex in a suit against Franklin &amp; Sei-delmann, LLC (\u201cF &amp; S\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">In July of 2007, Apex entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell all of its assets to F &amp; S. The initial proceeds were to be used to pay down Apex\u2019s debts and then distribute funds to shareholders on a pro-rata basis. After three initial payments, F &amp; S made no further payments to Apex. In May of 2008, Wade Rome, the majority shareholder of Apex, hired Defendant Singerman Mills to initiate litigation against F &amp; S for discontinuing payments. This suit was brought in federal court in Ohio. Singerman Mills is an Ohio law firm with a single office in Beachwood, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The action between F &amp; S and Apex was ultimately arbitrated in Ohio, and Apex received a net award. Plaintiffs allege that these funds were never divided among the shareholders and they never received any of these proceeds. They allege that Defendants knew or should have known that there was cause for concern about wiring the award to a bank account owned by Rome.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">In the present lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Florida, Plaintiffs assert claims for (1) breach of the attorney-client fiduciary duty; (2) breach of fiduciary duty and duty of care; (3) breach of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct for not obtaining waivers of conflict; (4) negligence; (5) gross negligence; (6) conspiracy to commit civil theft; and (7) conspiracy to commit civil theft or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, and the district court ordered that discovery be conducted. After discovery was complete, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">The district court held that Florida\u2019s long-arm statute did not reach Defendants\u2019 conduct. Additionally, even if the long-arm statute did reach Defendants\u2019 conduct, Defendants did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Florida to constitutionally subject them to jurisdiction in Florida. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>After thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action for lack of personal jurisdiction <em>de novo. Licciardello v. Lovelady, </em>544 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.2008). The plaintiff bears the burden of making out a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction by presenting sufficient evidence to withstand a directed verdict motion. <em>Stubbs v. Wyndham Nassau Resort &amp; Crystal Palace Casino, </em>447 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir.2006). The defendant then must \u201craise[ ], through affidavits, documents or testimony a meritorious challenge to personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Sculptchair, Inc. v. Century Arts, Ltd., </em>94 F.3d 623, 627 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). Conclusory statements, \u201calthough presented in the form of factual declarations, are in substance legal conclusions that do not trigger a duty for Plaintiffs to respond with evidence of their own supporting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Posner v. Essex Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>178 F.3d 1209, 1215 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the defendant provides sufficient evidence, \u201cthe burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove jurisdiction by affidavits, testimony or documents.\u201d <em>Sculptchair, </em>94 F.3d at 627 (quotation omitted). If the plaintiffs complaint and the defendant\u2019s evidence conflict, \u201cthe district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Madara v. Hall, </em>916 F.2d 1510, 1514 (11th Cir.1990). If the forum\u2019s long-arm statute provides jurisdiction over one claim, the district court has personal jurisdiction over the entire case so long as the claims arose from the same jurisdiction-generating event. <em>See Cronin v. Washington Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>980 F.2d 663, 671 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">We apply a two-step inquiry in determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is proper. <em>Horizon Aggressive Growth, L.P. v. Rothstein-Kass, P.A., </em>421 F.3d 1162, 1166 (11th Cir.2005). First, we examine whether the exercise of jurisdiction would be appropriate under the forum state\u2019s long-arm statute. <em>Id. </em>Second, we examine \u201cwhether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which requires that the defendant have minimum contacts with the forum state and that the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Here, the district court first held that the court lacked personal jurisdiction under the Florida long-arm statute. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(l)(a), (b), (g), and (2). The district court then held that, even if Florida\u2019s long-arm statute reached Defendants\u2019 conduct, the Due Process Clause of the United State Constitution prevented it from exercising personal jurisdiction over Defendants. The court found that Defendants lacked meaningful \u201ccontacts, ties, or relations\u201d with Florida. <em>See Int\u2019l Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">We agree with the district court that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Florida\u2019s long-arm statute reaches Defendants\u2019 conduct, the Due Process Clause prohibits Florida courts from exercising jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>over Defendants in this suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">A. Minimum Contacts</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution protects an individual\u2019s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful \u201ccontacts, ties, or relations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819, 66 S.Ct. 154. Where a forum seeks to assert specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, due process requires that the defendant have \u201cfair warning\u201d that a particular activity may subject him to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign. <em>See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). \u201cThis fair warning requirement is satisfied if the defendant has purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.\u201d <em>Licciardello, </em>544 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant must have reasonably anticipated being sued in the forum\u2019s courts in connection with his activities there. <em>Burger King Corp., </em>471 U.S. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174. \u201cJurisdiction is proper where the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum proximately result from actions by the defendant <em>himself </em>that create a substantial connection with the forum state.\u201d <em>Madam, </em>916 F.2d at 1516 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Applying these standards to the facts of this case, we hold that Defendants do not have sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Florida. As the district court noted, Defendants have no office, telephone, bank account, or property of any kind in the state of Florida. The evidence is undisputed that Defendants do not market themselves to Florida and did not conduct any matters related to this lawsuit in Florida. <em>Cf. Sculptchair, </em>94 F.3d at 631 (finding minimum contacts partly because defendant \u201cpurposefully availed herself of the privilege of conducting business in Florida by marketing ... products in the state\u201d). The only contacts by Defendants with Florida regarding this lawsuit involved telephone and electronic communications made with Florida-resident Plaintiffs Laufer and Kaufman. Defendants were hired to represent Apex in an action brought in Ohio, and the arbitration proceedings were not conducted in Florida. There is also no evidence that Defendants ever traveled to Florida for anything connected with this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Defendants did not purposefully avail themselves of conducting business in Florida. Defendants did not solicit any work from Apex and were originally contacted to represent Apex by Wade Rome, who was in Missouri, and Apex\u2019s counsel, who were in Missouri and Georgia. During Defendants\u2019 representation of Apex, no bills were ever mailed to Florida; instead, they were mailed to Missouri. There were no legal documents filed in Florida, no legal documents signed in Florida, no hearings in Florida, no depositions taken in Florida, and the arbitration proceedings took place in Ohio. <em>Cf. Robinson v. Giarmarco &amp; Bill, P.C., </em>74 F.3d 253, 259 (11th Cir.1996) (finding minimum contacts for nonresident attorney and accountant when, <em>inter alia, </em>defendants knew that the will would be probated, and the trust administered, in Florida and mailed all correspondence to the decedent in Florida).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Plaintiffs argue that this case is similar to <em>Sculptchair, Inc. v. Century Arts, Ltd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>In <em>Sculptchair, </em>this Court found that minimum contacts existed to justify hauling two defendants into a Florida court. 94 F.3d at 631. But Plaintiffs\u2019 case here is factually distinct. In <em>Sculptchair, </em>the plaintiff was the owner and president of a Florida company marketing, selling, and leasing a type of chair cover. <em>Id. </em>at 625-26. One of the defendants personally contacted the plaintiff seeking to obtain an exclusive licensing agreement to manufacture and market these chair covers in Canada. <em>Id. </em>at 626. This agreement was ultimately signed in Florida, and two of the defendants traveled from Canada to Florida to finalize the deal. <em>Id. </em>Months later, another defendant traveled from Canada to Florida for a four day \u201clogistical meeting\u201d with the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>This Court found sufficient minimum contacts to bring the defendant corporation and an individual associated with the corporation into court in Florida. It was undisputed that the corporation \u201creached out\u201d to Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 631. Defendants had also structured the agreement, \u201cenvisioning continuing and wide-reaching contacts with Sculptchair in Florida by seeking the exclusive licensing agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Here, Defendants did not reach out to Plaintiffs seeking representation; they never traveled to Florida in relation to this case; and there were no papers or agreements signed or filed in Florida. This minimal contact with Florida is not the type that would \u201clead a person to reasonably expect the possibility of ensuing litigation in a Florida court should some type of dissatisfaction or complications arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that Apex is a Florida corporation and that Defendants spoke on the phone with Apex shareholders in Florida does not establish that Defendants would have \u201cfair warning\u201d that their activities related to this matter would subject them to the jurisdiction of Florida. <em>Cf. Burger King Corp., </em>471 U.S. at 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174. Accordingly, we conclude that Defendants do not have sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Because we conclude that Defendants do not have minimum contacts with Florida, we need not address whether the exercise of jurisdiction would offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. We agree with the district court that Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defendants' affidavits are conclusory and self-serving \u2014 and therefore insufficient to rebut the allegations of the Complaint regarding personal jurisdiction \u2014 is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">. Accordingly, we need not address the district court\u2019s holding that Florida's long-arm statute does not reach Defendants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
