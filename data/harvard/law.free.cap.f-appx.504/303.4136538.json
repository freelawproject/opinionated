He was sentenced to a 151-month term of imprisonment on Count One and to a consecutive 60-month term of imprisonment on Count Two, as well as to a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Vigil appeals his sentence. He contends that the district court clearly erred in attributing 11S.4 grams of methamphetamine to him as relevant conduct. He asserts that there was a lack of reliable evidence to support the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996). We will affirm such a finding if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See id. </em>The district court may consider any relevant evidence at sentencing \u201cwithout regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 343 (5th Cir.1993) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3). Facts used for sentencing purposes should be \u201creasonably reliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Shacklett, </em>921 F.2d 580, 585 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">At sentencing, a law enforcement officer testified as to Vigil\u2019s voluntary post-arrest statement. Vigil, who was in possession of approximately 17 grams of actual methamphetamine when he was arrested, admitted to the officer that a person known as Milkweed had fronted a quarter pound of methamphetamine (113.4 grams) to him and that he had been selling methamphetamine for three or four weeks prior to his arrest. The officer recalled that Vigil spoke coherently and did not appeal to be under the influence of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Vigil, who also testified at sentencing, denied making such an admission. He averred that he was high on methamphetamine at the time of his arrest and that he had not slept in several days.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The district court determined that the law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony regarding the post-arrest statement was credible and accurate, and it credited the officer\u2019s testimony. \u201cDistrict courts enjoy wide discretion in determining which evidence to consider and to credit for sentencing purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantu-Ramirez, </em>669 F.3d 619, 628 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2759, 183 L.Ed.2d 628 (2012). This court defers to the district court\u2019s superior position in making credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>217 F.3d 323, 331-32 (5th Cir.2000). Vigil\u2019s contention that his admission was unreliable because he was under the influence of methamphetamine when he made the statement in question is unavailing given the district court\u2019s determination that he had given a detailed, rational post-arrest statement. <em>See Cantu-Ramirez, </em>669 F.3d at 628. The district court\u2019s drug quantity determination is plausible in light of the record as a whole; therefore, it is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Davis, </em>76 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
