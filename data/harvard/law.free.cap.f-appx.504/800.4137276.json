The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>adjusted offense level of 29 for Jackson\u2019s offense, which involved cocaine base, and his criminal history category of IV, yielded a sentencing range calling for a term of imprisonment of between 121 and 151 months. In November 2009, the District Court sentenced Jackson to a term of 70 months, granting a variance based on the then sentencing disparity for offenses involving cocaine and cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In March 2012, Jackson moved the District Court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the retroactive application of Amendment 750 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. The court denied his motion. He now appeals, arguing that the court erred by failing to consider his individual characteristics and apply the same downward variance that he originally received.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We review the District Court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court abuses its discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or follow proper procedures in making its determination. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a full re-sentencing. That is, the court must maintain all original sentencing determinations, with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The district court must then engage in a two-part analysis when considering a motion for reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 780. First, the court must recalculate the applicable guideline sentence range, using the amended guideline provisions. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Second, the court then must decide, in its discretion, whether to retain the existing sentence or impose a reduced sentence, within the new range, considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as public safety considerations. <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">It is unclear whether the District Court originally applied a downward variance or a departure when sentencing Jackson. To decide which was applied, we consider whether the court mentioned a specific guideline provision and if the court\u2019s reasoning was based on its conclusion that the guideline range was not appropriate. <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). We are not bound by the court\u2019s language. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the court effectively reduced Jackson\u2019s offense level and adopted a new guideline range based on the then-existing disparity between powder and crack cocaine sentences, rather than merely sentencing him below the original range, it apparently applied a downward departure rather than a variance. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006). Nevertheless, this distinction is not important because Jackson\u2019s argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">The Supreme Court has held that <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, district courts lack authority to sentence a defendant below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>Dillon v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number><em>United </em>States, 560 U.S. -, -, 180 S.Ct. 2688, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (explaining that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not implicate the interests identified in <em>Booker, </em>because the proceedings are \u201cnot constitutionally compelled,\u201d but instead represent a \u201ccongressional act of lenity,\u201d and because any facts found by a judge in such proceedings cannot serve to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment range).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable effective November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, made permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. Amendment 750 also changed the marijuana equivalency for 1 gram of crack cocaine from 20 kilograms of marijuana to 3,571 grams of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750, Reason for Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Moreover, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) provides that a district court may <em>not </em>impose a new sentence that is below the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range, with one exception: if the court previously granted a downward departure to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, the court may impose a comparable downward departure from the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (2011); <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2012). Application Note 1 clarifies that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d from the defendant\u2019s original sentencing was the range generated by combining the total offense level and criminal history category and <em>before </em>any variance or departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(A). Therefore, Jackson\u2019s applicable guideline range called for imprisonment of 121 to 151 months, which was the range before the court varied or departed downward at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">When Jackson was sentenced in 2009, the 2008 equivalency table dictated that he be held responsible for 4,088.1 kilograms of marijuana. Under the 2008 guidelines manual, offense levels involving different kinds of drugs were calculated by using the table to determine the marijuana equivalency for each drug, then combining those amounts and using the total to find the offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 10 (2008). If the calculations involved cocaine base, however, the base offense level assigned by the sentencing table was then reduced by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 10(D)(i) (2008). Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s base offense level pursuant to the sentencing table in 2008 for his case involving the equivalent of at least 3,000 kilograms but less than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana was 34, which the presen-tence report then reduced by 2 levels to get 32 as Jackson\u2019s final base offense level. After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Jackson\u2019s adjusted offense level was 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">After Amendment 750, the 196 grams of crack cocaine that Jackson was held accountable for converted to a lesser amount under the 2011 equivalency table \u2014 the equivalent of 699.92 kilograms of marijuana \u2014 which, combined with the other drug equivalency conversions, came to a total of the equivalent of only 868.02 kilograms of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 10(D). While the guidelines still provided a mechanism for assigning an offense level when both cocaine base and other controlled substances are involved, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 10(B) (2011), the amended \u00a7 2D1.1 did <em>not </em>include the direction that the base offense level calculated for combining different drugs should be reduced by two levels if cocaine base was involved. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>U.S.S.G.App. C at 377, Amend. 748 (\u201cThe Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 captioned \u201cApplication Notes\u201d is amended in Note 10 by striking subdivision D ... \u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. 10(D). Jackson\u2019s amended base offense level was 30, so after applying a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Jackson\u2019s new total offense level was 27. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(6) (2011). Combined with his category IV criminal history, Jackson\u2019s amended guideline range, as the Government correctly noted, was 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. (2011 Federal Sentencing Guidelines, Sentencing Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Even if Jackson\u2019s calculations are correct \u2014 and his new range is 70 to 87 months\u2019s imprisonment \u2014 the District Court still did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Jackson was not eligible for a reduction following Amendment 750 because, although the amendment lowered his offense level and the guideline range, his original 70-months\u2019 sentence fell below, or at, the bottom of the amended guideline ranges identified by the Government (100 to 125 months) and Jackson (70 to 87 months) and a court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the guideline range in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding unless he originally received a substantial assistance departure, which Jackson did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">. <em>United.
