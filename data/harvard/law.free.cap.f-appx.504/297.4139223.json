They had remained free on bond prior to trial, but after conviction the district court remanded them to custody pending sentencing. Defendants filed motions for release pending sentencing, which the district court denied. They appeal the denial of those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">A defendant who has been convicted \u201cshall ... be detained\u201d pending sentencing \u201cunless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, there is a presumption against release pending sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding release only for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Considering both the burden on the Defendants to show by clear and convincing evidence that they are not likely to flee and our deferential standard of review, we are reluctant to reverse the district court\u2019s decision. The district court, having conducted a twenty-five-day trial, was in the better position to assess the Defendants\u2019 international contacts and their motive to flee, particularly in light of their co-conspirator\u2019s 110-year sentence. We also note that the government ultimately opposed the motions for release despite having initially declined to seek remands to custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the evidence attached to the Defendants\u2019 motions may have somewhat mitigated the likelihood that they would flee, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the evidence failed to do so clearly and convincingly. On de novo review we might reach a different conclusion, but that is not the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
