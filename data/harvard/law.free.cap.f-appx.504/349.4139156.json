Saucedo argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe because the district court failed to consider that his reentry offense was at bottom a mere trespass and did not consider his assimilation in and family ties to the United States. He further contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of correctness because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, given that it double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">Conceding that he failed to object in the district court, Saucedo asserts that plain error review should not apply because no objection is required to preserve the issue of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence. He acknowledges, however, that the issue is foreclosed, and he raises it to preserve the issue for further review. We have held that a defendant\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to the reasonableness of his sentence triggers plain error review. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Even if we reviewed for an abuse of discretion, however, his arguments are unavailing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-23\">As he concedes, Saucedo\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected the argument that a guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Furthermore, Saucedo\u2019s sentence, which is at the low end of the applicable guidelines range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Saucedo has not demonstrated that the district court erred, much less plainly erred, by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentence of 46 months in prison. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
