Finding no error on the part of the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Citizens for Smart Growth v. Sec\u2019y of the Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>669 F.3d 1203, 1210 (11th Cir.2012) (citation omitted). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). When reviewing a summary judgment motion, \u201c[w]e do not make credibility determinations, but instead believe the evidence of the non-mov-ant ... and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor.\u201d <em>Evans v. Stephens, </em>407 F.3d 1272, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (ellipses in original). We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that federal law preempts state law. <em>See Cliff v. Payco Gen. Am. Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">On appeal, Bennett claims that ECMC and Premiere violated the Higher Education Act (HEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq.; </em>the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g; and Georgia state garnishment law, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-4-46.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bennett also contends that there is a question of fact as to whether she owes a debt at all, and therefore the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>improperly granted summary judgment in favor of ECMC and Premiere.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">A. The Higher Education Act</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Bennett asserts that ECMC and Premiere violated certain provisions of the HEA, which govern the procedures for administrative wage garnishment. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a)(2)-(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bennett contends that ECMC and Premiere violated the HEA when they failed to: (1) provide her with prior notice of the nature and amount of the debt owed; (2) give her notice of their intent to initiate the administrative wage garnishment; and (3) provide certain documents and records upon request regarding Bennett\u2019s alleged Stafford loan default. However, we have consistently held that \u201c[w]hile the HEA endows debtors with certain rights during the wage garnishment process, the HEA expressly empowers only the Secretary of Education \u2014 not debtors \u2014 with the authority to enforce the HEA and rectify HEA violations.\u201d <em>Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1123 (citation omitted); <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a. Therefore, \u201c[i]t is well-settled that the HEA does not expressly provide debtors with a private right of action.\u201d <em>Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1123 (citing <em>McCulloch v. PNC Bank Inc., </em>298 F.3d 1217, 1221 (11th Cir.2002)). There is also no implied private right of action. <em>McCulloch, </em>298 F.3d at 1224-25. Accordingly, the district court properly found that Bennett could not bring a private cause of action against ECMC and Premiere for the alleged HEA violations. <em>See Bennett I, </em>D. Ga.2012, \u2014 F.Supp.2d -, (No. 11-124, Oct. 20, 2011); <em>Bennett II, </em>D. Ga.2012, 2012 WL 1605108, (No. 11-124, May 8, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">B. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">Although there is no express or implied private right of action under the HEA, a violation of the HEA can, at times, give rise to a private cause of action under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>FDCPA. <em>See Cliff, </em>368 F.3d at 1127. Bennett contends that ECMC and Premiere violated the FDCPA, directly and via their failure to qualify as guaranty agencies under the HEA, when they communicated with and improperly \u201cissued [a] garnishment withholding order to [her] employer.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(b) (prohibiting a debt collector\u2019s communication with third parties under the FDCPA unless certain limited conditions apply). However, Bennett can only succeed on this claim if ECMC and Premiere: (1) fail to qualify as \u201cguaranty agencies\u201d under the HEA, and therefore did not have express authority to contact her employer; and (2) are classified as \u201cdebt collectors\u201d under the FDCPA, and acted in violation of its regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">1. \u201cGuaranty Agencies\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Under the Family Federal Education Loan (FFEL) Program, student loans, such as Bennett\u2019s Stafford loan, are guaranteed either by a state agency or by a \u201cprivate nonprofit organization that has an agreement with the Secretary [of the Department of Education (DOE) ] under which it will administer a loan guarantee program under the [HEA].\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.200; <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1078(a)(1). These nonprofit organizations, known as guaranty agencies, enter into agreements with the DOE that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">[S]et forth such administrative and fiscal procedures as may be necessary to protect the United States from the risk of unreasonable loss thereunder, to ensure proper and efficient administration of the loan insurance program, and <em>to assure that due diligence will be exercised in the collection of loans insured under the program.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1078(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). HEA regulations have expressly characterized the relationship between a guaranty agency and the DOE as a fiduciary relationship. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.419(a) (\u201cThe guaranty agency must exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary charged with the duty of protecting, investing, and administering the money of others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Guaranty agencies are not only given express authority to engage in collection activities, but federal regulations mandate that the agencies engage in \u201cdue diligence\u201d to collect on defaulted loans as part of their agreement with the DOE. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.410(b)(6)(i) (\u201cA guaranty agency <em>must </em>engage in reasonable and doc\u00fcmented collection activities on a loan on which it pays a default claim filed by a lender.... [T]he agency <em>must </em>perform at least one activity every 180 days to collect the debt, locate the borrower (if necessary), or determine if the borrower has the means to repay the debt.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see generally </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.411(governing \u201c[l]ender due diligence in collecting guaranty agency loans\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">In addition, as part of their mandatory collection activities, guaranty agencies are given express authority to \u201cgarnish the disposable pay of a debtor to collect the amount owed if the debtor has failed to make payments required under a repayment agreement.\u201d <em>Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1118 (citing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a) (\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of State law, a guaranty agency ... may garnish the disposable pay of an individual to collect the amount owed by the individual, if he or she is not currently making required repayment under a repayment agree-ment_\u201d)). Guaranty agencies also have express authority to contact a debtor\u2019s employer and issue a withholding order demanding that the employer garnish the debtor\u2019s wages. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a)(6) (\u201c[T]he employer shall pay to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>the Secretary or the guaranty agency as directed in the withholding order.... \u201d); <em>see also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.410(b)(9)(i)(H) (\u201cUnless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the employer.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Bennett contends that ECMC is not a guaranty agency, and that because there is no evidence that her Stafford loan was transferred or assigned to ECMC, it is not the current holder of her loan. Bennett asserts that the sworn affidavit of ECMC\u2019s Senior Account Servicing Representative, Julia Lambert \u2014 which states that ECMC is the current holder of Bennett\u2019s loan and that it is a guaranty agency \u2014 is nothing more than an unsupported opinion. Citing a decision from the Ninth Circuit, Bennett further maintains that neither ECMC nor Premiere have engaged in the requisite activities to be classified as anything more than debt collectors. <em>See Rowe v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., </em>559 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir.2009). ECMC, on the other hand, cites Lambert\u2019s affidavit and contends that it qualifies as a guaranty agency under the HEA, such that its issuance of a withholding order to Bennett\u2019s employer was appropriate. Premiere concedes that it is not a guaranty agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">As a preliminary matter, we reiterate the district court\u2019s observation that Bennett has confused the requirements for demonstrating an organization\u2019s \u201cguaranty agency\u201d status under the HEA with the requirements necessary to prove an entity\u2019s status as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the FDCPA. <em>See Bennett II, </em>D. Ga.2012, 2012 WL 1605108, (No. 11-124, May 8, 2012) (\u201cBennett appears to intermingle the FDCPA and HEA.\u201d). The test that Bennett cites, as stated in our sister circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Rowe </em>and discussed by the district court below, resolves the question of \u201cdebt collector\u201d status, but is inapplicable to determine \u201cguaranty agency\u201d status. <em>See </em>559 F.3d at 1032 (\u201cTwo requirements must be satisfied for an entity <em>to come within the exception to the FDCPA </em>for collection activities \u2018incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.\u2019 \u201d (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i)) (emphasis added)). Therefore, we simply look for an agreement between ECMC and the DOE to determine guaranty agency status. See-34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.200(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">ECMC has presented sufficient evidence that it is the current holder of Bennett\u2019s Stafford loan, as well as evidence of its guaranty agency status, through Lambert\u2019s sworn affidavit and the attached letter listing ECMC as a guaranty agency to the DOE. Although the list of guaranty agencies is not on official DOE letterhead, as Bennett vehemently points out, the list attached to Lambert\u2019s affidavit is identical to the list of guaranty agencies posted on the DOE\u2019s official website. <em>See </em>U.S. Department of Education, <em>State Guaranty Agency, </em>Organizations by Type, http:// wdcrobcolpOl .ed.gov/Programs/EROD/ org_list.cfm?category_cd=SGA (last visited Dec. 16, 2012). Moreover, numerous sister circuits have explicitly held that ECMC is a guaranty agency. <em>See Rowe, </em>559 F.3d at 1032 (finding no dispute as to ECMC\u2019s guaranty agency status); <em>see also Black v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., </em>459 F.3d 796, 798 (7th Cir.2006) (finding that ECMC is \u201ca non-profit corporation that acts as a guarantee agency and occasionally handles the defaulted FFELP loans of debtors who file a petition for relief under Chapter 13\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Aside from making a bald assertion that Lambert\u2019s affidavit is nothing more than \u201can opinion,\u201d Bennett has not presented any other evidence to support her claims regarding ECMC\u2019s guaranty agency status. Based on the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>record before us, and Bennett\u2019s failure to present sufficient evidence otherwise, we agree with the district court that ECMC qualifies as a guaranty agency under the HEA, and is therefore engaged in a fiduciary relationship with the DOE. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.419(a). Accordingly, ECMC had the authority to engage in administrative wage garnishment and issue a withholding order to Bennett\u2019s employer. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">2. \u201cDebt Collectors\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Congress enacted the FDCPA in order to eliminate \u201cthe use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices\u201d and \u201cto protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(a), (e). The Act thereby regulates the collection of \u201cdebts\u201d by \u201cdebt collectors\u201d by dictating, <em>inter alia, </em>the type and frequency of the contacts that a debt collector can make with a debtor. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692a, 1692c; <em>see also Pelfrey v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., </em>71 F.Supp.2d 1161, 1165 (N.D.Ala.1999), <em>aff'd </em>208 F.3d 945 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). A violation of any of the prohibited activities listed in the FDPCA gives rise to a private cause of action. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The FDCPA broadly defines a \u201cdebt collector\u201d as \u201cany person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). However, the Act lists multiple exceptions to this definition; in relevant part, the FDCPA does not apply to \u201cany person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another <em>to the extent such activity ... is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(i) (emphasis added). Although an entity that satisfies this exception is not subject to the FDCPA, \u201cthe Secretary of Education has expressed the belief that third-party debt collectors acting on behalf of guaranty agencies to collect federal student loans must comply with the FDCPA.\u201d <em>Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1123-24 (citing 55 Fed.Reg. 40120 (Oct. 1, 1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Bennett contends that ECMC and Premiere are both debt collectors under the FDCPA. However, based on facts similar to the ones at bar, we have explicitly held that ECMC is an entity acting incident to a fiduciary relationship with the DOE, and is therefore exempt from the provisions of the FDCPA. <em>Pelfrey, </em>208 F.3d at 945 (\u201c[T]he [FDCPA]. does not apply to [ECMC], because [ECMC] is a \u2018person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity ... is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original)). Likewise in this case, ECMC\u2019s status as a guaranty agency, and therefore its fiduciary relationship to the DOE, is direct evidence that it satisfies the fiduciary relationship exemption and is not subject to the provisions of the FDCPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Premiere, on the other hand, concedes \u201cthat it is a third-party debt collector subject to the FDCPA.\u201d However, it contends that because ECMC actually issued the withholding order to Bennett\u2019s employer, and because Bennett\u2019s employer was specifically directed to remit payments to ECMC, Premiere \u201cmerely acted as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>accounts receivable collection contractor assisting ECMC with collection of [Bennett\u2019s] defaulted student loan.\u201d Once again, ECMC had the authority to issue a withholding order to effectuate wage garnishment. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a)(6). Moreover, the Secretary of Education has recognized that \u201c[a] great deal of the collection action on [FFEL] Program loans is performed for guaranty] agencies by third party collection contractors ... subject to the FDCPA.\u201d <em>See </em>55 Fed.Reg. 40120; <em>see also Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1123-24. Accordingly, because ECMC is authorized to engage in administrative wage garnishment, and because Premiere is authorized to perform collection activities on ECMC\u2019s behalf as a third-party contractor, Premiere did not violate the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">C. Preemption by Georgia Wage Garnishment Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Bennett also argues that the Georgia state wage garnishment statute supersedes the HEA. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-4-46 (\u201c[N]o part of the personal earnings of [a debtor] shall be subject to garnishment prior to [a] judgment.\u201d). However, we expressly decided this issue in <em>Cliff </em>when we held that, pursuant to the \u201cnotwithstanding any provision of state law\u201d clause of the HEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a), the HEA \u201cpreempts [] those provisions of state law that would otherwise prohibit or hinder the ability of a guaranty agency to garnish a debtor\u2019s wages.\u201d 363 F.3d at 1125. Here, because the Georgia statute would require ECMC to obtain a state court judgment prior to garnishing Bennett\u2019s wages, the Georgia statute is preempted because it hinders ECMC\u2019s ability to garnish a debtor\u2019s wages. Therefore, Bennett\u2019s argument to the contrary is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">D. Question of Fact as to Debt Owed</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Bennett contends that \u201cthe record ... is completely absent evidence that ECMC or Premiere is the owner or holder of [her] note or judgment.\u201d Bennett also maintains that she has already paid any debt owed on the Stafford loan, and cites two official letters issued by the DOE on September 24, 2000 and February 20, 2010, stating that two of her defaulted loans have been \u201cpaid in full.\u201d Finally, Bennett claims that appellees\u2019 failure to file a compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a) provides further evidence that there is a question of fact as to whether she owes a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Contrary to Bennett\u2019s assertions, we need not address any of these claims. As recognized by the district court, this is not the appropriate forum to raise these issues; instead, Bennett should pursue these claims in accordance with the available administrative rights, procedures and remedies provided under the HEA. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1095a(a)(5) (\u201c[T]he individual shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing ... concerning the existence or the amount of the debt.\u201d); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.410(b)(9)(i)(E) (\u201cThe guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an opportunity for a hearing ... concerning the existence or the amount of the debt.\u201d), 682.410(b)(i)(J) (\u201cThe guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at the borrower\u2019s option, may be oral or written, if the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt.\u201d). Bennett has a right to a hearing before a \u201chearing official appointed by the [guaranty] agency,\u201d who \u201cmay be any qualified individual, including an administrative law judge, not under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.410(b)(9)(i)(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-11\">. Although ECMC originally filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the district court construed that motion as one for summary judgment, and gave the parties additional time to supplement the record. <em>See Bennett I, </em>D. Ga.2012, - F.Supp.2d -, (No. 11-124, Oct. 20, 2011). Bennett also filed a motion for a permanent injunction, which the district court denied because it had already \"dismissed Bennett\u2019s claims against ECM[C] on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Bennett I, </em>D. Ga.2012, - F.Supp.2d -, (No. 11-124, Oct. 20, 2011). However, because Bennett does not \"plainly and prominently\u201d contest the permanent injunction ruling on appeal, it is therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that an issue is abandoned when it is not \"plainly and prominently\u201d raised on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-20\">.
