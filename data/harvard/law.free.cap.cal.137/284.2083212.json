The usual judgment of foreclosure was rendered, and defendant appeals from the judgment, bringing up only the judgment-roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The appellant contends that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, because there is no express averment therein that the principal sum of the note and mortgage was \u201cdue\u201d at the commencement of the action. The complaint sets out in full the note and mortgage sued on, which show on their face that the principal was due and payable about two years before the commencement of the action; and it is averred that <em>\u201cno </em>part of the principal mentioned in said promissory note and mortgage has been paid,\u201d etc., and that \u201cthe principal sum of\" said promissory note, to wit: fifteen hundred (1500) dollars, is unpaid, and is owing by said defendant John L. Pavkovich to J. R. Luddy plaintiff herein.\u201d These averments are entirely sufficient to show what the contract sued on was, and that appellant had violated it by not paying the note after its maturity. And the sufficiency of the complaint in this respect is an answer to appellant\u2019s contention that there is no express finding that the principal sum of the note was \u201cdue.\u201d The court, m addition to specific findings as to the amount of the principal sum secured, and that it is \u201cunpaid,\u201d etc., finds that all allegations of the complaint are true except a part of the allegation as to an attorney\u2019s fee; and it also finds under the head of \u201cConclusions of Law\u201d that the principal sum with certain interest, is \u201cdue and unpaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">With respect to an attorney\u2019s fee for foreclosing, the mortgage provides that in the event of foreclosure the mortgagee \u201cmay include in such foreclosure a reasonable counsel- fee, to be fixed by the court\u201d; and it is averred that two hundred and fifty dollars was a reasonable fee. The court allowed a fee of one hundred and twenty-five dollars,\u2014which is not claimed to be unreasonable,\u2014but merely gave a personal judgment for that amount, holding that it was not included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>mortgage lien. Appellant contends that' the provision in the mortgage as to attorney\u2019s fee does not warrant a personal judgment therefor; but on this point the case is exactly like <em>Klokke </em>v. <em>Escailler, </em>124 Cal. 297, where it was held,\u2014&gt; the provision of the mortgage and the averment in the complaint about an attorney\u2019s fee being the same there as in the ease at bar,\u2014that \u201cwhile plaintiff is entitled upon proper showing to recover attorney\u2019s fees in his action, he is not entitled to have those fees included in the amount of the mortgage lien. He must .rely alone upon a personal judgment. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Temple, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
