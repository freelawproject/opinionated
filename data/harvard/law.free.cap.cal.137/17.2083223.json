The complaint contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>three counts in regard to the same cause of action. The second count states that on March 1, 1899, plaintiff, at the request of defendant, paid to one Kincell $457.87; that defendant promised to repay the same, but has failed to do so, and the sum remains due and unpaid. The court found the facts thus stated to be true, and ordered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows that in January, 1899, defendant came to .its office with Kincell and stated that Kineell would be engaged during the season in packing and shipping fruit for defendant; that in the business it would be necessary for Kineell to have money to pay for labor and material, desired plaintiff to advance the money Kineell might want for the purpose, and that Kincell would draw his drafts upon defendant in Los Angeles for amounts as needed; that if plaintiff would pay Kineell such drafts defendant promised to pay them when presented to him in Los Angeles; that plaintiff promised to comply with the request, relying upon the defendant\u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">! On the eleventh day of January, 1899, Kineell drew a draft upon defendant for $167.16, which was paid, and several like drafts for different amounts were drawn during January and February, 1899, in all cases the defendant paying the drafts when presented through plaintiff\u2019s correspondent in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u2022 On March 1, 1899, Kincell drew a draft on defendant for $457.87, upon which plaintiff paid the money, passing it to the credit of Kincell.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">When this draft was presented to defendant he refused to pay it. Defendant claims that prejudicial errors occurred, for which the order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The draft in question was sent by plaintiff to the Los Angeles National Bank\u2014its correspondent\u2014for collection. The prior drafts had been sent to the same bank and collected by it. In cross-examination of Bittinger, the cashier of plaintiff, certain questions were asked for the purpose of showing that the Los Angeles National Bank was the correspondent of plaintiff in Los Angeles 'for attending to all its business, that it was a general agent of plaintiff, and that defendant notified the Los Angeles bank before the draft in dispute was presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that he would not pay any more drafts drawn on him by Kincell.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">The court sustained plaintiff\u2019s objections to this class of questions, and we think the court erred in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The following is a sample of the questions asked in cross-examination to which the court sustained plaintiff\u2019s objections :\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201cQ. Mr. Bittinger, you state that these drafts were acknowledged by the Los Angeles bank down here. Was that bank your correspondent in this city for the purpose of attending to your business here?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cQ. Who presented these drafts to Mr. Jacoby in Los Angeles for the First National Bank of Riverside ? \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">The defendant was placed upon the stand in his own behalf, and testified that he never gave Kincell authority to draw upon him for any purpose, but that he had business relations with Kincell during the early part of the year 1899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u201cQ. What were they?\u201d To this question the court sustained plaintiff\u2019s objection on the ground that it was immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">After defendant had given certain testimony, and further objections were made by plaintiff, the defendant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI understand your honor to rule that we are not</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">entitled to ask this witness what notice he gave to the person presenting that draft?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\"><em>\u201cThe </em>Court.\u2014Yes, that is what I rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Counsel for defendant then asked him the following question :\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-13\">\u201cQ. Did you ever, Mr. Jacoby, notify the First National Bank, plaintiff, either directly or through the persons presenting to you the draft, or any drafts drawn by Mr. Kincell upon you, that Mr. Kincell had no authority to draw any sight drafts upon you, and that you would not pay any more sight drafts drawn by Mr. Kincell upon you, unless at the time of the drawing and presentation of the drafts there was a sufficient sum of money due him from you to cover the amount of the draft?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-14\">The court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objection to this question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-15\">The following then took place:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-16\">\u201cQ. [by defendant\u2019s counsel]. Now as to the draft in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tion, Mr. Jacoby, do you remember when that was presented to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><em>\u201cThe </em>Court-\u2014\"What is the object of this question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><em>\u201cMr. </em>Uowla/nd.\u2014To show that at the time the draft was presented and they were notified that it was dishonored, they still had the funds in their hands. That is the object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\"><em>\u201cThe </em>Court.\u2014What funds do you refer to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\"><em>\u201cMr. </em>Hoivland.\u2014The money which they claim they had paid . for the draft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\"><em>\u201cThe </em>Court.\u2014The objection is sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">Counsel for defendant then offered to prove by defendant \u201cthat he notified the Los Angeles National Bank, who was representing the First National Bank of Riverside, that Mr. Kincell had no authority to draw the sight drafts upon him; that there was no money due Mr. Kincell from him, and that he would not pay any drafts drawn by Kincell against him unless at the time of the drawing and presentation there was due Mr. Kincell from him sufficient money to cover the amount of the draft; that notice was given on the fifteenth day of February, again on the twenty-seventh day of February, and again on the second day of March; that the last draft, the one in question,, was presented to him on the afternoon of the second day of March and dishonored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The court declined to hear the evidence, remarking, \u201cIt is simply consuming time unnecessarily.\u201d The evidence was offered for the purpose of proving the nature of the agency of the. Los Angeles bank in connection with plaintiff, that plaintiff had notice that defendant would not pay any more drafts drawn upon him by Kincell, and that plaintiff still had the funds in its hands when notified of the dishonor of the drafts in' question. The offered evidence went to the gist of the defense set up by defendant in his answer. If the Los Angeles bank was a general agent of plaintiff, and was notified, or if it was only an agent for the purposes of collecting the drafts, and was notified, and communicated such notice to plaintiff, the plaintiff would not have been justified in paying this draft. The evidence bearing upon the question should have been received, and then from such evidence the court should have determined the fact. Ordinarily, when a draft is sent from one bank to another for collection the bank to whom it is sent is the agent of the bank sending the draft only for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the purpose of collection, including, of course, the duties of taking all necessary steps as to notifying, protesting, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">But there is no such presumption as would preclude the proof of an agency of a general kind. Again, the findings are upon the count as to moneys advanced at defendant\u2019s request. If plaintiff was notified before it advanced the money, it could not have advanced it at defendant\u2019s request. Yet the court would not permit the defendant to prove that plaintiff was notified that the draft was dishonored while it still had the funds in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Defendant\u2019s theory was, that he did not request the advances to Kincell, and that he only paid the drafts when Kineell had credit or goods on hand to justify the defendant in paying them. As to whether the drafts were evidence of moneys advanced by plaintiff at defendant\u2019s request or were taken by plaintiff for collection, was the issue upon which the parties were contending. The defendant, by the rulings of the court, was deprived of putting in his testimony. It is said that the questions asked of Bittinger in cross-examination were not proper cross-examination. As he had testified that the money was advanced at the request of defendant, it would certainly be a very strict construction to hold that he might not be cross-examined fully as to whether or not the money was so advanced, by showing that it was advanced after the plaintiff had been notified not to advance it; but be that as it may, no such objection was made in the court below. Plaintiff will not be allowed here to make it for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">We advise that the order be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Haynes, C., and Gray, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order is reversed.
