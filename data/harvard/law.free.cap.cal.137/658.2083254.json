From the title of the ordinance, the absence of regulatory provisions, the amounts of the several taxes imposed, and the nature of the particular subject of taxation involved here, it is clear that the license tax in question was imposed for the purpose of raising revenue. The case is therefore substantially similar to that of the <em>City of Sonora </em>v. <em>Curtin (ante, </em>p. 583), just decided, and it must therefore be held on the authority of the decision in that case that the license tax in question was repealed, and the right of action therefor extinguished by section 3366 of the Political Code (added thereto by the act of March 23, 1901, Stats. 1901, p. 635).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed and the action dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
