The entire information is as follows: \u201cLee Look is accused by the district attorney of the county of Santa Clara, state of California, by this information, of a felony committed as follows: The said-defendant, on the 14th day of March, A. D. 1901, at the county and state aforesaid, unlawfully and with malice aforethought killed Lee Wing, contrary to the form, force, and effect of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the people of the state of California.\u201d Murder under our law is defined as follows: \u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being,with malice aforethought.\u201d (Pen. Code, see. 187.) It will be noticed that in this information the thing killed, Lee Wing, is not averred to have been a human being; that the crime of which he is sought to be charged is not stated to be \u201cmurder\u201d; that there is no averment that he did \u201ckill and murder\u201d Lee Wing; that the word \u201cmurder\u201d nowhere appears in the document, nor does the latter contain any other language which necessarily implied that the appellant killed a human being. We think therefore that, for this reason, the information is radically defective, and cannot support the verdict and judgment. This court has, no doubt, been exceedingly liberal in condoning loose pleadings; but to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>that a man\u2019s life can be judicially taken on such an information as the one here in question would be to sacrifice to liberality all the established rules of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We do not mean to hold that an indictment for murder cannot be sufficient without an express averment that the thing killed was a human being\u2014although there seems to be no good reason for leaving out that part of the statutory definition. There may be other language used which necessarily implies that the killing was of a human being, and in such case to designate the deceased by an appellation which could reasonably be considered as the name of a person would be sufficient, without the further express statement that the deceased was a human being. For instance, where, as is usual, the defendant is charged with the crime of \u201cmurder,\u201d or where, as is usual, it is averred that the defendant \u201cdid kill and murder, \u2019 \u2019 it may be reasonably inferred that the killing was of a human being, because to constitute murder there must be the killing of such a being. But there is no such averment here, nor its equivalent. The averment that the killing was unlawful and malicious would apply to the crime of malicious mischief committed by maliciously killing a horse, a dog, or a bird.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Counsel for respondent seem to assert quite confidently that indictments and informations like the one in this case have heretofore been sustained by this court, and strongly invoke the rule of <em>stare decisis; </em>but the cases cited do not support the position. The main cases relied on are <em>People </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>63 Cal. 165, and-\u2014as approving <em>it\u2014People </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>66 Cal. 345, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyndman, </em>99 Cal. 3. In the Soto case the only points decided were that it is sufficient to charge an offense in the language of the statute defining it, and that an indictment for murder generally includes murder of both the first and second degree. In the opinion in that case the court say: \u201cThe point chiefly argued for the defendant is, that, under the information against him, he could not be legally convicted of murder of the first degree. The information is in the language of the statute defining murder, which is: \u2018Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, with malice aforethought.\u2019 (Pen. Code, sec. 187.) Murder, thus defined, includes murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. It has many times been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>cided by this court that it is sufficient to charge the offense committed in the language of the statute defining it.\u201d In the case at bar the information was <em>not </em>\u201cin the language of the statute defining murder\u201d; and in the Soto ease there was no decision of the point here involved, and \u201cthe crime of murder\u201d was expressly charged in the information. <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomlinson </em>was not a case of murder; it was a ease of embezzlement, and the Soto case was cited merely to the point that an information is sufficient if it \u201cis in the language of the statute.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyndman </em>the Soto case is cited only to the points that murder \u201cincludes both degrees,\u201d and that \u201cit is sufficient to charge the offense committed in the language of the statute defining it.\u201d Moreover, it was alleged in the information in that case that the defendant \" did kill and murder one William Searle.\u201d The only other California cases cited by respondents are <em>People </em>v. <em>Alviso, </em>55 Cal. 230; <em>People </em>v. <em>McNulty, </em>93 Cal. 427, and <em>People </em>v. Freeland, 6 Cal. 96. In the Alviso case the indictment, which was held sufficient, charged that the defendant unlawfully, etc., \u201cdid kill and murder one John Ruhland.\u201d In the McNulty case the information charged that the defendant did \u201ckill and murder one James Collins\u201d; and in answer to the contention that as the deceased was not designated as a human being, and James Collins might mean a horse as well as a person, the court said: \u201cIt is manifest that the defendant could not have been otherwise than informed by the language used that he was accused of the murder of a human being, when he was charged with having murdered one James Collins.\u201d In the Freeland case the defendant was \u201cindicted for the crime of murder in shooting one \u2018Greek George\u2019 \u201d; and the point made was that \u201c \u2018Greek George\u2019 is not a common name of any person, and it is not averred that the real name of the deceased is unknown to the grand jury\u201d; and it was in view of these facts that the court said that \u201cit was not necessary to allege that the deceased was a sentient being,\u201d and that \u201cfor aught we know \u2018Greek George\u2019 may be the name of a man with as much propriety as any other name or appellation used to denote persons.\u201d Of course, a charge of the murder of \u201cGreek George\u201d necessarily included the proposition that he was a human being, for the killing of any other kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>creature would not be murder. Indeed, the only question in the case was whether \u201cGreek George\u201d was so unusual and imperfect as the name of a human being as to require a statement in the indictment that the name of the deceased was to the jury unknown. \u2022 \u00a1</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Respondents have cited a number of cases from other jurisdictions. We have examined those from which quotations are made, and which are chiefly relied on, and we find that nearly all of them are merely to the point that there need not be an express statement that the deceased was a human being where that fact was necessarily to be inferred from other averments in the indictment. One of these cases cited is <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>State, </em>63 Ind. 337, where it is stated in the opinion of the court that \u201cthe indictment contains two counts, each count charging murder in the first degree.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>33 Iowa, 526, the defendant is charged with murder committed by, among other things, \u201clying in wait with the specific intent to kill and murder the said William Patterson.\u201d In <em>Reed </em>v. <em>State, </em>16 Ark. 499, it is stated that the defendant was indicted \u201cfor the murder of a certain Wyandotte Indian, whose named was unknown to the grand jury.\u201d In <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>State, </em>36 Tex. 321, the defendant was indicted \u201cfor the murder of William H. McMillan.\u201d In <em>Timmerman </em>v. <em>Territory, </em>3 Wash. Ter. 444, the indictment accused the defendant \u201cof \u2022 the crime of murder in the first degree, committed as follows. \u2019 \u2019 'The nearest approach to the case at bar among the cases cited is <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>4 Wash. 104; but that case is based on <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Territory, </em>2 Wash. Ter. 381; <em>Timmerman </em>v. <em>Territory, </em>3 Wash. Ter. 444, and <em>Freidrich </em>v. <em>Territory, 2 </em>Wash. Ter. 358; and in the Leonard case the indictment had the words \u201cdid kill and murder,\u201d and in the Timmerman and Freidrich cases the defendant was expressly charged with \u201cthe crime of murder in the first degree.\u201d Moreover the definition of murder considered in <em>State </em>v. <em>Day </em>is as follows: \u201cEvery person who shall purposely . . . <em>kill another </em>shall be deemed guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d Counsel for respondents also cite <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>38 La. Ann. 301; and in that case the rule is stated correctly, and carries it as far as it can be properly followed. The court there say: \u201cIt was not necessary to have specified in the indictment that the deceased <em>Martha </em>Calhoun was a human being. These are a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Christian and surname which can be legitimately given to a human being only. The offense charged is <em>murder. </em>The use of the term implies the killing of a human being.\u201d (The -word murder is italicized in the original.) As this case states, it is no doubt true that where a defendant is expressly charged with the crime of murder, which necessarily includes the killing of a human being, and the deceased is given an appellation which may be reasonably taken as the name of a person, there the omission of the averment that such person was a human being will not vitiate the indictment; and such would also be the case where any other language was used showing that the deceased was a human being. At .common law the indictment for murder was excessively particular in detail, and contained averments about the deceased applicable only to a human being; but it was absolutely necessary that it should use the word \u201cmurder.\u201d Blackstone says that \u201cin indictments for murder it is necessary to say \u25a0that the party indicted \u2018murdered/ not \u2018killed\u2019 or \u2018slew/ \u25a0which till the late statute was expressed in Latin by the word \u2018murdravit\u2019 \u201d (4 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, 308); and in Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law (vol. 3, p. 737) it is said \u201cany indictment must also, after stating the circumstances, draw the conclusion that <em>so </em>the prisoner, the defendant, feloniously, etc., did kill and <em>murder, </em>the last word being an artificial term which it is requisite to use. \u2019 \u2019 And while much of the prolixity of the common-law pleading may now be omitted, still he who undertakes to frame an indictment in the form of a mere skeleton must see that the skeleton contains all of its necessary structural parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">It is contended by counsel for respondents that the information in this case is a model of brevity. It would, however, have been still one syllable shorter if the crime stated had been \u201cmurder\u201d instead of \u201cfelony\u201d; and the beauty of the brevity would have been but little marred by the addition of the words \u201chuman being,\u201d or \u201cdid kill and murder.\u201d And if brevity be the main <em>desideratum, </em>it would have been further promoted by the simple statement that the defendant \u201ckilled Lee Wing,\u201d\u2014leaving it to be inferred that the killing was before the filing of the indictment, and assuming that all killing is <em>prima facie </em>unlawful and malicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The judgment and order appealed from are reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to the court below to sustain the demurrer to the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Van Dyke, J., Harrison, J., Beatty, C.
