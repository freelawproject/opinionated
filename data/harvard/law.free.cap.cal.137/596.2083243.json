Section 2608 of the Civil Code provides: \u201cA statement in a policy, which imports that it is intended to do or not to do a thing which materially affects the risk, is a warranty that such act or omission shall take place.\u201d In view of this express provision of the statute, it is evident that the questions and answers heretofore quoted from plaintiff\u2019s written application became a part of the bond, or policy of indemnity, and consequently plaintiff is bound by the terms of the contract he made, and having failed to substantially comply with those terms, his failure necessarily discharges the defendant from liability. <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Fidelity and Casualty Co., </em>99 Fed. 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Van Dyke, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
