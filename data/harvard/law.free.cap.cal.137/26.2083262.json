Judgment was rendered in the court below annulling the marriage, and defendant appeals from the judgment. There is no bill of exceptions or statement; none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>of the evidence is brought up here in any form; and the only point made by appellant is, that the complaint does not state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The complaint was filed January 27, 1899, and it is averred therein: \u201cThat on the twenty-third day of January, 1899, the said plaintiff and defendant were married at the city of Santa Eosa, county of Sonoma, state of California, and ever since then have been, and now are, husband and wife;\u201d and the contention of appellant is, that as by this language of the complaint plaintiff acknowledges and asserts a continuous <em>status </em>of marriage for four days, he has thus alleged a marriage that cannot be \u201cannulled,\u201d but must continue until dissolved by the death of one of the parties, or by a decree of divorce, under section 90 of the Civil Code. There is in the briefs of appellant a good deal of rather elaborately constructed logic indulged in, founded upon an asserted distinction between \u201cmarriage\u201d and <em>\u201ca </em>marriage.\u201d The contention seems to be that \u201ca marriage\u201d means only a marriage ceremony,\u2014\u201cthe gateway through which the parties enter the married state.\u201d Therefore, it is contended that the provision in section 82 of the Civil Code, that \u201ca marriage\u201d may be annulled for certain causes, means only that for one of those causes a marriage ceremony may be annulled, but that if a plaintiff admits the existence of \u201cmarriage\u201d without the \u201ca,\u201d he cannot invoke the remedy provided by that section. We see no such distinction in the code. \u201cMarriage\u201d means, generally, a certain existing relation or <em>status, </em>and \u201ca marriage\u201d can mean nothing more than this same <em>status </em>as existing between two particular persons. Section 82 assumes that the married relation exists between the parties to the action, and that this relation may be annulled when the consent of either party was obtained by force, \u201cunless such party after-wards freely cohabited with the other as husband or wife.\u201d It clearly contemplates that such marriage is not absolutely void, but only voidable at the instance of the aggrieved party, who may have it annulled by a decree of court. The section would be idle and vain if it proposed merely to annul a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Henshaw, J., and Temple, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
