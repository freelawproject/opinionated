There was evidence before the court that the defendant, after his release from the hospital, failed to report to his probation officer, was found in his hotel room with a bottle of whiskey, had made inquiries regarding the purchase of a gun, and did not notify his probation officer of a change in his address. This evidence provided a sufficient basis for the action of the court in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation, and we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
