We have recently reaffirmed this court\u2019s long-standing position that the State constitution, N.H. Const, pt. II, art. 74, does not permit the supreme court to advise the legislature on the constitutionality of existing laws. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. 280, 428 A.2d 909 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Under these circumstances, the justices of the supreme court respectfully request that they be excused from answering the questions contained in the resolution as not being within the spirit or letter of the constitutional provision, N.H.
