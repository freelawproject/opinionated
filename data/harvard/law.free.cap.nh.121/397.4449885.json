The defendant had previously, on March 30, 1979, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\">A hearing on two petitions for capias was held on April 16, 1980. The only petition before us on appeal deals with the defendant\u2019s failure to deliver property to the plaintiff in accordance with the divorce decree. The record reveals that the defendant orally moved to dismiss the petition and to continue the hearing \u201cuntil after a determination by the bankruptcy court.\u201d Both motions were taken under advisement and subsequently denied. The order was entered from which the defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Mr. Settle first claims \u201cthat the finding of contempt was made without comparing exhibits or receiving any testimony from any party.\u201d The record discloses that the plaintiff filed a motion for clarification of the April 17, 1980 court order and that on November 19,1980, the master found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201c1. Defendant was permitted the opportunity to offer testimony and evidence at the hearing of April 16, 1980 on the petition for capias for failure to deliver personal property in accordance with the terms of the divorce decree. Defendant chose not to exercise the opportunity, after consultation with counsel but prior to commencement of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">2. Defendant\u2019s counsel stipulated in chambers that the petitions could be decided from the records and pleadings before the court. This stipulation was changed\u2014 after defendant conferred with counsel prior to hearing, insofar as defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that his client did want to take the stand to testify concerning the petition for capias for falsifying a court document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">3. The petition for capias for failure to deliver personal property was decided from the record and pleadings before the court as well as from defendant\u2019s failure to refute or defend against plaintiff\u2019s assertions and allegations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">We hold that the record supports the master\u2019s findings and rulings and that the defendant, having waived the opportunity \u201cto offer testimony and evidence\u201d at the April 16, 1980 hearing, cannot now be heard to complain. <em>See City of Rochester v. Smith, </em>121 N.H. 184, 185, 427 A.2d 53, 54 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The defendant\u2019s second complaint is that the bankruptcy proceeding places him \u201cunder a legal impossibility [to] comply with the terms of the divorce decree\u201d because the trustee in bankruptcy has constructive possession of the personal property and \u201c[t]he issues of ownership . . . are to be litigated . . . [and] testimony will be required for accurate identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument. We rejected a similar underlying claim made by this defendant regarding his real estate assets when we upheld the granting of a motion for summary judgment in <em>Settle v. Keene Savings Bank, </em>120 N.H. 827, 423 A.2d 986 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We have before us an appendix that consists of an order of the bankruptcy judge <em>(Betley, </em>J.) dated March 5, 1981, ruling that the defendant Settle has committed fraud upon the bankruptcy court and his creditors. Although this order confirms the vesting of title to the defendant\u2019s property in the trustee by operation of law at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, <em>see Armand Engineering Co., Inc. v. Adrien A. Labrie, Inc., </em>121 N.H. 107, 111, 427 A.2d 15, 17 (1981), it recognizes the fact that the property is \u201csubject however, to the claims of Cynthia [Settle] Meyer.\u201d Furthermore, this order leaves no doubt in a reasonable person\u2019s mind that neither the defendant nor his new spouse have any title or any possessory interest in any of the defendant\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The bankruptcy court order contains the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cThe court is constrained to observe that here we have a bankrupt, John Alden Settle, Jr. who has meticulously planned, prior to March 30, 1979, how to secrete his assets from his creditors and the trustee in bankruptcy, by arranging for storage facilities for his valuable personal property . . . resorting to the use of an alias . . . , hoping that he could this way elude detection and discovery on this secreted property. The bankrupt claims \u2018irreparable harm by virtue of the court\u2019s ex-parte orders permitting the trustee to collect this secreted property.\u2019 By virtue of these ex-parte orders, the trustee was able to corral this valuable property and avoid \u2018irreparable harm to his creditors.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Needless to say, we also are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s alleged concern for the protection of the trustee\u2019s or creditors\u2019 rights and find that it is simply a sham designed to interfere with the orderly process of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We award the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $300 under our Rule 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
