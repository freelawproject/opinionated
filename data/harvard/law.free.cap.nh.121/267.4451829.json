In order to sustain its burden of proving that the violation occurred on a \u201cpublic way,\u201d <em>see State v. Duranleau, </em>99 N.H. 30, 31, 104 A.2d 519, 520-21 (1954), the State had introduced into evidence a copy of the appropriate commission\u2019s return of the laying out of Route 101-A. On appeal, the defendant contends that the Trial Court <em>(Souter, </em>J.) erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on his claim that the copy of the commission\u2019s return of layout was insufficient to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that the highway was a \u201cpublic way\u201d because it did not show (1) the actual oath taken by the commissioners, <em>see </em>RSA <em>233:4, (2) </em>that they made a personal examination of the location of the highway, see RSA 233:10, (3) that the taking was of a fee simple interest in land, <em>see </em>RSA 236:2, (4) the width of the highway, <em>see </em>RSA 233:11, or (5) that an assessment was made and damages paid or tendered, <em>see </em>RSA 233:12.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"> The return of layout states that the commissioners were \u201cduly sworn.\u201d This is sufficient evidence of compliance with.RSA 233:4 even though it did not include the actual oath taken. The return also gives a detailed description of the layout from which the width of the highway could be determined, and the trial court was correct in presuming compliance with the other statutory requirements for a properly laid-out highway in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <em>Hoban v. Bucklin, </em>88 N.H. 73, 78-79, 184 A. 362, 365 (1936). The return therefore constituted sufficient proof' that Route 101-A was a public way. <em>State v. Michaud, </em>98 N.H. 356, 358, 100 A.2d 899, 901 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The failure of the State to introduce additional evidence on these disputed points does not, as the defendant argues, justify an inference that such evidence could not be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
