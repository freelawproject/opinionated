The defendants, the City of Nashua and its zoning board of adjustment, argue that the court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s request for a ruling that the zoning board\u2019s finding must be held \u201cprima facie lawful and reasonable,\u201d RSA 31:78 (Supp. 1979), constituted reversible error. They also allege that the court erred in not determining the spirit of the zoning ordinance on the basis of the comprehensive plan according to which it was enacted. We disagree with the defendants\u2019 arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">The premises that are the subject of this appeal consist of a two-story building owned by the plaintiffs and located on Main Street in Nashua in a Class A Urban Residence District, as defined in the Nashua zoning ordinance. For approximately fifteen years prior to the request for a variance, Mary Belanger, one of the plaintiffs, has lived in the house and has operated a real estate office on the first floor. Although the zoning ordinance does not permit commercial use of property located in this zone, it does allow this particular use to continue as a non-conforming use because it pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>dates the inception of the ordinance\u2019s prohibition. Nashua, N.H., Rev. Ordinances title 8, ch. 7, \u00a7 604 (1977). In contemplation of a sale of the premises, the plaintiffs, on October 25, 1979, applied to the Nashua Zoning Board of Adjustment for a variance that would allow for the expansion of the non-conforming commercial use throughout the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The zoning board held a hearing on November 27, 1979, at which it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application because the requested use was \u201cnot in the spirit of the ordinance.\u201d After the plaintiffs had been denied a rehearing by the board, they filed an appeal to the superior court under RSA 31:77 (Supp. 1979). The Trial Court <em>{Goode, </em>J.), after a hearing on February 14 and 15, 1980, entered an order in which he denied certain of the city\u2019s requests for findings and vacated the zoning board\u2019s order. His order, from which the defendants appeal, further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cUpon a consideration of all the evidence offered, the Court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities that the order of the Nashua Zoning Board of Adjustment is unreasonable. That order is accordingly vacated and this matter remanded to the City of Nashua for such further proceedings as may be required, not inconsistent with this ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">RSA 31:78 (Supp. 1979) states that \u201cthe burden of proof shall be upon the party seeking to set aside any order or decision of the board of adjustment ... to show that the same is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d The statute further provides that the trial court, in reviewing such a decision or order, must deem all <em>findings </em>of the board of adjustment \u201cprima facie lawful and reasonable.\u201d RSA 31:78 (Supp. 1979). Additionally, the trial court shall not set aside or vacate such orders or decision, \u201cexcept for errors of law, unless the court is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that said order or decision is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.; e.g., Slater v. Planning Board of Town of Rumney, </em>121 N.H. 212, 215, 427 A.2d 511, 513 (1981); <em>Cook v. Town of Sanbornton, </em>118 N.H. 668, 669, 392 A.2d 1201, 1202 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred in not regarding the findings of the zoning board as prima facie lawful and reasonable. They direct our attention to the court\u2019s denial of their request that \u201c[t]he finding by the zoning board that the requested use would not be in the spirit of the ordinance must be held to be prima facie lawful and reasonable.\u201d Although this finding by the court might alone constitute error, when read in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>context of the court\u2019s ultimate finding of the unreasonableness of the zoning board\u2019s decision based on a balancing of the probabilities, and especially in conjunction with its denial of another of the defendants\u2019 requests by which it essentially concluded that the plaintiffs had <em>\u201covercome the statutory presumption of lawfullness and reasonableness of the finding of the zoning board\u201d </em>(emphasis added), we find no error. <em>See Slater v. Planning Board of Town of Rumney supra; Sprague v. Town of Acworth, </em>120 N.H. 641, 644, 419 A.2d 1075, 1076 (1980); <em>Burns v. Bradley, </em>120 N.H. 542, 546-47, 419 A.2d 1069, 1072 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The defendants also had requested a finding that the plaintiffs had the \u201cburden of proving . . . that the zoning board was unreasonable in its finding that the proposed use of the premises violated the spirit of the zoning ordinance.\u201d The court granted this request, \u201cbut only to the extent [the plaintiffs] must show that the order of the Board of Adjustment is unreasonable.\u201d We conclude that the court properly granted this request because the burden of proof that RSA 31:78 (Supp. 1979) imposes on a party appealing a zoning board decision is to show that the <em>order or decision </em>of the board is unreasonable or unlawful, not to show that the <em>findings </em>were unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The defendants next assert that the plaintiffs did not introduce relevant evidence which satisfied their burden of proving that the order of the zoning board was unreasonable. Alternatively, the defendants contend that they, in fact, presented the court with evidence, mainly the comprehensive plan of the city of Nashua, upon which to sustain the zoning board\u2019s decision that the expansion of this non-conforming use was not in the \u201cspirit of the ordinance.\u201d They specifically argue that the spirit of the zoning ordinance must be determined in light of the comprehensive plan from which the ordinance is derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u201c[I]t is \u2018the general policy of zoning to carefully limit the extension and enlargement of nonconforming uses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wunderlich v. Town of Webster, </em>117 N.H. 283, 286, 371 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1977) (quoting <em>Arsenault v. Keene, </em>104 N.H. 356, 359, 187 A.2d 60, 62 (1962)); <em>see </em>6 P. Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls \u00a7 41.03 [3][a] (1978). In discussing the need for communities to develop comprehensive or master plans as guidelines for local growth, we stated that \u201c[t]owns may not refuse to confront the future by building a moat around themselves and pulling up the drawbridge.\u201d <em>Beck v. Town of Raymond, </em>118 N.H. 793, 801, 394 A.2d 847, 852 (1978). <em>See generally </em>Haar, <em>In Accordance With a Comprehensive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Plan, </em>68 Harv. L. Rev. 1154 (1955). While we recognize the desired interrelationship between the establishment of a plan for community development and zoning, we believe that municipalities must also have their zoning ordinances reflect the current character of neighborhoods. The record is replete with evidence that the area in question has, indeed, gone through substantial changes from the time it was originally zoned for single family residential use. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the zoning board of adjustment was unreasonable in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a variance was within the court\u2019s discretion and sufficiently supported by the evidence. That finding must therefore be upheld. <em>Chagnon Lumber Co., Inc. v. DeMulder, </em>121 N.H. 173, 175, 427 A.2d 48, 50 (1981) (citing <em>Kierstead v. Betley Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., </em>118 N.H. 493, 497, 389 A.2d 429, 432 (1978)); <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>115 N.H. 347, 350, 341 A.2d 777, 780 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
