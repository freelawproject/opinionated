In 1978, he developed pain and paresthesia of the median nerve of the hand. After an operation and a healing period, the plaintiff was examined by Dr. David G. Publow, a physician agreed upon by the parties. Dr. Publow determined that the plaintiff had \u201clost 30% of function to the affected right upper extremity.\u201d The parties agreed that the \u201caffected right upper extremity\u201d was the wrist, and submitted the question of the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s award to the New Hampshire Labor Commissioner, Robert M. Duvall. Pursuant to RSA 281:26, I, the commissioner awarded benefits to the plaintiff for a permanent partial loss of use of the hand, not of the arm. The plaintiff then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this court, arguing that the labor commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">A statute that is clear and unambiguous is not subject to interpretation by this court. <em>Dupont v. Chagnon, </em>119 N.H. 792, 794, 408 A.2d 408, 409 (1979); <em>Corson v. Brown Prods., Inc., </em>119 N.H. 20, 23, 397 A.2d 640, 642 (1979). RSA 281:26, I(u) provides that an award for permanent total loss of <em>use </em>of a member will be the same as for <em>actual </em>loss of that member. Subsection (r), dealing with actual loss of an arm by amputation, says that no award for the whole arm may be made unless the arm is amputated at or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>above the elbow. In all other cases, the claimant is only entitled to an award for loss of the hand. Thus, the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute is in accord with its plain meaning, and there is no error in the application of the statute. <em>See Wood v. General Elec. Co., </em>119 N.H. 285, 289, 402 A.2d 155, 158 (1979); <em>Dodier v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>117 N.H. 315, 317, 373 A.2d 341, 342 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-4\">Douglas, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
