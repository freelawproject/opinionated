In passing, however, we note that the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States have expressed divergent views in their individual opinions on the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Supreme Court of the United States in considering a Sixth Amendment question sustained a Florida statute providing for the use of unanimous six-member juries in all but capital cases, holding that the twelve-member jury is not a necessary ingredient of a \u201ctrial by jury.\u201d In <em>Colgrove v. Battin, </em>413 U.S. 149, 159-60 (1973), the Supreme Court of the United States held that a <em>federal district court </em>procedural rule providing for six-member juries in civil cases did not violate the Seventh Amendment\u2019s guarantee of trial by jury in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Since the <em>Williams supra </em>and <em>Colgrove supra </em>decisions, writings of legal scholars with empirical studies, leading to considerable debate regarding the impact of six-member juries, have been legion. For a listing of several of these articles, <em>see Ballew v. Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 231 n.10 (1978). In <em>Ballew supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that a jury of less than six in a criminal trial violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. When Justice Blackmun wrote the majority opinion in <em>Ballew, </em>he had the benefit of the post <em>-Williams </em>data, and he discussed several studies that suggested: \u201cthat progressively smaller juries are less likely to foster effective group deliberation,\u201d and that \u201c[a]t some point, this decline leads to inaccurate fact-finding and incorrect application of the common sense of the community to the facts,\u201d 435 U.S. at 232; \u201cthat the risk of convicting an innocent person . . . rises as the size of the jury diminishes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 234; that \u201c[t]he chance for hung-juries would decline,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 236; and that \u201c[fjurther reduction in size will erect additional barriers to [minority] representation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 237. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>The Jury Size Question in Pennsylvania: Six of One and a Dozen of the Other, </em>53 Temple L. Q. 89, 90 n.5-7 (1980) (discussing studies regarding these problems).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Although Justice Blackmun\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Ballew </em>expressed these concerns in the context of a decision regarding a further reduction of criminal trial juries from six to five, we note that these problems may also arise in the context of reducing the size of juries in civil cases from twelve to six.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Justice Marshall, in a footnote to his dissent in <em>Colgrove supra, </em>noted that \u201cthe Seventh Amendment is one of the few remaining provisions in the Bill of Rights which has not been held to be applicable to the states\u201d through the Fourteenth Amendment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>413 U.S. at 169 n.4. Accordingly, although House bill 698 might pass muster under the federal constitution, the determination of its propriety falls squarely within this State\u2019s power to apply its own constitutional provisions regarding trial by jury. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank of Olathe v. Clark, </em>226 Kan. 619, 622, 602 P.2d 1299, 1302 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"> In 1859, the New Hampshire House of Representatives asked the justices of this court whether the legislature had the power to change the law to provide for petit juries numbering less than twelve. In responding to the House of Representatives this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201cWe regard it as a well settled and unquestioned rule of construction that the language used by the legislature, in the statutes enacted by them, and that used by the people in the great paramount law which controls the legislature as well as the people, is to be always understood and explained <em>in that sense in which it was used at the time when the constitution and the laws were adopted.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\"><em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>41 N.H. 550, 551 (1860). (Emphasis added.) The court examined the meaning of the terms \u201cjury\u201d and \u201ctrial by jury\u201d at the time of the adoption of our constitution, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201c[W]e are of opinion that no body of less than twelve men, though they should be by law denominated a jury, would be a jury within the meaning of the constitution; nor would a trial by such a body, though called a trial by jury, be such, within the meaning of that instrument. <em>We think, therefore, that the legislature have no power so to change the law in relation to juries, as to provide that petit juries may be composed of a less number than twelve, </em>nor to provide that a number of the petit jury, less than the whole number, can render a verdict. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 552 (emphasis added); <em>see Copp v. Henniker, </em>55 N.H. 179, 193 (1875). We reaffirm this decision, believing that the vitality of its conclusion remains today, especially in light of the number of empirical studies that have questioned the impact of the six-member jury on our court system. We therefore answer your question as it pertains to the New Hampshire Constitution, N.H. Const., pt. I, art 20, in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Nothing in this opinion is to be construed as preventing parties by stipulation from obtaining a trial with less than twelve jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>in both civil and criminal cases. We are aware of the existence of RSA 606:8, :9, but these sections have never been before us for our consideration.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-5\">William A.
