The first count alleged a violation of the consumer protection statute, RSA ch. 358-A (Supp. 1979). The second and third counts alleged breaches of express and implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code, RSA ch. 382-A. The fourth count alleged violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312 (1979). At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the Trial Court <em>(Mullavey, </em>J.) granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a non-suit with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 first count. The court denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 other counts but reserved the defendants\u2019 right to renew the motion at the close of the evidence, before the case went to the jury. At the close of the defendants\u2019 case, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining three counts. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In reviewing the plaintiffs\u2019 exception to the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 motions for non-suit and directed verdict, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Foss v. Byrnes Chevrolet, Inc., </em>119 N.H. 808, 809, 408 A.2d 415, 415 (1979); <em>Sargent v. Alton, </em>102 N.H. 476, 478, 160 A.2d 345, 346 (1960). The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence need not be conclusive. <em>Watson v. Company, </em>83 N.H. 200, 205, 140 A. 169, 172 (1928). It is sufficient for the plaintiffs to establish that the evidence presented could support a jury verdict in their favor. <em>See Sargent v. Alton, supra </em>at 478, 160 A.2d at 346; <em>Leonard v. Manchester, </em>96 N.H. 115, 117, 70 A.2d 915, 917 (1950). Accordingly, we review the facts of the case as the plaintiffs presented them.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In May, 1977, the plaintiffs, Gerald and Jana Welch, purchased a new Dodge Monaco station wagon from the defendant Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge, Inc., at a cost of approximately $7,549. The automobile was manufactured by the defendant Chrysler Corporation. Subsequent to the purchase of the station wagon, the plaintiffs experienced numerous difficulties with the vehicle and brought it back to Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge for repairs approximately thirteen times between May, 1977 and October, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">During this six-month period, the automobile required repairs too numerous to list. Accordingly, we mention only the more serious of them. The transmission was first repaired and then replaced. The carburetor was repaired or adjusted several times. The starter-clutch was replaced. A leak in the fuel tank was repaired. The paint finish was repaired on the roof, hood, front fender, quarter panel, and dashboard. Peeling overlay was also repaired. Most of these problems were repaired to the plaintiffs\u2019 satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">A continuing problem with the automobile, however, was a \u201cshimmy\u201d that could be felt when the car was driven. The plaintiffs first noticed this problem on the day they purchased the vehicle. After Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge attempted to fix this problem, it informed the plaintiffs that the tires were causing the problem. The plaintiffs then took the car to a Firestone dealer. The dealer replaced the Firestone 500\u2019s that were on the car with a set of Firestone 721\u2019s. This failed to alleviate the problem and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge continued to insist that the tires were the cause of the \u201cshimmy,\u201d the tire dealer placed another new set of 721\u2019s on the car. When this failed to remedy the problem, the dealer diagnosed the problem as a bent rear axle. Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge then replaced the axle, but although the vibration in the rear ceased, the \u201cshimmy\u201d continued. At some point, Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge replaced the Firestone tires with Goodyear tires, but this also had no effect. Throughout this period, the tires were frequently balanced, and the front end was aligned at least once, in unsuccessful attempts to eliminate the \u201cshimmy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">All of these repairs were performed under the warranty. Consequently, although the cost of repairs totalled approximately $1,012.72, the plaintiffs did not pay anything for them, with the exception of a payment of approximately $20 to the Firestone dealer. It is obvious, of course, that bringing the automobile in for such frequent repairs would cause inconvenience and lead to loss of confidence in the integrity and reliability of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On November 14, 1977, the plaintiffs returned the automobile to Fitzgerald-Hicks Dodge. The plaintiffs returned the keys to the vehicle and, by letter delivered along with the keys, revoked their acceptance and demanded the return of the purchase price. The defendant refused, and the plaintiffs filed this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Because the plaintiffs presented their case in four counts, some of which require different elements of proof, we consider the propriety of the trial court\u2019s actions with respect to each individual count. Counts II and III, however, will be discussed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Count I alleged that the def\u00e9ndants employed an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of RSA 358-A:2 (Supp. 1979) in that they failed to fulfill the promise contained in the warranty to repair all defects occurring in the automobile within the first twelve months or 12,000 miles from the day of sale. The plaintiffs presented no evidence, however, to establish that the defendants acted in bad faith, dishonestly, or in any way attempted to take unfair advantage of them. Indeed, the plaintiffs testified that they were generally satisfied with the service they received. We fail to see how the good faith attempts of the defendants to comply with the terms of a standard warranty can be classified as an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of RSA 358-A:2 (Supp. 1979). There may be circumstances under which failure to comply with a warranty would constitute an unfair or deceptive practice, but this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Counts II and III allege that the defendants breached their express warranty, RSA 382-A:2-313; their implied warranty of merchantability, RSA 382-A:2-314; and their warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, RSA 382-A:2-315. The counts further allege that the breach of these warranties substantially impaired the value of the automobile to the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs were therefore entitled to revoke their acceptance of the vehicle and receive back the purchase price. RSA 382-A:2-608.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">The defendants contend that they complied with their express warranty obligations by correcting the problems with the vehicle as they developed. The defendants concede, however, that problems still existed with the automobile. The defendants specifically acknowledge that the car \u201cshimmied,\u201d although they dispute the severity of the \u201cshimmy\u201d and contend that it is within tolerable limits. Whether a \u201cshimmy\u201d is severe enough to constitute a defect is a matter for the jury. <em>See Foss v. Byrnes Chevrolet, Inc., </em>119 N.H. at 809, 408 A.2d 415. The plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified that the car \u201cshimmied\u201d and that, although many cars had such a \u201cshimmy,\u201d the \u201cshimmy\u201d was a problem and should have been fixed. The plaintiffs also testified that the \u201cshimmy\u201d was unacceptable to them and caused them to lose confidence in the car. There was, therefore, sufficient evidence to enable the jury to find that the defendants breached their warranty to repair defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The defendants also contend that the directed verdicts in their favor were proper because there was no evidence that they breached the warranty of merchantability. Specifically, the defendants assert that there was no evidence that the vehicle would not pass without objection within the automobile industry, or that it was not fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was used, or that it failed to be of average quality. RSA 382-A-.2-314. We disagree. The plaintiffs testified that the vehicle \u201cshimmied\u201d when driven. The plaintiffs\u2019 expert also testified that the car \u201cshimmied\u201d and required repairs. On the basis of this evidence, the jury could have found that the car was not of average quality or fit for the ordinary purpose for which an automobile is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The defendants next argue that the plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. <em>Elliott v. Lachance, </em>109 N.H. 481, 484, 256 A.2d 153, 155 (1969); RSA 382-A:2-315, Uniform Laws Comments; <em>see </em>83 A.L.R.3d 669. The defendants are correct in their assertion that the plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence that the plaintiffs had a particular purpose in purchasing the automobile or that they relied upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>defendants\u2019 expertise in selecting the particular vehicle. Consequently, the trial court properly directed a verdict on this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendants assert that the plaintiffs\u2019 revocation of acceptance was invalid because the evidence would not support a jury finding that the vehicle possessed a significant defect which substantially impaired the value of the vehicle to the plaintiffs. <em>See Asciolla v. Manter Oldsmobile-Pontiac, Inc., </em>117 N.H. 85, 86, 370 A.2d 270, 271 (1977). This position overlooks the testimony that the vehicle still \u201cshimmied\u201d after numerous attempts to repair it and that the \u201cshimmy\u201d existed at the time the plaintiffs revoked their acceptance. It is not necessary that the plaintiffs establish the cause of the defect. <em>See Werner v. Montana, </em>117 N.H. 721, 728, 378 A.2d 1130, 1135 (1977). The plaintiffs need only prove that there was a non-conformity that substantially impaired the value of the motor vehicle to them. Id.; RSA 382-A:2-608. Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that the continuing problem undermined their confidence in the automobile and destroyed its value to them as a family automobile should not be ignored. It is true, as the defendants assert, that the subjective test of impaired value must be evaluated by objective standards. <em>See Asciolla v. Manter Oldsmobile-Pontiac, Inc., supra </em>at 89, 370 A.2d at 273. But the question of whether a defect has substantially impaired the value of the automobile to the plaintiffs is one of fact to be determined by a jury. Furthermore, even if the problem of the \u201cshimmy\u201d were insufficient by itself to justify the plaintiffs\u2019 revocation of acceptance, the jury was free to conclude that the numerous defects in the vehicle justified the plaintiffs\u2019 revocation of acceptance notwithstanding that the defendants had repaired many of them. The jury could find that the series of defects and problems that the plaintiffs experienced with the automobile reasonably destroyed their confidence in the integrity and reliability of the vehicle. <em>See Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., </em>262 N.W.2d 349, 354 (Minn. 1977); <em>Asciolla v. Manter Oldsmobile-Pontiac, Inc., supra </em>at 89, 370 A.2d at 274. When the number of problems with the vehicle becomes so large as to call into question the integrity of the automobile, the value of the vehicle to the buyer may be substantially impaired and the buyer justified in revoking his acceptance even though some of the problems have been repaired or are repairable. <em>See Durfee v. Rod Baxter, Inc., supra </em>at 354-55; <em>Tiger Motor Company v. McMurtry, </em>224 So. 2d 638, 646-47 (Ala. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"> The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs\u2019 revocation of acceptance was untimely and therefore invalid because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>had driven the vehicle for five months and 11,000 miles. While ordinarily this might have a limited persuasiveness, <em>see Sanborn v. Aranosian, </em>119 N.H. 969, 970, 409 A.2d 1352, 1353-54 (1979), we must reject it in this case. Where, as here, the seller\u2019s conduct induces the buyer to delay his revocation of acceptance, the time in which the buyer must revoke is extended. <em>See Gramling v. Baltz, </em>253 Ark. 352, 358, 485 S.W.2d 183, 187-88 (1972); <em>Conte v. Dwan Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 112, 122-23, 374 A.2d 144, 148-49 (1976); <em>Werner v. Montana, </em>117 N.H. 721, 730, 378 A.2d 1130, 1133 (1977). The reasonableness of the delay is a question of fact for the jury. <em>See Frontier Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Trigleth, </em>256 Ark. 101, 104, 505 S.W.2d 516, 517 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"> Count IV alleged that the defendants\u2019 breach of their warranties constituted a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and that the plaintiffs were, therefore, entitled to return the automobile and recover the purchase price and their reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. Under the act, a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a warrantor to comply with any obligation under the act or under a warranty may sue for damages and other legal and equitable relief. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2310(d)(1). The act contains no provisions creating warranties, and the substantive content of warranties is controlled by State law. Furthermore, because the act contains no guidelines concerning the measure of damages and the availability of certain kinds of relief, State law controls on this point as well. <em>See Novosel v. Northway Motorcar Corp., </em>460 F. Supp. 541, 545 (N.D.N.Y. 1978). The act explicitly states, however, that the consumer may recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of his damages. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2310(d)(2). Accordingly, because the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence established a prima facie case under the Uniform Commercial Code, it also established a prima facie case under the federal act. It was error, therefore, for the trial court to direct a verdict for the defendants on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">For the reasons herein stated, we remand this case to the trial court for retrial on counts II, III, and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
