The court approved and incorporated as part of its decree the parties\u2019 stipulations as to custody, support, and property division. Two months later, Donald Mizner filed a petition to bring forward and modify the decree, asserting that his financial circumstances had changed substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">After the divorce, the plaintiff began living with another man who provided her with some financial assistance. The Master <em>(.Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) excluded certain financial records of the plaintiff\u2019s live-in friend from the modification hearing. After the master\u2019s report denying relief to Donald Mizner was approved by <em>Batchelder, </em>J., this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\"> Since the appeal in March 1981, both parties have remarried. In <em>Logan v. Logan, </em>120 N.H. 839, 843, 424 A.2d 403, 405 (1980), we held that the trial court in a modification hearing \u201cshould consider <em>all </em>relevant evidence with regard to the ability of <em>all </em>persons owing a duty to support the child or children.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Under <em>Logan, </em>remarriage affects the parties\u2019 duty to support natural children and stepchildren and should be considered by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 842-43, 424 A.2d at 405. <em>See generally </em>RSA ch. 546-A. Because of the parties\u2019 change in status, we see no purpose in deciding this case in its present posture. Accordingly, we remand for reconsideration and/or a new petition to modify. <em>See Haight v. Petit, </em>121 N.H. 886, 435 A.2d 1132 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b1112-8\">Batchelder, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
