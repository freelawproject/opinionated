Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that RSA 284:15-c does not authorize the town to impose conditions upon its approval of the issuance of licenses to conduct dog race meets within its borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">At the March 10, 1981, annual meeting, the Town of Salem voted on three warrant articles, and the votes thereon were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u201cArticle II. Do you approve the issuance of a license for holding dog race meets in Salem at a multi-element sports and entertainment complex which includes a multi-purpose indoor arena suitable for major league professional ice hockey, basketball, concerts and other large gatherings?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">VOTE: Yes-5,110, NO \u2014 3,193.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">\u201cArticle III. Are you in favor of approving the issuance of a license to conduct dog racing meets in the Town of Salem?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">VOTE: Yes \u2014 1,943, NO \u2014 4,272.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-14\">\u201cArticle IV. To see whether, under RSA 284:15-c, the Town will vote to authorize the issuance of a license to conduct dog race meets in Salem by voting for one of the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-15\">(VOTE FOR ONE)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-16\">A) Do you favor the issuance of a license to hold dog race meets in Salem only upon condition that the licensee shall cause the Boston Bruins Hockey Club of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the National Hockey League to execute a long-term lease to play its home games in an arena to be built in Salem by the end of 1982?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">B) Do you favor the issuance of a license to hold dog race meets in Salem even if the Bruins do not move to Salem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">C) Do you oppose the issuance of a license to hold dog race meets in Salem?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">VOTE: A) Yes-625, NO-263.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">B) Yes \u2014 451, NO \u2014 590.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">C) Yes \u2014 1,015, NO \u2014 193.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The threshold issue in this case is whether a justiciable controversy exists between the parties concerning the validity of Article II of the town warrant. We hold that the facts of this case make declaratory judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> The remedy of declaratory judgment is intended to grant relief from uncertainty concerning the status or legal rights existing between adverse parties. <em>Portsmouth Hospital v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>109 N.H. 53, 56, 242 A.2d 398, 400 (1968). It is intended to permit the resolution of controversies \u201cbefore obligations are repudiated and rights invaded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 242 A.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The adverse claim involved must be \u201cdefinite and concrete touching the legal relations of parties having adverse interests.\u201d <em>Wuelper v. University of N.H., </em>112 N.H. 471, 473-74, 298 A.2d 747, 749 (1972). The action cannot be based on a hypothetical set of facts, <em>id., </em>298 A.2d at 749; <em>Villars v. Portsmouth, </em>100 N.H. 453, 455, 129 A.2d 914, 916 (1957), and it cannot constitute a request for advice as to future cases. <em>Piper v. Meredith, </em>109 N.H. 328, 330, 251 A.2d 328, 329 (1969). \u201cFurthermore the controversy must be of a nature which will permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made through a decree of a conclusive character.\u201d <em>Wuelper v. University of N.H., supra </em>at 474, 298 A.2d at 749. <em>But see Beaudoin v. State, </em>113 N.H. 559, 562, 311 A.2d 310, 313 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">Article II approves the issuance of licenses to conduct dog race meets at \u201cmulti-purpose\u201d entertainment complexes. According to the agreed statement of facts, no application for a license to conduct dog races has been made to the New Hampshire Greyhound Racing Commission, and it is possible that no such application will ever be made. Indeed, according to the parties, the selectmen of the Town of Salem have not yet even certified the results of the vote on Article II to the commission. Thus, in order for the plaintiffs to suffer any harm from the alleged unlawful activity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Town of Salem, a series of events which has not yet transpired must occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"> While the petition raises interesting questions of law, in view of the posture of the case at this time any decision by this court on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim would simply constitute advice as to future cases, based upon a hypothetical set of facts arising out of questions II and IV, a and b. Actions for declaratory judgment should be confined to justiciable controversies of sufficient immediacy and reality as to warrant action by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In the event an application for a license is made in the future, a new petition for declaratory judgment may be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b735-6\">Bois, Brock and Batchelder, JJ., did not sit; Lampron, Ret.
