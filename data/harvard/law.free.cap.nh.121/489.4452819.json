On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>appeal, the defendant alleges that RSA 632-A:2 (Supp. 1979) is unconstitutionally vague, that the indictment is defective, that the court erred in its instructions to the jury and that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We have held that, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside a verdict based on the insufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthis court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, which is entitled to all reasonable inferences that arise from the evidence (citations omitted).\u201d <em>State v. Goodwin, </em>118 N.H. 862, 866, 395 A.2d 1234, 1236 (1978); <em>State v. Berry, </em>117 N.H. 352, 355, 373 A.2d 355, 358 (1977). While conflicting evidence was given at trial by the defendant and the prosecutrix, the jury could have found the following facts. The defendant and his friend, Alvah Goodwin, spent February 1, 1977, \u201cjoyriding\u201d around southern New Hampshire, drinking beer and looking for some girls that they could \u201cpick up.\u201d Late in the afternoon, the pair arrived in Manchester, where they purchased a road map for the purpose of helping them \u201ctrick\u201d a girl into coming over to their car.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">They spotted a seventeen-year-old high school girl walking home from school and the defendant pulled his car up next to her. He asked the girl for directions to Massachusetts and, getting out of the car, spread the map on the hood. Once the girl approached the car, the defendant then shoved the girl, who was kicking and screaming, into the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The victim testified that once in the car she was placed in the middle of the front seat with the defendant on one side and his friend on the other. She started to cry and asked to be taken home. They ignored this request. The defendant drove the car out of Manchester and stopped at a small country store to buy beer and cigarettes. When the defendant left the car, he told his friend not to let the girl go, and the friend then held on to the girl\u2019s right knee and warned her \u201cdon\u2019t go anywhere, because there\u2019s no place to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">When the defendant returned to the car, he drove toward Concord along some isolated back roads where he stopped on two occasions. On one of these occasions, he attempted to sexually assault the girl but her resistance was sufficient to discourage him and he decided to take her to his apartment in Hillsboro.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Once there, the defendant bolted the door, pulled down the shades, told the girl \u201cdon\u2019t try to yell, because no one will hear you,\u201d and ordered her to take her clothes off or else he would take them off for her. Although she continued to protest and requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>that she be taken home, the defendant persisted in his demands that she remove her clothes. Once undressed, the defendant told her that \u201cif you resist, it will hurt more,\u201d and the defendant then proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">The defendant\u2019s version of the episode was quite different from that of the victim. He testified that the girl consented to getting into the car and consented to the act of intercourse. The jury obviously found that much of the testimony given by the defendant at trial was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">We cQnelude that, on all the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, reasonable jurors could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim did not consent either to her confinement or to sexual intercourse and that the defendant was guilty of violations of RSA 632-A:2 V (Supp. 1979) and RSA 633:3. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the convictions due to the insufficiency of the evidence. <em>See State v. Hardy, </em>120 N.H. 552, 554, 419 A.2d 398, 399-400 (1980); <em>accord, State v. Goodwin, </em>118 N.H. 862, 867, 395 A.2d 1234, 1237 (1978); <em>cf. Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 312-13, 324 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The defendant next argues that RSA 632-A:2 V is unconstitutionally vague and therefore violates due process. The statute provides that a person is guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault, a class A felony, if he engages in sexual penetration \u201c[w]hen the victim submits under circumstances <em>involving </em>false imprisonment, kidnapping or extortion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant contends that the use of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d in the statute, in some fashion, renders the statute unconstitutionally ambiguous or vague. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\"> \u201cA criminal statute violates the constitutional requirement of definiteness if it forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>State v. Hewitt, </em>116 N.H. 711, 712, 366 A.2d 487, 488 (1976) (citing <em>Connally v. General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926)); <em>see Rose v. Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 49 (1975). Because the statute challenged here does not affect the exercise of a fundamental right, this is not a case justifying a facial attack. <em>Rose v. Locke, supra </em>at 50 n.3; <em>State v. Hewitt, supra </em>at 713, 366 A.2d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> The issue before us is whether the statute afforded the defendant sufficient warning that the conduct he engaged in was forbidden, <em>see Rose v. Locke, supra </em>at 50, and we therefore consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the statute \u201cin light of the conduct to which it is applied.\u201d <em>State v. Hewitt, supra </em>at 713, 366 A.2d at 489 (citing <em>United States v. National Dairy Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 36 (1963)); <em>State v. Piper, </em>117 N.H. 64, 65, 369 A.2d 199, 200 (1977). In applying the statute to the facts of this case, we are mindful of the fact that a statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because the \u201creviewing court believes [it] could have . . . drafted [the statute] with greater precision.\u201d <em>Rose v. Locke, supra </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged 1961) defines \u201cinvolve\u201d as follows: \u201c5 a: to have within or as part of itself: Contain, Include . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. It is readily apparent that RSA 632-A:2 V (Supp. 1979) forbids a person from engaging in sexual penetration of another \u201c[w]hen the victim submits under circumstances . . . [which include] false imprisonment, kidnapping or extortion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Having reviewed the transcript of the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that RSA 632-A:2 V (Supp. 1979) gave fair warning to the defendant that the conduct with which he was charged, sexual penetration of a victim whom he had kidnapped or falsely imprisoned, was forbidden, and we therefore reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute is void for vagueness. <em>See State v. DeGrenier, </em>120 N.H. 919, 921, 424 A.2d 412, 413 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The defendant next contends that the indictment charging him with aggravated felonious sexual assault, RSA 632-A:2 V (Supp. 1979), should have been quashed because it did not specify the facts or circumstances of the underlying kidnapping or false imprisonment. <em>See State v. Bussiere, </em>118 N.H. 659, 661, 392 A.2d 151, 153 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The indictment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">\u201c[T]hat Francis N. Taylor, Jr. . . . on the 1st day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven at Hillsboro . . . did purposely engage in sexual penetration in the form of sexual intercourse with [the prosecutrix] . . . [that the prosecutrix] did submit under circumstances involving kidnapping, <em>said kidnapping occurring when Francis N. Taylor, Jr., did knowingly confine [the prosecutrix] a person, under his control, with a purpose to terrorize the said </em>[prosecutrix]....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">(Emphasis added.) The language of this indictment is similar to that which we considered in <em>State v. Bussiere, </em>118 N.H. 659, 660-61, 392 A.2d 151, 153 (1978), with the exception that the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>in the italicized portion of the indictment presently before us above did not appear in the <em>Bussiere </em>indictment. In other words, the indictment here goes on to describe the offense of kidnapping in the words of the kidnapping statute, RSA 633:l(c), whereas the indictment in <em>Bussiere </em>did not. Generally, \u201can indictment is sufficient if it uses the words of the proper section of the applicable statute.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Meloon, 119 N.H. 76, 77, 397 A.2d 1041, 1042 (1979) (quoting <em>State v. Panichas, </em>107 N.H. 359, 362, 222 A.2d 211, 213 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The defendant, however, argues that the indictment in this case is insufficient because <em>Bussiere </em>requires that when a person is charged under RSA 632-A:2 V (Supp. 1979), the indictment \u201cmust enumerate the facts establishing the necessary elements of the offense of kidnapping.\u201d <em>State v. Bussiere, supra </em>at 661, 392 A.2d at 153. The facts which the indictment in this case enumerated were that on February 1, 1977, in Hillsboro, the defendant did knowingly confine the victim, a person under his control, with a purpose to terrorize the victim. Under RSA 633:l(c) \u201c[a] person is guilty of kidnapping if he knowingly confines another under his control with a purpose to: .. . (c) [terrorize him . .. .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"> This case is distinguishable from <em>Bussiere </em>because here the necessary elements of the offense of kidnapping were set out in the indictment at issue. The indictment also identified the victim and gave the location and date of the offense. Whether an indictment is sufficient depends on whether \u201cit gives the defendant enough information so that he can prepare for trial,\u201d <em>State v. Meloon, </em>119 N.H. at 77, 397 A.2d at 1042; <em>see State v. Darcy, </em>121 N.H. 220, 223, 427 A.2d 516, 518 (1981), by setting forth \u201call of the necessary elements constituting the offense,\u201d <em>State v. Champagne, </em>119 N.H. 118, 119, 399 A.2d 287, 288 (1979) (citations omitted), and enables the defendant to \u201cplead his conviction or acquittal as a bar to further prosecution for the same offense. . . .\u201d <em>State v. Bussiere, supra </em>at 662, 392 A.2d at 153-54 (quoting 41 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Indictments and Informations </em>\u00a7 93 (1968)). Under this standard, we hold that the indictment in this case is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury were erroneous and insufficient. In making this claim, the defendant points out that the trial court failed to give eight specific jury instructions which he requested. We have held, however, that if the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury adequately states the relevant law and standards to be followed by the jury \u201cthe court has no obligation to use specific language requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>by a party although it is free to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Gorham, </em>120 N.H. 162, 165, 412 A.2d 1017, 1019 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">The defendant\u2019s specific objections to the court\u2019s charge to the jury are that it was inadequate to apprise the jury that the defense of consent applied to both charges and that it failed to adequately explain \u201cthe necessity that the submission to sexual penetration occur at a time when there is actual confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s consent defense, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cNow, to all of these charges, the defense has raised the defense of consent .... The defense must only raise the defense of consent. The State must disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">[A] showing of consent would constitute a complete defense to the crime. Lack of consent may be proved in a variety of ways, including but not limited to an attempt to escape, outcry or offer of resistance, except where the victim is restrained by fear or violence. Although a woman must resist to the extent of her ability, she is not required to risk serious injury which is threatened or feared.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Later, in response to a question from the jury, the court elaborated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201c[T]he consent here has to be one of the victim\u2019s own free will, not submitting because of fear or <em>whatever else </em>that the evidence may show but if you found she submitted with a free will, it amounts to consent....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">(Emphasis added.) The defendant argues also that the insertion of the phrase \u201cwhatever else that the evidence may show ...\u201d could mislead the jury into concluding that \u201csubmission out of fear of being laughed at, or being ridiculed or being late for an appointment . . .\u201d would be sufficient to negate consent. We find no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The trial court clearly instructed the jury that the defense of consent applied to both charges. It also adequately paraphrased our holding in <em>State v. Bass, </em>93 N.H. 172, 176, 37 A.2d 7, 10 (1944), that a \u201cwoman must resist to the extent of her ability . . . but she is not obliged to risk the peril of serious personal injury that may be threatened or that she may fear.\u201d Judged in its totality, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s charge on the issue of consent and the extent of resistance required by the victim regarding the rape charge and the kidnapping charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>With respect to the issue of whether the victim must submit while she is actually kidnapped or falsely imprisoned, the court charged the jury that \u201cthere must be a finding that [the victim] submitted under circumstances involving either kidnapping or false imprisonment.\u201d The defendant argues that this charge was insufficient because the victim may have consented to the false imprisonment or kidnapping at some point before the sexual penetration, thereby negating that element of the crime. It is doubtful that the later consent of a victim to what was initially a kidnapping or false imprisonment would have the effect urged by the defendant. <em>See State v. Humburgs, </em>3 Wash. App. 31, 36, 472 P.2d 416, 419 (1970). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a delayed consent to the abduction without consent to the sexual penetration would require an acquittal on the aggravated felonious sexual assault charge (RSA 632-A:2 V (Supp. 1979)), we consider the court\u2019s instructions on the defense of consent to be adequate to preclude the jury from falling into error. Accordingly, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
