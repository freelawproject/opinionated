For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Pursuant to RSA 273-A:10, the PELRB scheduled an election for October 5, 1979, to determine whether or not the employees of the Manchester Water Works wanted the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) as their bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">On October 2, 1979, the commission mailed a form letter and a two-page question and answer sheet to all of its employees indicating the commission\u2019s opposition to the proposed bargaining unit, AFSCME. Objecting to many of the statements contained in that mailing, AFSCME responded with a letter of its own which it mailed to the employees on October 3, 1979. Because the election was held on October 5, not all of the employees received AFSCME\u2019s letter prior to the election. A majority of the employees elected not to designate AFSCME as their bargaining unit, and AFSCME then filed an unfair labor practice complaint, RSA 273-A:5, with the PELRB. It was, and remains, AFSCME\u2019s contention that the commission\u2019s letter contained several inaccurate statements and violated RSA 273-A:5 1(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Upon hearing, the PELRB found that \u201c[t]he two questions raised by the union as misleading have not been demonstrated to have misled anyone.\u201d The PELRB further concluded that any inaccuracies in the commission\u2019s letter were \u201charmless at worst.\u201d Following the granting of a petition for rehearing, AFSCME presented additional evidence to the board. The PELRB, however, was of the opinion that none of this evidence was new and reaffirmed its original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">On appeal, AFSCME argues that the distribution of the commission\u2019s letter and enclosures constituted an unfair labor practice. Specifically, it alleges a violation of RSA 273-A:5, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">\u201cI. It shall be a prohibited practice for any public employer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">(a) To restrain, coerce or otherwise interfere with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>employees in the exercise of the rights conferred by this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-3\">(b) To dominate or to interfere in the formation or administration of any employee organization;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The statute does not expressly forbid communications between a public employer and its employees concerning matters pertaining to employee organizational efforts. Indeed, the federal counterpart to RSA ch. 273-A specifically authorizes an employer to express \u201cany views, arguments or opinion . . .\u201d on such organizational activities provided that such an \u201cexpression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c). We also must be cognizant of the constitutional provisions that raise the freedom to communicate one\u2019s views to the highest level of protection that can be provided. <em>See State v. Nickerson, </em>120 N.H. 821, 824, 424 A.2d 190, 192 (1980); U.S. CONST, amend. I; N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Against this background, we cannot say that the mailing of the communication itself violated RSA 273-A:5. The mailing did not contain any threats that employees would lose their jobs or be the victims of retaliation by the commissioners. In short, the mere act of communication by an employer with its employees does not result in a per se violation of RSA 273-A.-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\"> Neither are we persuaded that because the communication was mailed on October 2, three days before the scheduled election, an unfair labor practice results. While it is true that some communications can be subjected to reasonable time, place and manner limitations, <em>Heffron v. International Soc\u2019y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., </em>101 S. Ct. 2559, 2563 (1981); <em>see Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, </em>101 S. Ct. 2176, 2186 (1981), the language of RSA 273-A:5 does not provide for any such limitations. Further, AFSCME\u2019s contention that it did not have sufficient time to respond to the commission\u2019s letter by <em>mailing </em>a rebuttal letter is weakened by the PELRB\u2019s observation that \u201cthere was no evidence that personal delivery to employees or other means of communications were not available [to AFSCME] up to and including the day of election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">AFSCME also argues that the PELRB erred in ruling that in order for an employer communication, such as the one involved here, to constitute an unfair labor practice, \u201cit must be established that the statement was illegally applied or intended for illegal reasons.\u201d This, AFSCME contends, requires proof of scienter and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>because RSA ch. 273-A requires no such showing, amounts to an error of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-3\">While RSA 273-A.-5 does not refer to scienter as an element of an unfair labor practice, it does not necessarily follow that the PELRB erred as a matter of law in imposing such a requirement under the circumstances of this case. \u201cWe have . . . consistently recognized that the legislature has vested the PELRB with authority to define the terms of RSA ch. 273-A and to fill in the \u2018interstices.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Cheney, </em>119 N.H. 822, 826, 409 A.2d 775, 777 (1979). Because the particular act alleged here to be an unfair labor practice involved freedom of speech concerns, and the only issue was the accuracy of the communication, not whether it was threatening or intimidating, we cannot say that the PELRB committed an error of law in inquiring into whether the commission knew that certain statements in its communication were inaccurate or false. Moreover, the PELRB found that the alleged inaccuracies were \u201charmless at worst.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"> \u201cOur standard of review for PELRB rulings requires the appealing party to show by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the PELRB\u2019s rulings are unjust or unreasonable, or that the PELRB has made an error of law.\u201d <em>Appeal of Keene State College Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>120 N.H. 32, 38, 411 A.2d 156, 161 (1980) (citations omitted). \u201cAlthough the board\u2019s determinations are not controlling, they are nevertheless persuasive, and are considered to be <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable, and will be upheld unless they constitute a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Cheney, </em>119 N.H. at 826, 409 A.2d at 777. Finding no such abuse, we hold that AFSCME has not met the requisite burden of proof to set aside the PELRB\u2019s decision. <em>See id., </em>409 A.2d at 777; RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b985-6\">King, C.J., and Batchelder, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
