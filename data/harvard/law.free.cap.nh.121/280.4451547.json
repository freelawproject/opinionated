Does RSA 284:15-c authorize the Greyhound Racing Commission to issue a license for dog racing where there has been no unconditional approval given by the voters, in the terms of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u201c2. If the result of the vote in Salem is to impose conditions on the issuance of a dog racing license which can be met only by one applicant, does the vote of the town limit the commission\u2019s authority to consider the granting of a license only to that applicant?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u201c3. Is the greyhound racing commission authorized to issue a license disregarding the conditions purportedly established in the Salem votes?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\"><em>\u201c4. </em>If the greyhound racing commission is not authorized to disregard the conditions established in the Salem votes, which of the conditions attached by the voters must be honored by the commission?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u201cThat the clerk of the House transmit copies of this resolution to the Justices of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The following reply was returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">\n<em>To the Honorable House of Representatives:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">The undersigned justices of the supreme court reply as follows to your request filed in this court on April 1,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">The four questions may be summarized as asking whether, in view of the results of the March 10, 1981 referendum of the Salem voters, the greyhound racing commission has authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>under RSA 284:15-c to issue a license for dog racing at Rockingham Park if the legislature enacts certain unspecified financial incentives.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>116 N.H. 358, 360, 360 A.2d 889, 891 (1976), we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201c[I]t has been the long-established law in this State that the \u2018constitutional provision for advisory opinions . . . does not permit the Supreme Court to advise the Legislature as to the meaning of existing statutes.\u2019 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>102 N.H. 187, 188, 152 A.2d 872, 873 (1959). Similar considerations prevent the supreme court from rendering advisory opinions on the constitutionality of existing laws as distinct from the constitutionality of proposed legislation. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>115 N.H. 222, 223, 337 A.2d 354, 355 (1975); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>109 N.H. 578, 583, 258 A.2d 343, 347 (1969); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 524, 525, 113 A.2d 542, 543 (1955); <em>Opinion of the Court, </em>62 N.H. 704, 705 (1816); <em>see </em>Note, <em>Advisory Opinions on the Constitutionality of Statutes, </em>69 Harv. L. Rev. 1302, 1304 (1956).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The law is also well settled that this court will not answer questions not directly touching the power or duty of the body making the request. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. 557, 558, 66 A.2d 76, 76 (1949); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>67 N.H. 600, 601, 43 A. 1074, 1074 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In our opinion, the questions contained in the resolution conflict with those principles because: (1) they ask for an interpretation of RSA 284:15-c in light of the vote of a local government; (2) they do not seek advice on the constitutionality of proposed legislation; and (3) they concern the authority of the greyhound racing commission rather than the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">For these reasons, the justices of the supreme court respectfully ask to be excused from answering the questions contained in the resolution because they are not within the spirit or letter of the constitutional provision, N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 74. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>119 N.H. 266, 268, 401 A.2d 507, 508 (1979); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>116 N.H. 358, 360, 360 A.2d 889, 891 (1976).</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-9\">William A.
