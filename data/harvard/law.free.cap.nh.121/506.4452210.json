Steinberg, </em>119 N.H. 223, 231, 400 A.2d 1163, 1169 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Defendant Edith Steinberg, wife of Morton Steinberg, filed a claim under RSA 281:22 for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for herself and her minor children as a result of her husband\u2019s death from a \u201cmassive heart attack\u201d on April 11, 1974, while employed by plaintiff New Hampshire Supply Company, Inc. The deputy labor commissioner found that the decedent\u2019s employment caused his heart attack and awarded compensation for his death in accordance with the above statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The plaintiff employer and its insurer appealed to the superior court. At trial, Mrs. Steinberg contended, and the trial court found, that coupled with the deceased\u2019s regular duties as operations manager of a plumbing warehouse business, he had been involved in intensive merger negotiations for nine or ten months before his heart attack, working six to seven days a week with much daily overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">She argued that these work-related conditions, together with the pressure resulting from the imposition of deadlines, intensive negotiations, and other factors, precipitated and thus caused, or at least contributed to, her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The trial court found that there \u201cis a substantial amount of conflicting expert medical testimony as to the relationship between the deceased\u2019s employment and the cause of his death .... Notwithstanding the foregoing, the medical experts [agree that] . . . prior to the deceased\u2019s death, he had a long history of obesity, smoking, elevated blood pressure and a significantly elevated cholesterol count.\u201d The court also found that the deceased\u2019s father had died of a heart attack and that the deceased\u2019s mother had had three heart attacks by the age of sixty-five. It further found that, \u201c[although not decisive in and of itself . . . there was no single, sudden event or work-related occurrence that triggered the myocardiac infarction suffered by the deceased while working at his desk on April 3, 1974.\u201d The court concluded that Mr. Stein-berg\u2019s death was not causally related or attributable to his employment, but that his death \u201cwas the result of an underlying heart disease which was, in the circumstances and on the facts presented, not work-related.\u201d Accordingly, the court decreed that the deceased\u2019s dependents were not entitled to compensation benefits. Mrs. Steinberg appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On that first appeal, we sustained Mrs. Steinberg\u2019s exceptions. In doing so, we found conflicting medical testimony on whether work-connected overexertion and sustained psychological stress can cause a heart attack. We stated, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cIt is this court\u2019s responsibility to interpret and apply the law as it currently exists. Therefore, we reject the position that work-connected overexertion and sustained psychological stress can <em>never </em>provide the medical causal nexus for compensable myocardial infarctions, and a single sudden precipitating event is not a legal requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>New Hampshire Supply Co. v. Steinberg, </em>119 N.H. at 230, 400 A.2d at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">When this case was first before us, we set out the legal causation test to be used to ascertain whether a claimant has proven \u201cthat the work-related stresses were a legal causal factor in the heart attack which ensued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The actual test for legal causation varies depending upon whether there is a prior weakness or disease in the heart of the individual. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 400 A.2d at 1168. This analysis \u201ctakes into account the \u2018personal risks\u2019 contributed by the worker and the \u2018employment risks\u2019 present in his work.\u201d Note, <em>Heart Injuries Under Workers\u2019 Compensation: Medical and Legal Considerations, </em>14 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 1365, 1389 (1981). We also emphasized that \u201c[i]n addition to legal causation, that is, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>stress was work-connected, the claimants must also prove as a fact medical causation.\u201d <em>New Hampshire Supply Co. v. Steinberg, </em>119 N.H. at 231, 400 A.2d at 1168; <em>see Modern Transfer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd., </em>408 A.2d 900 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">At the hearing on remand, the court invited and heard arguments by counsel on their positions pertaining to the remand. Upon reconsidering the evidence and the surrounding circumstances which led to Steinberg\u2019s death, the court reaffirmed its conclusion \u201cthat the claimants did not carry the required burden of establishing legal causation.\u201d Rather, the court stated, \u201cthe attack was more probably than otherwise the result of an expected progression, given the deceased\u2019s overall medical condition and state of development.\u201d With respect to medical causation, the court reiterated its prior finding \u201cthat Mr. Steinberg\u2019s death was the result of an underlying heart disease which was, in the circumstances and on the facts presented, not work-related.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court reaffirmed the result reached in its prior decree, and defendant Steinberg appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u201cThe compensability of heart attacks ... [is a] most. . . troublesome problem in workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d Larson, <em>The \u201cHeart Cases\u201d in Workmen\u2019s Compensation: An Analysis and Suggested Solutions, </em>65 Mich. L. Rev. 441, 441 (1967); <em>see Jackson v. Emile J. Legere, Inc., </em>110 N.H. 252, 255-56, 265 A.2d 18, 20-21 (1970) (Kenison, C.J., concurring specially). \u201cThe adjudication of claims for heart injuries under worker\u2019s compensation laws is difficult because of the progressive nature of coronary heart disease and the ambiguous relationship of emotional stress and physical exertion to the development and aggravation of coronary heart disease.\u201d Note, <em>Heart Injuries Under Workers\u2019 Compensation: Medical and Legal Considerations, </em>14 SUFFOLK U. L. Rev. at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> In this case there was conflicting evidence as to whether the stress of the decedent\u2019s employment was the medical and legal causation of the deceased\u2019s heart attack. It is well settled that the weighing of the testimony and the assessment of its credibility was solely within the province of the trial court. <em>Ballou v. Ballou, </em>118 N.H. 463, 465-66, 387 A.2d 1169, 1170 (1978); <em>see Town of Croydon v. Current Use Advisory Board, </em>121 N.H. 442, 446, 431 A.2d 126, 129 (1981). Furthermore, when, as in this case, there is competent medical evidence to support a determination that the decedent\u2019s employment activities were not causally related to his heart attack and resulting death, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court even though contrary testimony received would have supported a different result. <em>Modern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Transfer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd., </em>408 A.2d at 902 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">We have examined the record of the original hearing and that of the hearing on remand, including the exhibits and depositions, in the light of our opinion remanding the matter to the trial court. On remand, the trial court stated that it was going to review the defendant\u2019s claim in accordance with the new rule of law enunciated in <em>New Hampshire Supply Co. v. Steinberg, </em>119 N.H. 223, 400 A.2d 1163 (1979), and our review of the record indicates that the court did so. Because there is evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the decedent\u2019s heart attack was not caused by or attributable to work-connected stress but rather was the result of an underlying heart disease, that finding must stand. <em>See Automated Housing Corp. v. First Equity Associates, Inc., </em>121 N.H. 177, 180, 428 A.2d 886, 888 (1981); <em>Duby v. Osgood, </em>120 N.H. 356, 357, 415 A.2d 326, 326 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We therefore uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the claimants are not entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits as the result of the death of Morton Steinberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
