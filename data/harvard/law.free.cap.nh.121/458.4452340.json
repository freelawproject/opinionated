We recently addressed the latter issue in <em>Rullo v. Rullo, </em>121 N.H. 299, 428 A.2d 1245 (1981), and therefore need address it only briefly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The facts underlying the present case are straightforward and not contested. After a jury trial, James M. Coyne was convicted of reckless manslaughter (RSA 630:2 1(b) (Supp. 1979)) in the death of Clifford P. Germain, III, the plaintiff\u2019s son. Coyne did not appeal. Gwendolyn Mitchell, as administratrix of her son\u2019s estate, had previously commenced an action against Coyne for the wrongful death of Germain. When Aetna Life and Casualty Insurance Company, the homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier for Coyne\u2019s parents, denied coverage, the plaintiff filed a petition for declaratory judgment (RSA 491:22) to determine whether the policy provided coverage. The insurance company, while admitting that James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Coyne was an insured under its policy, claimed that Coyne\u2019s act was intentional within the meaning of an expressed exclusion contained in its policy. It contended that Coyne\u2019s criminal conviction for reckless manslaughter was determinative of the issue of intent, and that the estate was therefore collaterally estopped from relitigating that issue. The Trial Court <em>{Goode, </em>J.) granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the plaintiff appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It is the insurer\u2019s contention that because its insured, James Coyne, was a party to the criminal action he cannot now claim that his acts were negligent and seek liability coverage under the policy. It also asserts that the plaintiff cannot obtain the benefits of the policy through the insured. This claim is readily disposed of by reference to <em>Rullo v. Rullo supra, </em>in which we held that an insurance company cannot use the criminal conviction of its insured to collaterally estop a third party from claiming that the insured\u2019s acts were negligent. \u201c[A] criminal conviction ... is [not] a bar to ... a subsequent civil proceeding.\u201d 121 N.H. at 300, 428 A.2d at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the defendant has interjected certain factual issues within an amended answer to the plaintiff\u2019s petition, and that this entitles the plaintiff to reassert her right to have a jury determine those factual issues. We do not have all of the pleadings which have been filed in this proceeding before us. We cannot therefore determine the merit of this claim. Upon remand, the trial court will determine whether the defendant raised factual issues in its amended answer, which the court allowed, that would justify a reversal of the court\u2019s earlier determination that the plaintiff was not entitled to a jury trial because the defendant had admitted all issues of fact in its original answer. <em>Lucas v. Cate, </em>99 N.H. 134, 106 A.2d 200 (1954); <em>see American Employers Ins. Co. v. Liberi, </em>101 N.H. 480, 147 A.2d 306 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
