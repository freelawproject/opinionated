Were the provisions of ballot question 3 effective in removing the references to Article 99 in the amendments to Article 100 adopted by ballot questions 4 and 5?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u201c2. As Article 100 was amended in 3 different ballot questions on November 4, 1980, how does Article 100 now read?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u201cAnd Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of State be directed to transmit 6 attested copies of this Resolution to the Clerk of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The following reply was returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">\n<em>To the Honorable Governor and Council:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">The undersigned justices of the supreme court reply as follows to your request filed in this court on April 24, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">The first question presented asks us to determine whether ballot question 3 was effective in removing the references to Article 99 in the amendments to Article 100 adopted by ballot questions 4 and 5. We answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">In answering the question presented we are guided by the premise that \u201c \u2018[e]very reasonable presumption both of law and fact is to be indulged in favor of the validity of an amendment to the Constitution . . . after its ratification by the people,\u2019 . . . and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>unconstitutionality should not be declared except upon \u2018inescapable grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N.H. <em>541, 543, </em>133 A.2d 790, 792 (1957) (citations omitted); <em>see Gerber v. King, </em>107 N.H. 495, 499, 225 A.2d 620, 623 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">Ballot question 3 is based on a resolution of the Constitutional Convention of 1974, and ballot questions 4 and 5 are derived from resolutions of the House of Representatives, with the Senate concurring. Ballot question 3 called for the repeal of article 99 of part second of the constitution and provided for the insertion in article 100 of the article 99 requirement of a two-thirds vote of the people for approval of constitutional amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u201cRepealing statutes are subject to the general rules of statutory construction applicable to all legislative enactments. Thus, in determining whether or not a repeal has been effectuated, . . . the legislative history of the act, and the nature of the defect sought to be remedied by its enactment are . . . important factors to be considered by the courts.\u201d 1A C. Sands, SUTHERLAND STATUTORY Construction \u00a7 23.06 (3d ed. rev. 1972). These factors are also useful in inquiring into the validity of constitutional amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In explaining resolution 49, which included the wording of ballot question 3, to the 1974 Constitutional Convention, Delegate Tucker stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cThe only pertinent provision of Article 99 is that portion that deals with amending by a two-thirds vote. What we would do is simply add to Article 100, section (c), the fact that an amendment would have to be approved \u2018by two-thirds of the qualified voters present and voting on the subject in the towns, wards and unincorporated places.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Journal of Constitutional Convention 199 (June 12, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">By amendment adopted by the voters in 1964, article 100 was amended generally to include much of the procedure for adopting amendments to the Constitution which until that time had been in article 99. The requirement that all amendments to the Constitution must be approved by two-thirds of the qualified voters present and voting on the subject, however, remained in article 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">We agree that the two-thirds majority vote provision was the only \u201cpertinent\u201d one remaining in article 99, because the right of the people to have submitted to them the question of calling for a constitutional convention was already incorporated in article 100. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>See </em>Journal of Constitutional Convention 108-118 (June 2, 1964). Accordingly, we conclude that ballot question 3 repealed article 99 and that the references to article 99 in ballot questions 4 and 5 must be considered to have related to the means of approving constitutional amendments already contained in article 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">Incorporating the provisions approved by the electorate in 1980 in questions 3, 4 and 5, article 100 now reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">\u201c[Art.] 100. [Alternate Methods of Proposing Amendments.] Amendments to this constitution may be proposed by the general court or by a constitutional convention selected as herein provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(a) The senate and house of representatives, voting separately, may propose amendments by a three-fifths vote of the entire membership of each house at any session.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">(b) The general court, by an affirmative vote of a majority of all members of both houses voting separately, may at any time submit the question \u2018Shall there be a convention to amend or revise the constitution?\u2019 to the qualified voters of the state. If the question of holding a convention is not submitted to the people at some time during any period of ten years, it shall be submitted by the secretary of state at the general election in the tenth year following the last submission. If a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question of holding a convention approves it, delegates shall be chosen at the next regular general election, or at such earlier time as the legislature may provide, in the same manner and proportion as the representatives to the general court are chosen. The delegates so chosen shall convene at such time as the legislature may direct and may recess from time to time and make such rules for the conduct of their convention as they may determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(c) The constitutional convention may propose amendments by a three-fifths vote of the entire membership of the convention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Each constitutional amendment proposed by the general court or by a constitutional convention shall be submitted to the voters by written ballot at the next biennial November election and shall become a part of the Constitution only after approval by two-thirds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>qualified voters present and voting on the subject in the towns, wards, and unincorporated places.\u201d</blockquote>\n<judges id=\"b472-5\">William A.
