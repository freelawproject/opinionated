Apart from expenditures which a candidate could make on his own behalf from his personal assets, the practical effect of a limitation upon the amount of contributions a candidate for public office can accept is to place a limit upon the amount of money that he can spend in pursuit of that office. Such a restriction would clearly affect potential contributors\u2019 rights of freedom of speech and association and a candidate\u2019s ability to engage in the expression of his political views, particularly his access to paid political advertising. Because Senate Bill No. 29, if enacted, would have a substantial effect on the ability of both citizens and candidates to express their political views and associate with one another, the Bill raises serious concerns under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, <em>see Buckley v. </em>Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 54-59 (1976) (per curiam), and under part 1, article 32 of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">In <em>Buckley v. Valeo supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the rights secured under the First Amendment forbid Congress from enacting and enforcing laws that unconditionally limit the amount a candidate for federal office can spend in his election campaign. Because the United States Supreme Court has also held that the basic constitutional protections guaranteed by the First Amendment are, under the Fourteenth Amendment, applicable to the States whenever they exercise their powers of supervision over the electoral process, <em>Communist Party of Indiana v. Whitcomb, </em>414 U.S. 441, 449 (1974), there can be no doubt that <em>Buckley </em>applies with equal force to the States, and is therefore binding upon this court. <em>See Communist Party of Indiana v. Whit-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>comb, </em>414 U.S. at 449-50. Further, the New Hampshire Constitution guarantees the same right to free speech and association. N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 32; <em>see State v. Nickerson, </em>120 N.H. 821, 826, 424 A.2d 190, 193-94(1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"> Senate Bill 29 would limit the amount of contributions a candidate for state or local office may accept, while <em>Buckley </em>forbids placing a limitation upon campaign spending. In strictly scrutinizing the provisions of the proposed statute, it is our opinion that the difference between an unconditional limitation on the amount of contributions a candidate may accept and a similar limitation on the amount a candidate may spend is one of form, not of substance. In either case, it is our opinion that both the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and part I, article 32 of the New Hampshire Constitution forbid such an encroachment upon free expression and association. \u201cThe First Amendment\u2019s protection against governmentaLabridgment of free expression cannot properly be made to depend on a persmTsTfinaircial ability to engage in public discussi.on.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. at 49. An unconditional restriction on the totai amount of contributions that a candidate can-accept impermissibly limits a, candidate\u2019s \u201cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\u201d Despite its laudable purpose to control escalating campaign costs, it cannot survive under the State and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We therefore answer both of the questions transmitted \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-7\">William A.
