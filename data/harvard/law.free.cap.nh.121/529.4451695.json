Is the partial public campaign financing system for candidates for governor and governor\u2019s council in House Bill 847 which sets a spending ceiling only for candidates who accept public financing constitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\u201c2. Is the proposed amendment to House Bill 847 which replaces the bill\u2019s public campaign financing system with a formula for limiting campaign expenditures by candidates based upon a dollar amount multiplied by the number of voters qualified to vote for the office the candidate seeks at the last preceding biennial election constitutional, and does it resolve any constitutional problems which may be raised by House Bill 847 in its present form?</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">\u201cThat the clerk of the House transmit 7 copies of this resolution to the Justices of the Supreme Court along with an equal number of copies of HB 847 and the proposed amendment to HB 847.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">The following answer was returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">\n<em>To the Honorable House of Representatives:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">The questions herein presented are similar to those transmitted by the Honorable Senate and answered in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. 434, 430 A.2d 191 (1981). The first question is whether a campaign spending ceiling is constitutional if applied only to those candidates for public office who accept public financing. The United States Supreme Court has held that similar limitations, voluntarily assumed by those who wish to avail themselves of the benefits of public financing of their political campaigns, violate no provision of the federal constitution. <em>See Buckley v. Valeo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>424 U.S. 1, 95-99 (1976). Unlike proposed Senate bill No. 29, <em>see Opinion of the Justices supra, </em>House bill No. 847 limits campaign spending only when a candidate voluntarily chooses to accept public financing. It is also our opinion that the imposition of a spending ceiling on candidates for public office as a condition to making public funds available to them would not violate N.H. Const, pt. 1, art. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The proposed amendment to House bill 847 that would eliminate the public financing feature of the bill and leave a bill which would impose an absolute limit on the campaign spending of all candidates, however, cannot survive in light of free speech guarantees under both the State and federal constitutions. U.S. Const. amend. I; N.H. Const, pt. 1, art. 32; <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. at 54, 59; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>121 N.H. 434, 430 A.2d 191 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We therefore answer question number 1 in the affirmative and question number 2 in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-6\">William A.
