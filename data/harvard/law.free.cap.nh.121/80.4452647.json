Karin M. ... </em>(a minor; Henry . . . , parent). The juvenile was placed in a foster home and eventually on February 26, 1980, the Town of Lee was designated to be the legally responsible unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">On February 28, 1980, counsel for the plaintiff, Town of Lee, filed an appeal in the superior court based primarily on \u00e1 claim of imposition of liability on the town without notice or hearing. A confused and inadequate record reveals that somehow in the course of the appeal the district court was designated the named party defendant with orders of notice and service joining the juvenile\u2019s parents as parties to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">After a hearing, the Superior Court <em>{Randall, </em>J.), on a \u201cpetition to stay order of district court and enjoin liability,\u201d ruled \u201c[t]hat the only issue to be heard in this [superior] court is who is ultimately liable for expenses incurred.\u201d Recognizing that \u201cyou [the district court] shouldn\u2019t be a party, . . . ,\u201d it granted a motion to dismiss filed by counsel for the Durham District Court. The plaintiff Town of Lee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>We affirm. <em>Cf. Melton v.
