We hold that under such circumstances neither the birth certificate nor the testimony is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The defendant, Robert Ebelt, was charged with felonious sexual assault in violation of RSA 632-A:3 (Supp. 1979) (statutory rape). The indictment alleged four counts of sexual penetration of \u201cDeborah Ebelt,\u201d a child under sixteen years of age, during July 1978. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the birth certificate of \u201cDeborah Lynn Ebelt\u201d and any testimony regarding the prosecutrix\u2019s age based on that document. The grounds for the defendant\u2019s motion were that the State had offered no proof that the prosecutrix was.the person named in the birth certificate and that the prosecutrix had no knowledge of her age other than from that document. The Superior Court <em>(Johnson, </em>J.) denied the defendant\u2019s motion. At trial, the only evidence the State offered of the prosecutrix\u2019s age was the birth certificate and the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony. The jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\"> The defendant argues that the birth certificate was inadmissible as a matter of law because it was irrelevant. We agree. Relevant evidence is evidence that tends \u201cto establish a fact of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>Welch v. Bergeron, </em>115 N.H. 179, 182, 337 A.2d 341, 343 (1975). One of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>at issue in this case is the age of the prosecutrix. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:3 (Supp. 1979). The State correctly points out that a birth certificate is prima facie evidence of a date of birth. <em>Groulx v. Groulx, </em>98 N.H. 481, 486, 103 A.2d 188, 191 (1954). Nonetheless, not just any birth certificate is relevant, <em>see People v. Hernandez, </em>18 Cal. App. 3d 651, 658, 96 Cal. Rptr. 71, 74-75 (1971); a birth certificate of Jane Smith would not tend to prove the prosecutrix\u2019s date of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">For a birth certificate to be admissible, there must be evidence to establish the identity of the person named in the certificate. <em>See State v. Winkley, </em>14 N.H. 480, 494 (1843); <em>State v. Wallace, </em>9 N.H. 515, 516-17 (1838); <em>cf. </em>7 J. Wigmore, A Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 2129 (3d ed. 1940). Ordinarily the identity of a witness is not a problem, but the facts of this case raise a question of whether the prosecutrix is indeed the person named in the birth certificate. In 1969 the prosecutrix was abandoned by a couple named \u201cAldrich.\u201d At that time she was called \u201cDebbie Ebert.\u201d The New Hampshire Division of Welfare became the child\u2019s legal guardian, but it had no information on her background prior to that time. In 1974 a division of welfare employee discovered the birth certificate of a \u201cDeborah Lynn Ebelt\u201d (not Ebert) and associated it with the prosecutrix. There is no evidence in the record to indicate why the division of welfare concluded that the birth certificate was the prosecutrix\u2019s. We assume that it was based in part on the similarity of names and on the fact that the child celebrated her birthday on March 25 and the date of birth given in the certificate was March 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">This court has held that, when a person\u2019s identity is questioned, sameness of name is insufficient evidence of identity, even when the name is unusual. <em>Mooers v. Bunker, </em>29 N.H. 420, 431-32 (1854); <em>see </em>9 J. Wigmore, A Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 2529 (3d ed. 1940). We have also noted that, when extradition papers contain only a person\u2019s name and date of birth, he has the right to require the State to establish that he is the person named in the requisition papers. <em>Reeves v. Cox, </em>118 N.H. 271, 274, 385 A.2d 847, 850 (1978). Since the same name and birth date are inadequate evidence of identity, similarity of name and birth date are manifestly not enough. The State had the burden of establishing the prosecutrix\u2019s identity. <em>See State v. Ward, </em>118 N.H. 874, 878, 395 A.2d 511, 513 (1978). Absent proof that \u201cDebbie Ebert\u201d and \u201cDeborah Lynn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Ebelt\u201d are one and the same person, the birth certificate was inadmissible. <em>Cf. State v. Reenstierna, </em>101 N.H. 286, 288, 140 A.2d 572, 574 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"> We also find merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony as to her age, which was based solely upon the birth certificate, was inadmissible. Technically, a person\u2019s testimony as to his own age is hearsay because he cannot have personal knowledge of the event. 3 Criminal Defense Techniques \u00a7 53.03 [3] (M. Eisenstein &amp; J. Dunleavy ed. 1980); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 667(5) (rev. ed. 1979). Such testimony, however, is commonly accepted by courts. <em>Id. </em>The State rightfully notes that the court has held that the prosecutrix in a statutory rape case may testify as to her own age. <em>State v. Tetrault, </em>78 N.H. 14, 14-15, 95 A. 669, 670 (1915). That case is inapposite. It indicates that a witness is permitted to testify as to her own age because there is usually a practical basis for such knowledge. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 95 A. at 670; Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 667(5). In that case, the prosecutrix learned of her age from her adoptive parents, who had been told the date by the child\u2019s aunt. <em>State v. Tetrault supra. </em>In those circumstances the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony as to her age possessed the characteristics of trustworthiness and reliability that justified its admission as an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See State v. Russell, </em>114 N.H. 224-26, 317 A.2d 781, 782 (1974). In this case, there is no such sound basis for the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony. Under oath, she stated that the origin of her knowledge of her age was the birth certificate; before she saw that document she went by another name and celebrated a different birthday. In fact, there is evidence that she originally believed herself to be a year older than the age shown by the birth certificate. Because there is no corroboration of the prosecutrix\u2019s age, her testimony is inadmissible. <em>Cf. People v. Tucker, </em>363 N.Y.S.2d 180, 181 (App. Div. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> The facts of this case present a close question as to whether the prosecutrix was fifteen years old at the time of the alleged acts, or was sixteen. If she was sixteen, then the defendant\u2019s conduct, although reproachable, does not fall within the statutory proscription. RSA 632-A:3 (Supp. 1979). The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime charged. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970); <em>State v. Adelson, </em>118 N.H. 484, 486, 389 A.2d 1382, 1384 (1978). Because the birth certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony of her age were improperly admitted, there is insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Cf. Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315 (1979); <em>State v. Kiluk, </em>120 N.H. 1, 4, 410 A.2d 648, 650 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-5\">BoiS, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
