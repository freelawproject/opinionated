Knabe, Jr., who were engaged in extensive business enterprises, arranged with the appellant, the Union Trust Company of New Jersey, a corporation doing business in Jersey City, on the 20th of November, 1908, for the loan of $50,000\".00 on the note of William Knabe, secured by collateral, with the understanding that they might secure an additional loan of $50,000.00, and on the 31st of December, 1908, the Trust Company made a further loan of $50,000.00 on a demand note of William Knabe, secured by the collateral. These notes were paid, or marked paid, on the books of the Trust Co. on the 13th of July, 1909, and on the same day the Trust Company made a loan of $80,000.00 on the demand note of Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., of that date, secured by a bond of the United Surety Company of Baltimore, guaranteeing the payment of a part of said sum, and by other collateral. A number of payments were made on the $80,000.00 note, reducing the amount due thereon on March the 1st, 1910, to $65,000.00. In the meantime some question was raised as to the validity of the bond of the Surety Company, and on the 1st of March, 1910, Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., gave the Trust Company a new note for $65,-000.00 (the amount then due on the $80,000.00 note), secured by collateral and endorsed by his wife and William Knabe, guaranteeing the payment thereof, and on the same day the note of $80,000.00 was marked paid on the books of the Trust Company and the bond of the Surety Company was surrendered. Payments were made on the $65,000.00 note until June 1st, 1910, when, the balance due was $29,191.65. Demand was made upon William Knabe and Ernest J. Knabe', Jr., for the payment of this balance, and on or about the 12th of January, 1911, Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., went to the office of the Trust Company for- the purpose of securing further time. On the 24th of January, 1911, the president of the Trust Company wrote N.

J. Knabe this afternoon; he is now having his books balanced.by the Baltimore Auditing Company. Until this is completed he will be unable to discuss settlements with any of his creditors. He has lost entirely, if not all, of his assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>As to you disposing of the remaining collateral in your hands; under our practice, it will he necessary for you to do so and credit the net proceeds of your sale, so that your suit will he for the net amount due, together with interest. Mr. Knabe, however, makes the request that you withhold the sale- of the collateral until he has submitted a statement prepared by the auditor; this of course is a matter in your discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Mrs. Knabe is the daughter of Gustave Schlens, president of the William Wilkens Company, and is reputed to be worth $5,000,000. Mrs. Knabe\u2019s interest in her mother\u2019s estate is approximately valued at $200,-000. This we will ascertain more in detail from our examination tomorrow. At this time Mr. Knabe has no available assets from which you could collect your claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Yery truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">( Signed) N.

Also secure the endorsement of Mr. Ernest J. Knabe and his brother, William Knabe, to the new note.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This suggestion is made with a view of Mrs. Knabe becoming the direct obligor on the loan, we agreeing under the circumstances to defer any action on the collateral without prejudice to ourselves until, we will say, the first of June. If you think this is a satisfactory arrangement and does not prejudice us in any way, we would suggest that you endeavor to consummate it, you at the same time maintaining this claim under your jurisdiction and watching developments in connection with the Knabe affair, to the end that our interests may be fully protected during the time that we are carrying the loan on our books.

This new note is made by William Knahe to the order of the Union Trust Company of Eew Jersey and guaranteed by Eellie Knabe and Ernest J. Knahe, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">The old note which we hold was made by Ernest J. Knahe to our order. The authority to take up the old note, which was a contract by Ernest J. Knabe with us, is signed by William Knabe, and we could, therefore, we feel, use the new note, contract of William Knabe with us, were it not for the fact that the authority to do so is signed William Knahe by Ernest J. Knabe, Jr. We have no power of attorney covering such a use of William Knabe\u2019s name by Ernest Knahe on file with us.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>It will, therefore, be necessary to have \u00e1 power of attorney dated January 31, 1911, from William Knabe to Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., covering the situation, or else have a new note like the one you just sent us executed in which Ernest J. Knabe is maker and Nellie and William Knabe are guarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Tours very truly,</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Gr. E. Hendrickson, Atty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">On the 11th of March, 1911, counsel for William Knabe and Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., at the request of Mr. Gill, sent him the power of attorney from William Knabe to Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., referred to in the letter of Mr. Hendrickson, and Mr. Gill forwarded it to the Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Charles H. Ferling, the trust clerk of the Trust Company, states that he was the custodian of all notes upon which the Trust Company made loans; that the note for $30,239.23 was not delivered to him until the 21st of March, 1911; that up to that date he had in his possession the old note for $65,-000.00; that on the 21st of March, 1911, the note for $30,-</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">239.23 was handed to him by one of the officers of the Trust Company, and that he put the loan through and applied the proceeds of said note to the payment of the balance due on the note of $65,000.00; that the loan on the note of $30,-</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">239.23 was made on the 21st of March, 1911, and that on that day he surrendered possession of the note of $65,000.00; that usually the notes are delivered to him as soon as they are passed by the officers or executive committee; that he does not know where the note for $30,239.23 was prior to March 21st, 1911, but that it was not entered on the books of the Trust Company or \u201cused in payment of the balance of the other note until March the 21st\u2019\u2019; that no money was loaned on said note, and no money was transferred in any way by the book-keeper or any other way until\u201d March 21st, 1911. Mr. Ludlow, the president of the Trust Company, testified in his examination in chief: \u201cWhen we received the note representing the loan of William Knabe for $30,239,23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that had been negotiated by Mr. Gill in Baltimore, we were directed to apply the collaterals formerly on the loan of Ernest J. Knabe to the loan of William Knabe, but we had no right to do that without the written consent of all parties to the original Ernest J. Knabe loan, and as that authority we received this communication marked 'Exhibit B\u2019 (letter of February 3rd, 1911), but when we received it we noticed that the signature of William Knabe had been made by Ernest J. Knabe, Jr.; we accepted the loan, but required .that the power of attorney authorizing Ernest J. Knabe to sign for William Knabe. be filed with us, and wrote Mr. Gill,. telling him to secure and forward the power of attorney, which he subsequently' did. When we received the authority, or the power of attorney, it was filed in our files and the loan physically put through the books and the check drawn to the order of William Knabe, tire loan having been made to him, and then upon the authority of this communication signed by the three Knabes, we endorsed the explanation for the diversion of the fund from one name to the account of another on the book as a memorandum for future reference and placed the proceeds of the check out of the treasurer\u2019s account for that liquidation of the Ernest J. Knabe loan. This is an unusual process and naturally we required proper authority for it, and did not act on it until the authority was in legal shape so that there could bo no question about it, as is done not only with this loan but occasionally under other circumstances.\u201d On cross-examination, Mr. Ludlow, in answer to the question, \u201cWhen did you receive the William Knabe note (the note for $30,239.23) ?\u201d replied: \u201cI think it was sometime in-February (referring to paper). Yo; it was March 4th, from Y. Rufus Gill &amp; Sons, Mr. Gill. That was a new transaction. We did not discount it then, i believe we called Mr. Gill\u2019s attention to the discrepancy in the power of attorney attached to the latter authorizing the proceeds of the note to be applied to the payment of the Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., note, and for the transfer of the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>lateral from the Ernest J. Knabe note1 to the William Knabe note. I refer by that to our letter of March 4th to E. Eufus Gill. * * * At that time, March 4th, we had accepted the note with that provision. Our transaction was not complete until the authorization for the signature of William Knabe. That was on or about the date this loan sheet was entered. We probably entered it the same day, about March 21st, 1911.\u201d He further testified that he passed on all new loans made by the Trust Company, and that they are then submitted to the executive committee for approval; that the committee has the right to reject or approve a loan; that the loan of $30,239.23 was approved by the executive committee sometime after March the 5th, 1911, as the final act on the part of the Trust Company, and that when they passed on it they had the right to reject or approve it. On the day following the day on which the above testimony was given the same witness, in answer to a question of counsel for the Trust Company, said: \u201cIn this particular loan the board of directors could not have approved the arrangements made, because the arrangement was made by me, with their knowledge, and explained from time to time, as the process proceeded, and was at all times acceptable to the board of directors\u201d; that he reported to the board of directors and executive committee and that they approved of his action; but that there were no minutes of any resolution of the directors or executive committee; and in reply to- the Court, he said that he could not recollect exactly what was said at any meeting and that no resolution was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On the 30th of June, 1911, Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., and his wife and William Knabe, executed the following agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahj\">\u201cWhereas, William Knabe, as maker, executed and delivered his demand collateral promissory note dated Baltimore City, Md., January 31st, 1911, for tlie sum of $30,239.23, with interest, to the Union Trust Company of Eew Jersey, or order, for the payment of which note and interest Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., and M. Eellie Knabe, his wife, became endorsers on said note:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>And Whereas, The interest on said note due June 30th, 1911, amounting to $755.98, became due and payable, but the said William Knabe was unable to pay the same, and has requested said Trust Company to grant him an extension of time to October 1st, 1911, in which to pay said interest and principal debt, which it has consented to do, by and with the consent of the said endorsers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of one dollar, and of the extension of time of payment as hereinbefore set forth, we, and each of us, do hereby remain bound as makers and endorsers respectively of the payment of said sum of $30,239.23 and all interest due and to become due thereon to the Union Trust Company of NTew Jersey represented by the note aforesaid, and we, and each of us, do hereby waive demand for payment, protest and notice thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">Witness our hands and seals this 30th day of June, A.

(Seal)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkH-\">Wm. Knabe (Seal)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">On the 26th of July, 1912, the Union Trust Company sued out of the Baltimore City Court a writ of attachment against Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., and M. Kellie Knabe; bis wife, as non-residents, and filed with the affidavit of its vice-president the short note and account, the note of January 31st, 1911, and the agreement of June 30th, 1911, referred to above. Certain property of Mrs. Knabe was attached, and the attachment was also laid in the hands of Gustav A. Schlens, individually and as administrator of Henrietta Schlens.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">A motion was filed in each case by the garnishee to quash the attachment on the ground that 11. Kellie Knabe was the wife of Ernest J. Knabe, Jr.; that she signed the guaranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>on said note and said agreement at the request and for the accommodation of her said husband and William Knabe; that she did not by said endorsement or agreement obtain, directly or indirectly, any money, property or thing of value for her use, or the use, benefit or advantage of her separate estate; that said note was \u201cnegotiated, transferred and delivered to the plaintiff in the State of New Jersey, * * * and came for the first time into legal existence in said State\u201d; that under the laws of the State of New Jersey she and her property are not liable on said endorsement, and that said endorsement as to her is void, and is not a proper voucher against her upon which to base an attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Depositions were taken by agreement of counsel in Cincinnati, Ohio-, and filed May 2nd, 1913. On the 12th of May, 1913, the Trust Company filed in each case a motion for a jury trial, as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff prays a jury trial in the above entitled case on the motions to quash filed by Gustav A. Schlens, individually and as administrator, garnishee.\u201d The Court below overruled the motion for a jury trial, and on the 4th of June, 1913, proceeded to hear the motion to quash without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In addition to the evidence to which we have already referred, there was further evidence to the effect that the note of $65,000.00 was endorsed by Mrs. Knabe in Maryland at the request of her husband, and was taken by him to New Jersey and there delivered to the Trust Company; that the endorsement on the note of $30,239.23 and the authority to apply the proceeds were signed by her in Maryland at the request of her husband, and were delivered by him or his attorney to N. Eufus Gill <em>&amp;\u25a0 </em>Sons in Baltimore City; that the agreement of June 30th, 1911, was signed by her at the request of her husband in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was delivered by him or his attorney to said attorneys of the Trust Company in Baltimore City, Maryland; that the one dollar mentioned in said endorsement and in said agreement of J une 30th were not paid, and that Mrs. Knabe did not on the faith of said endorsement or agreement obtain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>directly or indirectly, any money, property or thing of value, for her use, or for the use, benefit or advantage of her separate estate. There was also additional evidence reflecting upon the question whether the several notes we have referred <em>to </em>represented new and independent loans, or were only continuations or extensions of the previous loans, the contention of the Trust Company being that they were separate and independent transactions. But in the view we take of the case it is not necessary to make further reference to it. In connection with the correspondence between the Trust Company and H. Eufus Gill <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Mr. Ludlow, Mr. Hendrickson and Mr. Gill testified that H. Eufus Gill &amp; Sons were authorized to accept the note and endorsement. Mr. Gill further testified that he wrote the note and endorsement; that the place of payment was not inserted in the note, and that the note was dated in Maryland for the purpose of making it payable in Maryland; and that Ernest J. Knabe, Jr., and his attorney agreed that the note and endorsement should he treated as a Maryland contract and he delivered to him in Maryland for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of the Hew Jersey law. While this testimony in reference to an understanding that the endorsement shonld he treated as a Maryland contract is at variance with the positive recollection of counsel for Mr. Knabe, a further discussion of it is rendered unnecessary by other evidence in the case from which it affirmatively appears that counsel for1 Mr. Knabe did not represent Mrs. Knabe; that he never saw her in regard to the matter; that Mr. Gill never met her until after the suit was instituted, and that she signed the endorsement at the request of her husband without any further connection with or knowledge of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The garnishee offered in evidence the Hew Jersey statute which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\"><em>\u201c5. </em>That any married woman shall, after the passing of this act, 'have the right to hind herself by contract with any person in the same manner and to the same extent as though she were unmarried, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>contract shall be legal and obligatory, and may be enforced at law or in equity, by or against such married woman, in her own name apart from her husband; provided, that nothing herein shall enable such married woman to become an accommodation endorser, guarantor or surety, nor shall she he liable on any promise to pay the debt, or answer for the default or liability of any person; provided, further, however, that if on the faith of any endorsement, contract of guaranty or suretyship, promise to pay the debt or to answer for the default or liability of any other person, any married woman obtains, directly or indirectly, any money, property or other thing of value, for her own use, or for the use, benefit or advantage of her separate estate, she shall be liable thereon as though she were unmarried, anything contained to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Tlr-. Garrison, an attorney at law of New Jersey and general counsel for the appellant, testified that the statute referred to does not apply to a non-resident married woman; that there are no New Jersey decisions to that effect, but that he based his opinion upon the reasoning of the Court in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>66 N. J. L. 257; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>77 N. J. L. 681, and <em>Basilea </em>v. <em>Spagnuolo, </em>80 N. J. L. 88; that the guaranty of a married woman, executed and delivered to thei agent of the payee or guarantee, a New Jersey corporation, outside of the State of New Jersey, would under the decisions referred to be enforceable against her. On cross-examination he stated that the endorsement of a promissory note by a married woman which does not become a completed contract until it reaches the State of New Jersey is not valid, but that that rule would not, in his opinion, under the decisions mentioned, apply to a non-resident married woman; that the decisions of New Jersey hold as to the contracts of resident married women that the law of the place where the contract is made, and not the law of the place of domicile controls as to the capacity of the parties; that the question where the same rule applies to non-resident married women <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>has not been decided either way in New Jersey; that under the law! of the State of New Jersey, in accordance with the case of <em>Live Stock Co. </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>40 N. J. L. 476, the last essential act necessary for the consummation of a contract determines the time and place of the making of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">During the hearing of the motion to quash, twenty-nine exceptions were reserved by the Trust Company. The first exception is to the refusal of the Court below to grant the motion for a jury tidal; the twenty-ninth is to the action of the Court in quashing the attachment, and the remaining exceptions axe to rulings on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In support of the first exception the appellant relies upon Article 5 of the Declaration of Eights, section 6 of Article 15 of the Constitution, and the cases of <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>25 Md. 365; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>30 Md. 334, and <em>Lanahan </em>v. <em>Heaver, </em>77 Md. 605. In <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, supra, </em>the Court said: \u201cIn attachment cases, in which other parties interpose claims to the property seized under the writs, a practice prevails in Maryland, which has been sanctioned, for docketing cases between the claimants and-the attaching creditors, and trying the title on issues framed or made by the pleas, by a jury, before the Court makes final disposition of the attachment. This course is to be commended, and doubtless would have been pursued in this cause had application 'been made. On such an application we regard it would have been the duty of the Court to have granted it, and had the question of the <em>bona fides </em>of the bill of sale, and all other facts in proof of the title, submitted to the jury under such instructions as might arise, as in other jury trials. This right to the trial by jury of all issues of fact in civil proceedings in the several Courts of law in this State, where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of five dollars, is guaranteed by the Constitution of this State.\u201d In that case the practice referred to had not been followed, neither party had asked for a jury trial, and it was objected in the -Court of Appeals that the lower Court had no right to hear the motion to quash without a jury. In disposing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>that objection the Court said further: \u201cThat the Court has this right upon the motion.to quash, the law, as derived from the case of <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>3 H. &amp; McH. 535, decided in 1191, was relied on as controlling weight and authority. The opinion of the General Court, pronounced in that case by Judge Chase (552,553), is full and explicit, not only as to the province of the Court without the intervention of a jury, but as to the summary nature of an attachment proceeding prior to its dissolution under the old system, and the mode of proceeding by suggestion, either from the defendant in the attachment, or a third person claiming an interest in the property attached, for the purpose of showing that the property taken did not belong to the defendant, and for taking proof <em>dehors </em>the proceeding to establish the- claim. The opinion of the General Court on the point in question, and in all its parts, has been so recognized by this Court in various decisions in more recent cases, and has become so interwoven with the attachment law and practice in this State that it can be no longer questioned as settled law.\u201d In <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Katz, supra, </em>the appellee moved to quash the attachment for defects apparent on the fact of the proceedings, and because he was the owner of the property. After disposing of the first ground of the motion, the Court said: \u201cThis disposes of all objections made or suggested, based upon alleged defects apparent on the face of the proceedings. The other reason assigned for quashing the writ goes to matters <em>dehors, </em>and relates to' the validity of the bill of sale by which the appellee claims title to the property attached. A large mass of testimony has been taken on this subject, but, as we have stated, the judgment below was based exclusively upon the insufficiency of the affidavit. Upon the important question of the validity of this deed, the parties have never had the benefit of the Court\u2019s consideration and judgment. It is true, the question is open to us for decision on this appeal. Such questions may be raised on a motion to quash, and heard before the Court, in this summary mode, on evidence produced by the parties, if they elect so to try them. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>was decided in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>25 Md. 350, but in that case the better practice of having them submitted to a jury was strongly commended, and looking to all the circumstances of this case, we think the proper course to be pursued, and the one which will best subserve the ends of justice, is to reverse the order appealed from, for the reasons already stated, without expressing\u2019 any opinion upon the validity of the deed, and send the case back under a <em>pro</em>cedendo,, in order that the parties may have again the option to submit the question to a jury, or have it heard and decided by the Court upon the evidence now in the record, and such other testimony as they may choose to introduce under the Court\u2019s order and direction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The practice approved by the Court in the above cases was the practice, where other parties claimed the property attached, of docketing cases between the claimants and the attaching creditors, and trying the title on <em>issues framed or made by the pleas, </em>by a jury, before the Court makes final disposition of the attachment. But the Court did not hold that where questions of fact- are to be determined on a <em>motion lo quash </em>that the parties are entitled to a jury trial. On the contrary, the Court distinctly recognizes the right of the Court to determine such questions without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The case of <em>Lanahan </em>v. <em>Heaver, supra, </em>was not an attachment case, and the Court simply stated the general rule that in civil cases a jury cannot be dispensed with except by the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In the case of <em>Gover </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>15 Md. 576, a motion was filed to quash the attachment on the ground that the defendant was not an absconding debtor, and the motion was resisted by the plaintiffs upon the ground that the matters of fact averred in the motion were proper \u201cfor trial and decision by a jury, upon issues properly joined between the parties, and ought not to be tried by the Court.\u201d On appeal the Court said: \u201cThat the Court had authority to entertain the motion to quash, to hear the evidence in relation thereto, and decide the motion without the intervention of a jury, is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>fully sustained by <em>Lambden </em>v. <em>Bowie, </em>2 Md. 334, that we consider it unnecessary to enter into any reasoning on the subject.\u201d In <em>Gittings </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 Md. 458 Judge Milled said: \u201cMotions to dissolve attachments involving sometimes questions of residence and citizenship, and other matters of fact <em>dehors </em>the proceedings may be decided by the Court in this mode, and such decisions have never been regarded as infringing the constitu\u00edional right of trial by jury.\u201d In the case of <em>Ferrell </em>v. <em>Farnen, </em>67 Md. 76, the questions before the Court was whether the garnishee and claimant, who elected to try the case upon a motion to quash before the Court, could, after the evidence had been partly taken, dismiss his motion, and by filing a plea try the same question before a jury. In that case the Court said: \u201cAs to the objection raised by the appellant, that he was entitled to a jury trial, it is no longer an open question in this Court, since the case of <em>Wilhelm </em>v. <em>Roloson, </em>37 Md. x, and the cases there cited, where the right of the Court to hear and determine, on a motion to quash an attachment case for matter <em>dehors </em>the .record, without the intenvention of a jury, was distinctly recognized * * * It is certainly undeniable that the garnishee or claimant who makes a motion to quash, may abandon such motion at any time before the final decision of it. The motion to quash is a summary proceeding, triable before the Court. It may include matters apparent upon the face of the proceedings as well as matters <em>dehors. </em>But he may waive his right to a summary proceeding, as far as the matters outside of the record are concerned, and resort to a plea, which does require the intervention of a jury.\u201d In the unreported case of <em>Wilhelm </em>v. <em>Roloson, </em>37 Md. x, the Court held that, \u201cthe Court has the right to hear and decide motions to quash attachments for matters <em>dehors </em>the record, without the intervention of a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The cases to which we have referred not only recognize and approve the practice of the courts in hearing motions to quash attachments without the intervention of a jury, hut establish their right to do so, and there was, therefore, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>error in the ruling of the Court below in the first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The important question in the case is, can the claim of the appellant be enforced against Mrs. Knabe or her property ? In considering that question we must first determine whether the guaranty was made in Maryland or in the State of New Jersey, and that involves a consideration of the nature of her undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Her endorsement reads, \u201cIn consideration of the making, at the request of the undersigned, of the loan evidenced by the within note upon the terms thereof and of the sum of one dollar, the undersigned hereby guarantee to the Union Trust Company of New Jersey, its successors, endorsers or assigns, the prompt payment of the said loan, when due,\u201d etc. The evidence shows that the \u201cone dollar\u201d mentioned in the above guaranty was not paid, and the only consideration for the guaranty was the loan to be made on \u201cthe within note.\u201d <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>115 Md. 349; <em>Nabb </em>v. <em>Koontz, </em>17 Md. 283, and <em>Ordeman </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>49 Md. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Until the loan to be secured by the note was actually made/' the guaranty was executory, and could only become binding tipon the making of the loan. The guaranty was not given in consideration of a <em>promise </em>on the part of the guarantee to make the loan, but rests upon a loan actually made. Until the loan was made by the Trust Company on the note in accordance with its terms the guaranty was not the complete and binding obligation of the guarantor, but was in the na-\u00a1 ture of a promise to guarantee. It is said in <em>Brantly on </em>Cont<em>racts </em>(2nd Ed.), 43-44: \u201cWhen the offer contemplates an acceptance by the doing of an act, the contract is formed, not by a promise to do that act, but by actually doing it. Consequently, the offer is revocable at any time before the act is done, provided notice of the revocation has been communicated.\u201d And it is stated in <em>Stearns on Suretyship, </em>page 94, that, \u201can executory contract of guaranty may be considered as a mere offer to contract, and not binding until acted upon\u201d; and in 20 <em>Cyc. </em>1480, that \u201ca general guaranty of pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ment by another of a liability to be created in the future \" * * will be terminated by the death of the guarantor.\u201d In the case of <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Dobbins, </em>122 Mass. 168, the Court said: \u201cAn agreement to guarantee the payment by another of goods to be sold in the future, not founded upon any present consideration passing to the guarantor, is a contract of a peculiar character. Until it is acted upon, it imposes no obligation and creates no liability of the guarantor. After it is acted upon, the sale of the goods upon the credit of the guaranty is the only consideration for the conditional promise of the guarantor to pay for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\u201cThe agreement which the guarantor makes with the person receiving the guaranty is not that I now become liable to you for anything, but that if you sell goods to a third person, I will then become liable to pay for them if such third person does not. It is of the nature of an authority to sell goods upon the credit of the guarantor, rather than of a contract which cannot be rescinded except by mutual consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is, therefore, clear, from the very nature and terms of Mrs. Knabe\u2019s undertaking, and upon the authorities cited, that the endorsement on the note in question did not become binding on her until the Trust Company accepted her offer to guarantee the payment of the \"note <em>by making the loan, </em>v</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A contract is made where the last act is done to malee it a binding obligation upon the parties to it. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Royal Insurance Co., </em>49 Md. 366; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Rasin Fertilizer Co., </em>87 Md. 679; <em>Latrobe </em>v. <em>Winans, </em>89 Md. 636; <em>Expressmen\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Hurlock, </em>91 Md. 585; <em>Northwestern Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McCue, </em>223 U. S. 234; <em>Northhampton Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>40 N. J. L. 476; <em>Milliken v. Pratt, </em>125 Mass. 374; <em>Irving Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>74 N. J. L. 42, 64 Atl. 1071. In the last mentioned case a married woman executed in FTew Jersey an agreement to guarantee the payment to a bank in FTew York of a loan to be made by said bank toVher husband. The guaranty was delivered to her husband^ in</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">New Jersey and taken by him to the bank in New York. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Tlie bank accepted the guaranty and made a loan to the husband upon the faith of it. The Oourt held that, notwithstanding the agreement was executed and delivered in the State of Xew Jersey, it did not become operative until the bank accepted it and acted upon it, and that therefore the \u25a0contract was made in Xew York, and that its validity was to be determined by the law of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It is a well settled rule in this State that the law of the State in which the contract is made determines the capacity of the parties and the validity of the contract. In the case of <em>Trasher </em>v. <em>Everhart, </em>3 G. &amp; J. 234, the Court said: \u201cIt is a universal principle, governing the judicial tribunals of all civilized nations (for the truth of which no authority need be cited), that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>controls the nature, construction and validity of the contract. Courts will always look to the <em>lex loci, </em>to give construction to an instrument, and will impart to it validity, according to those laws, unless it would be dangerous, against public policy, or of immoral tendency to enforce it here.\u201d To the same effect are the cases of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Mullin, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 190; <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>9 Gill, 1; <em>B. and O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>28 Md. 287; <em>Eastwood </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>44 Md. 563; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Schall, </em>65 Md. 289. The same rule is adopted in New Jersey and is distinctly recognized in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>66 N. J. L. 253, 46 Atl. 567, and <em>Irving Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra. </em>It is urged on behalf of the Trust Company that <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>77 N. J. L. 681, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 763, establishes a different rule, but a careful reading of that case does not warrant that conclusion. In that case the evidence did not show where the note in question was delivered, and in that respect it was distinguished by the Court from the case of <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra. </em>In the case at bar they offer to guarantee the note was accepted by making the loan in the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">As the guaranty in question must be regarded as a Xew Jersey contract, and as the capacity of the parties, and the validity of the contract must be determined by. the law of the State in which the contract was made, it would seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>follow that under the provisions of the Few Jersey statute the guaranty of Mrs. Knahe can not he enforced ag\u2019ainst her or her property. The appellant also contends that the evidence shows that the parties agreed that the law of Maryland should control in determining the validity of the endorsement. But as we have said the evidence shows that counsel for Mr. Knahe did not represent Mrs. Knahe, and that she Avas not a party to any such agreement or understanding. It is also urged that the intention of the parties that the law of Maryland should be applied in determining the validity of the endorsement may be presumed from the fact that the note Avas dated in Maryland, and the case of <em>Mayer v. Roche, supra, </em>is relied on. In that case, however, there was no evidence to show where the note was del\u00cdArered, and the Court said: \u201cWe held in <em>Thompson v. Taylor </em>that the law of the place of contract was decisiAre on the question of incapacity to contract incident, to coverture. The question in this case is whether, upon the bare facts above stated, the place of contract was Few York or Few Jersey.\u201d In the case at bar the \u201cplace- of contract\u201d is shoAvn to be Few Jersey, and where that is the case the rule adopted in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The opinion expressed by the general counsel for the appellant that the statute of Few Jersey does not apply to contracts of non-resident married Avomen was not baaed upon any decision to that effect by the courts of Few Jersey, and in view of the decisions of this State and the Fbav Jersey cases to which wo have referred, holding that the validity of the contract must be determined by the laAvs of the State in Avhich it is made, we would not be warranted in adopting' his construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Tt is further insisted that the note and endorsement of January 31st was accepted by Mr. Gill in payment of the balance due on Hie preA\u00dcous note of $65,000.00. But the contract of Mrs. Knabe was an agreement to pay the note of January 31st, and her offer to become guarantor could only be accepted by making the loan on that note, A <em>pr'om</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>ise </em>to make the loan could not be substituted for the actual making of the loan, which was the only consideration for her guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Counsel for the appellant contends also that the parties intended that the agreement of June 30th should he substituted for the note, and that the note is merged in said agreement. The agreement, however, is by its terms an agreement consenting to an extension of the time for the payment of the note, and to <em>remain </em>hound as maker and endorsers of the note. It does not alter the original contract of the parties, nor change their liability thereon, hut was intended to preserve that liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In the third, fourth, fifth and ninth exceptions the witness was asked whether the notes to which we have referred, including the note in suit, were not renewals of previous notes. The appellant was not prejudiced by the answers to these questions, for treating the loan of January 31st, 1911, as a new loan Mrs. Knahe would not, as we have said, he liable for her endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In the tenth and eleventh exceptions the witness was asked what he did with the note after it was executed hv him and his brother William and Mrs. Knahe, and in reply he said he presumed that it was sent to the Union Trust Company. The plaintiff moved to strike out the answers of the witness, and these exceptions are to the refusal of the Court to grant the motions. The appellant was not injured by these rulings because the evidence clearly shows that ..the note and endorsement were delivered to its attorney in \"Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In the fourteenth exception the witness was asked. \u201cWas there any other purpose or obiect in the making or the endorsing and guaranteeing of the $30.000.00 note than to satisfy the! demands of the Union Trust Co. of New Jersev?\u201d And he answered. \u201cThere was not.\u201d We do not see how this evidence could have iniured the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">TLe question which the Court refused to permit the plaintiff to ask in the fifteenth exception was answered hv the witness on pages 115 and 117 of the record without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Iii the sixteenth exception the witness was asked, \u201cIs it not a fact that in every instance that a loan is made by your company, that it has to be approved by the executive committee?\u201d And he replied, \u201cI believe so.\u201d In view of the fact that the by-laws of the plaintiff -were offered in evidence, and the testimony of Mr. Ludlow as to the extent of his authority, the plaintiff could not have been injured by the answer of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We see no error in the ruling in the seventeenth exception. The defendant had the right to interrogate the witness as to what was done by Ihe plaintiff in making the loan evidenced by the note in suit. Moreover, substantially the same question was asked and answered by the witness without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The evidence referred to in the twentieth exception was substantially covered by the previous testimony of the witness, and the plaintiff could not have been prejudiced by its rejection, even if we assume that it was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The plaintiff could not have been injured by the ruling in the twenty-second exception, because the witness had already stated the authority given him by the directors of' the Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Assuming that the witness could properly be asked to state what Mr. Knabe and Mr. Hershey understood about discounting the note, the witness had already given his version of his agreement with the parties referred to, and the plaintiff could not have been prejudiced by the rejection of the evidence referred to in the twenty-fifth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The other exceptions were abandoned by counsel for the appellant, and finding -no reversible error in any of the rulings of the Court below the order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs, to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">[For the reasons stated, the orders appealed from in the other two appeals,.at the same time argued, was affirmed, with costs to the appellee.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
