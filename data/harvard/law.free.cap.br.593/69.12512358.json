INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The matter before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Donald R. Lassman, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Plaintiff\" or the \"Trustee\") of the bankruptcy estate of Kristen M. Spalt (the \"Defendant\" or the \"Debtor\"). Through his Motion, the Plaintiff seeks summary judgment against the Debtor on Counts I, III and IV of the \"Amended Complaint Objecting to Discharge of the Debtor.\" Specifically, the Plaintiff seeks judgment denying the Debtor a discharge 1) pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(D) due to her failure to furnish him with records and information that he requested (Count I); 2) pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A) for knowingly and fraudulently making false oath(s) or account(s) on her Schedules (Count III); and 3) pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) due to her refusal to obey a lawful order of the Court, specifically a Stipulation as approved by an Order of this Court (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiff filed a Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of his Motion for Summary Judgment together with the Affidavit of Jonathan M. Hixon, counsel for the Plaintiff, together with a Memorandum of Law. The Defendant filed an Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, a Response to the Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and an Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court heard the Motion for Summary Judgment on September 7, 2018 and took the matter under advisement. The Court now makes its findings of fact and rulings of law in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, made applicable to this proceeding by Fed. R. Civ. P. 7056.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor commenced a Chapter 7 case on January 15, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee conducted the meeting of creditors and examined the Debtor on February 17, 2016. The Trustee continued the meeting of creditors to March 16, 2016 and then continued it several more times while the Trustee awaited the production of certain financial records and documents that he had requested from the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor's Production of Records to the Trustee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 29, 2016, the Debtor filed Schedule A/B: Property disclosing as assets ownership interests in several entities as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 80% shareholder of Jackbox, LLC;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 14.28% interest in the Nancy Gallagher Partnership;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Trustee/beneficiary of the KG Family Trust;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 50% beneficiary of the J.P.

Realty Trust\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Debtor admitted listing the accounts but stated that she was not a signatory on the South Lafourche Bank account and that she did not have an interest in the account.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On March 2, 2016, the Trustee delivered to Debtor's counsel a 3-page document entitled \"List of documents to produce[.]\" On March 30, 2016, Debtor's counsel delivered to Trustee's counsel approximately one and one-half banker's boxes of documents in response to the Trustee's List of documents to produce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On June 3, 2016, the Trustee requested, by letter from his counsel to Debtor's counsel, that the Debtor produce additional documents, including, among other things, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (i) All schedules, consents, votes, directions, certificates or other documents evidencing the ownership of beneficial interests or membership interests or evidencing or constituting transfers of beneficial interests or membership interest in various entities the Debtor held a beneficial or membership interest in;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (ii) Organizational documents for Cape 10-21 LLC and 10-21 Nominee Trust;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (iii) Bank records for the Debtor's TD Bank checking and savings accounts, Cape Coastal's South Lafourche account and a Charles Schwab &amp; Co. trust account for JP Realty Trust;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (iv) Source documents for Jackbox's TD Bank account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (v) Source documents for KG Family Trust's TD Bank Account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (vi) Records of deposits and withdrawals from the Debtor's 5477 Account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (vii) Records of deposits and withdrawals from the Debtor's Charles Schwab account ending in 6665;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (viii) Records of transfers in and out of JP Realty Trust;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (ix) Operating agreements for Jackbox, Cape 10-21 LLC, Cape Coastal, Lydonia, Mohawk Callais, Narragansett, New Ranger and Veatch LLC;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (x) Federal tax returns for Cape Coastal, Veatch and Debtor's other entities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (xi) The most recent income statements for Cape Coastal, Mohawk Callais, Lydonia, New Ranger and Narragansett and the most recent balance sheet and income statements for Cape 10-21, LLC and Veatch, LLC;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (xii) Exhibits to the Statement of Undisputed Fact with Plaintiff and Defendant Responses filed in the Suffolk County Superior Court action 12-04539; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (xiii) A schedule of payments of tuition, room, board, fees and any other charge or expenses with respect to any of the Debtor's children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Debtor failed to timely produce the documents, records or communications responsive to the Trustee's request. Nevertheless, the Defendant contends that \"Counsel for the Debtor and Counsel for the Trustee had various conversations regarding the documents, the Debtor's efforts to obtain the documents from third parties and the nonexistence of certain of the documents.\" The Defendant did not point to any specific part of the record to support that assertion. The Court notes that the Defendant in her Affidavit stated, on the one hand, that she attempted to comply with the Trustee's requests but because the information was in the possession of third parties she relied on her husband to produce the documents. On the other hand, she represented that she produced one and one-half banker boxes of documents as well as a memory stick containing 50,000 pages of documents. She did not indicate in her Affidavit whether any of the documents she produced were responsive to the Trustee's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On July 10, 2016, and again on August 12, 2016, Trustee's counsel followed up with emails to Debtor's counsel requesting the same documents that he had requested in the June 3, 2016 letter. The Debtor again failed to timely produce the documents, records or communications responsive to the Trustee's follow-up requests. Trustee's counsel testified that he alerted Debtor's counsel that he had not received documents from the Debtor's accountants and attorneys; the Defendant attempted to deny the testimony with reference to \"conversations regarding the documents\" between counsel to the Debtor and counsel to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On August 25, 2016, the Trustee filed his Complaint Objecting to Discharge of the Debtor on the grounds that, inter alia, the Debtor failed to produce records to the Trustee related to her property and financial affairs. Approximately four months later, on or around January 2017, the Debtor produced a thumb drive to counsel for the Trustee consisting of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 pages of documents that were produced to the Debtor by Massachusetts Housing Finance Authority (\"MHFA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In support of his position that he did not obtain the documents requested, the Plaintiff relies upon the testimony of his counsel during the trial held in\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency v. Spalt\n   </em>\n   , Adv. P. No. 16-1127. Specifically, during the trial, his counsel, James M. Liston, Esq., testified that, although he may have exchanged telephone calls with Debtor's counsel, he did not obtain all the documents requested until after August 25, 2016 when the Trustee filed an adversary proceeding objecting to the Debtor's discharge, adding \"[s]ubsequent to that, we probably received most of these documents at different points in time from different sources - - from a number of different sources including the debtor. The debtor did submit - - give [sic] us certain of the documents after the adversary had been commenced.\" Notably, the Trustee was required to obtain pertinent documents from third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On February 14, 2017, the Trustee served his Request for Admissions in this matter. The Debtor never responded to the Request for Admissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On January 3, 2018, the Trustee filed his Motion to Deem Admitted and Conclusively Establish the Matters Set Forth in the Trustee's Request for Admissions and to Preclude Defendant from Introducing Evidence to the Contrary. The Debtor failed to file any response, and, on January 24, 2018, the Court granted the Trustee's Motion. As such, the following facts, in relevant part, are deemed admitted and conclusively established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   i. On March 2, 2016, the Trustee delivered to Debtor's Counsel a 3-page document entitled \"List of documents to produce,\" including a \"[c]opy of KG Family Trust as of 1/15/16, a copy of the Schedule of Beneficiaries, and document showing transfers of any property into, or out of, this trust for the period January 1, 2012 to date;\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ii.

As of this date, the Trustee has not received any of\n   the documents requested in that letter and email.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   viii.

(the \"Charles Schwab\n   Account\"), which she disclosed on Schedule A/B. The Debtor represents that she and her son, James E. Spalt, owned the account, adding that each had the right to make deposits and withdrawals without the consent or knowledge of the other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As part of her failure to respond to the Trustee's Request for Admissions, the Debtor admitted, and thus it has been conclusively established, that there were two transfers from the Charles Schwab Account during the two-year period prior to the Debtor's bankruptcy petition as follows: (i) one on March 26, 2014 in the amount of $530,000.00; and (ii) one on October 7, 2014 in the amount of $86,000.00. The Debtor admits the transfers were made, but maintains that they were made without her knowledge to an account in Louisiana used by a business her son and his father operated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The transfer for $530,000.00 was made to Cape Coastal Marine LLC's account at South Lafourche Bank. The Debtor, while admitting the transfers were made, contends that Cape Coastal Marine LLC was a management company for boats located in Louisiana and that, while she had an interest in the limited liability company, \"she had a passive role in the LLC and had no role in the operation or management of the LLC or Cape Coast Marine LLC [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The undisclosed transfer was made to Cape Coastal Marine LLC at a time when the Debtor and her spouse were subject to a preliminary injunction in a state court action brought against them by MHFA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   although Cape Coastal Marine LLC was not subject to the injunction.

The Debtor disputes this assertion, contending that her husband \"was employed by Cape Coastal Marine LLC and a signatory on the account of Cape Coastal Marine LLC,\" adding that \"[a]ny payments from Cape Coastal Marine were made by James Spalt, not the Debtor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Trustee asserts that the Debtor testified at the MHFA trial that she knew about the $530,000.00 transfer from the account but did not recall whether she amended her Schedules or SOFA to include such transfer. The Debtor contends that her knowledge arose after the complaint filed by MHFA. The Debtor never amended her Schedules or SOFA to include the transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In her SOFA, when asked whether she transferred any property to a self-settled trust during the preceding ten years, the Debtor answered \"No.\" The Declaration of Trust for the KG Family Trust was executed by the Debtor on or about February 2, 2008 and recorded with the Essex County Registry of Deeds, on July 11, 2008, in Book 27913, Page 69. Although the Debtor denied that she is the settlor of the KG Family Trust, the Trustee submitted a copy of the \"Declaration of Trust Establishing KG Family Trust,\" a nominee trust, which provides in part: \"I, Kristen Spalt, Trustee, hereby declare that Ten (10) Dollars is held in trust hereunder and any and all additional property, real and personal, that may be acquired hereunder (the \"Trust Estate\") shall be held in trust, solely as nominee, for the sole benefit of the individuals or entities listed in the Schedule of Beneficiaries ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Debtor, in her Schedule A/B: Property filed with the Court, listed an 80% ownership interest in Jackbox, LLC; a 50% ownership interest in J.P. Realty Trust; and an 8% ownership interest in Cape 10-21 LLC. Nevertheless, the Debtor testified during her 2004 Examination that she transferred her interest in Jackbox, LLC to the KG Family Trust on or about March 12, 2008. The Debtor also testified that her interests in J.P. Realty Trust and Cape 10-21 LLC had been transferred to the KG Family Trust in and after 2008. The Debtor, in her Schedules, listed herself as \"Trustee/beneficiary of the KG Family Trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Debtor states that she is not the sole beneficiary of the KG Family Trust. She testified in her 2004 Examination that her children also are named as beneficiaries of the KG Family Trust. The KG Trust Schedule of Beneficiaries ultimately produced to the Trustee after August 25, 2016 reflects that the Debtor's children hold beneficial interests in the trust in unspecified percentages or amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor's Compliance with Bankruptcy Court Orders\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Debtor and her spouse owned real property located at 63 Braggs Lane, Barnstable, Massachusetts at the commencement of the Debtor's Chapter 7 case. The Debtor and her spouse, James Spalt, ceased occupying the Property sometime prior to July 1, 2016 and leased the Property to Hilary O'Malley pursuant to Massachusetts Residential Lease Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On September 26, 2016, the Trustee filed \"Chapter 7 Trustee's Motion for Turnover of Rents (Expedited Determination Requested).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Trustee\n   the unauthorized execution of a lease violated the automatic stay and was void as a matter of law. The Debtor objected to the motion, and thereafter, the Debtor, her spouse, James Spalt, and the Trustee entered into a Stipulation which the Debtor personally executed. The Trustee filed a Motion for Approval of Stipulation Regarding Rents, together with the Stipulation. The Court granted the Motion on October 17, 2016. The order approving the Stipulation was served on the Debtor and her counsel. Pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Stipulation, the Debtor and James Spalt agreed that in the event that the Lease was extended for any term or terms beyond June 2017, they would continue to pay the Trustee half of the difference between the monthly rent for such extended term and the monthly Property Expenses as defined in the Stipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Paragraph 4 of the Stipulation, the Debtor and James Spalt were required to send the Trustee the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   [W]ritten evidence of their monthly payments of the Property Expenses [as defined in the Stipulation] each and every month during the term of this Stipulation so that such written evidence of such payments is received by the Trustee on or before the last day of the month in which they are made. Failure to timely provide such written evidence of payment to the Trustee shall be deemed to be proof for the purposes of this Stipulation that such payment was not made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   On July 26, 2017, August 1, 2017 and January 31, 2018, James M. Liston, Esq., counsel for the Trustee, sent email requests to Charles R. Bennett, Esq., counsel for the Debtor, for written evidence of Property Expenses as set forth in the Stipulation. The Debtor stated that \"the requests were forwarded to James Spalt, who was the person acknowledged to be in charge of the property and making decisions regarding the lease and payment expenses.\" The Debtor and James Spalt did not respond timely to the Trustee's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   On March 5, 2018, as a result of the Debtor's failure to deliver to the Trustee proof of payment of the Property Expenses, the Trustee filed his Chapter 7 Trustee's Motion for Order Directing Payment of Rent under Stipulation, seeking an order authorizing the Trustee to direct Hilary O'Malley, the tenant at the Premises, to pay all further rent for the Premises payable under the Second Lease directly to the Trustee. In his Motion, the Trustee stated: \"[t]he Spalts [sic] failure to send written evidence of payment of the Property Expenses to the Trustee is proof that they are not paying such expenses under paragraph 4 of the Stipulation.\" That same day, the Court entered an Order directing\n   that \"[t]he Debtor shall file a response to the Trustee's Motion, admitting or denying each numbered paragraph on or before March 7, 2018 at 4:30 pm, failing which the Court shall grant this Motion without further notice of a hearing.\" Notwithstanding the explicit direction contained in the Court's March 7, 2018 order, the Debtor did not timely file a response to the Trustee's Motion and thus failed to comply with the order. Moreover, by failing to admit or deny the paragraphs of the Trustee's motion, the Debtor is deemed to have admitted that she and James Spalt were not paying the Property Expenses in accordance with the Stipulation, which the Court approved on October 17, 2016. Accordingly, on March 8, 2018, the Court granted the Trustee's Motion for Order Directing Payment of Rent under Stipulation, authorizing him to direct Hilary O'Malley to pay all further rent for the Premises payable under the Second Lease, all as defined in the Motion, directly to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Subsequently, on March 20, 2018, the Debtor provided the Trustee with certain written evidence of monthly payment of the Property Expenses (as defined in the Stipulation). At the time of the above production, the Trustee had already filed his Motion seeking to enforce the Stipulation, as approved by the Court, and the Court had already entered its Order directing payment of rent to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE DEBTOR's AFFIDAVIT IN OPPOSITION TO THE TRUSTEE's MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Debtor submitted an Affidavit in support of her opposition to the Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment. In her Affidavit, she blamed her husband's \"financial missteps, unsuccessful investments and financial maneuvering\" for forcing her into bankruptcy and causing her to \"liv[e] barely above the poverty line.\" She asserted that \"Mr. Spalt established the KG Family Trust and transferred his and apparently certain of [her] assets to the KG Family Trust.\" She added that he liquidated his assets and ran the funds through a Charles Schwab Account which she owned with her adult son, also named James Spalt (i.e., James E. Spalt), and that he used funds from the sale of property which he and his brother owned to invest in limited liability companies which purchased boats to service the oil and gas industry in Louisiana. She represented that she had no role in the management of financial affairs of any of the entities located in Louisiana and any position she had in any entities \"was totally passive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   While maintaining that MHFA essentially has a vendetta against her, she stated that after she commenced her bankruptcy case, she \"acted in good faith to fully and completely comply with all of [her] obligations as a debtor.\" She asserted that she attempted to fully comply with the Trustee's request for information and never withheld documents in her possession. She indicated that she relied upon her husband in preparing her Schedules and SOFA, adding that \"[w]hile such reliance may have been misplaced, under the circumstances, I never had any intent to conceal assets from creditors or the Trustee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Debtor in her Affidavit maintained that all of the financial affairs for the family were handled by her husband and that \"[u]nder his stewardship the family has been enmeshed in over ten years of litigation with MHFA, has presided over business failures, and dissipated the family assets and wealth.\" In support of her contention that she was unaware of what was transpiring with respect to her financial affairs and the financial affairs of her family, she stated that she did not review the\n   account statements when they arrived at their home and left them for her husband to review. She said she did not knowingly or intentionally withhold information from the Trustee and delivered to the Trustee all of the Schwab account statements for 2014 and 2015, although she did not say when. She represented in her Affidavit that she had no motive or incentive not to make a full and complete disclosure and was honest in her answers. Finally, she stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   With respect to the Trustee's assertion that I failed to comply with the Stipulation relating to the lease of the family home,\n   <em>\n    I never was included in that transaction\n   </em>\n   . All the communications and discussions with the tenant were done by my husband. Likewise, all of the discussions with the Trustee and his Counsel were through my husband.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Aug. 21, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    General Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court concludes that the Trustee unequivocally established that the Debtor knowingly and fraudulently failed to produce records, knowingly and fraudulently made false oaths, and willfully disobeyed Court orders. It is undisputed that the Debtor is not an infant or an incompetent person and that her debts are primarily business debts. In addition, she is represented by experienced bankruptcy counsel. Nevertheless, the Debtor both pre- and postpetition, admittedly assumed little to no responsibility for the integrity of her\n   Schedules and SOFA, the production of documents, or adherence to the Stipulation approved by the Court, the violation of which prompted this Court to order her to immediately respond to the Trustee's Motion for Order Directing Payment of Rent. Were the Debtor's deficiencies in responding to the Trustee's requests for information, her omissions on the SOFA immaterial, or her failure to fully comply with the terms of the Stipulation isolated incidents, the Court might view the Debtor's conduct through a different lens. Taken as a whole, however, the Debtor's failure to fulfill her duties, including 1) cooperating with the trustee as necessary to enable the trustee to perform\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   trustee's duties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ; and 2) surrendering to the Trustee all property of the estate and any recorded information, including books, documents, records, and papers, relating to property of the estate,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 521(a)(4), compel the Court to conclude that the Debtor engaged in a pattern of conduct designed to thwart, and did thwart, the Trustee's expeditious investigation of her financial affairs, including the investigation of the transfers she omitted from her SOFA. The Debtor's failure to adequately respond to the Trustee's requests for financial information caused the estate to needlessly incur legal fees and concomitantly diminished the potential for creditors to receive a dividend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Debtor, as her Schedules and SOFA reveal, had complex and intertwined interests in numerous entities, bank accounts and brokerage accounts. She set forth in her Affidavit that her husband was not successful in managing the financial affairs of her family. In her words, \"[u]nder his stewardship the family has been enmeshed in over ten years of litigation with MHFA, has presided over business failures, and dissipated the family assets and wealth.\" She asserted that her husband established the KG Family Trust and transferred his and certain of her assets to the KG Family Trust and that he liquidated those assets and used the proceeds to invest in businesses in Louisiana, running funds through a Charles Schwab Account she owned with her son. She maintained that she had no role in the management of the financial affairs of any entities, that she made no decisions, and that her role was totally passive. Indeed, she admitted to acting as a straw, while complaining that his financial misdeeds forced her into bankruptcy and caused her to live \"barely above the poverty line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   While the Debtor may have been passive in her role as a trustee, beneficiary, and owner of various entities, trusts and brokerage accounts prepetition, once she elected to commence a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and discharge debts in excess of $11 million, she was obliged to perform\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   duties as a Chapter 7 debtor. As noted above, those duties included cooperating with the Trustee and surrendering property to the Trustee. The Debtor elected to delegate those responsibilities to her husband, the very same individual who dissipated the family's wealth and whose financial machinations forced her into bankruptcy. Unless a debtor is incompetent and represented by a guardian, those duties cannot be delegated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1004.1. The Court rejects, as a matter of law, the Debtor's excuses set forth in her Affidavit that her husband was responsible for producing documents and ensuring compliance with the Stipulation with respect to the rental proceeds from 63 Braggs Lane, Barnstable, Massachusetts. The Debtor was aware of her husband's financial ineptitude and the substantial judgment obtained by MHFA against him. Her decision to delegate her duties as a debtor to her non-debtor spouse with his track record of financial\n   mismanagement can only be viewed as so reckless as to establish fraudulent intent, and she produced no evidence that he in performing the duties she delegated to him acted without fraudulent intent. The Debtor had and has no legal grounds for relying upon her husband to perform her duties. Her decision to foist him on the Trustee as the party responsible for the performance of her duties undermines the words in her Affidavit. Thus, the adage, \"actions speak louder than words\" is apt in this case. Stated another way, the Court must evaluate the Debtor's conduct, which is deemed admitted, rather than her words alone. For example, the Debtor asserted in her Affidavit that she attempted to fully comply with the Trustee's request for information and never withheld documents in her possession, adding that she did not have \"any intent to conceal documents or information from the Trustee.\" The evidence overwhelmingly contravenes that statement. The Debtor was responsible for the production of documents, the accuracy of her Schedules and abiding by Court orders. Her statements that she relied upon her husband to satisfy her responsibilities is woefully insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that she did not act with the requisite fraudulent intent where the circumstances and her own words convincingly establish that he was incapable of performing those tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Count I - Section 727(a)(4)(D)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   1.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Debtor knowingly and fraudulently withheld documents from the Trustee. Counsel to the Trustee repeatedly requested substantial documentation from the Debtor about her interests in trusts, limited liability companies, and bank accounts. The Debtor did not comply with the Trustee's lawful requests, and it has been deemed admitted and conclusively established that she did not produce numerous and material documents and that some documents that she did produce were produced only after the Trustee commenced this action to deny her discharge. The documents requested by the Trustee were required for his proper administration of her bankruptcy estate and related to her asserted ownership of beneficial interests or membership interests in trusts and limited liability companies, respectively. The Debtor's failure to timely produce documents hampered the Trustee in the administration of the case, driving up administrative expenses, and prejudicing creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Debtor in her Affidavit provided no legitimate excuse for her failure to produce\n   requested documents. Her pattern of conduct establishes unequivocally that she was persistently uncooperative and evasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3648913\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/346/597/\">\n    346 B.R. at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Debtor's Affidavit fails to create a genuine issue of material fact as it is deemed admitted that she did not produce recorded information requested by the Trustee. The Debtor did not produce competent evidence that the records the Trustee sought were unavailable. Indeed, the Trustee was forced to obtain some of the documents from third parties when the Debtor failed to produce them. The Debtor did not produce any competent evidence that she made any attempts to obtain the documents other than to ask her husband to provide her with information. She did not attach to her Affidavit copies of any communications she initiated to obtain from third parties bank records, check images, account statements, or records relating to the trusts and limited liability companies in which she had interests. Although the Debtor states that she attempted to fully comply with the Trustee's request for information and never withheld documents in her possession, the deemed admissions set forth above tell a different story. The Debtor's egregious failure to produce documents despite repeated requests by the Trustee evidences a fraudulent intent to conceal information that would fully illuminate her financial condition and, as noted, she produced no competent evidence to substantiate any attempts to comply. Her reliance upon her husband to produce the records was reckless and patently unreasonable under the circumstances where he was responsible for the morass of her financial affairs. The Debtor failed to produce competent evidence that she sought a Rule 2004 examination of her spouse to ascertain what records existed and where they were. The complexity of the Debtor's ownership interests was such that she had a duty to respond to the Trustee's requests even if it meant seeking an order to compel her spouse to cooperate with her in fulfilling her duties under the Bankruptcy Code. Dumping thousands of documents on the Trustee, most of which appear not to have been responsive to his requests, cannot overcome the circumstantial evidence of fraudulent intent. The Court is not obliged to speculate as to the Debtor's motivation for withholding information from the Trustee. Her persistent dereliction of her duty gives rise to an inference of fraudulent intent that cannot be rebutted by words alone, in the absence of evidence attached to her Affidavit detailing her efforts to shed light on her financial affairs. Her delegation of her responsibilities to her spouse, her dereliction of her duties - - her \"hands off\" approach to satisfying those duties - - compels but one conclusion that she wished to withhold information from, or delay the Trustee's discovery of, information that might lead to the discovery of estate property. The Debtor failed to submit any evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact warranting denial of summary judgment on Count I.

As this Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Tully\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] petitioner cannot omit items from his schedules, force the trustee and the creditors, at their peril, to guess that he has done so-and hold them to a mythical requirement that they search through a paperwork jungle in the hope of finding an overlooked needle in a documentary haystack.\"\n   <em>\n    Tully\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716640\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/106/\">\n    818 F.2d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the Debtor signed her Schedules\n   and SOFA under penalties of perjury, she did not invest effort into ascertaining their truth and accuracy. The Debtor listed her debts as business debts. The Debtor, while describing her role in the financial affairs of her family as passive, was not unsophisticated. The complex construct of trusts and limited liability companies and her roles in them, even if passive, belies any assertion as she was unsophisticated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Finally, the Debtor never amended her schedules or SOFA when she learned of the transfers. \"Although haste may excuse numerous inaccuracies, 'no carelessness could excuse the debtor's failure to amend his papers promptly when he had the leisure to do so.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re MacDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6102915\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/50/255/#p259\">\n    50 B.R. at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Gonday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6111467\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/27/428/#p433\">\n    27 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   432 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Court concludes that (1) the Debtor made statements under oath on her Schedules and SOFA that were false. In addition, the Court concludes that, in view of the injunction entered by the Superior Court, the Debtor knew or reasonably should have known that the statement on the SOFA was false and that she omitted the transfers from the Charles Schwab Account with reckless disregard for the truth, thus establishing fraudulent intent. In this regard, disclosure of the transfers would have evidenced violation of the Superior Court's preliminary injunction. Finally, the false statement as to the absence of sizeable transfers was material to the bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    In re Sholdra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108031,11096999\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/380/\">\n    249 F.3d at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Tully\n   </em>\n   observed: \"The statutes are designed to insure that complete, truthful, and reliable information is put forward at the outset of the proceedings, so that decisions can be made by the parties in interest based on fact rather than fiction.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tully\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716640\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/106/\">\n    818 F.2d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Debtor's professed ignorance of the transfers and the status of certain limited liability companies, namely Jackbox, LLC, J.P. Realty Trust, and Cape 10-21 LLC, is unavailing in view of the totality of the circumstances. The Debtor, whose financial affairs were entangled with her husband's failed business dealings, had ownership interests in assets that had considerable value, at least at one time. She had a duty to investigate her financial affairs, obtain and produce pertinent books and records, and answers questions fully and truthfully without reliance upon her memory alone or undocumented inquiries directed to her husband. By failing to disclose aspects of her financial affairs as required by questions on the SOFA, she was derelict in her duty to answer truthfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Debtor's name was on the Charles Schwab Account regardless of whether it was used by her son or husband as a conduit for shifting funds from one entity to another. In view of the magnitude of the transfers, which were made to a company in which she had an interest, in violation of injunction issued by the Superior Court, and the depletion of that account, the Debtor's omission of transfers totaling $616,000 compels the conclusion that she acted with fraudulent intent to conceal potentially avoidable transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Debtor submitted no competent evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to Count III.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As noted above, the Debtor maintains that she did not willfully refuse to obey the Stipulation and the Court order directing her to respond to the Trustee's Motion for Order Directing Payment of Rent under Stipulation because she, as she stated in her Affidavit, was \"never included in the transaction\" and \"all discussions with the Trustee and his Counsel were through my husband.\" The Debtor failed to proffer competent or legally cognizable evidence to justify the delegation of her duties under the Stipulation to her spouse. Indeed, she produced no competent evidence of \"inadvertence, mistake, or inability to comply\" that would justify her failure to comply with her duties under the Stipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Clair v. Cadles of Grassy Meadows II, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260668\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/550/655/#p675\">\n    550 B.R. 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (E.D.N.Y. 2016). She merely delegated responsibility for adhering to the Stipulation to her husband, whose financial track record of \"financial missteps, unsuccessful investments and financial maneuvering\" she recognized in her Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The approval of the Stipulation was a Court order. The Debtor, not her husband, is the debtor in this Chapter 7 case. The Debtor executed the Stipulation, and she is a co-owner of the Braggs Lane property. As noted above, the Debtor proffered no evidence or justification for her failure to abide by the Court order approving the Stipulation and requiring a response to the Trustee's Motion. The Debtor, in essence, invites this Court to condone her passivity in the face of her duty to adhere to the Stipulation. To the extent the Debtor seeks to discharge debt in excess of $11 million, she needed to ensure compliance with the Stipulation and respond to the Court's order. She willfully ignored that responsibility just as she ignored the injunction issued by the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The Debtor failed to submit competent evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to Count IV. Accordingly, the Court shall enter summary judgment in favor of the Trustee on that count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As the Court has observed, the Debtor has exhibited a consistent and pervasive practice of firmly planting her head in the sand with respect to her duties to cooperate with the Trustee and produce documents, to honestly and forthrightly prepare her Schedules and SOFA, and to abide by Court orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tully\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716640\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/106/\">\n    818 F.2d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Debtor's pervasive disregard of\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   obligations compels but one conclusion: she intentionally thwarted the Trustee in performing\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   duties to investigate her financial affairs and to collect and reduce to money property of the estate. Isolated incidents of misconduct may be excused as unintentional, but a pervasive pattern of dereliction cannot be excused and warrants denial of the Debtor's discharge. In view of the foregoing, the Court shall enter an order granting the Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I, III, and IV.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The Court may take judicial notice of its own docket.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     LeBlanc v.
