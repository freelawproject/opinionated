The Chapter 7 Trustee and Xerox Corporation objected, asserting that the New Mexico garnishment statute is inapplicable for use by a debtor in bankruptcy to claim an exemption in otherwise non-exempt assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After considering the New Mexico statutes, the related New Mexico rules, and relevant case law, the Court concludes that the Debtors cannot rely on the New Mexico wage garnishment statute to claim an exemption in the funds deposited pre-petition into their checking account. The Court will, therefore, sustain the objections, and disallow Debtors' claimed exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtors filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on December 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. Debtors elected to claim exemptions under New Mexico law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedule C - Docket No. 1. Debtors initially claimed an exemption under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7 in $3,000 on deposit in a Wells Fargo Bank checking account, $2.00 on deposit in a Wells Fargo Bank savings account, and $5.00 in a savings account at US Eagle Federal Credit Union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Debtors claimed all other exemptions under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7\u00a7 42-10-1 through 42-10-13. The claim of exemptions under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7 is predicated on the exempted funds being proceeds of the Debtors' wages. The Chapter 7 Trustee and Xerox Corporation objected to the Debtors' claim of exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 19 and 20. The Court held a preliminary hearing on the objections to Debtors' claim of exemptions on May 1, 2018. At the hearing the Court directed the Debtors to amend their claim of exemptions based on counsel's representation that the schedules required an amendment to correct the amount of funds in the Wells Fargo Bank checking account as of the petition date. The Court took under\n   advisement the issue of whether, as a matter of law, the Debtors can claim an exemption under the New Mexico garnishment statute, N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Debtors amended their claim of exemption under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7 to reduce the amount of the claimed exemption in the funds on deposit in their checking account at Wells Fargo Bank to $1,893.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee objected to the Debtors' amended claim of exemptions on the same grounds previously raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 39. Debtors' amended claim of exemption also reflects a claimed exemption in $78.00 of the funds on deposit in their Wells Fargo Bank checking account under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7\u00a7 42-10-1, -2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court held a status conference on August 16, 2018 because there was no evidence before the Court that the source of the funds in the Wells Fargo Bank checking account in which the Debtors claim an exemption under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7 are the proceeds of the Debtors' wages. Following the status conference, the parties filed Stipulated Facts Regarding Objection to Debtors['] Claim of Exemption (\"Stipulation\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 44. The Stipulation establishes that the total amount of the funds on deposit in the Wells Fargo Bank checking account on the petition date was $2,601.98.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Of that amount, $1,819.02 was attributable to wages, and $782.96 was attributable to non-wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The objections raise the issue of whether the New Mexico garnishment statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   affords debtors in bankruptcy an exemption in wages already paid to the Debtors, in addition to the exemptions provided under New Mexico's general exemption statutes. The party objecting to a debtor's claim of exemption has the burden to establish that the exemption is not properly claimed. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(c). Because the Court finds that the exemption in wages under the New Mexico garnishment statute only applies to disposable earnings a debtor's employer still owes to a judgment debtor, the Court concludes that the New Mexico garnishment exemption is inapplicable to the funds in the Debtors' bank account in which the Debtors claimed an exemption under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7. The claimed exemption will, therefore, be disallowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Split in the Case Law Regarding Whether a Debtor in Bankruptcy May Claim an Exemption under Applicable Garnishment Statutes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Courts examining the question of whether a state law garnishment statute affords debtors in bankruptcy an exemption in wages have come to opposite conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Urban,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100060\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/262/865/\">\n    262 B.R. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

A creditor may garnish the following: 1) a debt owed to a defendant that is not exempt from garnishment; or 2) personal property belonging to the defendant. N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-1. Wages are a form of debt owed to a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To initiate a garnishment, a creditor serves a writ of garnishment on a third-party garnishee whom the creditor believes either 1) is indebted to the defendant; or 2) is in possession of property that belongs to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-2 (service on garnishee); NMRA, Rule 1-065.2(B) (service of writ of garnishment). Service of the writ of garnishment after entry of a judgment \"has the effect of attaching all personal property, money, wages or salary in excess of the amount exempt under Section 35-12-7 1978... in the garnishee's possession ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-3(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, with the sole exception of wages and salary exempt from garnishment, the writ attaches to all indebtedness of the garnishee to the defendant and to all property in the garnishee's possession or under its control.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934312\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/329/848/#p856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The writ does not attach to wages and salary exempt from garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To garnish wages, a judgment creditor serves a writ of garnishment on the judgment debtor's employer, who becomes the garnishee. The garnishment exemption statute caps the amount of disposable earnings for any pay period that can be garnished. N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-7-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because a writ of garnishment never attaches to wages and salary exempt from garnishment, a judgment debtor is not required to do anything to claim an exemption in wages under New Mexico's wage garnishment statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the \"employer as a garnishee\" is required to \"pay to the defendant, when due, the amount of his wages or salary exempt from garnishment under Section 35-12-8 NMSA 1978.\" N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-8. Thus, the exemption in wages provided in the New Mexico wage garnishment statute is applied automatically when the garnishee/employer determines, based on the maximum garnishable amount set forth in N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7, the exempt portion of wages to be paid to the judgment debtor after garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A garnishee who employs the judgment debtor continues to pay the judgment creditor the non-exempt portion of the debtor's wages until 1) the judgment is paid in full, or 2) the garnishee no longer employs the judgment debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-4(D) (if the garnishee employs the debtor, the judgment orders the garnishee to pay the creditor the non-exempt portion of the judgment debtor's wages until the judgment is satisfied, or the employment relationship is terminated, and the garnishee notifies the judgment creditor in writing that it no longer employs the judgment debtor).

That statute grants exemptions against certain real and personal property. Unlike the wage garnishment exemption, which is self-executing, any person desiring to claim an exemption under the general exemption statute must file a claim of exemption in the appropriate court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 42-10-13 (\"Any person desiring to claim that property is exempt ... shall file his claim of exemption ... in the appropriate court ...\"). For writs of execution and writs of attachment issued by a state district court, the New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure set forth a procedure for claiming the exemptions of personal property under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7\u00a7 42-10-1 to 42-10-7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMRA, Rule 1-065(J) and Rule 1-065.1(C). For writs of garnishment other than wage garnishments, NMRA, Rule 1-065.2(G) and (H) set forth a procedure whereby the judgment debtor must file a claim of exemption with the court and serve the claim of exemption on the judgment creditor and garnishee to preserve a claim of exemption. Failure to timely file and serve a claim of an exemption in personal property available under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7\u00a7 42-10-1 to 42-10-7 results in waiver of the exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMRA, Rule 1-065.2(I) (\"If the judgment debtor fails to [timely] file a claim of exemption ... the judgment debtor shall be deemed to have waived the right to claim a statutory exemption other than wages.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The Meaning of New Mexico's Wage Garnishment Exemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As with all questions of statutory construction under New Mexico law, interpretation of the wage exemption provisions of the New Mexico wage garnishment statute depends on the meaning of the language used and the intended purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Youth &amp; Families Dep't v.

To discern the meaning of a statute, the Court first looks to the language of the statute itself; if the meaning is clear, the inquiry ordinarily is complete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A careful examination of the New Mexico garnishment statute leads to the conclusion that the wage garnishment exemption contained in the statute applies only to wages or salary due from the employer to the judgment debtor and does not apply to wages or salary once paid to the judgment debtor. Section 35-12-8 requires\n   the \"employer charged as garnishee\" to \"pay to the defendant, when due, the amount of his wages or salary exempt from garnishment under Section 35-12-7 NMSA 1978.\" N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-8. This language indicates that the exemption applies only to wages due from the employer to the judgment debtor because it directs the garnishee to pay the exempt portion of the wages to the judgment debtor when the wages become due. The employer must calculate and pay the exempt amount of wages and salary due to its employee and withhold the nonexempt amount for the benefit of the judgment creditor. Because the plain statutory language limits the exempt portion of a judgment debtor's wages to a portion of the earnings the employer owes the judgment debtor, it follows that the garnishment exemption in wages does not apply to wages once paid to the judgment debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The self-executing nature of the wage garnishment exemption also supports the conclusion that the exemption does not apply to the proceeds of wages on deposit in a bank account. Unlike exemptions claimed under the New Mexico general exemption statute, there is no mechanism in the garnishment statute for a garnishee who is not the debtor's employer to withhold any exempt proceeds of wages from the judgment creditor. The judgment debtor does not serve a wage garnishment claim of exemption on the judgment creditor or garnishee and does not file a claim of a garnishment exemption with a court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The statutory form of writ of garnishment, contained in N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-18, further reinforces the conclusion that the garnishment exemption applies only to wages due from the employer to the judgment debtor. Section 35-12-18 provides that writs of garnishment must be in substantially the form set out in that section. As it relates to wages, the statutory writ of garnishment form states that, if the writ was issued in aid of execution of judgment, it \"attaches wages or salary\n   <em>\n    due from you to the defendant\n   </em>\n   \" in excess of the amount exempt from garnishment under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7(A). N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-18 (emphasis added). The statutory form also prohibits the garnishee from paying the nonexempt amount to the judgment debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20P.3d%20865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As it relates to wages, the required statutory form of writ of garnishment is designed only for garnishing wages due from the employer to the judgment debtor and makes no sense if it were applied to garnish the proceeds of wages on deposit in a bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Once wages or salary are paid and deposited into a debtor's bank account, a debtor must rely on the exemptions available under New Mexico's general exemption statutes to protect such funds.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 42-10-1 (providing an exemption in personal property); N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 42-10-10 (exemption in lieu of homestead). To claim an exemption under\n   the general exemption statute set forth in N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7\u00a7 42-10-1 to 42-10-13, the debtor files a claim of exemption, and the court adjudicates the validity of the claim if it is in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Portal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260733\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/132/171/\">\n    2002-NMSC-011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260733\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/132/171/\">\n    132 N.M. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260733\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/132/171/\">\n    45 P.3d 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing the meaning of a New Mexico exemption statute).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   If a writ of garnishment is served on a bank that is not the judgment debtor's employer, the bank does not owe any wages or salary to the judgment debtor. In that instance, neither the judgment creditor nor the bank must ascertain whether or to what extent funds on deposit in the judgment debtor's bank account are proceeds of wages or salary paid to the debtor. This is so because the New Mexico garnishment statute only requires a garnishee that is the judgment debtor's employer to withhold the nonexempt portion of the judgment debtor's wages as determined under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-4(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, $1,918.02 of the funds in the Debtors' Wells Fargo bank account that the parties stipulate to be proceeds of wages are not subject to the wage garnishment exemption.

The New Mexico garnishment statute allows the judgment debtor to receive the exempt portion of his or her wages over the life of the garnishment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-4(D) (the garnishee continues to pay the non-exempt portion of the debtor's wages to the judgment creditor and the exempt portion of the debtor's wages to the debtor until the judgment is satisfied or the employment relationship terminates).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   However, wages deposited into a judgment debtor's bank account lose their character as wages for purposes of the New Mexico garnishment statute. As funds on deposit, they are only subject to the general property exemptions under New Mexico law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Many judgment debtors whose wages are being garnished will not likely forfeit the remaining seventy-five percent of the exempt wages deposited into a bank account because a judgment creditor who wishes to garnish a debtor's bank account must serve a separate writ of garnishment on the bank. Unlike wage garnishments, garnishment of a judgment debtor's bank account is not continuing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-3 (the effect of garnishment on the garnishee is to attach personal property of the judgment debtor that is in possession of the garnishee as of the time the writ is served, or that comes into the garnishee's possession or control between the time of service and the time the garnishee files its answer to the writ). As a practical matter, wages paid to a judgment debtor will be unavailable to satisfy a judgment if the debtor spends the wages deposited into his or her bank account before a judgment creditor serves a writ of garnishment on the judgment debtor's bank, or if the wages are deposited in the account after the garnishee files its answer to the writ of garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   If a debtor in bankruptcy could rely on the New Mexico wage garnishment exemption to exempt proceeds of wages deposited into a bank account, it is possible that a debtor could exempt wages in an amount much greater than the New Mexico wage garnishment exemption statute is intended to protect: a debtor could use a bank account to accumulate funds over time, and then shelter the funds from creditors by claiming exempt 75% of the total amount on deposit, regardless of amount, provided the debtor could trace the proceeds of the funds on deposit in the bank account to wages. As noted by the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of Illinois:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In light of the purpose for wage garnishment caps, it is perfectly understandable that Illinois would protect a portion of unpaid wages from garnishing creditors, while affording no special protection to wages once paid. The purpose of the garnishment caps is to protect a wage earner living paycheck to paycheck from losing his entire earnings so that he is left destitute with no ability to pay necessary family living expenses.... Once he deposits the wages into a bank account, however, the funds become fair game for creditors. An insolvent person may not accumulate and shelter funds in a bank account simply because they derive from wages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Thum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934312\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/329/848/#p856\">\n    329 B.R. at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court will sustain the Trustee's objection to the Debtor's claimed exemption and disallow the Debtor's exemption claimed under N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 35-12-7.
