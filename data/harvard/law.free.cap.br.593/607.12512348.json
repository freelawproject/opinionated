Hanan, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff CoVantage Credit Union filed a complaint seeking to except from discharge a debt resulting from the debtor's presentation of bad checks, relying on both 11 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B). The debtor did not respond to the complaint, so CoVantage moved for default judgment. Realizing that its two legal theories were inconsistent and mutually exclusive, CoVantage pursued judgment on only the claim under section 523(a)(2)(A). The Court held two prove-up hearings on the motion, at which counsel for CoVantage submitted supporting evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After considering counsel's submissions and arguments, and the record in this case, the Court will grant the motion. Because the Court lacks sufficient evidence to determine the appropriate amount of the nondischargeable debt in one aspect, the Court will defer entering an order for judgment until CoVantage supplements the record with additional information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Eastern District of Wisconsin's July 16, 1984, order of reference.

So, to determine whether Ms. Stangel intended to defraud CoVantage at the time she tendered her NSF checks, the following factors are relevant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   1. The length of time between when the checks were issued and the bankruptcy filing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   2.

Whether the debtor used the money received from the checks to purchase luxuries or necessities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500270\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/266/686/#p694\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These factors are not exhaustive or determinative, and a plaintiff need not make a showing on each one before being entitled to a judgment on its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this case, the above factors weigh in favor of CoVantage's assertion that Ms. Stangel did not intend to repay her debt to CoVantage at the time she incurred it. Ms. Stangel issued the checks only two months before she filed her bankruptcy petition, and at least four months after retaining her bankruptcy attorney. All of the checks were issued at a time when Ms. Stangel's Associated Bank checking account had been closed for more than three months. While it is slightly troubling that the bank statements provided by CoVantage are undated, they are addressed to her at the same address she listed in her petition, and other evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Ms. Stangel knew she was using an account that lacked funds sufficient to cover the checks presented to CoVantage. The account last had a positive balance in June 2016. From early May until the account was closed, it incurred $441 in overdraft fees and $245 in returned item fees (for at least two returned checks). The total amount of the checks presented to CoVantage is more than three times Ms. Stangel's apparent monthly income at the time, and the checks were cashed within a 30-hour period. Also probative of Ms. Stangel's intent is her failure to respond to the plaintiff's November 29 demand letter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hostetter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9029957\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/320/674/#p679\">\n    320 B.R. at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In the Court's view, this form of notification [sending a written notice of the dishonor of the check]\n   <em>\n    coupled with the complete failure of the debtor to respond either by any payment or any communication,\n   </em>\n   has some probative value with respect to intent.\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Some factors either are neutral, or tend to weigh against a finding of fraudulent intent. For example, the record does not contain any evidence about Ms. Stangel's prospects for higher-paying employment. Nor does it show whether she used the money received from the checks to purchase luxuries or necessities-but, the debts listed on Schedule E/F are primarily medical and do not suggest profligate credit card spending or otherwise hint at the purchase of \"luxuries.\" Her personal property consists primarily of a car, a bunk bed, and a lamp. The record also is devoid of any information concerning whether the debtor's cashing of the checks with CoVantage reflected a sudden change in her banking activity. Although counsel for CoVantage stated in a March 2018 letter to the Court that Ms. Stangel's behavior was atypical,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CM-ECF Doc. No. 14 (\"before these transactions, the Debtor hadn't used her CVCU account since March 2016, which she used exclusively for the purposes of having her tax returns [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] automatically deposited\"), no evidence was submitted to corroborate that assertion, and therefore the Court does not consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On balance, however, the evidence establishes a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of nondischargeability. The timing of when Ms. Stangel cashed the checks, as well as her bankruptcy filing, suggest that she presented the checks when she knew they would be returned, and that she intended to file for bankruptcy and discharge the debt rather than repay it. This is sufficient to satisfy CoVantage's burden regarding Ms. Stangel's liability for nondischargeable damages. The same is not true, however, as to the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of those damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because CoVantage did not reduce its debt to judgment prior to the debtor's bankruptcy, the Court also must determine the amount of the nondischargeable debt. CoVantage's complaint suggests two different numbers for the \"actual damages\" it suffered as a result of Ms. Stangel's fraudulent conduct: $2,405.25, and $2,500.30 (a third of the requested treble damage amount). The evidence, however, shows that Ms. Stangel withdrew a total of\n   $2,400 from the funds created by depositing the NSF checks. That is the amount of actual damages supported by the record, and on which the Court will base the judgment. The Court will not speculate about what the additional $5.25 or $100.30 represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   CoVantage also requests attorney fees and treble damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20895.446\">\n    Wis.

At the second prove-up hearing, the Court requested that CoVantage's counsel file an affidavit of fees and costs to support an award under this subsection.

Counsel frames the question as \"whether an award of treble damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20895.446\">\n    Wis.

But the court in\n   <em>\n    Polus\n   </em>\n   was not asked to determine whether exemplary damages under the Wisconsin statute were mandatory or discretionary-only whether the evidence in that case supported such an award (and it did not).

Other factors regarding a defendant's conduct that \"make trial of a punitive or exemplary damage claim by affidavit inappropriate\" include \"the seriousness of the hazard to the public, [and] the profitability and duration of the improper conduct,\" while mitigating factors include \"the age of the offender; the attitude and conduct of the offender upon detection; fines and forfeitures already imposed; ... or that the defendant is a person of modest means who will be severely punished by a relatively small amount of punitive damages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8667832\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/147/589/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 602,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8667832\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/147/589/\">\n    433 N.W.2d 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, the case law is clear that exemplary damages under Wis. Stat. section 895.446(3)(c) are discretionary, and that the Court must make a reasonable inquiry and examination of the facts-including into circumstances like those listed above in\n   <em>\n    Shopko\n   </em>\n   -to determine whether exemplary damages are appropriate. The Court will exercise the discretion afforded by the statute in declining to award exemplary damages here. Where there has been no appearance by the debtor, and only a circumstantial showing of intent by default, the Court is reluctant to treble damages-particularly damages that the debtor will not be able to discharge-without knowing more about the debtor's circumstances and motivation at the time the debt was incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For example, was the debtor, like Jean Valjean, facing dire conditions that required incurring the debt-in a short or acute window of time-to pay for food or other necessities? Was CoVantage only one of many \"victims\" in a long-running scheme to defraud banks and credit unions, or did the debtor's presentation of NSF checks in November 2016 represent an isolated occurrence? The debtor's schedules do not suggest excessive credit card debt, and an award of treble damages would exceed nine months' worth of the debtor's take-home pay. CoVantage has presented no evidence of recidivism or anything that would otherwise suggest the debtor's conduct was so egregious to deserve punitive sanctions. Keeping in mind that bankruptcy courts routinely draw inferences of intent in favor of a debtor's discharge,\n   <em>\n    In re Trevisan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9081774\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/300/708/#p713\">\n    300 B.R. at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court will not infer malicious motivation or reprehensible conduct on the debtor's part, without more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based on the evidence submitted, the Court concludes that CoVantage has proven a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of \"actual fraud\" under 11 U.S.C. section 523(a)(2)(A), and that it has suffered actual damages of $2,400 as a result. For the reasons stated above, the Court will not treble those damages under Wis. Stat. section 895.446(3)(c). And while reasonably-incurred attorneys' fees are allowable under Wis. Stat. section 895.446(3)(b), the Court cannot determine the appropriate amount to award based on the record before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court ORDERS that CoVantage's motion for default judgment is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that CoVantage shall have\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     14 days from the date of this order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to submit an affidavit of fees and costs that CoVantage seeks to recover under Wis. Stat. section 895.446(3)(b). In addition to including an itemization of counsel's time and the work performed, the affidavit must include sufficient information for the Court to ascertain (1) the amount of fees actually incurred; and (2) whether those fees are reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stathus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103355\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/260/166/\">\n    260 Wis.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103355\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/260/166/\">\n    659 N.W.2d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
