(Sale Order \u00b6 9.) It stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Except for the Assumed Liabilities expressly set forth in the Purchase Agreement or described therein or Claims against any Purchased Company, none of the Purchaser, its successors or assigns or any of their respective affiliates shall have any liability for any Claim that (a) arose prior to the Closing Date, (b)\n   <em>\n    relates to the production of vehicles prior to the Closing Date\n   </em>\n   or (c) otherwise is assertable against the Debtors or is related to the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date....

They included \"all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale of Products or Inventory prior to the Closing.\" (MTA \u00a7 2.09(i).) The MTA broadly defined an excluded Product Liability Claim as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   any Action arising out of, or otherwise relating to in any way in respect of claims for personal injury, wrongful\n   death or property damage resulting from exposure to, or any other warranty claims, refunds, rebates, property damage, product recalls, defective material claims, merchandise returns and/or any similar claims, or any other claim or cause of action, whether such claim is known or unknown or asserted or unasserted with respect to, Products or items purchased, sold, consigned, marketed, stored, delivered, distributed or transported by [Old Chrysler].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (MTA Definitions Addendum, at p. 90,\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   by Amendment No. 1 to MTA, at \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By Stipulation and Order, dated Nov. 19, 2009, the parties amended section 2.08(h) to the MTA to expand the scope of Assumed Liabilities relating to Product Liability Claims. (ECF Doc. # 5988.) As amended, New Chrysler assumed liability for post-Closing accidents involving vehicles manufactured and sold by Old Chrysler before the Closing, but the assumption expressly excluded liability for punitive damages. Under the amendment (\"Amendment No. 4\"), Assumed Liabilities included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (i) all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale after the Closing of Products or Inventory manufactured by Sellers or their Subsidiaries in whole or in part prior to the Closing and (ii) all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale on or prior to the Closing of motor vehicles ... solely to the extent such Product Liability Claims (A) arise directly from motor vehicle accidents occurring on or after Closing, (B) are not barred by any statute of limitations, (C) are not claims including or related to any alleged exposure to any asbestos-containing material or any other Hazardous Material and (D)\n   <em>\n    do not include any claim for exemplary or punitive damages\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (MTA, Amendment No. 4, \u00b6 1 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, the Sale Order acknowledged New Chrysler's obligation to comply with the National Transportation and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (\"NTMVSA\"), as applicable to the business of New Chrysler after the Closing, and New Chrysler further\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   agreed to assume as Assumed Liabilities under the Purchase Agreement and this Sale Order the Debtors' notification, remedy and other obligations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030116\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   through 30120 of the NTMVSA relating to vehicles manufactured by the Debtors prior to the Closing Date that have a defect related to motor vehicle safety or do not to [sic] comply with applicable motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under the NTMVSA.

The\n    <em>\n     Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Frankie Overton (\"Overton\"), as administrator of the estate of Sue Ann Graham (the \"Decedent\"), and Scott Graham (\"Graham,\" and together with Overton, the \"Plaintiffs\"), as legal guardian of the Decedent's minor son, J.G., filed the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   in Alabama State Court against, among others, New Chrysler.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subject of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   is a car accident that occurred in Alabama on June 10, 2016. The Decedent and J.G. were riding as passengers in a 2002 Jeep Liberty (the \"Jeep\" or \"Vehicle\") when a vehicle driven by defendant Rodericus Obyran Carrington struck the Jeep causing it to overturn. (\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The Decedent sustained fatal injuries; J.G. sustained non-fatal injuries as well as mental and emotional injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Plaintiffs brought claims in Alabama State Court pursuant to the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine (\"AEMLD\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and under theories of negligence and wantonness. (\n   <em>\n    See Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-34, 41-59.) The claims directed at New Chrysler alleged that the proximate cause of the Plaintiffs' injuries was the defective design, manufacture and sale of the Vehicle, (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31, 45, 52), or alternatively, the failure to warn or recall the Vehicle despite New Chrysler's knowledge of the defective condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 47, 56.) The\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleged in numerous places that New Chrysler, among others, designed, manufactured and sold the Vehicle, (\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 30, 42, 50, 51), but this is not plausible. The Vehicle was apparently manufactured and sold in or around 2002, and New Chrysler did not come into existence until the 2009 sale transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Overton sought damages under the Alabama Wrongful Death Act (\"AWDA,\" and collectively with its predecessors, the \"Wrongful Death Act\") as a result of the death of the Decedent (the \"Overton Claims\"). (\n   <em>\n    See Complaint\n   </em>\n   at pp. 8, 11, 14-15.) Graham, on behalf of J.G. who survived the accident, sought compensatory damages on all of his claims and punitive damages with respect to claims based on New Chrysler's post-Closing conduct (the \"Graham Claims\").

(\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Brief\n   </em>\n   20-21.) This argument is not new. It has been considered and rejected in analogous situations involving federal statutes that preclude the recovery of punitive damages. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Painter v. Tenn. Valley Auth.,\n   </em>\n   the personal representative of decedent's estate brought an action under the Wrongful Death Act against the TVA. The District Court dismissed the action because the Wrongful Death Act was limited to the recovery of punitive damages, and punitive damages could not be recovered against the United States or its agencies.\n   <em>\n    Painter v.

Moreover, there are strong federal policies that favor the interpretation of Amendment No. 4 advocated by New Chrysler. The exclusion at issue was contained in a contract of sale approved by the Court.

The Plaintiffs do not make the\n   untenable argument that the parties to Amendment No. 4 understood that they were limiting New Chrysler's liability for punitive damages based on egregious conduct but not based on ordinary negligent conduct.

The result flows from interpretation accorded to the nature of the damages recoverable under the Wrongful Death Act. Since\n   <em>\n    Savannah,\n   </em>\n   the Alabama Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the plaintiff in a wrongful death action may recover only punitive damages, and evidence supporting a compensatory award is irrelevant.

The anomaly, or absurd result, noted by the\n   <em>\n    Painter\n   </em>\n   Court forty-five years ago still persists, and despite major tort reform legislation in 1987 (and decisions like\n   <em>\n    Painter\n   </em>\n   and academic and judicial criticism), the Alabama legislature has chosen not to change the Wrongful Death Act to permit the award of compensatory damages in wrongful death actions.\n   <em>\n    Tillis Trucking v.

While the result is unsatisfactory, the Court is powerless to change the result.

They consist of (i) compensatory damage claims based on the actions of Old Chrysler and/or New Chrysler whether pre- or post-Closing, and (ii) punitive damage claims based on the post-Closing actions of New Chrysler. The compensatory damage claims clearly fall within the purview of the additional claims assumed by New Chrysler under Amendment No. 4. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amendment No. 4 \u00b6 1 (New Chrysler will assume \"all Product Liability Claims arising from the sale ... prior to the Closing of motor vehicles ... manufactured by [Old Chrysler] and distributed and sold as a ...

They are not barred by the Sale Order or the relevant contractual provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The allegations pertaining to the punitive damage claims based on post-Closing conduct are sparse and conclusory. The\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   states that \"the defective condition of the Jeep Liberty was known by [New Chrysler] and/or former Chrysler companies absorbed by [New Chrysler], and that knowledge was transferred to [New Chrysler].
