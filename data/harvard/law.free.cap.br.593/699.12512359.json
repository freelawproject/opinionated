Rosen had known Barberi for around 10 years and previously had completed art transactions with her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124596\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/243/687/#p691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Barberi suggested to Rosen the possibility of entering into a transaction with the Gallery, through Chowaiki, with regard to a watercolor and ink painting entitled\n   <em>\n    Schichtenweise\n   </em>\n   by the late Russian Expressionist-Abstract painter Wassily Kandinsky (the \"\n   <em>\n    Kandinsky\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, 11. In an email dated October 11, 2017, Barberi explained to Rosen that the Gallery was \"looking to either sell [the Kandinsky] and make a profit or buy it from [its] current owner and share the investment with a partner and then resell [it] and make a substantial profit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Barberi stated that \"time was of the essence\" because Chowaiki was concerned that \"another buyer [would] buy it before he [got] the funds together.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Barberi represented to Rosen that Chowaiki was trustworthy and that they were close friends, having engaged in \"a lot of business together [in the past].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rosen spoke with Chowaiki by telephone on October 12, 2017, whereupon they discussed the Kandinsky offer and Chowaiki proposed that Rosen could participate in a joint purchase of the\n   <em>\n    Schichtenweise\n   </em>\n   painting with Barberi and the Gallery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.

Chowaiki clarified that the Gallery would be required to pay $950,000 to buy the painting before re-selling it for $1.2 million and that if Rosen was interested in participating they could make the return proportional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After engaging in negotiations, Rosen and Chowaiki agreed that for a 24% interest in the Kandinsky, Rosen would pay $230,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 23, 2017, Rosen caused $230,000 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Wired Funds\n   </em>\n   \") to be transferred from his wife's bank account (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bank Account\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Account\n   </em>\n   \") to the Gallery's bank account in New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Exh.

In addition, she reported that Chowaiki and the Gallery's majority owner, David Dangoor, were being accused of fraud in which they had allegedly lured investors and collectors into paying money for artworks by renowned artists that neither the Gallery nor its principles owned or had any right to sell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 n.1.

Soon thereafter, on November 27, 2017, the Gallery filed its schedules of assets and liabilities, listing assets of $276,681.59 and liabilities of $11,877,011.03.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Summary of Assets and Liabilities for Non-Individuals [Case No. 17-13228, ECF No. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shortly after the Petition Date, Rosen initiated this adversary proceeding\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking: (i) a declaratory judgment finding that\n   the Gallery had fraudulently induced Rosen to transfer the Wired Funds to the Gallery's bank account in New York (\"\n   <em>\n    Count I\n   </em>\n   \"); (ii) a declaratory judgment that under both section 541(d) of the Bankruptcy Code and New York state law, the Gallery has no equitable interest in the Wired Funds and thus they are not part of the Gallery's bankruptcy estate (\"\n   <em>\n    Count II\n   </em>\n   \"); and (iii) the imposition of a constructive trust and the immediate turnover of the Wired Funds to Rosen (\"\n   <em>\n    Count III\n   </em>\n   \"). Am. Compl. at 12. In lieu of an answer, the Trustee moved to dismiss under Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the Trustee raised the issue of Rosen's standing to bring this adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hearing Tr. 21-22:20-7. The Trustee argued that it was unclear who was the real party in interest in this case, since the Wired Funds had been transferred from a bank account belonging to Rosen's wife, rather than Rosen himself.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   23:7-13. While Rosen conceded that the Wired Funds were transferred from his wife's account, he maintained that he had standing because the Wired Funds in fact belonged to him, notwithstanding the name on the account.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   41:6-13. Rosen also argued that as husband and wife, he and the account owner should be considered one economic unit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   42-43:24-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the standing issue was first introduced at the First Hearing, the Court ordered supplemental briefing regarding the standing issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   68-69:23-10; So-Ordered Stipulation Scheduling Supplemental Briefing [ECF No. 19]. After further briefing on standing, the Court held a Second Hearing on the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    The Record with Respect to the Bank Account from which the Funds were Transferred\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is undisputed, and the evidence submitted in connection with the supplemental briefing on the standing issue confirms, that the Bank Account from which Rosen caused the Wired Funds to be transferred is an account at Edmond de Rothschild Bank registered in the name of Orian Levin, who is Rosen's wife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Levin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Levin opened the Bank Account on March 12, 2006, and on the same day she, granted Rosen power of attorney over the Bank Account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heerde Decl. Exh. A; Levin Decl. Exh. A. Additionally, on July 21, 2011, Rosen and Orion Levin filed with the Bank a document called Form A - Declaration of Identity of the Beneficial Owner, which listed both Rosen and Levin as beneficial owners\n   of the funds in the Account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Levin Decl. Exh. C (Form A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rosen and Levin have each submitted declarations attesting that although the Bank Account is in Levin's name, they \"consider[ed] all the funds in the Account to be joint property\" and that it is their \"mutual understanding that each of [them is] equally entitled to use all the funds in the Account.\" Rosen Decl. \u00b6 7.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Levin Decl. \u00b6 8 (\"Shay [Rosen] and I consider all funds in the Account to be our joint property. It is our mutual understanding that each of us are equally entitled to use all the funds in the Account.\"). Each also attested that Rosen manages the Account, communicates with the Bank regarding the Account, and uses funds in the Account in his discretion, for example, by executing withdrawals and deposits for purchases and sales of art relating to his art business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosen Decl. \u00b6 8; Levin Decl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (ii)\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Briefings on the Issue of Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his supplemental memorandum on the standing issue, the Trustee contends that Rosen lacks standing because both the complaint and the attached exhibits demonstrate that the Wired Funds - the subject of this adversary proceeding - were transferred from Levin's account, and therefore, Rosen could not allege injury to property in which he held an interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Standing Memo. \u00b6 16. The Trustee argues that New York law presumes that once funds are deposited into a bank account, the account holder is the party that has title to those funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee also disputes Rosen's assertions that a husband and wife should be considered one economic unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Moreover, the Trustee argues, leave to further amend should not be granted on the grounds of futility, since even if Levin were to be substituted as the named plaintiff, she would be unable to factually maintain the causes of action that Rosen pleads since there were no allegations that Chowaiki made any (mis)representations to her upon which she relied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29, 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rosen argues in his supplemental memorandum that his allegations, if taken as true, are sufficient to establish standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosen's Standing Memo. at 3. In connection with his supplemental briefing, Rosen filed his declaration and a declaration from his wife. Rosen also supplemented the record with documentation reflecting that he has power of attorney over the account, and that he is listed as a beneficial owner of the account pursuant to the Form A document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Levin Decl. Exh. A. Rosen argues that, taken in its totality, this evidence demonstrates that he has a sufficient interest in the Account to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement for standing. Rosen Standing Memo at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In reply, the Trustee disputes the significance of Rosen's supporting documents. Reply to Plaintiff's Supplemental Briefing Concerning Plaintiff Shay Rosen's Standing \u00a7 I \u00b6 2, \u00a7 II \u00b6 8-11 (\"\n   <em>\n    Trustee 2nd Standing Reply\n   </em>\n   \") [ECF No. 34]. The Trustee argues that the designation of Rosen as a \"beneficial owner\" on Form A is simply a banking formality required by Swiss authorities as part of their anti-money laundering statutes; it does not equate to an ownership interest sufficient enough to\n   confer standing to bring an adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trustee 2nd Standing Reply at \u00a7 III. The Trustee references the definition of \"beneficial owner\" set out by the Financial Action Task Force, an inter-governmental body that develops policies to protect against money laundering:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a customer and/or the natural person [on] whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. It also includes those persons who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FATF,\n   <em>\n    International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation: The FATF Recommendations\n   </em>\n   , at 111 (2012). The Trustee argues that the \"beneficial owner\" designation merely refers to the entity that exercises control over the legal owner of the account; however, such control over the legal person does not equate to legal ownership for the purposes of standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the Trustee emphasizes that the policy behind requiring account holders to name \"beneficiary owners\" is to combat money laundering, not to construe civil ownership of funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Thus, the Trustee argues, the \"beneficiary owner\" designation does not stand for the proposition that Rosen has a property interest in the funds in the account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304103\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/117/923/#p925\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In support of this contention, the Trustee argues that, pursuant to New York state law, once funds are deposited in a bank account, the account holder is presumed to have title to those funds. It is undisputed that the Wired Funds were transferred from a bank account owned by Orion Levi, Am. Compl. \u00b6 16, and not Plaintiff Rosen. Hence, the Trustee asserts that the Amended Complaint does not allege injury to property in which Rosen owns an interest and therefore Rosen cannot establish an actual, personal injury in fact sufficient to establish his constitutional standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rosen argues that the Trustee's argument fails for two reasons. First, he contends that there is no inherent inconsistency in the allegation that Rosen owned funds in an account under Orion Levin's name, and, on a motion to dismiss, the Court is required to accept as true Rosen's factual allegations relating to standing. Next, Rosen urges that the Supplemental Declarations establish that while the Account is maintained under Levin's name, Rosen and Levin have mutual ownership of the funds in the Bank Account, thereby rebutting the New York state law presumption of ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This Court finds that Rosen has meet his burden in alleging facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that he suffered a concrete injury sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As a general rule, New York law presumes that \"once funds are deposited in a bank account, the account holder has title to and control over those funds.\"\n   <em>\n    LFD Operating, Inc. v.
