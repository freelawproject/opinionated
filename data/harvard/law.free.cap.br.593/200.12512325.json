The Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss on September 4, 2018, and the Debtors filed a Reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss on September 18, 2018.

The Debtors' Organizational Structure and Operations\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Pre-bankruptcy, the Debtors bought, improved, and sold high-end luxury homes, as well as owned and operated full-service real estate brokerages, a private investment company, and real estate lending operations. (\u00b6 25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The Debtors conducted their business through a network of affiliated companies that own the various assets comprising its businesses. (\u00b6 27).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The Debtors' ultimate parent is RS Protection Trust. (\u00b6 28).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 WMF Management, LLC, a debtor in this Court, is a wholly owned subsidiary of RS Protection Trust, that operated the retail fundraising aspect of the Debtors' business and owns seven investment fund entities (the \"Funds\"). (\u00b6\u00b6 29-33).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 The Funds' business purpose was to solicit and raise money from members of the general public (including individuals, couples, trusts, and small businesses) to fund the Debtors' real estate and investment operations. The Funds also serviced the debt they raised by collecting loan proceeds from the property owners and paying the noteholders. (\u00b6 34-35).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 The Debtors, their affiliates and their representatives specifically targeted elderly individuals as part of their marketing process through advertisements on financial radio programs and retirement seminars. These elderly individuals often became noteholders. (\u00b6 56).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 In a typical transaction, a noteholder would loan a fixed amount to a Fund pursuant to a loan agreement for the stated purpose of enabling the Fund to lend money to a third-party borrower. The Fund would contemporaneously enter into a promissory note with the noteholder evidencing the Fund's financial obligation to the noteholder. (\u00b6\u00b6 36-37).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The Fund would solicit several noteholders for funds to facilitate the third-party borrower's purchase of a parcel of real property. (\u00b6 39).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The third-party borrower was either a mezzanine holding company (\"MezzCo\") owned by the Debtors' parent company, or a single property real estate company (\"PropCo\") owned by a MezzCo. (\u00b6 38)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 The MezzCo or PropCo would use money from the Fund to purchase or construct upon a parcel of real property.

(\u00b6 41).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 The loan agreement [between the noteholder - or member of the general public - and the Fund] stated that the noteholder's loan would be secured by a security interest in the Fund's present and future right, title and interest in and to (i) the loan from the Fund to the third-party\n   borrower, (ii) the promissory note evidencing that loan, (iii) the mortgage or deed of trust securing that loan, and (iv) insurance policies in connection with the loan. (\u00b6 42).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 In connection therewith, the Fund would execute [in favor of the noteholder]: (i) an assignment of the Fund's right, title and interest in the promissory note reflecting the loan and the related mortgage or deed of trust in connection with the real property, and (ii) a collateral assignment, pursuant to which the Fund assigned to the noteholder the Fund's right, title and interest in the same underlying documents, proceeds and rights thereunder. (\u00b6 43)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, the original documents evidencing the transactions were not retained by the noteholder, but remained in the Fund or Debtor's possession at all times. (\u00b6 44).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 The proceeds from the sale of properties would be disbursed by the applicable PropCo or MezzCo to the Fund, which would in turn use the proceeds to repay lenders [noteholders], among other things, (\u00b6 46).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 The Debtors estimate that the Funds, and thereby the Debtors, received approximately $750 million in loans from approximately 9,000 noteholders. (\u00b6 47).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Woodbridge Mortgage Investment Fund 3A (\"Fund 3A\"), also a debtor before this Court, is the largest Fund. It received over $248 million from approximately 2,822 noteholders. (\u00b6\u00b6 48-50).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Fund 3A was in the business of exchanging with members of the public promissory notes collateralized by liens on real properties acquired by a PropCo. (\u00b6 51).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2. The Plaintiffs' Loan Agreement and Collateral Assignment with Fund 3A\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 The Plaintiffs were solicited by the Funds to invest money and became noteholders with Fund 3A. The Plaintiffs used, among other moneys, retirement funds to make the loans. For some Plaintiffs, the loan amount was their entire retirement fund. (\u00b6\u00b6 54, 55, 57).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 The Plaintiffs were noteholders with Fund 3A in connection with real property located at 141 South Carolwood Drive, Holmby Hills, California (the \"Owlwood Estate\" or the \"Property\"). (\u00b6 59).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, the Plaintiffs entered into written loan agreements with Fund 3A prior to lending funds to Fund 3A (the \"Owlwood Loan Agreements\") (\u00b6 60).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Pursuant to the Owlwood Loan Agreements, the Plaintiffs lent Fund 3A funds for the stated purpose of funding a secured loan from Fund 3A to a third-party borrower, in this case Sturmer Pippen Investments, LLC (\"SPI\"). SPI is also a debtor in this Court and, upon information and belief, is the PropCo that owns the Owlwood Estate. (\u00b6\u00b6 61-64).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Under the terms of the Owlwood Loan Agreements, the Plaintiffs were granted \"a security interest in all of [Fund 3A's] present and future right, title and interest in and to - (i) that certain loan in the principal amount of $63 million extended to SPI and secured by a first priority lien on the Property (the \"Pledged Loan\"), (ii) the promissory note evidencing the Pledged Loan, (iii) the mortgage and deed of trust securing the Pledged Loan with an interest on the Property, and (iv) title insurance policies and other instruments or\n   documentation as may be executed and delivered to Woodbridge in conjunction with the Pledged Loan. (\u00b6 65).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 The Fund serviced the debt it raised by collecting loan proceeds from the property owners and paying the Plaintiff-noteholders. (\u00b6 66).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Paragraph 2(f) of the Owlwood Loan Agreements states that \"Woodbridge retains the right to execute other notes, loan agreements, assignments, and collateral assigmnents in favor of other lenders as may be necessary to fund the Pledged Loan secured by the Collateral [Property] on a\n   <em>\n    pari passu\n   </em>\n   basis with such other lenders.\" (\u00b6 68).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, in exchange for the Owlwood Loans, Fund 3A executed promissory notes (the \"Owlwood Lender Notes\") in favor of the Plaintiffs evidencing Fund 3A's financial obligation to the Plaintiffs pursuant to the Owlwood Loan Agreements. (\u00b6 69).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 Paragraph 14 of the Owlwood Lender Notes provide that the Owlwood Lender Notes were secured by the \"Collateral Assignment Documents,\" defined therein as the \"Note, the Loan Agreement of even date herewith between [Fund 3A and the Plaintiffs] ... and all other instruments executed or to be executed in connection therewith.\" (\u00b6 70).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, Fund 3A executed other notes, loan agreements assigmnents, and collateral assignments as contemplated in the Owlwood Loan Agreements. (\u00b6 71).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, Fund 3A executed an \"Assignment of Promissory Note and Mortgage\" and \"Collateral Assignment of Note, Mortgage and Other Loan Documents\" (collectively, the \"Collateral Assignment\"). (\u00b6 72).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 As stated in the Collateral Assignment, a condition of the Owlwood Loans was that Fund 3A would assign to the Plaintiffs, as additional security for the Owlwood Loan, all of Fund 3A's right, title and interest in and to the Deed of Trust, the promissory note secured by the Deed of Trust, and all rights to receive payments as set forth in the Collateral Assignment. (\u00b6 73).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, Fund 3A recorded the Collateral Assignment against the Owlwood Estate with the Los Angeles County Registrar-Record/County Clerk, (\u00b6 80)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 Upon information and belief, Fund 3A represented to the Plaintiffs that recording the Collateral Assignment would grant the Plaintiffs first-position liens on the Owlwood Estate, which was valued higher than the outstanding indebtedness. (\u00b6\u00b6 77-78).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 Fund 3A was in possession of the original documents and acted as custodian of the records on behalf of the Plaintiffs, in addition to the other noteholders solicited by Fund 3A for the financing of the Owlwood Estate.

Whether the Plaintiffs are secured creditors turns on whether the Plaintiffs' asserted security interests were perfected as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To perfect a security interest in real property, the putative secured creditor must have a mortgage or deed of trust executed in its favor and duly recorded in the land records as against the real property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs do not allege that they received - - let alone recorded - - any mortgage or deed of trust from the owner of the Property (SPI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Instead, the Plaintiffs assert that their perfected liens against the Property and any proceeds thereof arise from the Owlwood Loan Agreements, in which Fund 3A granted the Plaintiffs security interests in Fund 3A's right, title and interest in the loan between Fund 3A and SPI (the \"Pledged Loan\"). The Plaintiffs assert that Fund 3A executed an \"Assignment of Promissory Note and Mortgage\" and \"Collateral Assignment of Note, Mortgage, and Other Loan Documents\" (collectively, the \"Collateral Assignment\") in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Under either Delaware or California law, a security interest in an instrument or promissory note may be perfected by filing a UCC-1 statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   or by possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors have presented a Certificate of the Delaware Secretary of State certifying that there are no effective financing statements against Fund 3A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors also point out that the Plaintiffs admit in the Complaint that they do not have possession of the original Collateral Assignment documents, but, instead, allege that Fund 3A \"acted as custodian of the records on behalf of the Plaintiffs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors assert that the Plaintiffs have not - - and could not - - allege facts to support a claim that their interests in the Pledged Loan documents are perfected under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Plaintiffs also argue that, upon the Debtors' default, the Plaintiffs acquired the right to enforce the notes and deed of trust against the Property pursuant to the language in the Owlwood Loan Documents\n   and the Collateral Assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors contend, however, that the Plaintiffs do not have a present right to enforce the Pledged Loan because Fund 3A did not transfer or \"negotiate\" the underlying promissory notes to the Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as enacted in both Delaware and California, governs the transfer of instruments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The holder of the instrument is a person entitled to enforce the instrument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   A person becomes a \"holder\" through negotiation, which is accomplished by a transfer of possession and, in most cases, an indorsement by the holder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Debtors argue that, without possession, the Plaintiffs do not have any right to enforce the Pledged Loan documents under Article 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Plaintiffs, however, argue that California law deems them in \"possession\" of\n   the Pledged Loan documents pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010233.2\">\n    Cal.

The legislative history of the statute indicates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   This bill is sponsored by the California Independent Mortgage Brokers Association (CIMBA) to specify that the technical requirements of the Commercial Code for perfection of a lender's real property security interest ... are deemed to have been completed under specified conditions where the real estate broker maintains physical possession of the note under a servicing contract in accordance with provisions of the Real Estate Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The sponsor notes that there have been several recent situations of the bankruptcy of the servicing mortgage loan broker where the bankruptcy court has held that the lender's loan is unsecured, and the lender is an unsecured creditor of the broker, only because the current technical requirement of the Commercial Code for delivery of the note to the lender has not occurred. In these cases, the lender loses, although the position of the borrower and the bankrupt servicing mortgage loan broker is unchanged.\n   <strong>\n    This bill was introduced to provide an exception to the technical delivery requirement in specified broker servicing situations that are in accordance with provisions of the real estate licensing laws.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Debtors argue that California law does not apply here because (i) the loan documents specify that Delaware law applies, and (ii) UCC \u00a7 9-301 also specifies that the law of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located (in this case, Delaware) applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs contend that California law applies here because (i) it is a\n   consumer protection law\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and (ii) applicable choice-of-law rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   However, even assuming - - without deciding - - that the California \"Deemed Possession\" Law applies here, it does not aid the Plaintiffs in proving possession because the Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support two necessary elements of the statute.

The flaw in this argument is that this section of the California Business and Professional Code specifically defines a \"broker\" as \"a person licensed as a broker under any of the provisions of this part\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a \"real estate broker\" as \"a person licensed as a broker under Chapter 3 of this part.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Section 10233.2 only applies to licensed brokers was recognized\n   by the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in\n   <em>\n    Cedar Funding\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   The court disagrees with the Chapter 11 Trustee's Business and Professions Code analysis for the simple reason that no evidence has been offered demonstrating that CFI was a licensed broker.

These sections are not always easily reconciled because \u00a7 541(d) excludes certain equitable interests horn the estate\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   of a bankrupt while \u00a7 544(a) permits the trustee to bring certain tainted property into the control of the estate\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   for distribution to creditors. The Sixth Circuit noted that the Bankruptcy Code's policy of equitable distribution is paramount to any policy that underpins the bankruptcy court's authority to impose an equitable trust, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Constructive trusts are anathema to the equities of bankruptcy since they take from the estate, and thus directly from competing creditors, not from the offending debtor. \"Ratable distribution among all creditors\" justifies the Code's placement of the trustee in the position of a first-in-line judgment creditor and bona fide purchaser for value, empowered to avoid certain competing interests (and even to nullify the debtor's \"preferential\" prepetition payments to otherwise entitled creditors) so as to maximize the value of the estate. To a party defrauded by the debtor, incorporating the proceeds of fraud in the debtor's estate may seem like allowing the \"estate to benefit from property that the debtor did not own.\" [\n   <em>\n    In re] Quality Holstein Leasing\n   </em>\n   , 752 F.2d [1009] at 1013 [5th Cir. 1985]. But as the Seventh Circuit has pointed out, \"allowing the estate to 'benefit from property that the debtor did not own' is exactly what the strong-arm powers are about: they give the trustee the status of a bona fide purchaser for value, so that the estate contains interests to which the debtor lacked good title.\"\n   <em>\n    Belisle v.

The Code recognizes that each creditor has suffered disappointed expectations at the hands of the debtor; for this reason, it makes maximization of the estate the primary concern and entitlement to shares of the estate secondary. Imposing a constructive trust on the debtor's estate impermissibly subordinates this primary concern to a single claim of entitlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Delaware courts, however, have not adopted a bright line rule that \"the bankruptcy policy of ratable distribution trumps state law policy on constructive trusts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Delaware courts have decided that a trustee may use the strong-arm powers of \u00a7 544(a)(3) to avoid an equitable interest in real property if the trustee can avoid that interest under applicable law of the state in which the property in question is located as of the bankruptcy petition's filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Owlwood Estate Property is located in California. \"In California, a purchaser for value of real estate without actual or constructive notice of a prior interest is given bona fide purchaser status.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" Section 544, however, must be applied 'without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   While we agree that any constructive trust that is given effect must be a creature of [state] law, we cannot accept the proposition that the bankruptcy estate is automatically deprived of any funds that state law might find subject to a constructive trust....

The Debtors also argue that the Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Debtors note that on April 5, 2018, this Court entered an order establishing June 19, 2018, as the general bar date for the filing of proofs of claim against the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors served\n   copies of its \"Notice of Deadlines for Filing of Proofs of Claim and Proofs of Interest\" upon each of the Plaintiffs and their counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bar Date Notice states that holders of claims who fail to file a timely proof of claim on or before the applicable bar date \"may be forever barred, estopped, and enjoined from asserting such claim\" against any of the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs added the Elder Abuse Claim to the amended Complaint on July 17, 2018, which was four weeks after the deadline in the Bar Date Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"In bankruptcy, 'the only appropriate way to assert a claim against a debtor's estate is through the timely filing of a properly executed proof of claim' and not through an adversary proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 3001, 3002 and 3003 provide guidance on filing proofs of claim in a bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Debtors also argue that the Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert the Elder Abuse Claims.

Instead, the individual Plaintiffs are residents of Florida; the California residents are trusts or other entities (not individuals); and the Complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs were 65 years of age\n   <em>\n    as of the filing of the Complaint.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiffs responded by arguing that the term \"person\" may include entities, and otherwise seek to amend the Complaint to clarify which Plaintiffs would meet the definition of \"elder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   However, due to the procedural irregularities of the Elder Abuse Claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   I will not address the standing issues in this adversary. The Debtors argue that the Elder Abuse Claims are untimely, but, in some cases, a court may allow a late-filed claim under Rule 9006(b) if the claimant can show that the tardiness was the result of excusable neglect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, Count IV will be dismissed but with leave to allow any Plaintiffs who believe they have valid Elder Abuse Claims, and can show excusable neglect, to file motions seeking allowance to file late proofs of claim under Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) or other applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Counts I, II and III will be dismissed with prejudice. Count IV also will be dismissed, but with leave to allow Plaintiffs to file motions in the main bankruptcy case seeking allowance to file late proofs of claims under Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b), or other applicable\n   law, within 30 days.
