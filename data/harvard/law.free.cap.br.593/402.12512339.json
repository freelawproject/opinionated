CHAPMAN, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This contested chapter 15 proceeding presents an issue that the Bankruptcy Code does not explicitly address and as to which there is scant case law: how to determine the \"center of main interests\" (the \"COMI\") of an individual debtor. Here, the debtor Natalia Pirogova (the \"Debtor\" or \"Ms. Pirogova\"), who was born in Belarus, is a Russian citizen and is the holder of a \"Green Card\" which affords her permanent resident status in the United States. Her story is a colorful one; it includes, among other things, an outstanding Russian warrant for her arrest; alleged clandestine trips to Russia by way of the Belarus/Russia border; and an alleged trail of fraud, failed investments, and outstanding debt in both Russia and the United States. What brings her here to this Court is the petition of Yuri Vladimirovich Rozhkov, the trustee and foreign representative (the \"Foreign Representative\") appointed by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court (the \"Russian Court\") in Ms. Pirogova's pending insolvency proceeding (the \"Russian Insolvency Proceeding\") under the Russian Federation Federal Law No 127-FZ \"On Insolvency (Bankruptcy),\" which proceeding was commenced against her by one of her principal creditors, the Public Joint-Stock Company VTB 24, also known as \"VTB Bank.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is not Ms. Pirogova's first experience in a United States bankruptcy court; her single asset real estate entity, NMP-Group LLC, was a debtor in a chapter 11 proceeding in this Court in 2013. In the instant case - commenced some ten years after Ms. Pirogova obtained her Green Card, some five years after the commencement of the NMP-Group LLC chapter 11 case, and some three years after commencement of the Russian Insolvency Proceeding - the Foreign Representative asks this Court to find that, notwithstanding Ms. Pirogova's presence in the United States, which the Foreign Representative maintains is itself in furtherance of a fraud, Ms. Pirogova has continued her fraudulent activities in Russia and that Russia is her COMI. The burden of proof with respect to the issue of COMI falls squarely on the Foreign Representative; for the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the Foreign Representative has failed to adduce sufficient evidence for the Court to conclude that the Debtor's COMI is Russia such that the Court can recognize the Russian Insolvency Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, or, alternatively, that the Debtor has an \"establishment\" in Russia as contemplated by the applicable provisions of chapter 15 such that the Court can recognize the Russian Insolvency Proceeding as a foreign nonmain proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 30, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\"), the Foreign Representative filed (i) a form chapter 15 petition [Dkt. No. 1] pursuant to sections 1504 and 1515 of title 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"), commencing a case under chapter 15 ancillary to the Russian Insolvency Proceeding; and (ii) a Verified Petition Under Chapter 15 for Recognition of Foreign Main Proceeding [Dkt. No. 2] (the \"Verified Petition\" and, together with the form\n   chapter 15 petition, the \"Petition\"), seeking recognition in this Court of the Russian Insolvency Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, or, alternatively, as a foreign nonmain proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of the Petition, the Foreign Representative filed the Declaration of Sergey S. Sokolov [Dkt. No. 5] and the Declaration of Yuri Vladimirovich Rozhkov [Dkt. No. 7] (the \"Rozhkov Decl.\"). The Foreign Representative also filed a Motion for (i) Ex Parte Emergency Relief and (ii) Provisional Relief [Dkt. No. 6], together with the Declaration of Rick Antonoff [Dkt. No. 8] in support thereof. On April 2, 2018, this Court issued a temporary restraining order [Dkt. No. 10] temporarily granting the requested provisional relief and ordering that (i) section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code shall apply with respect to the Debtor and her property within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and (ii) the Stayed Actions (as defined therein) shall be enjoined until,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Court decides whether to grant the Petition and recognize the Russian Insolvency Proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Pirogova filed opposition to the Petition [Dkt. No. 45] (the \"Pirogova Opposition\"), together with the Declaration of Natalia Pirogova [Dkt. Nos. 43-44] (the \"Pirogova Decl.\") in support thereof. Responses to the Petition were also filed by (i) M Investment Capital, LLC and Mark Shvartsburd (collectively, the \"Shvartsburd Parties\") [Dkt. No. 34];\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) 7400 Oceanside at Fisher Island Condominium Association, Inc. [Dkt. No. 36]; and (iii) Lana Aferzon [Dkt.

No. 52] (the \"Reply\"), together with the Declaration of Sergey S. Sokolov [Dkt. No. 53] and the Declaration of Evan J. Zucker [Dkt. No. 54] in support thereof. On September 26 and September 27, 2018, the Court conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing on the Petition (the \"Hearing\"), at which the Court heard (a) oral argument from counsel to the Foreign Representative and counsel to Ms. Pirogova and (b) witness testimony from (i) Mr. Sergey S. Sokolov, the Foreign Representative's Russian law expert; (ii) the Foreign Representative (through an interpreter); and (iii) Ms. Pirogova (through an interpreter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the Hearing, the Foreign Representative filed a post-trial brief [Dkt.

Mr. Ran, a director or shareholder\n   of nearly one hundred Israeli companies, encountered financial difficulty in the late 1990's.

As in the instant case, the primary question before the bankruptcy court was whether or not Mr. Ran had his COMI, or, alternatively, an establishment, in Israel at the time the petition was filed, such that the court should recognize the Israeli insolvency proceeding under chapter 15. The bankruptcy court found that the Israeli bankruptcy proceeding did not qualify as foreign main or as a foreign nonmain proceeding and denied recognition, which decision was ultimately affirmed by the Fifth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n    at 1019-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In analyzing Mr. Ran's COMI, the Fifth Circuit weighed the facts placed into evidence by the Israeli receiver in support of the contention that Israel was Mr. Ran's COMI (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Mr. Ran's creditors were located in Israel and that his principal assets were being administered in the Israeli bankruptcy proceeding, which was initiated in Israel under Israeli law) against the following facts: (i) Mr. Ran and his family left Israel nearly a decade prior to the filing of the chapter 15 petition; (ii) Mr. Ran had no intention of returning to Israel; and (iii) Mr. Ran was a permanent legal resident of the United States and his children were U.S. citizens. The Court determined that the evidence proffered by the Israeli receiver, when weighed against these facts, was insufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Ran's COMI was in Israel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n    at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   So too here. The Court finds that the Foreign Representative has failed to meet his burden to prove by direct evidence that Ms. Pirogova's COMI at the time of Petition Date was Russia. The evidence proffered at the Hearing was insufficient to provide a basis on which the Court can conclude that, as of the Petition Date, Ms. Pirogova's domicile or habitual residence was Russia, particularly when weighed against (i) Ms. Pirogova's stated intention to leave Russia permanently in 2008 and never reside there again;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) the fact that Ms. Pirogova obtained permanent residence status in the United States in 2008;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) the absence of direct evidence that Ms. Pirogova had a habitual\n   residence in Russia at the time of the Petition Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court observes that the Foreign Representative places particular emphasis on Ms. Pirogova's ownership of an apartment located at Verhniye Polya street, 14, Apt. 266, Moscow, Russia (the \"Moscow Apartment\") in order to support his assertion that Russia is Ms. Pirogova's COMI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Ms. Pirogova appears to be listed as the owner of the Moscow Apartment on the official records for the Federal Service for State Registration, Cadastre and Cartography for Moscow,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Foreign Representative has offered no evidence that Ms. Pirogova maintains such apartment as her habitual residence. Indeed, the Foreign Representative offered no direct evidence whatsoever that anyone, including Ms. Pirogova, has occupied the apartment during any time period relevant to a determination of her COMI. To the contrary, at the Hearing, Ms. Pirogova testified that (i) she no longer owns the Moscow Apartment; (ii) she believes the apartment was seized by the bank approximately five years prior to the Hearing because she did not pay the mortgage; (iii) she has not returned to the Moscow Apartment since she learned of such seizure and has not lived there for \"a very long time;\" and (iv) she had no furniture or personal effects in the apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the Foreign Representative testified that on two or three occasions he visited the building in which the Moscow Apartment is located \"as part of the investigative measures to seek out information on the property of the Debtor,\" he admitted in his testimony that he never entered the Moscow Apartment to determine whether or not Ms. Pirogova was living there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the Foreign Representative offered into evidence three utility bills addressed to Ms. Pirogova at the Moscow Apartment;\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the Utility Bills do not provide any conclusive evidence that Ms. Pirogova inhabited or otherwise used the Moscow Apartment as her habitual residence as of the Petition Date. Even though the bills pertain to months subsequent to the Petition Date, each bill indicates on its face that utility payments for the Moscow Apartment have not been paid for several years - since December 31, 2015 with respect to electricity and since April 11, 2013 with respect to water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, based on the inconclusive evidence introduced by the Foreign Representative with respect to the Moscow Apartment, the Court cannot find that Ms. Pirogova's habitual residence on the Petition\n   Date was Russia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As this Court observed in\n   <em>\n    In re Kemsley\n   </em>\n   , challenges arise in applying recognition principles to an individual whose life is not tied to one place, particularly when such individual has made multiple moves.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173036\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/489/346/#p353\">\n    489 B.R. at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that an individual debtor may not have lived in any one place with the intention of establishing the kind of residential stability contemplated in section 1516(c) ). Ms. Pirogova's case presents such a challenge. Aside from the evidence with respect to the Moscow Apartment, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Foreign Representative points to additional \"indicia of COMI\" to attempt to establish that Russia is Ms. Pirogova's COMI. The Court finds that such evidence, even taken together, is inadequate to support a finding that Russia is the Debtor's COMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, although the Court recognizes that a debtor's familial ties to a country may be a factor in determining an individual's COMI,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kemsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173036\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/489/346/#p353\">\n    489 B.R. at 352-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the fact that Ms. Pirogova has family and friends in Russia is insufficient to establish that Russia was her COMI as of the Petition Date. Unlike the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Kemsley\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Pirogova did not express a desire to live near her son and grandchildren in Russia, nor was there any evidence introduced at the Hearing that Ms. Pirogova maintains a close relationship with anyone in Russia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, there was no evidence presented that Ms. Pirogova frequently travelled to Russia via the open border between Russia and Belarus, as the Foreign Representative attempts to suggest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Ms. Pirogova acknowledges that she has the ability to cross the Russia/Belarus border using only her Russian travel documents\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not constitute proof that she did in fact do so; further evidence would be required for the Court to draw such a conclusion. Second, while Ms. Pirogova may in fact have creditors and assets located in Russia, as well as a pending Russian Insolvency Proceeding governed by Russian law, when such factors are weighed against the lack of direct evidence in the record that Ms. Pirogova's habitual residence as of the Petition Date was Moscow, they are insufficient to establish that Russia is Ms. Pirogova's COMI. Moreover, the Foreign Representative has acknowledged in the Petition that Russia is not the only country in which Ms. Pirogova has creditors and lawsuits pending against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lastly, the Foreign Representative contends that Ms. Pirogova's COMI is Russia because she has been perpetuating a fraud, avoiding debts, and evading authorities in\n   Russia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Foreign Representative asserts that (i) Ms. Pirogova owned and controlled a company named Rizalti-Plus-DKD which borrowed over $75 million from Petrokommerts (the \"Rizalti Loan\") based on \"knowingly unreliable\" information in 2007 and never repaid such loan; (ii) civil and criminal efforts were commenced in Russia against Ms. Pirogova to recover funds related to the Rizalti Loan; and (iii) Ms. Pirogova fled Russia using travel documents bearing different spellings of her name, in defiance of Russian authorities' directive to remain in the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of whether or not Ms. Pirogova engaged in fraudulent or criminal activity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   the allegations relate to activity well prior to the Petition Date and have no bearing on the Debtor's COMI as of the Petition Date, which is the only relevant date for purposes of recognition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Foreign Representative asserts that denying recognition of the Russian Insolvency Proceeding would be contrary to the spirit of chapter 15 because it would suggest that \"an individual who defrauds creditors and evades law enforcement authorities in her home country need only come to the United States, conceal her interest in property through holding companies and nominee agreements, and thereby prevent a duly appointed bankruptcy administrator from recovering her assets for the benefit of all creditors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court disagrees. Courts in the Second Circuit and elsewhere have emphasized that examining a debtor's COMI at the time the petition for recognition is filed fulfills Congress' purpose for implementing chapter 15 - to harmonize transnational insolvency proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fairfield Sentry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868908,4175933\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/127/\">\n    714 F.3d at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Most courts in this Circuit and throughout the country appear to have examined a debtor's COMI as of the time of the Chapter 15 petition.\") (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    In re Ran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n    607 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]xamining a debtor's COMI at the time the petition for recognition is filed fulfills Congress's purpose for implementing Chapter 15.\"). As the Fifth Circuit has specifically noted, an inquiry into a debtor's past operations prior to the time of the petition might lead to conflicting COMI determinations and the possibility of competing main proceedings, thus defeating the purpose of using the COMI construct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Pirogova's past conduct is not a factor the Court is required to consider in evaluating whether the\n   Russian Insolvency Proceeding can be recognized as a foreign main proceeding.

According to the Foreign Representative, \"what exactly constitutes an economic activity is quite expansive under the Model Law and can include just a single asset coupled with some level of economic activity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As evidence of Ms. Pirogova's establishment in Russia, the Foreign Representative points to (i) the Utility Bills in Ms. Pirogova's name found at the Moscow Apartment, which he argues illustrate the \"continuous and ongoing provision of services to her apartment and the costs associated with those services;\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) Ms. Pirogova's membership in the Association of Owners of Vessels \"Yacht-Club Zolotoy Gorod\" (the \"Yacht Club\"), which is \"located\" in Moscow, as evidenced by an extract dated August 28, 2018 from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities for Non-Profit Partnership;\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iii) Ms. Pirogova's 100% ownership of a Russian company named Taurus LLC, which became the subject of an insolvency proceeding in 2017 and is currently in liquidation;\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iv) two automobiles (a Mercedes Benz and a Russian-made \"VAZ\") owned by Ms. Pirogova, one of which appears to be currently insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Ms. Pirogova argues that none of the evidence proffered by the Foreign Representative has any probative value in meeting the statutory requirement of an establishment in Russia such that the Russian Insolvency Proceeding should be recognized as a foreign nonmain proceeding. She asserts that (i) the Utility Bills alone (assuming they even establish use of the Moscow Apartment at all) do not indicate that the utility charges were generated by\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   use of the apartment, as the Foreign Representative did not demonstrate that (or even attempt to investigate whether) Ms. Pirogova resided there, either as a primary or as a secondary residence;\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) the Yacht Club register indicates that Ms. Pirogova was a founding member but it does not prove that she was an active member of the club as of the Petition Date, and the Foreign Representative did not present any additional evidence as to her current membership status;\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iii) her ownership of Taurus LLC is irrelevant because the company is in the late stages of bankruptcy and it is not conducting economic activity in Russia;\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iv) the evidence regarding the two automobiles registered in Ms. Pirogova's name indicates that both cars have been \"seized\" and that a \"ban on registration acts\" had\n   been imposed on the VAZ in 2012 and on the 22-year old Mercedes-Benz in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Foreign Representative's evidence is insufficient to satisfy the two prongs of the \"establishment\" requirement set forth in the statute - that the Debtor had a place of operations in Russia as of the Petition Date and that she carried out a nontransitory economic activity from such place. First, the Court has been presented with inadequate direct evidence that the Moscow Apartment could be considered a \"place of operations\" within the meaning of section 1502(2). As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Foreign Representative has introduced no evidence (i) as to the time period in which Ms. Pirogova allegedly resided in the Moscow Apartment; (ii) as to whether she continues to use the apartment as a secondary residence; or (iii) even as to whether she has been present in the Moscow Apartment at all in the past several years. While a secondary residence or a place of employment can be sufficient to constitute a place of operations, the Foreign Representative has presented no evidence that the Moscow Apartment served as either one to Ms. Pirogova. That the Moscow Apartment is still registered in Ms. Pirogova's name is inadequate to establish that the apartment was her secondary residence on the Petition Date, particularly in light of Ms. Pirogova's testimony that she had not been there in years and that she believes the apartment had been seized by the bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Even if the Court were to conclude that this single asset in the debtor's name in Russia was sufficient to constitute a \"place of operations\" within the meaning of section 1502(2), as the Foreign Representative suggests, the Foreign Representative must also prove that Ms. Pirogova carried out nontransitory economic activity in Russia from such place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n    607 F.3d at 1027-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, even if the court were to conclude that the debtor possessed a place of operations in Israel at the time the petition was filed, because the debtor did not carry out any nontransitory economic activity in Israel, the second part of the establishment requirement was not met). The Court finds that the Foreign Representative's scant evidence and conclusory allegations are insufficient to prove that Ms. Pirogova carried out any nontransitory economic activity in Russia at the time of the Petition Date such that Russia could be considered her \"establishment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Foreign Representative's argument that Ms. Pirogova's ownership of the Moscow Apartment \"continues to generate economic activity in Moscow\" because a reading of the Utility Bills demonstrates utility services continue to be used each month and the utility companies continue to extend credit to Ms. Pirogova for the value of such services\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a stretch, to say the least. The mere presence of the Utility Bills (which have not been paid since 2015 and 2013, respectively)\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not, without more, support the conclusion that Ms. Pirogova occupied the Moscow Apartment, let alone that she generated economic activity in Russia, as of the Petition Date. The Court is similarly not persuaded that Ms. Pirogova generates economic activity through her membership in the Yacht Club because, as the Foreign Representative claims, the Yacht Club \"generates economic activity through membership dues\n   and the maintenance of the club.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no support in the record whatsoever for this conclusion. First, as noted by counsel to Ms. Pirogova, nothing on the face of the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, which was submitted into evidence, indicates that Ms. Pirogova's membership in the Yacht Club was current and active on the Petition Date,\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   and nothing further was submitted by the Foreign Representative in that regard. Moreover, even assuming that Ms. Pirogova was a member of the Yacht Club on the Petition Date, there is no evidence supporting the Foreign Representative's conclusory assumptions (i) that Ms. Pirogova paid membership dues or contributed to the maintenance of the Yacht Club at that time or (ii) that the Yacht Club generates economic activity. Indeed, the Foreign Representative conceded that he never visited the Yacht Club and has very limited knowledge about it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also finds that Ms. Pirogova's alleged failure to de-register two \"seized\" cars (or that she continues to hold insurance for one of such cars) to be far too tenuous a link to any nontransitory economic activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, the Court is not persuaded by the Foreign Representative's contention that Ms. Pirogova's entitlement to participate in the insolvency proceeding of Taurus LLC or that her governance rights and interests in the company constitute nontransitory economic activity in Moscow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the term implies, \"economic activity\" requires a showing of a local effect on the marketplace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Creative Finance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363795\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/543/498/#p514\">\n    543 B.R. at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Foreign Representative himself acknowledges, some level of \"minimal management\" by the debtor must be present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Pirogova's entitlement to participate in the insolvency proceeding of Taurus LLC, without more - such as proof of her active participation in such bankruptcy proceedings - does not rise to the level of \"minimal management\" of her interest in Taurus LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, the existence of the Russian Insolvency Proceeding alone fails to meet the statutory requirement of an establishment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Ran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n    607 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the existence of the involuntary Israeli bankruptcy proceeding alone was insufficient evidence to enable the court to conclude that Ran carried out nontransitory economic activity in Israel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the Foreign Representative has failed to meet his burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Ms. Pirogova had, on the Petition Date, an \"establishment\" in Russia within the meaning of sections 1502(2) and 1502(5) of the Bankruptcy Code such that the Russian Insolvency Proceeding should be recognized as a foreign nonmain proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In her Opposition, Ms. Pirogova raised additional objections to the Petition with respect to the following issues: (i) whether the Russian Insolvency Proceeding is a collective proceeding meeting the definition of \"foreign proceeding\" under section 101(23) of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) whether recognition of the Russian Insolvency Proceeding is manifestly contrary to United States public policy under section 1506 of the Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court has already determined that the Russian Insolvency Proceeding is neither a foreign main\n   proceeding nor a foreign nonmain proceeding, it need not address these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Petition for recognition of the Russian Insolvency Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding or, alternatively, as a foreign nonmain proceeding, is denied.
