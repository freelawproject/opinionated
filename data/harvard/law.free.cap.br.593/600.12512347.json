Walker, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees are charged with the duty of, among other things, maximizing the value of a bankruptcy estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An essential part of that process is an investigation into the legality of the Debtor's claimed exemptions. An objection to a claimed exemption can work to \"free-up\" an asset for liquidation for the benefit of creditors. Here, the Debtor has claimed an enhanced exemption of $25,000 under Tennessee homestead exemption law based on his custody of a minor child. The Trustee has challenged the Debtor's claim of custody as a basis for his objection to the claimed exemption. The Court conducted an evidentiary hearing, and the matter was fully briefed. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that the Debtor has properly claimed his exemption, and the Trustee's objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Marlon Cecil Bush (herein \"Debtor\") filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Code on April 13, 2018. On schedule C, the Debtor claimed a $25,000 exemption pursuant to Tennessee state law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-301\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The Debtor asserts custody of his granddaughter as a basis for the claimed exemption. The Trustee objects to the claim because the Debtor does not have custody of his granddaughter as the term custody is defined under Tennessee law. The Court conducted an evidentiary hearing, and the parties stipulated to the admission of evidence, including two state court orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The first order was entered on December 29, 2004. In that order, the Juvenile Court of Rutherford County, Tennessee\n   awarded temporary custody of the granddaughter to Sue Jackson,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the grandmother of the child. The Debtor testified that the child's mother sought entry of this order as she was terminally ill and the child's father was incarcerated at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The second order was entered on December 13, 2017 by the same court (\"Second Order\"), and appointed the Debtor and Sue Bush (\"Sue\") as guardians of the granddaughter. The Debtor testified that he and Sue sought this order after Sue's daughter passed away, and Sue herself was diagnosed with a terminal disease. They wanted to ensure the security of the granddaughter in the home and with the Debtor in light of Sue's health issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the hearing, the Debtor testified that the granddaughter lived in his home with him and Sue for approximately thirteen years, and continues to reside with them. He stated that while the granddaughter resides with them, they are responsible for providing food, shelter, medical care, emotional support, transportation, and all the necessities that go along with raising a child. The granddaughter's father does not exercise visitation, has not been ordered to - nor does he - pay child support, and does not provide for the child in any way. The Trustee did not challenge the Debtor's assertions on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trustee argues that this is a matter of law, and that the statute is clear with no ambiguity as to the definition of the term \"custody,\" and, therefore, statutory interpretation is not appropriate. Applying the definition of the term \"custody\" stated in the Tennessee Code, the Trustee concedes that someone has custody of the granddaughter, but contends it is not the Debtor. Alternatively, he urges this Court to certify the question of defining the term \"custody\" to the Tennessee Supreme Court if this ruling is to be based on a finding of ambiguity in the definition of the term in Tennessee statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor argues that because the term \"custody\" is not defined in the applicable exemption statute, it is appropriate for this Court to look to other Tennessee statutes, and the legislative intent behind those statutes, to determine the meaning of the term \"custody\" in the exemption statute. The Debtor points to provisions in Tennessee domestic law that define custody, and asserts that the same definition is used interchangeably with the term \"guardianship\" throughout the Tennessee statutes. This, coupled with the legislative intent of protecting families and providing security for minor children, parents and guardians, means the Debtor meets the requirements of the enhancement by having custody of a minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   STATUTORY PREDICATE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The meaning of the word \"custody\" as it is used in Tennessee's enhanced homestead exemption for an individual with custody of a minor child is a term undefined in that statute, and is the issue before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Homestead exemption statutes have been enacted with the purpose of protecting the value of homes of certain owners in certain circumstances. \"Homestead\" is the primary residence of a person, and exemption laws regarding residences protect residential values from such things as property taxes and forced sales for the benefit of creditors, as well as securing housing for a surviving homeowner spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the Code, a debtor may claim exemptions as authorized by state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   11 U.S.C. 522(b)(2). The state of Tennessee does not authorize the use of the federal exemption scheme, but instead has enacted its own required homestead exemption statute that expands the protections provided under the Code:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (f) Notwithstanding subsection (a) to the contrary, an individual who has one (1) or more minor children in the individual's custody shall be entitled to a homestead exemption not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) on real property that is owned by the individual and used by the individual as a principal place of residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-301\">\n    Tenn.

This section provides a definition of the word \"custody\" with regard to minors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b)(9) \"Custody\" means the control of actual physical care of the child and includes the right and responsibility to provide for the physical, mental, moral and emotional well-being of the child. \"Custody,\" as herein defined, relates to those rights and responsibilities as exercised either by the parents or by a person or organization granted custody by a court of competent jurisdiction. \"Custody\" shall not be construed as the termination of parental rights set forth in \u00a7 37-1-147. \"Custody\" does not exist by virtue of mere physical possession of the child[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2037-1-102\">\n    Tenn.

Title 34 of the Tennessee Code contains those statutes relating generally to guardianships and conservatorships\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The definition of the term guardian applicable therein is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (9) \"Guardian\" or \"coguardian\" means a person or persons appointed by the court to provide partial or full supervision, protection and assistance of the person or property, or both, of a minor[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2034-1-101\">\n    Tenn.

Furthermore, the claimed exemption in no way offends Tennessee public policy to afford relief and support to homeowners in certain circumstances, as in this case, providing all necessities for the care, protection, and security of the minor granddaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In pursuing the Second Order, the Debtor and Sue sought to secure the granddaughter's residence in the home with the Debtor and Sue. By seeking guardianship, the Debtor obtained complete guardianship, and all the rights and responsibilities that go along with it. The statute clearly states what is included in the rights of custody, and the record indicates that the Debtor exercises the full gamut of those rights. Those rights are directly in line with the intentions of the Debtor, and all of the statutory provisions in play here: the security of the minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, the asserted position of the Trustee would result in a ludicrous result. The Trustee's argument included the assertion that someone has custody of the granddaughter, it is just not the Debtor. Analyzing the potential parties who could claim the enhanced exemption under this position, it appears that the absentee father of the granddaughter is the only proper claimant. If the Debtor and Sue do not have custody because the Second Order does not \"effect custody,\" the state has not been awarded custody, and the mother is dead, that leaves the father as the only party left, under the definition of the term \"custody,\" who could potentially claim custody and the homestead exemption enhancement. Undoubtedly this was not the intent of the legislature. The statute serves to afford relief and security to those who have legal status\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   provide for a minor child. The father provides nothing for the child - no financial, medical, emotional, psychological, or physical support. To award the enhancement to the father by biological default renders the purpose of the statute meaningless. To apply the statute as the Trustee urges would not serve the legislative intent behind Tennessee law or the Code, and would result in a reward of relief offensive to the purpose of the\n   statute and to this Court - a ridiculous outcome and not one that this Court of equity is willing to support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Therefore, to clarify the Court's position: this Debtor, a non-parent exercising control of actual physical care of his granddaughter pursuant to the Second Order, and his actual exercise of the rights and responsibilities associated with guardianship and custody as defined under Tennessee law, in the absence of any other party exercising those rights, is found to have established his custody of the granddaughter for the limited purpose of the enhanced homestead exemption as applicable under the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   RULING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Debtor has established his eligibility for an enhanced homestead exemption of $25,000 under Tennessee homestead exemption law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2026-2-301\">\n    Tenn.
