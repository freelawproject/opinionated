Buchanan, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   U.S. Bank Trust, NA (the \"\n   <em>\n    Creditor\n   </em>\n   \") argues that the proposed cramdown of the Creditor's secured claim by Debtors Amy and James Lister (\"\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   \") in their chapter 13 plan [Docket Number 17] is prohibited by the anti-modification provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). The Debtors maintain that the anti-modification provision does not apply because Creditor's claim is secured by real property that is not solely the Debtors' principal residence. For the reasons that follow, this Court finds that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) precludes the modification of the Creditor's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties stipulated [Docket Number 24] to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Debtors own the real property located at and commonly referred to as 10038 State Route 775, Scottown, Ohio 45678 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Debtors have owned the Property since 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3. The Property consists of two adjacent parcels of real estate that are both pledged as collateral through a consensual mortgage for the debt owed to Creditor. The mortgage in question was executed on May 16, 2005 and was recorded with the Lawrence County Recorder's office on May 26, 2005. The mortgage fully matures on May 16, 2025.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   4. The Debtors have owned and operated a home childcare on the premises for the past twenty-one years. This encompasses the entirety of the time that Creditor has held a mortgage against the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   5. Debtors receive monthly rent in the amount of approximately $600.00 for the rental of a separate structure that exists on the Property. The separate structure serves as a residence for a third-party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Debtors began the rental of this separate structure in October of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   6. Debtors and Creditor agree that the information presented in the stipulations is submitted in lieu of testimony of the Debtors and such information is accepted as truthful and accurate. Creditor waives its rights to cross examination of the Debtors as witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   7. Debtors obtained an appraisal of the entirety of the Property on April 25, 2017, with such appraisal being completed by licensed appraiser Jeffrey Hunter. A copy of the appraisal has been filed with the Court as ECF No. 9 and shall be considered Joint Exhibit 1 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Appraisal\n   </em>\n   \"). This Appraisal shall be admitted as evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties further stipulated [Docket Number 43] to the admission of the following additional exhibits, which were attached to the parties' respective briefs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a.

This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(L).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 1322(b)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that a chapter 13 \"plan may ... modify the rights of holders of secured claims,\n   <em>\n    other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (emphasis added). This is known as the anti-modification provision or exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The two threshold legal issues before this Court are: (1) whether the anti-modification provision of \u00a7 1322(b)(2) applies to a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence, if that property also hosts commercial activities-so called \"mixed-use properties;\" and, (2) the point in time for determining the debtor's \"principal residence\" status under \u00a7 1322(b)(2). Courts have grappled with these issues for the past twenty-plus years. Before weighing in, this Court will endeavor to summarize the divergent approaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Section 1322(b)(2) and \"mixed-use property\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There are three differing approaches for determining the applicability of the antimodification\n   provision where the real property at issue serves as more than the debtor's principal residence. The vast majority of the cases in the mixed-use context involve real property that includes the debtor's principal residence as well as other income-producing rental property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Approach # 1: Real property that is\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      only\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    the debtor's principal residence (the \"Bright-Line Only Approach\"\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The \"majority\" of courts have adopted a bright-line approach concluding that the antimodification provision does not apply unless the real property is only the debtor's principal residence.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scarborough v.

Two circuit courts adopt this approach, although for different reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit looked to the plain language of \u00a7 1322(b)(2) in concluding that the anti-modification provision does not extend to mixed-use property.\n   <em>\n    In re Scarborough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704077,3671143\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/406/\">\n    461 F.3d at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   By using the word \"is\" in the phrase \"real property that is the debtor's principal residence,\" Congress equated the terms \"real property\" and \"principal residence.\" Put differently, this use of \"is\" means that the real property that secures the mortgage must be only the debtor's principal residence in order for the anti-modification provision to apply. We thus agree with the reasoning of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut when it noted that \u00a7 1322(b)(2)\"protects claims secured only by a security interest in real property that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the debtor's principal residence, not real property that\n   <em>\n    includes\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    contains\n   </em>\n   the debtor's principal residence, and not real property\n   <em>\n    on which the debtor resides\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adebanjo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6098093\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/165/98/#p104\">\n    165 B.R. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 (Bankr.

Under the approach adopted by this Court, the fact that the Debtors operate a business from their home does not exclude Creditor's claim from the anti-modification provision of \u00a7 1322(b)(2) simply because the Property also serves additional purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wages\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4168417\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/508/161/#p167\">\n    508 B.R. at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the fact that the Debtors rent a separate structure on the Property to a third-party and receive rental income, in and of itself, does not preclude application of the anti-modification provision to the Creditor's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260174\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/550/19/#p24\">\n    550 B.R. at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The third factor, however, goes to whether Creditor's claim is secured by collateral\n   <em>\n    in addition\n   </em>\n   to the real property that is the Debtors' principal residence, in which case the antimodification provision would not apply. The Debtors asserts that Creditor's claim is secured by additional collateral-namely, a second parcel of land that is not the Debtors' residence. The Debtors note that the parties have in fact stipulated that Creditor's claim is secured by two separate parcels [Docket Number 41, p.7 (citing to Docket Number 24, Line 5) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As the Creditor properly notes, however, \"[t]he fact that a debtor's home sits on a large tract or multiple lots does not automatically lead to a conclusion that the claim is secured by more than just the personal residence.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Snowden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116378\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/546/39/#p44\">\n    546 B.R. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). The determination of whether multiple parcels of real property constitute a debtor's principal residence \"is a fact-intensive analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116378\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/546/39/#p44\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Creditor argues that both parcels of real property securing its claim are the Debtors' principal residence based on evidence in the record characterizing the parcels as one residential property. In particular, Creditor asserts that the Debtors' schedules in this case and their prior chapter 7 case, together with the Appraisal and the \"tax records\" establish that the Debtors' principal residence includes both parcels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, Creditor notes that in the Debtors' prior chapter 7 case, the Debtors scheduled the Property as their residence and claimed the homestead exemption on Schedule C [Docket Number 42, p.2]. Similarly, Creditor observes that the Debtors claim a homestead exemption on Schedule C in this case [Docket Number 42, p.8; Docket Number 45, p.1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In response, Debtors explain that the Property was scheduled together in their current case as an \"administrative convenience\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   because both parcels are collateral for the Creditor's claim [Docket Number 44, p.4]. The Debtors point out that it is clear from their schedules in this case that their residence is separate from the second parcel because the schedules expressly state that the Debtors' residence is \"valued together with adjoining parcel on SR 775\" [Docket Number 44, p.5]. With respect to the exemption issue, Debtors state that Creditor has not offered any proof that Debtors intended to claim their homestead exemption against anything other than the portion of the collateral that holds their principal residence [Docket Number 44, p.5]. Regardless, Debtors maintain that the exemption issue is \"nullity\" because there is no equity in the Property [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   This Court finds that the manner in which the Debtors scheduled the Property in their prior chapter 7 case and this case in and of itself is not conclusive as to whether both parcels securing Creditor's claim are the Debtors' principal residence for purposes of \u00a7 1322(b)(2). While the Debtors did in fact check the box identifying the Property as a \"single-family home\" in Schedule A/B in the Debtors' prior case, they went on to identify and value the parcels separately as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Parcel No: 32-018-1301.000-$11,830.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Parcel No: 32-018-1500.000-$98,720.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   [Creditor's Ex. B, p.10]. Further, Creditor's assertion that the Debtors claimed a homestead exemption for the Property in their prior case is incorrect. The Debtors claimed no exemption for the Property in their prior case. [Id., p.16-17]. The Debtors' schedules in their current case are similarly inconclusive regarding whether the additional parcel is part of the Debtors' principal residence. This Court notes that the Debtors did not check a box on Schedule A/B in their current case describing the nature of the Property [Docket Number 1, p.10]. This Court further observes that the Debtors value the Property at $122,000 on Schedule C in their current case and only claim a homestead exemption in the amount of $100,000 [Docket Number 1, p.16], which could support the Debtors' argument that they were only claiming an exemption in the portion of the Property that is their residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Next, Creditor maintains that the Appraisal \"values the lots as essentially one, listing only the total value in its appraisal report\" [Docket Number 42, p. 8]. Creditor further notes that the Appraisal itself is a residential appraisal [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ]. As with their schedules, the Debtors respond that they obtained a single appraisal \"for consistency's sake\" since both parcels secure Creditor's claim [Docket Number 44, p.5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This Court finds Creditor's arguments regarding the Appraisal to be similarly inconclusive. The Appraisal merely establishes the value of the collateral securing Creditor's claim. The fact that it is a \"residential\" appraisal is unavailing. As Creditor argues and the tax records confirm, both parcels are residential property [Creditor's Ex. A]. As such, the fact that the Appraisal values the parcels as such does nothing to establish that the second parcel is also the Debtors' principal residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, Creditor argues that \"the tax records show the property is used as a single-family residence and residential vacant land\" [Docket Number 45, p.1 (referencing Creditor's Ex. A) ]. Debtors counter that the tax records \"tell a very different and far more convincing story\" [Docket Number 44, p. 5]. They maintain that the tax records show that the Debtors' residence sits solely on parcel no. 32-018-1500.000 (\"\n   <em>\n    Parcel # 1\n   </em>\n   \") while the separate structure that is rented to a third-party is located on parcel no. 32-018-1301.000 (\"\n   <em>\n    Parcel # 2\n   </em>\n   \") [id.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   While Creditor could have painted a clearer picture supporting the Debtors'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   residential use of the second parcel, this Court finds that the tax records together with other evidence in the record are sufficient to establish that the both parcels serve as the Debtors' principal residence. The tax records show that the house, which is on Parcel # 1, was built in 1966 [Creditor's Ex. A, p. 1]. Parcel # 2 includes a storage shed, which was also built in 1966. Parcel # 2 also includes the garage\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the attached rental unit and another storage shed, which were all built in 1976 [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 5].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tax records, as well as the deed, reflect that the Debtors acquired both parcels in the same conveyance on October 9, 1996 [Creditor's Ex. A, Debtors' Ex. A]. The fact that all of the out-buildings are located on Parcel # 2, including the only garage on the Property [Appraisal, pp. 4, 11], suggests that the two parcels were acquired to be used as one residential property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Beckford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526442\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/247/27/#p30\">\n    247 B.R. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2000) (finding that the \"location of the driveway and off-street parking area supports the conclusion that, although the house may be located within the confines of one lot, both lots have been used together as one residence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The configuration of the two parcels likewise suggests that the two parcels are one integrated property. The second parcel is in a u-shape that completely surrounds the parcel containing the Debtors' house. The Debtors' house appears to be positioned right on the edge of both parcels such that the inability to use Parcel # 2 would impair the Debtors' use and enjoyment of their house on Parcel # 1. As such, the layout of the parcels suggests that Parcel # 2 serves more as an \"expanded backyard\" than as a separate and distinct property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Frank\n   </em>\n   , 2014 Bankr.

E.D.N.C., Oct. 23, 2014). Drawing reasonable inferences from the record before this Court, it is difficult for this Court to find that the Debtors do not use Parcel # 2 as part of their principal residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds that Creditor's claim is secured only\n   by a security interest in real property that is the Debtors' principal residence and, as such, is protected by the anti-modification provision of \u00a7 1322(b)(2).
