INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mattie Mae Faulkner (\"the Debtor\") filed this chapter 13 bankruptcy on January 30, 2017. On March 27, 2017, M &amp; T Bank (\"M &amp; T\") filed a proof of claim in the amount of $126,523.43, secured by a mortgage on the Debtor's residential real property, 5432 North Fairhill Street, Philadelphia, PA (\"the Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 12, 2017, the Debtor filed a Complaint commencing this adversary\n   proceeding against M &amp; T. She filed an Amended Complaint on January 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This adversary proceeding is the latest legal skirmish involving the Property, going back to 2002. Prior to the commencement of this adversary proceeding, the Property was the subject of four (4) mortgage foreclosure lawsuits in state court and three (3) prior bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Amended Complaint raises eight (8) causes of action, invoking a broad range of legal theories, including lack of standing to enforce the secured debt, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , breach of contract, and violation of state and federal consumer protection statutes. Some of the claims are purely defensive in nature, designed to reduce or entirely eliminate M &amp; T's allowed claim; others are affirmative claims for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 19, 2018, M &amp; T filed a motion to dismiss (\"the Motion\") the Amended Complaint under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012 (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ), asserting that it has an enforceable right to collect the debt embodied in its secured proof of claim and that the Debtor's claims lack merit as a matter of law. The Debtor filed her response to the Motion on February 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Some of the issues presented by the parties are so clear cut that I wonder why they bothered to press them. Others are more problematic, sometimes involving difficult, unsettled issues of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The task of working through the claims and M &amp; T's asserted grounds for dismissal was made more arduous because the Debtor's forty (40) page, more than 200 paragraph Amended Complaint is unnecessarily prolix and filled with legal conclusions interspersed in the statement of facts and factual allegations interspersed in the statement of claims.\n   <em>\n    But\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7008 (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 ) (complaint should contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Motion will be granted in small part and denied in large part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons set out below, I will:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 grant the Motion and dismiss Counts II and III, which request that M &amp; T's proof of claim be disallowed based on the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 grant the Motion in part as to Count VI, insofar as the Debtor seeks affirmative damages for breach of contract, but I will permit Count VI to go forward insofar as it constitutes a defensive objection to M &amp; T's claim, seeking a partial disallowance of the claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 deny the Motion as to all of the remaining claims:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Count I - lack of authority to collect the secured debt;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Count IV - partial claim disallowance based on the merger doctrine;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Count V - partial claim disallowance based on Pennsylvania Act 6 of 1974;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Count VII - damages for violation of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practice and Consumer Protection Law; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Count VIII - damages for violation of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Consequently, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) also is relevant. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

However,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     an exception to the general rule is that a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The rationale underlying this exception is that the primary problem raised by looking to documents outside the complaint-lack of notice to the plaintiff-is dissipated [w]here the plaintiff has actual notice ... and has relied upon these documents in framing the complaint. [W]hat is critical is whether the claims in the complaint are 'based' on an extrinsic document and not merely whether the extrinsic document was explicitly cited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267575\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/241/#p249\">\n    770 F.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The following facts are based on the Amended Complaint and the court records of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County and this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 1994, the Property was solely owned by Kevin Faulkner, then the Debtor's spouse. At that time, Kevin Faulkner entered into a loan transaction with Provident Mortgage Corporation, secured by a mortgage (\"the Mortgage\") on the Property in the amount of $53,900.00. Kevin Faulkner was the sole obligor on the associated note (\"the Note\"). Later, the Mortgage was assigned to Provident Bank of Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 2002, Provident Bank of Maryland filed a mortgage foreclosure action against the Property, naming Kevin Faulkner as the sole defendant (\"the 2002 First Foreclosure\"). On February 24, 2003, Provident Bank of Maryland obtained a default judgment in foreclosure for $59,830.40 (\"the 2003 Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Soon after the 2003 Judgment was entered, the Debtor finalized her divorce from Kevin Faulkner. On June 26, 2003, pursuant to a court order, the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas executed a deed, transferring the Property to the Debtor. The deed was recorded on July 14, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On February 27, 2003, (three (3) days after the entry of the 2003 Judgment, but prior to the execution and recording of the Prothonotary's deed to the Property), the Debtor filed her first chapter 13 bankruptcy case, docketed at Bky. No. 03-12945. In the course of that case, she filed an adversary proceeding against Provident Mortgage Corporation, Adv. No. 04-058, that was settled on terms not apparent on the record. The Debtor's chapter 13 plan was confirmed on September 9, 2003, but the case was dismissed on September 14, 2004 for failure to make plan payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On November 29, 2004, the Debtor filed her second chapter 13 bankruptcy case, docketed as Bky. No. 04-35789. The Debtor's chapter 13 plan, which was confirmed on June 28, 2005, was designed to cure the default on the Mortgage. The case was dismissed on motion of the chapter 13 trustee, by order dated December 20, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On April 11, 2006, the Debtor filed her third chapter 13 bankruptcy case, docketed as Bky. No. 06-11509. Her chapter 13 plan was confirmed on February 27, 2007. Again, the plan was designed to cure the default on the Mortgage. The case was dismissed on April 29, 2008 for failure to make the required plan payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On October 16, 2008, Provident Bank filed its second mortgage foreclosure action (\"the 2008 Second Foreclosure\") against the Debtor and Kevin Faulkner. On November 11, 2008, while the action was pending, Provident Bank of Maryland assigned the Mortgage to Provident Bank. On February 17, 2009, the state court entered an order (\"the February 2009 Order\"), sustaining the Debtor's preliminary objection to the complaint and dismissing the 2008 Second Foreclosure. The February 2009 Order was entered because the \"Complaint [was] not properly verified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following the dismissal of the 2008 Second Foreclosure, Provident Bank did not file an amended complaint. Instead, on May 26, 2009, Provident Bank filed a third foreclosure action (\"the 2009 Third Foreclosure\") against the Debtor and Kevin Faulkner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 27, 2010, the same attorney who was representing Provident Bank in the 2009 Third Foreclosure filed a praecipe on behalf of Provident Bank of Maryland in the 2002 First Foreclosure (\"the 2010 Praecipe\") that purported to vacate the 2003 Judgment and discontinue the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Provident Bank discontinued the 2009 Third Foreclosure on March 19, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Later in 2012, M &amp; T began its collection efforts on the Note and Mortgage. M &amp; T filed a fourth foreclosure action against the Debtor and Kevin Faulkner on September 29, 2012 (\"the 2012 Fourth Foreclosure\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Debtor filed an answer and new matter in the 2012 Fourth Foreclosure, raising counterclaims for affirmative damages that are similar to the affirmative counts in the instant Complaint. The state court dismissed the counterclaims, with prejudice, on July 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   During the 2012 Fourth Foreclosure, M &amp; T requested leave of the state court to reissue the pre-foreclosure notices required by Pennsylvania's Loan Interest and Protection Law, Act 6 of 1984, 41 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 403(a) (\"Act 6\"), alleging that the notices should have been sent to the Debtor. The state court granted this request on November 15, 2016. M &amp; T sent the Debtor an Act 6 notice on December 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In 2014, the Property suffered damage that was covered by insurance. The insurance company sent the Debtor a check for $6,000.00. The Debtor forwarded this check to the entity claiming to be the holder of the Note and Mortgage. The Debtor then paid for the repairs herself. In the Amended Complaint, the Debtor alleges that she has not received credit for the insurance proceeds she paid to the alleged Note holder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Debtor filed the instant bankruptcy on January 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On March 27, 2017, M &amp; T filed proof of claim 2-1 (\"the Proof of Claim\") alleging a debt of $126,523.43 secured by the Property. The Debtor commenced this adversary proceeding on September 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. COUNT I - POSSESSION OF THE NOTE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Debtor's Count I Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In Count I, the Debtor argues that, under applicable nonbankruptcy law, M &amp; T lacks authority to enforce the debt that is secured by the Mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Specifically, the Debtor asserts that the Proof of Claim lacks evidence that M &amp; T \"is in possession of the Note and Mortgage which forms the basis for its proof of claim.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 105). In her Memorandum in opposition to the Motion, the Debtor argues that her position is bolstered by M &amp; T's failure to assert that it is the holder of the Note and Mortgage. (Debtor's Mem. at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As explained below, the Motion to dismiss this Count will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In essence, Count I amounts to an objection to the allowance of M &amp; T's Proof of Claim, a request for relief that ordinarily arises as a contested matter. Its assertion as part of an adversary proceeding is permitted by the rules of court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3007(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The existence of an allowable claim starts with the requirement that the claimant has a bankruptcy \"claim,\" which is defined as \"right to payment\" under applicable law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A). The Debtor's objection to M &amp; T's Proof of Claim requires that she establish that the claim is \"is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, the Debtor agrees that the source of M &amp; T's asserted right to payment is the Note and that the Note is a negotiable instrument under the Uniform Commercial Code. (Debtor's Mem. at 6 n.1.).

D.N.J. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, the Debtor alleges that M &amp; T \"is neither in possession of the note ... upon which it bases its claim nor is it the holder of the note ... with a right to enforce.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 107). This allegation, which I must accept as true at this stage of the adversary proceeding, states a claim for disallowance of M &amp; T's proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   M &amp; T seeks to avoid this outcome by referring to the copy of the Note that it attached to its Proof of Claim and states that the rules of court do not require that a proof of claim include an averment that the claimant has possession of an underlying note. As a result, M &amp; T posits that its Proof of Claim complies with the procedural requirement of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c) and is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   valid pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   M &amp; T also argues that the allegation that it lacks possession is disproven by the content of the Note it attached to the Proof of Claim. The Note, which is initially payable to Provident Mortgage Corp. t/a Consolidated Mort. Corp., is endorsed by Provident Mortgage Corp. to the order of Provident Bank of Maryland and then endorsed in blank by Provident Bank of Maryland. In addition, M &amp; T avers in the Proof of Claim that it is the successor by merger to Provident Bank of Maryland. Taking into account its attachment of the endorsed-in-blank note and M &amp; T's status as the successor to Provident Bank of Maryland,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   M &amp; T suggests that it is irrefutable\n   that it has possession of and is the holder of the Note (and therefore, that Count I should be dismissed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While the circumstances strongly suggest that M &amp; T has possession and is the holder of the Note, I am not persuaded that dismissal at the pleading stage is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   status of the Proof of Claim under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(f) cannot be determinative. Indeed, the reason the Debtor filed the adversary proceeding, and Count I in particular, was to overcome the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   status of M &amp; T's Proof of Claim. The Debtor has pled facts that, if proven, would do so. At least prior to discovery and summary judgment, the Debtor is entitled to establish that M &amp; T does not possess the Note or have any alternative grounds that support its right to enforce it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The fact that M &amp; T attached\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a copy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the Note to its proof of claim does not establish that it has actual possession of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     original\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   instrument. There are many ways a party may obtain a copy of a note without having possession, particularly where there has been prior litigation involving the instrument in which copies of documents were attached to court filings by other entities. Therefore, the copy of the Note attached to M &amp; T's Proof of Claim does not overcome the requirement that I accept as true the Debtor's allegation in the Amended Complaint that M &amp; T does not have possession of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Analysis of the merits of the motion to dismiss Count I requires one more step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While the Note is the basis for the debt that is secured by the Mortgage, the Debtor did not sign the Note and has no personal liability on it. Kevin Faulkner signed the Note when he owned the Property and only later did the Debtor take title. When she did so, the Property was subject to the Mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the Debtor's property is subject to a mortgage that secures an outstanding liability (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an outstanding right to payment), M &amp; T has a bankruptcy \"claim\" against the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (claim against the debtor \"includes claim against property of the debtor\");\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

However, M &amp; T's claim is only allowable if Pennsylvania law permits it to enforce its rights against the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the end, the allowability of the Proof of Claim turns on the question: may M &amp; T foreclose on the Property under Pennsylvania law? Because the Debtor has adequately alleged that M &amp; T does not hold and cannot enforce the Note, an allegation that I accept as true for present purposes, the answer is \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure contain no explicit requirement that a foreclosure complaint include documentation underlying the right to foreclose.

Based on that order, she conceptualizes M &amp; T as a state court loser, now coming to federal court as a plaintiff, (through the filing of its proof of claim), requesting that the federal court review and modify the state court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   M &amp; T asserts that Count II lacks merit as a matter of law. I agree. This claim for relief is borderline frivolous and will be dismissed. This is so for three (3) reasons\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   First, the February 2009 Order, dismissing the state court complaint because it was not properly verified, was not a dismissal of the 2008 Second Foreclosure on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Second, the assertion of the Proof of Claim against the Debtor is a request for relief based on events that preceded the entry of the state court order. It does not constitute a complaint regarding injuries caused by the state court order, as required by the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Great Western\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Third, in the absence of any indication that the dismissal of a mortgage foreclosure action was intended as a determination that the Note and Mortgage were absolutely invalid and unenforceable, the maximum effect the dismissal could have would be to bar the mortgagee from seeking foreclosure and payment based on the particular default alleged in the complaint. That is, the dismissal would not bar the mortgagee from filing a subsequent foreclosure action based on default of the note and mortgage occurring after the dismissal.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fairbank's Capital Corp. v.

If this requirement did not make the Debtor a \"party to the action\" for all actions in the foreclosure case that took place after the Property was deeded to her, at a minimum it made her a successor to Kevin Faulkner and placed her in privity with M &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Moreover, Kevin Faulkner's interest in the foreclosure litigation was identical to the Debtor's interest,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to protect the Property from acceleration, execution and sale. The Debtor took the Property subject to the 2003 Judgment, and acquired the same interest that Kevin Faulkner had when he failed to defend in the 2002 First Foreclosure: ownership of the Property subject to the foreclosure judgment, with a desire to avoid execution upon the Mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Having taken Kevin Faulkner's position with the same interests, the Debtor is sufficiently in privity with M &amp; T to invoke the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   against M &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   M &amp; T next argues that it was within its rights to institute a second foreclosure upon the Mortgage, even if the 2003 Judgment was still in effect because there were subsequent defaults. This, too, is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   M &amp; T's argument runs afoul of the merger doctrine. The entry of a foreclosure judgment fixes the positions of the parties: the mortgage merges into the judgment and no further monthly installments fall due as long as the judgment remained in effect. The debt secured by the mortgage is accelerated and is immediately due and payable in its entirety as set forth in the judgment. In short, there is no mortgage that could be in default or give rise to a new cause of action in mortgage foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   A post-judgment foreclosure action cannot accomplish anything for a mortgagee that has received a judgment - the relief sought has already been granted and the contract underlying the cause of action is not operational. 59\n   <em>\n    C.J.S.\n   </em>\n   Mortgages \u00a7 722 (West 2018) (\"When a mortgage has been validly and completely foreclosed, it cannot ordinarily be the subject of further foreclosures\").

R. Civ. P. 1028(a)(6) in support of its position, M &amp; T argues that the Debtor waived the affirmative defense of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   in preliminary objections to the complaints filed in the 2009 Third Foreclosure and the 2012 Fourth Foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Rule 1028(a)(6) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Preliminary objections may be filed by any party to any pleading and are limited to the following grounds:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (6) pendency of a prior action or agreement for alternative dispute resolution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   This argument is without merit for two (2) independent reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   First, it is not mandatory that a defendant raise every available defense in a preliminary objection, rather than in an answer and new matter. Rule 1028 states that preliminary objections \"may\" be raised, not that they must be raised. As a general proposition,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Although a defendant who fails to raise all preliminary objections at one time waives the right to voice those objections at a preliminary stage, the defendant is not barred from raising those complaints at an appropriate point later in an action. For example, although a defendant might lose the right to demur to a complaint by failing to include a demurrer with other preliminary objections, this does not mean that the defendant concedes, for the entire action, that a plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action. The legal sufficiency of a plaintiff's case remains an open issue, which a defendant may raise in his or her answer ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   3 Goodrich Amram 2d \u00a7 1028(b):6 (West 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Second, Rule 1028(a)(6) refers to pending matters that are in active litigation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not yet reduced to judgment),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   5\n   <em>\n    Standard Pennsylvania Practice\n   </em>\n   2d \u00a7 25:101 (West 2018), or matters committed to alternative dispute resolution (such as mandatory arbitration), not to the defense of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   based on a prior, final judgment. Indeed, the rules explicitly provide that the defense of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   be raised in a new matter as an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa. R. Civ.

Thus, under the state court rules, the Debtor could have sought leave to amend her pleading during the pendency of those actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa. R. Civ. P. 1033.

(M &amp; T Mem. at 21). M &amp; T suggests, however, that, at least for certain purposes, a default judgment is different than a judgment entered after a contest: it is entered without any judicial involvement; it is not a \"judicial order;\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   it may not be appealed unless a petition to open or strike has been denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these differences (and the lack of judicial involvement in the entry of the judgment, in particular) M &amp; T impliedly suggests that the default judgment belongs to the plaintiff to do with as it pleases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   M &amp; T also acknowledges that Pennsylvania rules of court include no express authorization for a party to effect vacatur\n   of a default judgment by praecipe, but adds that \"there is no procedural rule or case law that prohibits [the] procedure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).

R. Civ. P. 206.1 - 206.7 and 208.1 - 208.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Rules 206.1 - 206.7 require that a \"petition\" be filed for striking or opening a default judgment and set out the procedure to be followed after the petition is filed. Rules 208.1 - 208.4, more generally, provide that an application to the court for an order (with certain exceptions, including petitions under Rule 206.1 ) are requested by filing a \"motion\" and then set out the procedure to be followed after a motion is filed. Both sets of rules provide for notice to the opposing party and the opportunity to file a response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa. R. Civ. P. 206.2, 208.2(a)(4), 208.3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Debtor's essential argument is that the vacating of a judgment is the modification of a court order and therefore, regardless whether the proper procedure is found in Rules 206.1 - 206.7 or 208.1 - 208.4, it cannot be effected by praecipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Also, the Debtor emphasizes that, under Pennsylvania law, a default judgment is just as conclusive for\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   purposes as a judgment entered after contested litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

Nevertheless, I find it necessary to decide the issue and predict how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   I conclude that vacatur of a default judgment in mortgage foreclosure by praecipe, without the consent of the defendant and without notice and opportunity to be heard, is not authorized by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure and is legally ineffective. Consequently, if M &amp; T is the successor by merger to Provident Bank of Maryland,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n.5,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , it is bound by the 2003 Judgment, the doctrine of merger applies and the Motion to dismiss Count IV must be denied because it states a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   At the risk of oversimplification, my conclusion is based on the view that in the absence of textual support in the rules for the practice of vacating default judgments by praecipe, the due process requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard included in the existing court rules, along with the principles of finality and mutuality embedded in the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , are the most reliable expressions of Pennsylvania law on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   To be sure, M &amp; T's arguments that there is no statute or rule that explicitly prohibits vacatur-by-praecipe and that there is reason to believe that the procedure historically has been countenanced have some force. If a creditor holds a valid and enforceable default judgment obtained by the ministerial act of the prothonotary, it is not obvious why it should be prohibited from giving up the benefits of its judgment - usually (but not always) to its own detriment - and restarting merits litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Further, there may be a policy reason why a summary process for vacating a default judgment in mortgage foreclosure may be desirable. For example, if a defendant-mortgagor has cured a default after the entry of a foreclosure judgment but prior to sheriff's sale (a right that many\n   mortgages provide to a mortgagor), or the parties have entered into a forbearance agreement or loan modification after the entry of judgment in which the plaintiff-mortgagor agrees to reinstate the mortgage, it would appear to be in the interest of both the plaintiff-mortgagee and the defendant-mortgagor (as well as the court) to allow the mortgagee to update the public record regarding the status of the parties in the least costly, most efficient means possible: the simple act of filing a praecipe to vacate the judgment and a praecipe to discontinue the foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Nevertheless, while the issue is not free from doubt, I find the counterarguments more persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Although the rules of court allow a judgment to be entered by default through the ministerial act of the prothonotary, once that default judgment has been entered, a court order is in place that has determined the rights of the parties. In a sense, once entered, the judgment entered by the ministerial action of the prothonotary is transformed into something greater than a docket notation. This is clear from the preclusive effect given to the default judgment, which is treated as the final, judicial determination of the rights of the parties -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , of both parties. While this policy consideration arguably may be somewhat weaker in the default judgment context - where there has been no real contest between the legal positions of the parties - treating the default judgment in all respects as if it were entered by a judicial officer is bolstered by the policy of mutuality and notions of fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   In essence, a judgment is not a unilateral right held by the winning party, but a determination under the control of the court. This is even true for a default judgment, \"which remains within the control of the court indefinitely and may be opened or vacated at any time upon proper cause shown.\"\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648156\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/350/239/\">\n    350 Pa.Super. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648156\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/350/239/\">\n    504 A.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (1986) (citations omitted). Under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure and related case law, the standard mechanisms of undoing a judgment - opening and striking - require some court involvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is difficult to discern why vacating a judgment should be subject to different rules. To the extent that courts have permitted the practice of vacating a judgment to be effected by praecipe - for example, in the situations I described earlier (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , following a cure of the default giving rise to the judgment or a forbearance or loan modification agreement) - the vacatur of the judgment without active judicial involvement is, in essence, the product of the parties' agreement, not the unilateral action of the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent consent, the\n   court rules and related policy concerns strongly suggest that modifying a judgment requires notice, an opportunity to be heard and some cause for relief if the other party objects. The court rules could provide for a default judgment to be vacated by a praecipe if, with notice to the defendant, the plaintiff represents that the defendant consents to the vacatur. But no such rule presently exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The principles discussed above suggest that at least two (2) problems exist with the praecipe procedure used to vacate the 2003 Judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   First, while a praecipe to vacate must be served on every other party under Pa. R. Civ. P. 440,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   the praecipe here was not. The praecipe vacating the 2003 Judgment was served on one party: Kevin Faulkner, at the Property address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   By 2010, Provident Bank of Maryland, having filed the 2008 Second Foreclosure and 2009 Third Foreclosure against the Debtor, necessarily knew that the Debtor lived at the Property and was the real owner. Yet Provident Bank of Maryland did not serve her with the 2010 Praecipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Second, the purpose of Rule 440 is to give parties the opportunity to be heard if\n   they oppose whatever the petitioner is requesting. Vacatur-by-praecipe does not do this. When vacatur-by-praecipe is accompanied by a discontinuance, as occurred here, the very case in which a party might object is closed and ended, imposing an additional procedural hurdle to a party opposing vacatur.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duquesne Light Co. v.

In these circumstances, I conclude that M &amp; T's predecessors in interest did not validly vacate the 2003 Judgment, the Debtor may invoke\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   to bind M &amp; T to whatever consequences flow from the effect of its entry and the doctrine of merger.

Therefore, according to the Debtor, the legal fees cannot exceed $50.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    B. M &amp; T's Request for Dismissal on the Ground that Act 6 Is Inapplicable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   M &amp; T argues that Act 6 is inapplicable because the subject Mortgage is not a \"residential mortgage\" within the meaning of the statute and, therefore, not subject to the statutory pre-foreclosure notice requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The protective provisions of 41 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 403 and 406 are limited to statutorily defined \"residential mortgages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time M &amp; T's predecessor entered into the mortgage transaction with Kevin Faulkner, Act 6 defined \"residential mortgage\" as \"an obligation to pay a sum of money in an original bona fide principal amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less, evidenced by a security document and secured by a lien upon property located in this Commonwealth.\" 41 P.S. \u00a7 101 (as amended April 6, 1979, effective until September 7, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The original parties to the underlying loan transaction entered into the Mortgage in 1994. The original principal amount on the face of the Mortgage was $53,900.00. Thus, M &amp; T argues that, in 1994, the Mortgage was not an Act 6 \"residential mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   In 2008, the Pennsylvania Legislature amended 41 P.S. \u00a7 101, increasing the statutory ceiling from $50,000.00 to $217,873.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act 2008-57 (effective Sept. 8, 2008), 2008 Pa.

The pre-foreclosure notice provision of Act 6, 41 P.S. \u00a7 403, applies to the Mortgage. If M &amp; T failed to comply with \u00a7 403, its right to collect from the Debtor\n   all of the legal expenses it has incurred may be adversely affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Consequently, the Motion will be denied as to Count V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Here, the Debtor's claim is grounded in 41 P.S. \u00a7 403(a),\n   an Act 6 provisions that regulates foreclosure procedure, not the substantive terms of the Note and Mortgage. Consequently, all of the cited cases are distinguishable and do not support M &amp; T's request for dismissal of the Debtor's Count V claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   As far back as 1978, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that the notice provisions of Act 6 apply to mortgages that were executed prior to the statute's effective date, but that later became subject to Act 6 based on the definition of \"residential mortgage\" under the statute.\n   <em>\n    Ministers &amp; Missionaries Ben.

There is no reason to believe that when the Pennsylvania Legislature increased the scope of Act 6's coverage, it had any less of a consumer protective purpose in 2008 than it did in 1974. Therefore, I am convinced that 41 P.S. \u00a7 403(a) is intended to apply to any foreclosure of a mortgage that falls within the current definition of \"residential mortgage\" in 41 P.S. \u00a7 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   On the strength of\n   <em>\n    Goldsworthy\n   </em>\n   , I hold that 41 P.S. \u00a7 403(a) applies to the Mortgage in this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The conclusion that 41 P.S. \u00a7 403(a) applies to M &amp; T's foreclosure efforts after the effective date of the 2008 amendment to Act 6 does not end the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Debtor invokes 41 P.S. \u00a7 406 in order to translate the asserted violation of her notice rights into a monetary benefit and reduce M &amp; T's allowed secured claim. As stated earlier, \u00a7 406 restricts the amount of attorney's fees that a mortgagor can charge, depending upon whether the mortgagor has sent the statutory notice of intent to foreclose or has actually commenced a foreclosure proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   It is not clear whether \u00a7 406 may be applied to a mortgage that was not a \"residential mortgage\" under Act 6 when executed based on the enactment of the 2008 amendment to Act 6. Unlike \u00a7 403(a), which merely adds a procedural step in the foreclosure process and does not affect a mortgagor's substantive rights, \u00a7 406(a) potentially alters the substantive terms of a residential mortgage that includes a fee-shifting provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   That said, it is unnecessary further to explore this question in the context of the Motion requesting dismissal of Count V. Even without the invocation of 41 P.S. \u00a7 406, Count V states a claim for relief because the issue in this case does not concern the $50.00 attorney's fee limitation in \u00a7 406. Rather, the question is whether the entirety of the legal expenses incurred should be shifted to M &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Paragraph 17 of the Mortgage provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   If Lender requires immediate payment in full under Paragraph 9, Lender may foreclosure this Security Instrument by judicial proceeding.

Nevertheless, to the extent that HUD regulations governing the foreclosure process may have been violated, Count VI will survive insofar as the violations may provide grounds for a partial disallowance of M &amp; T's allowed secured claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Rooker-Feldman\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   In her Answer to M &amp; T's complaint in the 2012 Fourth Foreclosure, the Debtor asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract, raising essentially the same claim as she sets out in Count VI. However, on July 19, 2016, the state court entered an order (\"the July 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Order\") granting M &amp; T's motion for partial judgment on the pleadings and dismissing the Debtor's breach of contract claim \"with prejudice.\" (Ex. K to M &amp; T's Mem.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   M &amp; T asserts that the dismissal with prejudice of the Debtor's counterclaim in the 2012 Fourth Foreclosure bars this court from considering Count VI under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Respectfully, I disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Initially, I observe that I agree with M &amp; T that, on its face, the July 19th Order appears to be a dismissal of the Debtor's counterclaim for breach of contract on the merits. Unquestionably, M &amp; T stated several non-merits, procedural grounds in requesting dismissal of the counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. P to M &amp; T's Mem.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   But M &amp; T also asserted that the counterclaim failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted (largely for the same reasons asserted in this adversary proceeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The state court had both non-merits and merits grounds to choose from in deciding M &amp; T's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Had the state court concluded that the breach of contract claim was merely procedurally defective and impermissible in a mortgage foreclosure action, it is fair to conclude that it would have omitted the words \"with prejudice\" from the dismissal order. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the text of the order was that the court concluded that the counterclaim was properly raised in the action, but lacked merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Consequently, it is not surprising that M &amp; T seeks dismissal based on the state court's order. The Defendant litigated the validity of the contract claim on the merits in state court; it prevailed, and the Debtor is now raising the same issue in this adversary proceeding. At first blush, it appears possible that some kind of preclusion doctrine might apply. However,\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   is not applicable every time an issue has been previously decided by a state court. The facts here highlight the exceedingly narrow nature of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   M &amp; T's\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   argument fails for one of the same reasons that the Debtor's\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   argument failed in connection with Count II.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part V.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . M &amp; T cannot satisfy the second requirement of the doctrine:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the federal lawsuit complains of injuries caused by the prior state-court judgment. As stated earlier, when a federal plaintiff asserts an injury caused by the defendant prior to the entry of the state court judgment,\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n.6,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   In Count VI, the Debtor asserts that she suffered damages caused by M &amp; T's conduct, all of which pre-date the state court order dismissing her breach of contract claim. The Debtor is not complaining of harm caused by the state court dismissal order; she complains of harm caused by M &amp; T's earlier conduct.\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Failure to State a Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The thrust of the Debtor's contract claim is that certain provisions of the Mortgage incorporated federal regulations imposing certain limitations on M &amp; T's right to foreclose and that M &amp; T breached the mortgage contract by failing to perform those obligations before attempting to foreclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   In their competing memoranda, the parties engage in a spirited debate as to whether the Debtor, as a transferee who took title to the Property subject to the Mortgage, may assert claims for breach of M &amp; T's duties under the Mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   M &amp; T contends that as a transferee who is not a party to the Mortgage, who has not assumed it, but who is merely the owner of property that is subject to it, the Debtor does not step into the shoes of the original mortgagor and may not sue M &amp; T for the purported contract violations.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunkin' Donuts Franchised Restaurants, LLC v.

That may be so because the notion that a mortgagor has a right to sue a mortgagee for breach of the mortgagee's performance under the mortgage is more novel than the parties assume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Both parties appear to assume that the limitations on M &amp; T's right to foreclose on the Mortgage following a default that is expressed in the Mortgage (or incorporated by reference to federal regulations) constitutes an affirmative, contractual promise that, if not performed, may be the subject of an action for breach of contract. As explained below, I conclude, as a matter of law, that the Mortgage creates no such actionable promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Under basic principles of contract law, there is a critical distinction between a contractual condition and a contractual promise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   [A] condition is an event, not certain to occur, which must occur before performance under a contract becomes due. Whether words constitute a condition or a promise is a matter of the intention of the parties to be ascertained from a reasonable construction of the language used, considered in light of the surrounding circumstances.\n   <strong>\n    Where words in a contract raise no duty in and of themselves but rather modify or limit the promisees' right to enforce the promise such words are considered to be a condition.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   Whether a provision in a contract is a promise or a condition is significant in its legal effect.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The non-occurrence or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     failure of a condition is not a breach\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by a party unless he is under a duty that the condition occur.\"\n   <em>\n    [In re]Columbia Gas Sys.\n   </em>\n   , 50 F.3d [233]at 241 [3d Cir. 1995] (emphasis added).

C.S. \u00a7 3104(a). The payment obligation embodied in the Note is secured by the Mortgage. Upon a default of the Note, one remedy available to M &amp; T is foreclosure on the Mortgage. That right to foreclose is restricted by certain preconditions, such as the obligation to consider various forbearance or loan modification alternatives to foreclosure, to the extent required by the federal regulations; the right to foreclose also is subject to the requirement that the mortgagee provide the mortgagor with the pre-foreclosure notices required by Pennsylvania law, including Act 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   When properly viewed, these provisions of the Mortgage are not affirmative promises that the mortgagee will perform any duties. Rather, the Mortgage provides that the right to foreclose is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     conditioned\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on certain events and actions occurring before foreclosure proceedings are initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   At bottom, the Debtor has alleged nothing more than that certain conditions to foreclosure did not occur before M &amp; T commenced and pursued its foreclosure remedy. If true, the non-occurrence of those conditions establishes a defense to foreclosure, but does not support an affirmative claim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   For this reason, I will grant the Motion as to Count VI insofar as it states a claim for affirmative damages for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   The determination that the Debtor may not seek affirmative contract damages for breach of contract does not conclude the matter. Throughout the Amended Complaint, the Debtor asserts that her claims constitute both affirmative damage claims and an objection to M &amp; T's proof of claim. That is equally true with respect to Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   The facts alleged in Count VI, if proven, support an objection to M &amp; T's Proof of Claim on the ground that M &amp; T engaged in foreclosure activity without first satisfying contractual preconditions and therefore, its claim for various legal expenses incurred during the foreclosure process should be disallowed. To the extent that the claimed reduction in the allowed secured claim does not overlap the Count IV remedy, the Debtor is entitled to pursue this remedy.

Because the Debtor was qualified, the Debtor asserts that M &amp; T had no right to make a demand for payments in order to make such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The Debtor did indeed make some payments in reliance upon M &amp; T's special forbearance demands. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 193).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   The payment demands and factual omissions in the communications were likely made to deceive a reasonable borrower. As a result, interest, fees and charges continued to accumulate when the special forbearance should have paused some or all of them. M &amp; T then applied payments made by the Debtor, totaling between $21,000.00 and $22,000.00, to various fees and charges which were inflated and uncollectable. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 203).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   If these facts are proven, the Debtor can satisfy all three (3) elements of her UTPCPL claim: a deceptive act, reliance on the representations made to her, and an ascertainable loss of money due to the misapplication of payments actually made. In reaching this conclusion, I join other courts in this jurisdiction holding that that deceptive conduct in servicing a mortgage that caused a borrower to make payments states a UTPCPL claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Count VII will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   <strong>\n    XI.

Beginning with an argument that she revisits in other counts and that will be discussed below -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that the purported vacating of the 2003 Judgment entered in the 2002 First Foreclosure was a nullity, that the Judgment remains in effect and that the underlying mortgage has ceased to exist (having merged into the Judgment)\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Stendardo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516402\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/1089/\">\n     991 F.2d 1089\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3d Cir. 1993) - the Debtor asserts that in the absence of some evidence that Provident Bank of Maryland assigned its rights as judgment creditor to M &amp; T, M &amp; T has no interest in the underlying debt and no right to receive a distribution in the bankruptcy case. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-111). However, as explained below, the Debtor's main theory (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that M &amp; T does not possess the note) will survive M &amp; T's Rule 12(b)(6) motion. so it is unnecessary to consider her second theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-313\">\n    The fact that the Debtor's claim objection is being raised in an adversary proceeding warrants consideration of certain procedural differences between claims objections and adversary proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-314\">\n    An objection to a proof of claim typically is handled in a more summary fashion than an adversary proceeding. The rules do not require a response to an objection, but rather after an objection is filed, a hearing is promptly scheduled. At the hearing, specialized rules, which have been discussed in a legion of reported decisions, establish a system of \"shifting burdens\" with respect to the burden of proof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-315\">\n    Simply put, Rule 3001(c) provides that if a claim is based on a writing, the claimant must attach the writing to the proof of claim. Rule 3001(f) provides that a proof of claim filed \"in accordance\" with the rules constitutes\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    evidence of the validity and amount of the claim. In effect, a proof of claim that complies with the rules of court serves as both a pleading and as trial evidence, even in the face of an objection to the claim.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Henry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117341\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/546/633/#p634\">\n     546 B.R. 633\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 634-35 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2016).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-316\">\n    If the claimant's proof of claim qualifies for\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    status under Rule 3001(f), the burden of producing evidence contesting the validity or amount of the claim shifts to the objector. To meet this burden, the objector's evidence must \"refute at least one of the allegations that is essential to the claim's legal sufficiency.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Allegheny Int'l, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6512872,10517296\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/954/167/\">\n     954 F.2d 167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 173-74 (3d Cir. 1992). If the objector meets that burden, the ultimate burden of proof remains with the claimant, which may require the claimant to offer additional evidence in support of the validity or amount of the claim.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Henry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4117341\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/546/633/#p634\">\n     546 B.R. at 634\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-317\">\n    Presumably, these burden shifting rules apply at trial in an adversary proceeding. However, an adversary proceeding allows for an extra layer of pretrial process: a responsive pleading in the form of a motion to dismiss, which challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-318\">\n    In this adversary proceeding, M &amp; T's responsive pleading is a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012(b) (incorporating Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 ). As stated earlier, in the Rule 12(b)(6) context, the factual averments in the complaint are accepted as true in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). If, as appears to be the case here, M &amp; T's proof of claim is entitled to\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    status as to its validity and amount, for Count I to survive the motion to dismiss, the Amended Complaint must allege facts that refute at least one of the allegations essential to the legal sufficiency of M &amp; T's proof of claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-319\">\n    While the Debtor argues that M &amp; T's asserted status as a successor by merger to Provident Bank of Maryland is a factual issue that should be determined at a later stage of the proceeding, the publicly-searchable business and trade name databases maintained by the Departments of State of Pennsylvania and Maryland (containing information that is subject to judicial notice) suggest otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    \"Provident Bank of Maryland\" was incorporated in Maryland,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Md.

Thus, Provident Bank of Maryland and Provident Bank appear to be one and the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    The Debtor asserts that M &amp; T has not explained its connection with Provident Bank of Maryland. This is directly belied by the Proof of Claim, filed under oath, which includes a document stating that M &amp; T is the successor by merger to Provident Bank of Maryland. In light of my denial of the Motion as to Count I on other grounds, I need not reach the issue at this time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    If the averment in the Proof of Claim regarding M &amp; T's status as successor by merger is accepted, that fact also would refute one of the Debtor's Count IV arguments,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that the 2003 Judgment (entered in favor of Provident Bank of Maryland) is binding on the parties, but M &amp; T has not shown its right to enforce that judgment (entered in the name of another entity).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    Technically, in order to rely on M &amp; T's averments in the Proof of Claim regarding its status as successor by merger over the Debtor's denial, the Motion would have to be treated as a motion for summary judgment with respect to this issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
