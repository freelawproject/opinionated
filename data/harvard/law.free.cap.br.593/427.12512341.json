The Court has considered the pleadings and finds that a hearing would not aid the decisional process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Bankruptcy Rule 9013-1(b)(4). For the following reasons, the Motion to Vacate is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By way of brief background, this involuntary case was commenced on June 14, 2018, upon the filing of a Chapter 11 Involuntary Petition by David L. Woody (\"Woody\"); Zarella Contractors, LLC (\"Zarella\"); and Trinity Protection Services, Inc. (\"Trinity\") (together, all three petitioning creditors shall heretofore be referred to as the \"Petitioning Creditors\"). The Receiver filed a Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Bankruptcy Petition on June 19, 2018 (the \"Motion to Dismiss\"). The Motion to Dismiss alleged, among other things, that that the Involuntary Petition was filed in bad faith in an attempt to thwart sale proceedings in the Alleged Debtor's ongoing state court receivership case, and that the Petitioning Creditors failed to meet the statutory criteria to commence this involuntary proceeding. The Petitioning Creditors opposed the Motion to Dismiss. They then substituted Carlos Yeargen for Zarella Contractors, LLC as one of the Petitioning Creditors in an attempt to overcome some of the alleged deficiencies with the Involuntary Petition. After ancillary litigation involving the ability of the Receiver's counsel to represent it in this matter, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Motion to Dismiss on August 21, 2018. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss and gave the Parties time to brief the issue of the Receiver's\n   entitlement to damages in connection with the filing of the Involuntary Petition. The Order Dismissing Involuntary Bankruptcy Case and Temporarily Barring Further Involuntary Petitions was entered on August 23, 2018 (the \"Dismissal Order\"). The Dismissal Order barred each of the Petitioning Creditors from commencing, or joining in the commencement of, an involuntary bankruptcy case against the Alleged Debtor until further Order of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Petitioning Creditors filed the Motion to Vacate on August 31, 2018. Relying on Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023, the Motion to Vacate asserts that dismissal of this case was in error for three reasons: (i) Trinity was authorized to join the Involuntary Petition because it was in the process of winding up its affairs when it was filed; (ii) if Trinity, as a forfeited Maryland Corporation, was not authorized to join the Involuntary Petition, then it could not qualify as a petitioning creditor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and could therefore, join the involuntary petition under \u00a7 303(c) ; and (iii) the Receiver failed to submit any evidence that the Alleged Debtor had more than eleven creditors, therefore, the Involuntary Petition could have been filed by less than three petitioning creditors. The Petitioning Creditors argue that the Court overlooked a controlling decision from this District that, had it been considered by the Court, would have led to a different result. The Motion to Vacate also asserts that the Court should decline to award any damages to the Receiver and that the Petitioning Creditors acted in good faith so the bar to refiling should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 (New Trials; Amendment of Judgments), which makes Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 applicable to bankruptcy cases, provides: \"After a nonjury trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new judgment.\" Fed.

At the time it filed the adversary complaint, Mintec had sold its assets to another company and had no employees but remained a corporate entity after the sale of its assets for the purposes of receiving an \"earn-out\" over\n   time that would expire in 2008 and to recoup its damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761661\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/392/180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761661\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/392/180/\">\n    at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Petitioning Creditors neither argued nor presented any evidence prior to the Motion to Vacate to show that Trinity joined in the Involuntary Petition as part of efforts to wind up its affairs. The issue was not even raised at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. Instead, on August 20, 2018 - the day before the hearing - Trinity filed a \"Statement of Revival of Charter for Trinity Protection Services, Inc.\" in which it states that Trinity has \"revived its charter per the attached statement of good standing\" and \"to the extent necessary for this court to retain jurisdiction, Trinity will re-join the involuntary petition filed to commence this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Motion to Vacate asserts that the Petitioning Creditors did not have the opportunity to show that Trinity filed the Involuntary Petition \"as part of a good faith liquidation of winding up its affairs.\" The Court disagrees. It is undisputed that the Receiver challenged Trinity's eligibility to be a petitioning creditor in this case based on its corporate forfeiture. The issue was analyzed extensively in the Receiver's Reply Memorandum in support of its Motion to Dismiss, which attached excerpts of the deposition testimony of Darren Gregory Hollis, Trinity's President, as an exhibit. The attached deposition excerpt included a statement by Mr. Hollis that Trinity is an \"operating entity with an intent to garner contracts in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. O, p. 34 to Docket Entry No. 22 and Receiver's Ex. No. 50. Instead\n   of addressing Trinity's corporate standing, however, the Petitioning Creditors focused on a new theory in their responsive pleading, namely, that Trinity was a creditor of the Alleged Debtor as opposed to a related company under an alter ego theory of recovery. Thereafter, Trinity filed its Statement of Revival of Charter. Unquestionably the Petitioning Creditors had the opportunity to argue that Trinity filed the Involuntary Petition as part of its efforts to wind up its affairs to rebut the Receiver's contention that Trinity's forfeiture rendered it ineligible to file the Involuntary Petition. They failed to do so and cannot use Rule 59(e) to pursue this alternative theory after their initial theories failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nevertheless, even if the Court were to consider the Petitioning Creditor's argument that Trinity was winding up its affairs, the Motion to Vacate fails to present sufficient evidence to establish this. Mr. Hollis' post-dismissal affidavit, which was filed as an exhibit to the Motion to Vacate, does not credibly support the Petitioning Creditors' position. In seeking to clarify statements he made during his July 6, 2018 deposition in which he stated that although Trinity did not have any current contracts, he considered Trinity to be \"an operating entity with an intent to garner contracts in the future,\" Mr. Hollis' affidavit states that he was not referring to Trinity when he was talking about future operations, but was talking about himself, his wife and her new company, which was formed in 2016 to \"garner the same kinds of contracts as Trinity had performed\" after the United States \"began asserting tax liens against Trinity.\" If this were the case, there would have been no need for Trinity to revive its corporate charter on August 14, 2018. The Petitioning Creditors are offering a contrived interpretation of facts to support a new legal theory even though those facts and theories were available to them when they initially opposed the Motion to Dismiss. As stated above, Rule 59(e) is not a mechanism by which a party may continue to file motions with new theories until it gets it right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Hanover Ins.

Reading these provisions together, an original petitioning creditor may not join in the involuntary petition at a later date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 303.19[1] (16th ed. 2011) (\"Creditors eligible to join are those that were not petitioning creditors under section 303(b) and who hold unsecured claims that are not contingent.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 303(c) states that relief under that subsection is not available to those creditors \"filing under subsection (b).\" The Petitioning Creditor's argument would render the disqualifying language of \u00a7 303(c) meaningless if a defect in eligibility nullified a petitioning creditor's participation in the original involuntary petition so that they could be treated as a new creditor for purposes of \u00a7 303(c) after the defect was cured. Trinity, although ultimately deemed ineligible to file the Involuntary Petition, still filed the Involuntary Petition under \u00a7 303(b). Therefore, it is precluded from joining in the petition at a later date by \u00a7 303(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Receiver's Burden\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Petitioning Creditor's third argument is that the Receiver failed to submit any evidence that the Alleged Debtor had more than eleven creditors, therefore, they assert that the Involuntary Petition could have been filed by less than three petitioning creditors. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, this is another new argument that is neither based on new facts nor a change in controlling law so it could have been pursued when opposing the Motion to Dismiss. Regardless, the Petitioning Creditors have confused the burdens applicable to involuntary cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Petitioning Creditors cite Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1003(b), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If the answer to an involuntary petition filed by fewer than three creditors avers the existence of 12 or more creditors, the debtor shall file with the answer a list of all creditors with their addresses, a brief statement of the nature of their claims, and the amounts thereof. If it appears that there are 12 or more creditors as provided in \u00a7 303(b) of the Code the court shall afford a reasonable opportunity for other creditors to join in the petition before a hearing is held thereon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1003(b). Based on this Rule, the Petitioning Creditors assert that that the Receiver had the burden of proving that the Alleged Debtor has twelve or more creditors. There is no basis for this assertion. First, Rule 1003(b) was never invoked in this case because the Receiver never filed an answer to the Involuntary Petition. Instead, it filed the Motion to Dismiss as permitted by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1011. Second, even if an answer had been filed, the Involuntary Petition was filed by three creditors so there was no requirement under Rule 1003(b) for the Receiver to provide a list of creditors. Under such circumstances, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(a)(2) would have applied and the Receiver would have been required to file a list of creditors to be included on Schedules D, E/F, G, and H within seven days after entry of the order for relief. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007. Nonetheless, despite the inapplicability of Rule 1003(b), the Receiver attached a list of the creditors that received notice of the Receivership Case to the Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D to Docket Entry No. 6. The list, which consists of twenty five creditors, was admitted into evidence at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and was not rebutted by the Petitioning Creditors. As the Receiver argues in its Opposition to the Motion to Vacate, it was because of this list of creditors that the Petitioning Creditors substituted Carlos Yeargen for Zarella as a Petitioning Creditor in order to maintain the requisite number of petitioners (three) under \u00a7 303(b)(1) and presumably why Trinity revived its charter. Had there been any doubt that the Alleged Debtor had fewer than twelve qualifying creditors, the Involuntary Petition could have been filed solely by creditor Woody. Again, this argument fails to warrant the extraordinary relief afforded by Rule 59(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Finding of Bad Faith/Temporary Bar to Refiling\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Petitioning Creditors argue that there is a presumption that bankruptcy cases are filed in good faith and that the temporary bar to refiling contained in the Dismissal Order was not proper absent a finding of bad faith. The Court dismissed this case because the Involuntary Petition was not filed by three qualifying creditors. The Court did not make any findings at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss as to whether the Involuntary Petition was filed in bad faith. Instead, the Court reserved the issue of bad faith to be determined in connection with any damages sought by the Receiver if it was determined that the Receiver had standing to request damages under \u00a7 303(i). These issues have been briefed by the parties and are the subject of other pending motions filed in this case and will be addressed in more detail in connection therewith. In the meantime, however, the Court imposed a temporary bar to refiling another involuntary petition against the Alleged Debtor, at the Receiver's request, in order to maintain the status quo and allow the receivership proceedings to go forward. It is undisputed that the Petitioning Creditors were forum shopping when they filed the Involuntary Petition to stop the sale of the Alleged Debtor's assets in the receivership case. The Receiver also presented evidence that the delay in the sale proceedings in the receivership case caused by the filing of the Involuntary Petition was costly because the Receiver was expending funds to pay security and insurance expenses to protect the receivership estate's assets pending the sale of those assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Receiver's Ex. No. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court's power to impose the temporary bar is based on \u00a7\u00a7 105(a) and 349(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. These provisions grant the Court broad authority to issue any order that \"is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title\" and prevent an abuse of the bankruptcy process, including dismissing a case with prejudice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Meltzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284648\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/535/803/#p821\">\n    535 B.R. 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2015). The Court determined that a temporary bar was necessary and appropriate in this case after counsel for the Petitioning Creditor stated at the hearing that he had another creditor that may be interested in joining the Involuntary Petition. Counsel made this statement\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Court determined that the Petitioning Creditors failed to meet the statutory criteria for commencing an involuntary case. The timing of Counsel's statement indicated that the Petitioning Creditors were looking for another opportunity to stop the state court receivership proceedings, which would have rendered the dismissal of the instant case ineffective. Imposing a temporary bar prevented them from doing so pending further order of this Court. The Court notes that the Receiver has since filed a Motion to Extend Temporary Bar Prohibiting the Commencement of Further Involuntary Bankruptcy Petitions (the \"Motion to Extend Temporary Bar\") in which it relied on several cases where bankruptcy courts have imposed a bar on the refiling of another involuntary petition. The Petitioning Creditors did not file an opposition to the Motion to Extend Temporary Bar. Nevertheless, a determination of the bad faith, if any, of the Petitioning Creditors in filing the Involuntary Petition will impact the Court's determination regarding the duration of the bar on refiling. At this time, the Court will keep the temporary bar in place to preserve the status quo pending a determination of the Petitioning Creditors' alleged bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Receiver's Entitlement to Damages\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The final argument raised in the Motion to Vacate addresses whether the Alleged\n   Debtor or the Receiver incurred damages as a result of the Involuntary Petition. No damages were awarded in the Dismissal Order. In fact, the Receiver's entitlement to any damages is still under consideration by the Court and will be determined after the evidentiary hearing scheduled for November 28, 2018. Accordingly, this argument is premature and will be addressed in connection with other pending motions filed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court finds that the Motion to Vacate fails to establish a basis to warrant the extraordinary remedy of altering or amending the Dismissal Order under Rule 59(e). An Order consistent with this Memorandum will be entered contemporaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Again, although the Petitioning Creditors posit the Motion to Vacate as being premised on controlling case law not considered by the Court, they do not argue that there was an intervening change in controlling law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
