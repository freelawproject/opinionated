LBHI's Loan Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to its bankruptcy, LBHI, directly or through its affiliates, including Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (\"LBB\"), engaged in the purchase and sale of mortgage loans. LBHI arranged directly or through affiliates such as LBB to purchase mortgage loans from loan originators and other third parties (the \"Sellers\") including the Defendants; it then packaged such loans for securitization or sale to other third parties. In transactions involving UAMC, UAMC sold mortgage loans to LBB pursuant a Loan Purchase Agreement dated September 20, 2005 (as amended by an Addendum dated October 1, 2006, the \"UAMC LPA\") pursuant to which, among other things, UAMC contractually agreed to indemnify LBB and hold it harmless from liabilities or losses it might incur (including liabilities to third parties) as a result of breaches of the representations and warranties in the UAMC LPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In transactions involving\n   Eagle, Eagle (or its predecessor, Eagle Home Mortgage, Inc.) sold mortgage loans to LBB pursuant to a Loan Purchase Agreement dated October 21, 2004 (the \"Eagle LPA\" and, together with the UAMC LPA, the \"Agreements\") pursuant to which, among other things, Eagle contractually agreed to indemnify LBB and hold it harmless from liabilities or losses it might incur (including liabilities to third parties) as a result of breaches of the representations and warranties in the Eagle LPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conjunction with the sale by LBB to LBHI of the loans at issue, the Complaints assert that LBB subsequently assigned to LBHI all of its rights and remedies under the Agreements pertaining to such loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each of the Agreements specifically incorporates the terms and conditions of the Seller's Guide of loan administrator, Aurora Loan Services LLC (the \"Seller's Guide\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the Seller's Guide, the seller makes certain representations, warranties, and covenants to the purchaser of mortgage loans about, among other things, the quality, characteristics, and underwriting of each mortgage loan; the property securing the mortgage loans; and the borrowers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the event the seller breaches a representation, warranty, or covenant thereunder, the Seller's Guide delineates various forms of remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Specifically, section 710 of the Seller's Guide, entitled \"Repurchase Obligation\" provides, in relevant part, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In the event of a breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in Section 700 through 710 herein ... and unless Purchaser determines that such breach has been cured ...

Prior Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In March 2011, LBHI filed suit against UAMC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Case No. 11-CV-20859) (the \"Florida Action\"), alleging breaches of representations and warranties regarding eight mortgage loans that UAMC sold to LBB pursuant to the UAMC LPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 9, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed without prejudice seven of the eight counts in the complaint initiating the Florida Action, finding that such counts lacked commonality of factual circumstances, and granted LBHI the right to re-file each of such counts as a separate complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Immediately following dismissal of the Florida Action, LBHI filed seven actions in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (the \"Colorado District Court\"), each relating to one loan at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In five of the seven actions (collectively, the \"Colorado Actions\"), the Colorado District Court granted summary judgment in favor of UAMC on the basis that LBHI's breach of contract claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehman Bros.

Colo. August 28, 2014). LBHI appealed the five summary judgment decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (the \"Tenth Circuit\"). In a consolidated appeal, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the five summary judgment decisions, finding that LBHI's breach of contract claims accrued in 2006 and 2007 at the time LBHI purchased the loans at issue and, therefore, the claims asserted in the Colorado Actions filed by LBI in 2011 and 2012 were time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations for breach of contract under Delaware law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehman Bros.

The GSEs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac,\" and, together with Fannie Mae, the \"GSEs\") were two subsequent purchasers of mortgage loans from LBHI. In September 2009, both GSEs filed proofs of claim against LBHI (collectively, the \"GSE Claims\"), asserting breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants in numerous sale agreements for loans they had acquired from LBHI. The GSE Claims asserted claims for, among other things, \"alleged indemnity/reimbursement obligations\" and \"indemnity claims\" arising from the sale of mortgage loans to the GSEs, including mortgage loans originated by and purchased from the Defendants and ultimately sold to the GSEs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In its review of the GSE Claims, LBHI determined that certain loans, including those brokered or sold by the Defendants, contained various defects that violated the representations, warranties, and covenants under the Agreements. LBHI has alleged that the representations, warranties, and covenants in the sale agreements between the GSEs and LBHI were co-extensive with those in the Agreements between LBB and the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Lehman asserts that Defendants' breaches, acts, and omissions caused LBHI to incur liability to the GSEs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In January 2014, LBHI settled its disputes with the GSEs regarding the allowance of the GSE Claims (the \"GSE Settlements\"). The Court approved the GSE Settlements by Orders dated January 31, 2014 and February 19, 2014 (the \"GSE Settlement Orders\") [Case No. 08-13555, Dkt. Nos. 42420, 42918]. Pursuant to the Fannie Settlement, Fannie Mae received an allowed claim for $2.15 billion in LBHI Class 7 under the Plan, and, pursuant to the Freddie Settlement, Freddie Mac received a one-time cash payment of $767 million from LBHI, each in settlement of all claims and disputes between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Adversary Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequent to entering into the GSE Settlements, the Plan Administrator identified over 11,000 loans and over 3,000 potential counterparties against which LBHI allegedly held third-party contractual claims for indemnification and/or reimbursement by virtue of the GSE Settlements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   To manage this volume of indemnification claims, the Court authorized the Plan Administrator to implement a pre-litigation mediation protocol\n   with the Sellers from which it sought indemnification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedures Order for Indemnification Claims of The Debtors Against Mortgage Loan Sellers, dated June 24, 2014 [Case No. 08-13555, Dkt. No. 45277].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To further facilitate its pursuit of recoveries from those Sellers with whom mediation was unsuccessful, the Plan Administrator initiated adversary proceedings in this Court, including those at issue here, against more than one hundred Sellers (including the Defendants) in tandem with six previously-filed adversary actions (collectively, the \"Adversary Proceedings\"). Pursuant to the CMO, the Adversary Proceedings have a central docket for court filings (Adv. Pro. No. 16-01019) and have been coordinated for administrative purposes, including scheduling motions and discovery procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 22, 2016, LBHI filed the UAMC Complaint, initiating Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01297 against UAMC; on December 30, 2016, LBHI filed the Eagle Complaint, initiating Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01383 against Eagle and UAMC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the Complaints, LBHI claims that each of the Defendants breached its obligations under the Agreements by selling or submitting defective mortgage loans into LBHI's loan sale and securitization channels, and, thus, LBHI has a third-party indemnification claim against each Defendant for LBHI's liability to the GSEs (together, the \"Indemnification Claims\"). Specifically, the Complaints allege that it was Defendants' breaches of the representations, warranties, and/or covenants under the Agreements that caused LBHI to have to compensate the GSEs pursuant to agreements between LBHI and the GSEs that contained representations, warranties, and/or covenants co-extensive with those contained in the Agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The CMO provides a time frame for (i) the filing of so-called threshold motions such as motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) based on venue, jurisdiction, and/or failure to state a claim and (ii) objections to such motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 31, 2017, certain defendants in the Adversary Proceedings (including the Defendants) filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the complaints filed against such defendants pursuant to (i) Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and (ii) Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3) for improper venue [Dkt. No. 413] (the \"Motion to Dismiss\"). By Memorandum Decision and Order, dated August 13, 2018 [Dkt. No. 606], this Court denied the Motion to Dismiss, finding that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over each of the Adversary Proceedings and that venue in this Court is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The CMO also provides a time frame for the filing of so-called threshold motions to\n   address unique issues of individual defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As permitted by the CMO, Defendants filed the instant Motion seeking dismissal of the Complaints pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\" Rule 12(b)(6)\"), made applicable by Rule 7012(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on June 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By the Motion, the Defendants argue that the Complaints should be dismissed because the rulings in the Colorado Actions and in\n   <em>\n    Universal American\n   </em>\n   have preclusive effect as to LBHI's claims against the Defendants; as such, they assert that the allegations in the Complaints are barred by claim preclusion and by issue preclusion. LBHI vehemently disagrees. The Court's ruling follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   By the Motion, Defendants assert that the Complaints should be dismissed on the basis of claim preclusion because (i) LBHI is attempting to relitigate the same claims that were already dismissed in the Colorado Actions, which decisions were affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, and (ii) LBHI is precluded from making claims that it could have asserted in the Colorado Actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants contend that the first, second, and fourth elements of the claim preclusion doctrine under Colorado law are easily satisfied because (i) the summary judgment decisions in the Colorado Actions were final and have been affirmed by the Tenth Circuit; (ii) LBHI is suing the same party, UAMC, under the same contract, the UAMC LPA, in connection with the same transactions, the sale of mortgage loans sold from UAMC to LBB, which loans were subsequently sold to LBHI; and (iii) the Colorado Actions involved the same parties - UAMC and LBHI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, Defendants assert that the third element of the claim preclusion doctrine\n   - that the claims for relief in the two actions must be identical - is satisfied because the claims for relief in the Colorado Actions and those in these Adversary Proceedings are all claims arising under the same agreements - the UAMC LPA and the Seller's Guide. They point to the \"transactional approach\" applied by Colorado courts, whereby a contract is generally considered to denote a single transaction for the purposes of claim preclusion and, therefore, claims for breaches of such contract must ordinarily be brought in the same action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Colorado law, argue the Defendants, even those claims that arise from severable parts of a divisible contract are considered to be part of the same transaction for purposes of claim preclusion, and \"claims are tied by the same injury where they concern all or any part of the transaction or series of connected transactions, out of which the [original] action arose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Defendants submit that, even if the Colorado Actions and these Adversary Proceedings assert claims for breach on account of different loans, because the allegations in all of the actions arise under the same agreements, the judgments entered in the Colorado Actions (and affirmed by the Tenth Circuit) extinguished all claims held by LBHI with respect to such agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Alternatively, Defendants contend that, even if the Court is persuaded that the claims LBHI asserted in the Colorado Actions are different from those now asserted in these Adversary Proceedings, because the claims in the Adversary Proceedings\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been brought in the Colorado Actions, they are now barred by claim preclusion. Defendants' position is that Colorado's transactional approach would deem the claims \"identical\" for purposes of claim preclusion because they are all tied to alleged injuries under the UAMC LPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, even if LBHI did not assert third-party indemnification claims in the Colorado Actions, claim preclusion nonetheless applies because LBHI could have asserted in the Colorado Actions such indemnification claims pursuant to section 711 of the Seller's Guide. Defendants argue that LBHI's breach of contract claims in the Colorado Actions and its indemnification claims in these Adversary Proceedings arise from the same series of connected transactions, and claims based on the same transaction or series of connected transactions may not be split.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   By the Opposition, LBHI argues, persuasively, that claim preclusion does not apply because the third factor of the claim preclusion test - that the claims in the prior action and the instant action are identical - has not been satisfied. LBHI asserts that (i) the claims raised in the Colorado Actions involved entirely different mortgage loans, contracts, and loan originators than those asserted in Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01383, and (ii) the claims asserted in Adversary Proceeding\n   No. 16-01297 are based on entirely different mortgage loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because each claim of breach arises from a unique set of facts, circumstances, defects, and damages, LBHI contends that (i) the claims in the Prior Actions and in these Adversary Proceedings cannot be deemed to arise out of a single transaction, even if certain of the claims may arise from the same contract (as in the case of the UAMC Complaint), and (ii) as a result, the claims in these Adversary Proceedings need not have been brought in the Colorado Actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, and dispositively, LBHI argues that claim preclusion cannot apply here because LBHI's third-party indemnification claims against the Defendants did not accrue until LBHI entered into the GSE Settlements in 2014, as this Court has previously ruled;\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   as such, LBHI could not have raised these claims in the Colorado Actions, which were commenced in January 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court finds that the claims asserted by LBHI in Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01297 and Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01383 are not barred by claim preclusion. While the Defendants correctly cite the proposition that, under Colorado law, a contract generally is considered to denote a single transaction for the purpose of claim preclusion, such that claims for different breaches of a contract ordinarily must be brought in the same action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petromanagement Corp. v. Acme-Thomas Joint Venture\n   </em>\n   , 835 F.2d at 1335-36, the Tenth Circuit has explicitly noted that this is only the case \"so long as the breaches antedated the original action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1336. The Court of Appeals of Colorado has also concluded that \"[c]laim preclusion does not bar a later action on claims [under the same contract] which arise after the original action is filed, but before judgment in the original action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loveland Essential Group, LLC v. Grommon Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 318 P.3d at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, the Colorado Actions were commenced in 2013, prior to LBHI's entry into, and the Court's approval of, the GSE Settlements in 2014. LBHI's Indemnification Claims against each Defendant did not accrue until its liability to the GSEs was fixed upon entry of the GSE Settlement Orders in early 2014; accordingly, the Indemnification Claims did not arise in time for LBHI to have pled them in the Colorado Actions. As such, they are not barred by claim preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the claims asserted in the Adversary Proceedings could have been raised in the\n   Colorado Actions, the Court finds that, because the claims in each of the actions arise from the sale of different loans, each with a unique set of facts, circumstances, alleged defects, and asserted damages, such claims cannot be considered \"identical\" for purposes of the claim preclusion inquiry, even if the claims arise under the same contract. Each purchase of an individual loan by LBB from a Defendant cannot be considered as part of a single transaction merely because the parties agreed that each loan purchase and sale would be governed by the same terms and conditions set forth in the Seller's Guide. As LBHI correctly asserts, multiple federal courts (including the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the venue for the Florida Action) have held that claims regarding mortgage loans sold under the same contract need not or should not be brought in the same action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   So too here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, specifically with respect to Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01383, claim preclusion also cannot apply because this Adversary Proceeding involves a different defendant and a different contract than those involved in the Colorado Actions. Eagle, a defendant in Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01383, was not a party to the Colorado Actions, and the Defendants have not asserted that Eagle was in privity with UAMC when the Colorado Actions were commenced. Further, the claims in the Colorado Actions related to loans sold by UAMC under the UAMC LPA, whereas the claims in Adversary Proceeding 16-01383 relate to loans sold by Eagle under the Eagle LPA. Accordingly, neither the requirement that the claims for relief be identical nor the requirement that the parties to the proceedings be identical (or in privity with one another) is satisfied with respect to the claims LBHI has asserted in Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01383.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Motion to dismiss the Complaints on the basis of claim preclusion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Minn. Aug. 15, 2018) (\"In reaching its ruling, the court [in\n   <em>\n    Universal American\n   </em>\n   ] relied on New York precedent involving the implied right of indemnity.... Here, however, Plaintiffs expressly assert a stand-alone cause of action for\n   <em>\n    contractual\n   </em>\n   indemnity that does not allege a refusal to indemnify or breach of the indemnification provision.\"). Because the Tenth Circuit found that LBHI had not asserted a cause of action for express contractual third-party indemnification in the Colorado Actions, the Court concludes that the issue of whether or not the Indemnification Claims are time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations was not actually litigated and necessarily adjudicated in\n   <em>\n    Universal American\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Lehman Bros.

After analyzing sections 710 and 711 of the Seller's Guide and canvassing every case in which the parties' loan purchase agreement (or documents closely akin to such agreement) had been at issue, this Court held that LBHI's claim for indemnification under section 711 of the Seller's Guide did not accrue until the date of the Fannie Mae Settlement, when its liability to a third party was fixed or payment was made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, only at that time did the\n   six-year statute of limitations begin to run.

Similarly, section 711 was not discussed in\n   <em>\n    Universal American\n   </em>\n   , which decision barred as untimely LBHI's claims for breach of contract under section 710. The Indemnification Claims asserted by LBHI in the Complaints are contractual indemnification claims under section 711 of the Seller's Guide that did not accrue until LBHI's liability to the GSEs was fixed upon the approval of the GSE Settlements in 2014. Causes of action for express contractual indemnification have not been actually litigated and necessarily adjudicated in the prior proceedings pointed to by the Defendants - the Colorado Actions and\n   <em>\n    Universal American\n   </em>\n   .
