The court conducted a hearing on the Dev Stay Motion on June 5, 2018 in Raleigh, North Carolina and continued the hearing until June 13, 2018 in Raleigh, North Carolina, at which time the court conducted a joint hearing on the Dev Stay Motion and the CFCU Stay Motion. Cort I. Walker, Esq. appeared for the Debtor, S. Troy Staley, Esq. appeared for CFCU, Mr. Dev appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and Michael B. Burnett, Esq. appeared on behalf of Chapter 13 trustee John F. Logan, Esq. Based upon the court record, evidence presented, and arguments of the parties, the court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Debtor and Mr. Dev were married on May 6, 1992. During their marriage, on June 24, 2008, they executed a promissory note (\"Note\") in favor of CFCU for the original principal amount of $189,000.00. The Note requires monthly payments to CFCU in the amount of $1,118.01 for a period of 30 years. Repayment of the Note is secured by a Deed of Trust executed by the Debtor and Mr. Dev which encumbers real property (\"Property\") located at 404 Silvergrove Drive, Cary, North Carolina. CFCU properly perfected its lien on the Property by recording the Deed of Trust with the Wake County Register of Deeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Property was the marital residence of the Debtor and Mr. Dev until July 1, 2014, at which time the parties separated, and Mr. Dev relocated. The Debtor and their minor child remained and continue to reside at the Property. Upon petition of Mr. Dev, the Wake County District Court, File Number 13 CVD 11338, granted an absolute divorce on September 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since her separation from Mr. Dev, the Debtor has filed in this district three petitions for relief under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) Case Number 15-00158-5-SWH filed on January 9, 2015 and dismissed on October 15, 2015 for failure to make plan payments;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) Case Number 16-02500-5-DMW (\"2016 Bankruptcy\") filed on May 11, 2016 and dismissed on September 12, 2017 for failure to make plan payments; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) The current case filed on February 13, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each of these cases was filed to, among other reasons, prevent foreclosure of the Property by CFCU. As stated in the CFCU Stay Motion, \"[t]he initial foreclosure action was initiated by CFCU in 2016, but due to the bankruptcy filings by the debtor, CFCU has not been successful in completing the process. The prior filings were both filed during the 10-day upset bid period, rendering the foreclosure sales invalid.\" CFCU Stay Motion, \u00b6 12, ECF No. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In each case, the Debtor proposed a Chapter 13 plan providing for monthly conduit payments on the Note and a cure of its pre-petition arrearage. According to a Proof of Claim filed by CFCU in this case on April 30, 2018, at the time of the\n   Debtor's petition, the total balance due under the Note was $200,605.63, and the Note was in default as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-19\"><strong>32 monthly payments of $1,118.01</strong> <strong>$35,776.32</strong> <strong>Fees</strong> <strong>4,574.33</strong> <strong>Funds in Suspense</strong> <strong>(55.68)</strong> __________ <strong>Total Pre-petition Arrearage</strong> <strong>$40,294.97</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The scheduled value of the Property securing the Note is $250,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The CFCU Stay Motion requests relief from the automatic stay imposed by \u00a7 362(a) to allow CFCU to complete a foreclosure of its security interest in the Property. Although the CFCU Stay Motion does not pray specifically for relief from the co-debtor stay under \u00a7 1301, CFCU's counsel clarified at the hearing that CFCU believes it also requires this relief to foreclose the Property and orally amended the CFCU Stay Motion to include this additional request. CFCU contends that it lacks adequate protection in the Property due to the default on the Note, constituting cause for relief pursuant to \u00a7 362(d)(1). Additionally, CFCU asserts that the Debtor's third bankruptcy petition was filed in bad faith, is an abuse of the Bankruptcy Code, and is part of a scheme to delay, hinder and defraud CFCU; therefore, the requested\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   relief should be binding in future cases filed within two years pursuant to \u00a7 362(d)(4)(B). CFCU notes that upon similar motions filed in the Debtor's two prior cases, the parties executed consent orders conditioning the continuance of the automatic and co-debtor stays upon timely plan payments for a period of 12 months. The Debtor defaulted in her obligations under both consent orders, resulting not only in modification of the applicable stays but dismissal of the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As part of his action for divorce, on December 15, 2014, Mr. Dev filed a request for equitable distribution of marital property, and in the Dev Stay Motion, he seeks relief from the automatic stay to continue the equitable distribution proceeding in state court. Mr. Dev also prays the court to award him sanctions against the Debtor, asserting that her repeated bankruptcy filings and default on the Note have injured his credit rating and prevented him from obtaining a loan to buy new property, despite his being able to afford to do so. He wants the Property sold to satisfy the Note and outstanding\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   tax obligations. The Debtor counters that absent agreement of the parties, the state court cannot order the Property sold, citing\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Miller\n   </em>\n   , --- N.C.App. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647836\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/799/890/#p903\">\n    799 S.E.2d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (2017) (holding that for equitable distribution, the court's role is to classify, value, and distribute property, not simply to order that it be sold). She opposes stay relief, arguing that allowing Mr. Dev to continue the equitable distribution action will be costly and could only result in a dischargeable claim against her. The Debtor further contends that there are no grounds for the imposition of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the initial hearing on the Dev Stay Motion, the court questioned\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   whether the automatic stay is even in effect, because this case was filed within a year of the 2016 Bankruptcy's dismissal and the stay ostensibly terminated on the 30th day after the petition pursuant to \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A). The Debtor responded that any termination of the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) does not apply to actions against property of the estate such as the Property, citing this district's cases of\n   <em>\n    In re Paschal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n    337 B.R. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2006) and\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2700131\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/339/360/\">\n    339 B.R. 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2006). To allow it time to review and consider this issue not raised or briefed by the parties, the court continued the hearing on the Dev Stay Motion to be heard jointly with the pending CFCU Stay Motion, noting that CFCU would be equally affected by determination of whether the automatic stay remained in effect as to actions against the Property. At that subsequent hearing, CFCU and the Debtor announced that they had reached a settlement for consideration by the court which conditioned the continuance of the automatic stay and the co-debtor stay upon the Debtor meeting certain terms and conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Unfortunately, the broad protections of the automatic stay, while aiding honest debtors in obtaining a fresh start, can foster abuse of the Bankruptcy Code by allowing an individual to file a petition for the sole purpose of invoking the automatic stay but with no intention to comply with the obligations of a debtor. Such a bad faith filing will usually be dismissed in due course, at which point the debtor simply files a new petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Limitations of the Automatic Stay in Repeat Filings Under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With section 302 of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (\"BAPCPA\"), titled \"Discouraging Bad Faith Repeat Filings,\" Congress attempted to curb debtor abuse and limit the protections of the automatic stay to serial filers by adding the following restriction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this section-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (3) if a single or joint case is filed by or against a debtor who is an individual in a case under chapter 7, 11, or 13, and if a single or joint case of the debtor was pending within the preceding 1-year period but was dismissed, other than a case refiled under a chapter other than chapter 7 after dismissal under section 707(b)-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (A) the stay under subsection (a) with respect to any\n   <em>\n    action taken\n   </em>\n   with respect to a debt or property securing a debt or with respect to any lease shall terminate\n   <em>\n    with respect to the debtor\n   </em>\n   on the 30th day after the filing of the later case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (emphases added). The legislative history of BAPCPA states that \"Section 302 of [BAPCPA] amends section 362(c) of the Bankruptcy Code to terminate the automatic stay within 30 days in a Chapter 7, 11, or 13 case filed by or against an individual if such individual was a debtor in a previously dismissed case pending within the preceding one-year period.\" H.R. REP. NO. 109-31, pt. 1, at 69 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Debtor's current petition was filed within a year of dismissal of the 2016 Bankruptcy, triggering the application of \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A). The Debtor did not seek timely an extension of the automatic stay beyond 30 days pursuant to \u00a7 362(c)(3)(B),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   presumably relying on\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   for her position that \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) does not cause expiration of the automatic stay as to the Property. In these cases, the Honorable A. Thomas Small navigated in the wake of BAPCPA the specific language of \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) to determine to what extent the automatic stay terminates on the 30th day after a petition filed within one year of the dismissal of a previous case. At the outset, the Judge Small found that-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   in an Act [i.e., BAPCPA] in which head-scratching opportunities abound for both attorneys and judges alike, \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) stands out. It uses the amorphous phrase \"with respect to\" a total of four times in short order and\n   raises questions about the meaning of the words \"action taken,\" and \"to the debtor.\" The language of the statute is susceptible to conflicting interpretations, and if read literally, would apply to virtually no cases at all. In sum, it's a puzzler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n    337 B.R. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1. \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) and \"Action Taken\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   , the court focused on the phrase \"action taken\" and compared the word \"action\" to the broader term \"act\" used in other subsections of \u00a7 362. Applying established principles of statutory construction, the court concluded that-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   the term \"action\" means a formal action, such as a judicial, administrative, governmental, quasi-judicial, or other essentially formal activity or proceeding. Furthermore, the action with respect to which the stay terminates is an \"action taken,\" which means an action in the past, prior to the filing of the debtor's bankruptcy petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n    at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This interpretation is logical, because creditors who have spent time and money to initiate a legal process, which is frustrated by repeated bankruptcy filings, should be protected over those who have not expended such resources. Following this analysis, Mr. Dev's equitable distribution action and CFCU's foreclosure proceeding, each initiated pre-petition, are the types of \"actions taken\" which the automatic stay terminates under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A). Any reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   to support the Debtor's position that the automatic stay applicable to these creditors has not terminated is unfounded. Contrarily, in\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   , no creditor actions were taken prior to the debtor's bankruptcy, so the court held that no protections of the automatic stay were terminated in the case but noted that-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [t]here remain other issues with respect to \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A). Yet to be decided is the meaning in \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) of the term \"with respect to the debtor.\" If the stay is lifted as to an \"action taken,\" does the stay terminate with respect to the property of the estate or only with respect to the debtor? That is an interesting question that need not be decided in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This subsection contains no \"with respect to\" limitations like within \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A), and the court observed that Congress's \"use of a particular phrase in one statute but not in another 'merely highlights the fact that Congress knew how to include such a limitation when it wanted to.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2700131\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/339/360/\">\n    339 B.R. at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37882\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/274/\">\n    337 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   279 ).

Although urged by the moving creditor to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   approach, she concluded that Congress intended \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) to serve as a significant deterrent to bad-faith repeat filers by terminating after 30 days\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   protections of\n   the automatic stay provided by \u00a7 362(a).\n   <em>\n    Goodrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511972\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/829/\">\n    587 B.R. at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrarily, Judge Grossman agreed with Judge Small that-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Congress's use of the phrase \"action taken\" in contract to \"act\" used elsewhere in the statute should not be ignored. In addition, [the\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   ] interpretation of the statute is consistent with this Court's view that \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) was intended to apply and shift the burden from the creditor to the debtor in cases where, as here and in many cases, a debtor uses bankruptcy in order to stymie judicial, administrative or other proceedings with respect to debts, property securing such debts and leases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   , 562. B.R. at 583. This court sees merit in both positions. While leaning toward agreement with the\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   approach, the court will for now leave the\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   interpretation of the phrase \"actions take\" undisturbed in the interest of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , because the results in this case would be the same under either interpretation. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , both CFCU's foreclosure proceeding and Mr. Dev's equitable distribution action qualify as \"actions taken\" as that phrase is interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Goodrich\n   </em>\n   , the court's reversal of its interpretation of \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) was prompted by a secured creditor's motion for reconsideration of\n   <em>\n    McFeeley\n   </em>\n   . Judge Brown recognized that the debtor relied justifiably upon\n   <em>\n    McFeeley\n   </em>\n   when it chose not to move to extend the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(B) as to the collateral property of the estate and, therefore, exercised her powers under \u00a7 105\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to grant the debtor 30 days to seek such an extension\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Goodrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511972\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/829/\">\n    587 B.R. at 848-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court does not find the need to extend the same courtesy to the Debtor in this case, making the CFCU Stay Motion moot. Even if the automatic stay were in place, the CFCU Stay Motion presents sufficient cause for granting relief from the stay under \u00a7 362(d)(1). The Debtor is almost three years in arrears in her obligations under the Note, and the Debtor has no meaningful non-exempt equity to protect through a Chapter 13 plan.

In an opinion issued prior to\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   , Judge Grossman determined that the termination of the automatic stay pursuant to \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) does not likewise terminate the co-debtor stay.\n   <em>\n    In re Lemma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734810\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/299/#p304\">\n    393 B.R. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (Bankr.

The court declines to consider fully the issue, and in either case, relief from the co-debtor stay is necessary to seek collection of any foreclosure deficiency against Mr.\n   Dev personally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such relief is proper to the extent that-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (1) as between the debtor and the individual protected under subsection (a) of this section, such individual received the consideration for the claim held by such creditor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (2) the plan filed by the debtor proposes not to pay such claim; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (3) such creditor's interest would be irreparably harmed by continuation of such stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201301\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The termination of the automatic stay as to CFCU under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) prevents effectively the Debtor from paying CFCU's claim under the Note through a Chapter 13 plan, constituting cause for relief from the co-debtor stay pursuant to \u00a7 1301(c)(2). Additionally, relief is appropriate under \u00a7 1301(c)(3), because CFCU has been harmed by the Debtor's repeated bankruptcy filings which have frustrated CFCU's foreclosure efforts, and this harm may be irreparable if CFCU is further stayed by \u00a7 1301(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The automatic stay imposed by \u00a7 362(a) with respect to Mr. Dev's equitable distribution action against the Debtor and with respect to CFCU's foreclosure of the Property terminated under \u00a7 362(c)(3)(A) on March 15, 2018, which is 30 days after the Debtor's petition. This termination did not likewise terminate the co-debtor stay imposed by \u00a7 1301(a), but to the extent that the co-debtor stay precludes foreclosure of the Property or collection on the Note from Mr. Dev, relief is appropriate under \u00a7 1301(c). Although not addressed at the hearing, the court agrees with the Debtor that Mr. Dev has failed to state a viable claim for recovery of damages from the Debtor; now therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It is ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   1.
