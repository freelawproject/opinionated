PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Creditor-Appellant Kirk Etter appeals from the bankruptcy court's order dismissing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding filed by Debtor-Appellee, LLC 1 07CH12487 (\"Debtor\"). Debtor filed his Chapter 7 petition on December 31, 2013 and moved to dismiss it some three and a half years later. Over the objections of the Chapter 7 Trustee and the Creditor, the bankruptcy court granted that motion on October 11, 2017. As explained below, this court concludes that the bankruptcy court's findings are not sufficiently detailed to enable effective review, so the dismissal order is vacated and the case is remanded to the bankruptcy judge for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case stems from a dispute between Kirk Etter and the Debtor LLC over a mortgage note executed by a member of Debtor's managing LLC in April 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Motion of Debtor for Abstention and Dismissal (\"Debtor's Motion to Dismiss\") [BD\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   159] \u00b6\u00b6 16-18, Ex. 4; Brief of Appellant\n   Kirk Etter in Support of Appeal from Order of the United States Bankruptcy Court (\"Creditor's Brief\") [20], at 4.) Creditor Etter alleges that Debtor defaulted on the note, and Creditor sued the Debtor in Lake County, Illinois on February 20, 2013, obtaining a judgment on February 18, 2014. (Creditor's Brief [20], at 4.) On learning that the Debtor had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on December 31, 2013, however, the Creditor voluntarily vacated that judgment. (Transcript of Hearing, September 6, 2017 (\"September Transcript\") [228], at 30:11-16; Creditor's Brief [20], at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Debtor's voluntary Chapter 7 filing lists two Creditors: the City of Chicago Department of Revenue, and the City of Chicago Department of Water Management. (Chapter 7 Voluntary Petition [BD 1], Schedule D.) As reflected in later filings, it was the Village of Maywood, not the City of Chicago, that should have been named as a creditor. (Motion for Voluntary Dismissal [BD 49], at 6.) The Village moved for relief from the automatic stay in July 2015 (Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay [17] ), and the court granted that relief in November 2015 so that the Village could pursue a tax deed against Debtor in state court. (Order Granting Motion for Relief from Stay [BD 37] ). The Village of Maywood never filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court. Instead, Creditor Etter, who was not mentioned in the Chapter 7 filing, was the only party to file a proof of claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (September Transcript [BD 228], at 36:8-9 (\"[O]nly one claim was on file and that's Mr. Etter's.\"); Creditor's Brief [20], at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the course of the bankruptcy proceeding, Creditor Etter and Chapter 7 Trustee N. Neville Reid learned that Debtor was collecting monthly rent on property in the bankruptcy estate without turning those funds over to the estate. (Motion of Trustee for Turnover of Property of the Estate [BD 28] \u00b6 3.) The court ordered Debtor, \"its agents, employees, managers, and members\" to \"turn over all payments, rents, and transfers received ... at any time after filing the petition for relief.\" (Order for Turnover [BD 30].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two things happened following the turnover order. First Creditor and Debtor appear to have struck a deal to dismiss the bankruptcy case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September Transcript [BD 228], 25:1-26:19.) Under that deal, the Debtor agreed, among other things, to (a) turn over half of the post-petition rent to Creditor Etter (Trustee's Reply in Support of Motion for and Order of Contempt [179], at 9; (b) seek an order directing the Trustee to abandon the Maywood property and permit the Debtor to address the tax deed issue; and (c) move for dismissal of the bankruptcy. (Response\n   of Debtor to Trustee's Motion for an Order of Contempt [168], at 2.) That deal appears to have ultimately faltered; the Trustee did abandon the Maywood property, but Debtor failed to turn over the agreed portion of rents to Creditor Etter. (Trustee's Reply in Support of Motion for and Order of Contempt [179], at 9.) Trustee Reid's counsel explained to the court that he \"tried very hard to get the debtor to comply with that deal\" but was unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:20-21.) Thus, Trustee eventually moved the court for an order of contempt due to Debtor's failure to comply with the turnover order. (Trustee's Motion for an Order of Contempt [BD 163].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, Creditor moved for, and the bankruptcy court granted, several Federal Rule of Bankruptcy 2004 Orders Authorizing Discovery of the Debtor. ( [BD 93], [BD 145], [BD 146], [BD 147], [BD 148], [BD 149], [BD 157], [BD 158].) The extent to which these orders have been complied with is debated by the parties, and the court ultimately terminated them as moot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September Transcript [BD 228], at 36:22; Order Mooting Motion to Compel [BD 199].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Three and a half years after the voluntary bankruptcy was filed, and with no distributions ever made from the bankruptcy estate, Debtor asked the bankruptcy court to abstain from or dismiss the case. (Debtor's Motion to Dismiss [BD 159].) Debtor argued that the case is a two-party dispute not appropriate for bankruptcy court and that the court should therefore abstain from or dismiss the case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (Debtor's Motion to Dismiss [BD 159], at 5-6 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Spade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11125372\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/221/#p231\">\n    258 B.R. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231-38 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2001) ) (\"\n   <em>\n    Spade II\n   </em>\n   \").) Trustee Reid, joined by Creditor Etter, opposed Debtor's motion, arguing that Debtor sought dismissal \"as a disingenuous method of avoiding compliance with [the] [c]ourt's October 20, 2015 Order for Turnover.\" (Trustee's Response to Motion for Abstention and Dismissal [BD 171], at 2; Order Granting Motion to Join [BD 201].) Trustee Reid also argued that the case was more than a two-party dispute and raised several policy concerns with respect to abstention in these circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At a September 6, 2016 hearing, the bankruptcy court conditionally granted Debtor's motion to dismiss. (September Transcript [BD 228], at 44:20.) The court determined that Creditor was the only party to file a proof of claim and that the bankruptcy was a single-creditor dispute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 38:16-23.) Therefore, the court reasoned, \"there is no bankruptcy purpose behind this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:9-10.) The court noted that Creditor is \"clearly capable of pursuing its rights\" against debtor in a state proceeding (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:22-23) and that Creditor received \"information [through the Rule 2004's] ... that he would not have been able to get under the more narrow authority of a pure lawsuit, perhaps.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:22-24.) The court terminated the pending motions to compel Debtor to turnover rent [BD 200] and to respond to pending 2004 discovery requests. ( [BD 199].) The court formally entered the dismissal order on October 11, 2017. (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Debtor [BD 215].)

At least on the record before this court, the bankruptcy court never identified the source of its authority to dismiss. (September Transcript [BD 228]; Order Dismissing Case [BD 215].) The Creditor appears to assume that the dismissal was entered pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), which the Debtor cited in its motion to abstain or dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Debtor's Motion to Dismiss [BD 159], at 5.) Assuming this is so, this court is uncertain what findings of fact and conclusions of law support dismissal under that provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spade I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11150928\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/255/329/#p333\">\n    255 B.R. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] court's failure to make findings necessary to the proper exercise of its discretion is itself an abuse of discretion.\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Those factors listed in the case law vary, but typically they include \"(1) the presence of unsettled issues of non-bankruptcy law; (2) the availability of another forum to decide those issues; (3) economy and efficiency of administration; (4) any prejudice to the parties; and (5) the purpose of the bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Int'l Zinc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873802\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/76/#p82\">\n    355 B.R. at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Spade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9461961\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/269/225/#p228\">\n    269 B.R. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (D.

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    In re Int'l Zinc\n   </em>\n   ., Judge Goldgar dismissed a voluntary Chapter 7 filing pursuant to \u00a7 305(a)(1) because he concluded that the bankruptcy proceeding lacked any \"legitimate bankruptcy policy or purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Int'l Zinc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873802\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/76/#p82\">\n    355 B.R. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, there were multiple creditors in that case, but the Debtor was out of business and the \"bankruptcy estate ha[d] no assets\" to satisfy the claims against it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873802\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/76/#p82\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873802\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/76/#p82\">\n    at 85-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, the court offered no explanation for its conclusion that a single-creditor case similarly lacks a bankruptcy purpose, thus justifying support \u00a7 305(a)(1) dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nor did the court in this case engage in analysis of the question whether dismissal would be in the interest of both Debtor and Creditor.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Int'l Zinc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873802\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/355/76/#p82\">\n    355 B.R. at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (making a finding, required by the text of \u00a7 305(a) that \"the interests of all parties will be better served if this case is dismissed\").

The transcript shows that the court cites \"\n    <em>\n     Tachnet\n    </em>\n    (phonetic),\" which this court is unable to locate, (September Transcript [BD 228], at 42:5), and\n    <em>\n     In re American Telecom Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9293108\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/304/867/\">\n     304 B.R. 867\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2004). That latter case deals with the dismissal of a debtor's voluntary Chapter 7 filing pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) because the court determined the bankruptcy was filed in bad faith. Perhaps the bankruptcy court in this case intended to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 707(a), but it has provided no analysis under that statute, either. Nor did the bankruptcy judge cite or distinguish any of the case law cited by Debtor in support of its motion to dismiss. ( [BD 159].) Though the court referred to\n    <em>\n     In re J &amp; R Trucking, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3819299\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/431/818/\">\n     431 B.R. 818\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr.
