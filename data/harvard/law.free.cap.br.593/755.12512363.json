(Docket No. 23.) The following facts are recounted from those stipulations, stipulated exhibits, and the Court's own docket. The parties stipulate, and the Court agrees, that there are no genuine disputes regarding the material facts relevant to the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Debtor is the daughter of the Defendant. On April 27, 2009, in Akron, Ohio, the Defendant executed a durable power of attorney appointing the Debtor as her attorney in fact (Docket No. 23 Ex. A) (the \"POA\"). The POA authorized the Debtor to take a wide range of actions with respect to the Defendant's person and property, including comprehensive powers with respect to the Defendant's interests in real property. The POA authorized the Debtor\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   to sell, lease, convey, and to deliver possession and control of [the Defendant's] real property, on such terms and conditions, and under such covenants, as said attorney in fact shall deem proper and in my name execute, acknowledge, and deliver such instruments necessary to effect such sale, conveyance, lease, or agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Docket No. 23 Ex. A at 2.) This is the most specific provision regarding the disposition and transfer of real property in the POA. The POA does not specifically authorize the Debtor to transfer real property from the Defendant to herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Defendant had not been adjudicated incompetent at the time of the execution of the POA. The POA is expressly not dependent on the disability of the Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 2, 2010, Debtor, as attorney in fact pursuant to the POA, executed a warranty deed, conveying, or purporting to convey, Defendant's interest the Real Estate to the Debtor (Docket No. 23 Ex. B)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (the \"Warranty Deed\"). The Warranty Deed was recorded that same day with the Shelby County, Alabama Judge of Probate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The POA was also recorded with the same recording authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the face of the Warranty Deed recites that the sum of $10,000 was paid in exchange for the transfer of the Real Estate, the parties stipulated that no sum of any kind was paid by the Debtor in consideration for the transfer of the Real Estate. (Docket No. 23 \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 19, 2014, the Debtor filed a petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtor identified the Real Estate on her Schedule A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Trustee obtained a title report on the property, dated July 28, 2016, which the Defendant later introduced as an exhibit to the Defendant's Motion (Docket No. 25 Ex. B) (the \"2016 Title Report\"). Under \"other matters,\" the 2016 Title Report provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The next conveyance is from Annie Bell Tolbert Shelton to Angela D. Shelton, dated August 2, 2010 and recorded in Inst. No. 201008020000246240. The deed is executed by Angela D. Shelton as attorney in fact for Annie Bell Tolbert Shelton pursuant to an improperly acknowledged power-of-attorney recorded in Inst. No. 20108020006246230. The recorded Power of Attorney does not give the attorney in fact the power to convert assets to her own use and is not valid upon the incompetency of Annie Bell Tolbert Shelton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Docket No. 25 Ex. B at 2.) Earlier, on January 12, 2015, the Trustee obtained a \"Limited Liability Title and Lien Certificate\" from the Shelby County Abstract &amp; Title Company, Inc. (Docket No. 28 Ex. A) (the \"2015 Title Report\") that concluded that the title to the Real Estate was vested in the Debtor. The 2015 Title Report did not contain language questioning the sufficiency of the Defendant's POA or the validity of the August 2, 2010 deed. The 2016 Title Report, including its reservations about the POA and the transfer of title to the Debtor, is not part of the record title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 22, 2016, the Trustee filed her Complaint seeking, inter alia, (a) the right to sell the Real Estate pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (b) a declaration and determination of the right, title, and interest of the parties in the Real Estate. (Docket No. 1.) In her Answer (Docket No. 11), the Defendant denied for want of knowledge that the Debtor has a fee simple interest in the Real Estate, that it is not currently encumbered by any mortgages or security interests or liens, and that the Trustee has the right to sell it free and clear of interests other than the estate's. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 6-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under Section 544(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, a bankruptcy trustee acquires the rights of a hypothetical\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser of the debtor's real property. A\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser under nonbankruptcy law takes title subject to any prior claims and interests of which she has either (1) actual knowledge, or (2) constructive knowledge. Such prior claims or interests prevail against the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser. However, the rights a bankruptcy\n   trustee acquires pursuant to Section 544(a)(3) allow her to act as a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser of the debtor's real property without regard to her actual knowledge or that of any creditor. Notwithstanding the trustee's power to prime or avoid claims and interests of which she or any of the debtor's creditors have actual knowledge, a bankruptcy trustee is, like any\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser, charged with constructive knowledge of any claim or interest that is imputed to any purchaser pursuant to applicable nonbankruptcy property law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under Alabama law, a power of attorney that does not specifically authorize the attorney-in-fact to transfer the principal's real property to herself does not grant the power to do so. Furthermore, applicable Alabama Supreme Court precedent holds that a deed purporting to make such a transfer to the attorney-in-fact is void, not merely voidable. Under these circumstances, no party could acquire good title to the real property from the attorney-in-fact and could not be a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, even a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser would not acquire superior title to real estate under such circumstances because she would be charged with constructive knowledge of the flawed recorded instruments-which in this case include both the deed itself as well as the POA. In fact, the deed alone, purporting to transfer real estate to the same person who is acting as the transferor's attorney-in-fact, would be sufficient to warn a purchaser of Alabama real estate to inquire further about any specific authorization for the attorney-in-fact to transfer the principal's real property to herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As explained more fully below, the Trustee can acquire neither good nor superior title to the Real Estate from the Debtor under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The question is whether the real property law of Alabama would permit an attorney-in-fact or agent to transfer the principal's real estate to herself on the strength of the POA, which includes the general power \"to sell, lease, convey, and to deliver possession and control of [the Defendant's] real property,\" but does not specifically authorize self-dealing. The Court reads\n   <em>\n    Lamb v. Scott\n   </em>\n   as an expression of Alabama's real property law that conclusively prohibits the transfer of Alabama real estate to a self-dealing agent under a power of attorney that does not include a specific grant of power allowing such self-dealing, regardless of whether the power of attorney itself was executed pursuant to another state's laws or whether that other state's real property law would have upheld a similar transfer in\n   that state.
