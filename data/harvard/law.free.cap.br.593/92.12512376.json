INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court are the Debtor's amended chapter 13 plan dated May 31, 2018 (Doc. No. 68) (the \"Chapter 13 Plan\") and a motion for relief from stay filed by U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Securities Corp., CSFB Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-8 (\"U.S. Bank\") (Doc. No. 30) (the \"Motion for Relief\"). Both the Chapter 13 Plan and the Motion for Relief raise the same legal issue: whether the Debtor has a sufficient property interest in real property, located at 2 Grace Drive, Nashua, New Hampshire (the \"Property\"), that she may cure defaults under a mortgage that encumbers the Property and which U.S. Bank holds. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the Debtor does have a sufficient interest in the Property and so will deny the Motion for Relief and schedule a continued confirmation hearing on the Chapter 13 Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(a) and Local Rule 77.4(a) of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. This is a core proceeding in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Practical and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts are straightforward and wholly undisputed. U.S. Bank is the holder of a mortgage, originally given by the Debtor and James E. Underwood to SLM Financial Corp. U.S. Bank, after notice, completed a foreclosure auction of the Property to a third-party buyer on January 11, 2017. To date, no deed has been recorded to evidence this transaction in the public record. The Debtor filed a chapter 13 petition on May 9, 2017 (the \"Prior Chapter 13 Case\"). The Court dismissed the Prior Chapter 13 Case on March 29, 2018, after the Debtor failed to make plan payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor filed the current chapter 13 case on April 26, 2018 (the \"Current Chapter 13 Case\"). At the time of the filing of the Current Chapter 13 Case, U.S. Bank had still yet to record the foreclosure deed. U.S. Bank promptly sought relief from the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), seeking relief to evict the Debtor from the Property, arguing that the Debtor had nothing more than a bare possessory interest in the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the Debtor filed the Chapter 13 Plan, which seeks to cure prepetition defaults in the mortgage to U.S. Bank and maintain payments during the Current Chapter 13 Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court held a joint hearing on the Chapter 13 Plan and the Motion for Relief on August 3, 2018. In addition to the Debtor (who is not represented by an attorney), counsel for U.S. Bank, the chapter 13 trustee, and Attorney Leonard Deming, who had been the Debtor's bankruptcy counsel in the Prior Chapter 13 Case and is apparently a creditor in the Current Chapter 13 Case (\"Creditor Deming\"), appeared at the hearing. Creditor Deming argued in opposition to the Motion for Relief and in favor of the confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court noted, with the agreement of the parties, that it would take judicial notice of the relevant filings in the Prior Chapter 13 Case to the extent that it found them helpful in coming to a decision in this matter. The Court afforded U.S. Bank an opportunity to respond to Creditor Deming's last-minute brief, which it did, and then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Arguments of the Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties' arguments are straightforward. The Debtor argues that because U.S. Bank has failed to complete the foreclosure sale by recording a deed, she may still cure defaults under the mortgage and maintain payments to U.S. Bank in the Chapter 13 Plan. U.S. Bank argues that because it concluded the auction of the Property prepetition, the Debtor was divested of all legal and equitable interest, and the Property did not become property of the bankruptcy estate, making it impossible to effect a cure of the mortgage in the Chapter 13 Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, Creditor Deming argues that, by virtue of \u00a7 544(a)(3), which he asserts places the chapter 13 trustee in the position of a bona fide purchaser for value, the chapter 13 trustee has an interest in the Property that is senior to any interest that the third-party purchaser at the foreclosure would obtain by U.S. Bank's recording of the foreclosure deed postpetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

RSA \u00a7 479:26, I. The statute further provides that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   If such recording is prevented by order or stay of any court or law or any provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the time for such recording shall be extended until 10 days after the expiration or removal of such order or stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5888483\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/505/589/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Upon recording, \"title to the premises shall pass to the purchaser free and clear of all interests and encumbrances which do not have priority over such mortgage.\" N.H. RSA \u00a7 479:26, III. If, however, the mortgagee fails to record the foreclosure deed and affidavit within 60 days of the foreclosure sale, the sale is rendered \"void and of no effect only as to liens or other encumbrances of record with the register of deeds for said county intervening between the day of the sale and the time of recording of said deed and affidavit.\" N.H.

The word \"sale\" is generally defined as the transferring of ownership and title regarding property to a buyer. Thus, the statutory language envisions a debtor's rights being terminated upon the completed transfer of title and ownership to a buyer through a foreclosure sale. Title and ownership generally pass through foreclosure upon the completion of a\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   , and not upon the occurrence of a single event such as a foreclosure auction.

The\n   <em>\n    LaPointe\n   </em>\n   panel's apparent misreading of\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   fogs the rest of its legal analysis, substantially diminishing the clarity and persuasive value of the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaPointe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5888483\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/505/589/\">\n    505 B.R. at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The first sentence of the analysis section of the opinion begins: \"As Judge Haines pointed out in\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   : '[T]he major fork in \u00a7 1322(c)(1) interpretation is the ambiguous/unambiguous determination.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    JPMorgan Chase Bank v.

It has effectively read the phrase \"foreclosure sale\" out of the statute and substituted it with \"foreclosure auction.\" This substitution necessarily narrows the scope of the sentence, as \"auction\" is a more specific term than \"sale.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11667231\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/235/519/#p526\">\n    235 B.R. at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Thus, the statutory language envisions a debtor's rights being terminated upon the completed transfer of title and ownership to a buyer through a foreclosure sale. Title and ownership generally pass through foreclosure upon the completion of a process, and not upon the occurrence of a single event such as a foreclosure auction.\"). The Court finds the meaning of \u00a7 1322(c)(1) clear without any paraphrasing or glossing of terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    LaPointe\n   </em>\n   also seems to err when it concludes that the \"sold at a foreclosure sale\" text of \u00a7 1322(c)(1) should be limited to when the \"foreclosure process is complete as to the mortgagor.\" This reading of the statute effectively adds a limitation into the text that does not exist. In terms of state law, this addition is significant. For example, under New Hampshire law, the sale process can be complete as to a mortgagor without being complete as to third parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cornell v. Envoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280639\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/551/696/#p698\">\n    551 B.R. at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As explained above, failure to record the foreclosure deed and affidavit within the safe harbor renders the sale 'void and of no effect only as to liens or other encumbrances of record ... between the day of the sale and the time of recording of said deed and affidavit.' N.H. RSA \u00a7 479:26, II.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 1322(c)(1) focuses on the sale of the debtor's residence, and not upon the debtor's rights in the residence. The operative moment when a debtor can no longer cure a default in a mortgage secured by the debtor's residence under \u00a7 1322(c)(1) is the sale of the debtor's residence itself-the trigger point being when \"such residence is sold\"-not just when the foreclosure sale process is complete only as to the mortgagor. If Congress had intended to set a trigger point sooner than the point at which the residence\n   is sold as to all parties in interest (including the holders of intervening liens or encumbrances), it could have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of the statute is most faithful to the plain meaning of the language. In\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , Judge Deasy read the entirety of \u00a7 1322(c)(1) as a whole, without adding or subtracting language, and considered the overall purpose of the section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dolan v. U.S. Postal Service\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991514\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/481/#p486\">\n    546 U.S. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991514\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/481/#p486\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991514\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/481/#p486\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (\"Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.\"). The Court finds\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   to be more persuasive and better supported than the rationale described in\n   <em>\n    LaPointe\n   </em>\n   . Thus, in the absence of a mandate or controlling legal authority, the Court will continue to follow\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having determined that\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   is the correct approach, the Court finds that the Debtor may still attempt to cure her mortgage with U.S. Bank, pursuant to \u00a7 1322(c)(1), because, as of the petition date of the Current Chapter 13 Case, U.S. Bank had not completed the foreclosure sale by recording the foreclosure deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the Court will briefly address the argument raised by Creditor Deming. Section 544(a)(3) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (a) The trustee shall have, as of the commencement of the case, and without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor, the rights and powers of, or may avoid any transfer of property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable by-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (3) a bona fide purchaser of real property, other than fixtures, from the debtor, against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected, that obtains the status of a bona fide purchaser and has perfected such transfer at the time of the commencement of the case, whether or not such a purchaser exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00a7 544(a)(3). Neither the Chapter 13 Plan nor the chapter 13 trustee currently advances any claims against either U.S. Bank or the third-party purchaser at the foreclosure auction. Accordingly, the Court finds no purpose in discussing hypothetical, unasserted avoidance rights of the chapter 13 trustee. It is unclear to the Court how such rights impact the issue at stake, i.e., whether the Debtor can cure the U.S. Bank mortgage. And, because the Court has already decided the legal question before it, it does not need to reach this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the Debtor may include a cure and maintain provision pursuant to \u00a7 1322(c)(1) as to U.S. Bank's mortgage in her Chapter 13 Plan. Because the Motion for Relief is premised solely on the argument that the Debtor has no cure rights, it must be denied. This opinion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052. The Court will issue separate orders consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    At the time of this dismissal, the Court had an essentially identical legal issue under advisement as the issue it addresses in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Hereinafter, \"\u00a7,\" \"section,\" and \"Bankruptcy Code\" will refer to title 11 of the United States Code, unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
