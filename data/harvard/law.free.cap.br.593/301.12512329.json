J.D. Abrams, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   an employee was privy to proprietary information and trade secrets regarding management policies, customer lists, pricing and bidding strategies, profit margins and cost projections. He purposefully disclosed them to a competitor who offered him a position in his company. A jury found Miller misappropriated proprietary information and misused trade secrets, awarding his former employer damages of $1 million. However, the jury declined to award punitive damages because they found that Miller did not act with malice. Miller filed for bankruptcy relief and his employer objected to the dischargeability of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The employer argued that since the misappropriation and disclosure was willful, the damages must be nondischargeable. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit disagreed. Rejecting the notion that \u00a7 523(a)(6) applied to all intentional torts, the Circuit Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   We hold that the label 'intentional tort' is too elusive to sort intentional acts that lead to injury from acts intended to cause injury. Rather, either objective substantial certainty or subjective motive meets the Supreme Court's definition of 'willful...injury' in \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Merely because a tort is classified as intentional does not mean that any injury caused by the tortfeasor is willful. This case illustrates the distinction, since misappropriation of proprietary information and misuse of trade secrets are wrongful regardless of whether injury is substantially certain to occur.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (Third) Unfair Competition \u00a7 40(b) cmt....Misuse of trade secrets is not precisely like stealing funds from a till, because the tortfeasor's gain is not inevitably a loss to the legal owner of the secret.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Referencing an earlier holding by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Delaney\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Circuit Court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[F]or willfulness and malice to prevent discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6), the debtor must have intended the actual injury that resulted\" and not just performed an intentional act that resulted in injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court also noted that malice may be implied, as \"[m]alice inferred by legal reasoning and necessary deduction from the res gestae or the conduct of the party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Synthzing its reasoning, the Circuit Court pronounced the standard was met when either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm existed. Both parts of this concept hinge on a determination that the injury was intended. The first prong assumes intent to cause injury when a third party can objectively conclude that harm would occur. For example, someone is pushed out of a window. It may be argued that the perpetrator did not intend to kill the victim; however, there is such a objective and substantial certainty of injury. His intent to injure can be implied. The second prong or subjective motive is when actual intent to cause injury is present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because the jury in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   concluded that he lacked an intent to cause injury, the Circuit held the judgment dischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    In re Williams,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided the Fifth Circuit with another opportunity to further explain its holding in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Williams was a non-Union electrical contractor who only employed non-union electricians. After being sued by the local Union, he entered into a collective bargaining agreement requiring him to 1) use the Union employees; 2) pay Union wages; and 3) contribute to the Union pension for all Union employees. Shortly after signing the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"), Williams hired non-Union employees and paid them a prevailing wage rather than the Union wage. The Union sued claiming breach of the CBA and obtained a judgment. Williams filed for bankruptcy relief, and\n   the Union sued again, this time for nondischargeability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Fifth Circuit found that Williams intentionally breached the CBA. However, it could not find any evidence that the damages awarded were intentionally inflicted. With regard to the Union's claim that non-Union electricians were employed and not paid the prevailing wage, the Court concluded that while Union members lost an opportunity to work and non-Union electricians were denied a higher wage, the Union itself did not suffer. The same was made regarding Williams' failure to contribute to a Union pension that non-Union employees could not join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the Union argued that its reputation and authority were damaged by Williams' breach. While the Court did not argue the point, it found nothing in the record to support a finding that Williams intended the reputation of the Union be damaged or that he would have recognized a substantial certainty that this might occur. Citing\n   <em>\n    Kawaauhau\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit Court rejected a standard that would make debts from intentional acts that cause unintentional or unanticipated injuries nondischargeable. Finding that exceptions to discharge should be \"confined to those plainly expressed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   illustrates that the debtor must intend the specific injury or be aware that chances of its occurrence are substantial. It does not matter that the injury occurs or that it was foreseeable. The perpetrator must intend for it to occur or be aware of that the likelihood of damage is substantially certain. The Legislative History of section 523(a)(6) establishes that Congress did not intend for injury caused by \"reckless disregard\" to be \"willful and malicious.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Under [ section 523(a)(6) ], 'willful' means deliberate or intentional.

(\"Rapid\"), threatened Capstone and Rapid with disclosure of regulatory and criminal violations if they did not pay him for an alleged ownership interest. An arbitrator held that Shcolnik had no ownership interest and awarded $50,000 in attorneys' fees to Capstone and Rapid. The state court confirmed the award. Shcolnick filed a Voluntary\n   Petition for Relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Rapid and Capstone filed a Complaint objecting to the dischargeability of the attorney fee award.

Thus, Dehler was prohibited by La. Admin. Code 46:XLV.5361 (2006) from accepting her as a client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   While Dehler referred Mouton to Dr. Lapreyrolerie, Dehler did not consult with Dr. Lapeyrolerie regarding her risk assessment and did not obtain Mouton's test results as required by La. Admin. Code 46:XLV.5311 and 5361 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   During labor, Dehler was required by La. Admin. Code 46:XLV.5363 (2006) to seek medical consultation when the baby's heart rate could not be found and when Mouton's labor failed to progress after two hours. She did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Moutons do not contend that Dehler subjectively intended to cause their child's death. Instead, they contend that the debt is nondischargeable because Dehler's actions were objectively substantively certain to result in their child's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Mid-wifery continues as an occupation based on the belief that labor and delivery are a normal human activity. As such, the body will perform normally without outside intervention or medical attention. Dehler subscribes to this understanding and avoids direct intervention in a birth at almost all costs. She testified that unless there are observable symptoms of crisis or distress, she would not intervene. Instead of using typical medical means to determine the progression of labor, Dehler observes the mother's behavior, intensity of contractions, and the urge to push.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   There is no question that Dehler violated several provisions of the La. Administrative Code (\"Code\"). Her failure to obtain an ob-gyn's assessment of risk; have an ob-gyn on call for assistance during delivery; and failure to contact an ob-gyn when labor progressed beyond 24 hours and she could not hear a fetal heart rate all breached her duties under the Code. Her transgressions resulted in the revocation of her license. However, the question is not whether Dehler committed malpractice or even gross negligence but whether her actions or inactions were substantially certain to cause injury to the baby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In order to establish the substantial certainty of injury standard, the Moutons offered the testimony of Dr. Marshall St. Amant as an expert in maternal fetal medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, labor, and delivery. Dr. St. Amant testified that the medical standard for a \"high risk\" pregnancy is when the mother is age 35 years or older,\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   although in his opinion women ages 39 to 40 are definitely high risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   He also opined that labor lasting \"between 20 and 24 hours\" is \"prolonged labor\" as ninety percent of labors conclude\n   before twenty hours.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   The longer after 24 hours that labor continues \"... should be a red flag that something wrong is going on\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a dramatic increase to risk of fetal harm exists when labor lasts 53 hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an effort to explain the reason for the increased risk, Dr. St. Amant explained that oxygen to the fetus is reduced during prolonged labor. Contractions cause placental deterioration, which in turn causes less oxygen to reach the fetus. Lower oxygen levels for prolonged periods lead to complications and injury, even death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Mouton baby died of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or decreased oxygen resulting in severe brain damage. The prolonged oxygen deprivation occurred due to the length of labor. This diagnosis was supported by the presence of dark amniotic fluid at the time of her birth, a sign of oxygen deprivation and break down of placenta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Dr. St. Amant's expert opinion, Mouton should have been transported to a hospital after 24 hours of labor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had that been done, he believes that the baby had a 50% chance of survival.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Dr. St. Amant testified that in his mind, substantial certainty means greater than 50%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that Dehler's actions and inactions were substantially certain to result in the baby's death or serious injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, he stopped short of guarantying that a baby born after 53 hours of labor would die.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   A. ... [T]he longer you go the increased morbidity, the more morbidity you have the more likely it's going to add up to something that can take your life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q. Is [ ] prolonged labor [ ] more likely than not by your definition, or [ ] substantial by your definition [ ] likely to lead to injuries that you were just discussing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   A. Yes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   It is clear that Dr. St. Amant believes no labor should extend beyond 24 to 27 hours if at all possible. In his opinion, the risk of fetal morbidity or mortality increased with every quarter hour beyond that time. While the damage to the baby was \"substantially certain\" in Dr. St. Amant's opinion, the test is whether a midwife, specifically Dehler, would assume this to be the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Over the course of Dehler's career, she participated in over 100 births, several with prolonged labors or involving women aged 40 or older. She has experienced the loss of three babies. In two of the births, the mothers were under 40 and labors were not prolonged. Only in the Mouton case did these factors exist. Thus, Dehler's personal experience would not have led her to assume or expect that prolonged labor or age of the mother might contribute to the demise of a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Dehler was a fervent believer in midwifery and the body's natural ability to deliver a healthy child without outside intervention. She harbored a distrust of the\n   medical community and in particular hospital births. When asked if she had ever insisted on transporting a patient to a hospital or contacted a physician for help during a delivery, she replied that three times she transported to the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   She reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   [M]y real philosophy is I believe God is the giver and creator of life and that he sustains life and that he gives us medical knowledge and personnel to help in emergency situations. I 100 percent embrace the medical community as far as intervention when it's needed, c-sections when they're needed.... [I]t was a balance because in Louisiana there was a over 50 percent c-section rate and so you're trying to avoid those c-sections for the health of the mother and the child ...\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Based on the Court's observation of Dehler, her demeanor on the stand and testimony it was evident that she does not believe the medical community adds any benefit over what she can provide a patient. Her personal experience confirmed this belief. In 99 births, two deaths occurred under circumstances dissimilar to the ones involving the Mouton birth and in each case she was cleared of any wrongdoing after inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In fact, Dr. St. Amant provided statistics for at home and hospital births. In the case of at home deliveries, approximately 3.8 deaths occur out of 1000 births.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hospital deliveries cut that fatality rate to 1.9,\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   a rather small reduction unless you are the mother of the child that dies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   For these reasons, the Code allows home deliveries in only low to normal risk patients, requires a physician be on stand by during delivery, and a midwife consult with a physician if labor stalls after one or two hours. Each of these requirements are designed to identify the three in 1000 patients at risk of delivering a stillborn child. More to the point, they also guard against the development of severe injury or condition in either mother or child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court cannot conclude that Dehler either intended the Mouton baby to suffer severe harm or die. Nor can it conclude that the death of the Mouton baby's was an objective certainty since Dr. St. Amant and Dehler experienced healthy births even when labor was prolonged for many hours beyond 24. Dehler's history of success with prolonged labor made her confident that the outcome would be positive, a belief the Court finds has support in the record. So while the Court finds Dehler was exceptionally negligent in practice and probably reckless in her adherence to the parents' wishes, it does not find that she was willful or malicious. \"[S]ympathy and sense of fair play, however, do not a solid evidentiary foundation make as to subjective intent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the reasons assigned above, the Court finds in favor of Dehler and against the Moutons.
