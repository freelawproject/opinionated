At the heart of this Adversary Proceeding is a residence located at No. 3, 3000 Andrews Drive, Atlanta, Georgia (the \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   \"). At the beginning of 2011, the Property was jointly owned by William B. Johnson, Jr. (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \") and his spouse, Sandra Thome Johnson (\"\n   <em>\n    Sandra Johnson\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor then executed a\n   <em>\n    Limited\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warranty Deed\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Deed\n   </em>\n   \"), dated April 7, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Deed was recorded on April 11, 2011 in the real property records of the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia (the \"\n   <em>\n    Superior Court\n   </em>\n   \"). Through the Deed, the Debtor sought to convey his undivided one-half interest in the Property to Sandra Johnson (the \"\n   <em>\n    Transfer\n   </em>\n   \"). The Transfer was made for \"love and affection,\" the Debtor received no monetary consideration for the Transfer, and no transfer tax was paid on the Transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Subsequent to the Transfer, Synovus obtained a judgment against the Debtor and others on a defaulted commercial loan and recorded its judgment lien through the filing with the Superior Court of a\n   <em>\n    Writ of Fieri Facias\n   </em>\n   on December 1, 2011 (amended on February 6, 2012), in the amount of $6,008,349.22 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Synovus Lien\n   </em>\n   \"). Stephens obtained an Amended Final Judgment against the Debtor and others following entry of a consent order and recorded a judgment lien by filing a\n   <em>\n    Writ of Fieri Facias\n   </em>\n   with the Superior Court on February 21, 2012 in the amount of $4,600,000.00 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Stephens Lien\n   </em>\n   \"). Finally, on January 9, 2012, the IRS assessed a federal income tax liability against the Debtor and Sandra Johnson for the tax year 2010 in the amount of $5,099,897.04 and recorded its\n   <em>\n    Notice of Federal Tax Lien\n   </em>\n   on October 2, 2012 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Tax Lien\n   </em>\n   \")(all of the foregoing liens referred to collectively hereafter as the \"\n   <em>\n    Liens\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 1, 2014, Stephens filed an action in the Superior Court under the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act ( O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 18-2-70\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) to avoid the Transfer, styled\n   <em>\n    J.

The Superior Court Action was still pending on the Petition Date, but was stayed by the filing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Trustee was subsequently duly appointed as interim Chapter 7 Trustee (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Case, filed January 20, 2016 (Main Case Docket No. 6) ), and then became the permanent Chapter 7 Trustee in this case at the conclusion of the Section 341 meeting of creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Docket Entry of February 22, 2016;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Trustee subsequently moved to sell the Property to third party buyers.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Main Case Docket Nos. 25, 26, 32, 34, and 43. Sandra Johnson consented to the sale of her interest in the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Docket Nos. 36, 38, and 45. No party objected to the sale. Main Case Docket,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   . The Court entered an Order authorizing the sale. Main Case Docket No. 46. Subsequently, the Trustee sold the Property. Main Case Docket No. 51. Because there was no dispute that at all times Sandra Johnson owned at least a one-half (1/2) interest in the Property, the Court directed the Trustee to disburse one-half of the sale proceeds to counsel for Sandra Johnson, less certain costs of sale and taxes. Docket Nos. 41, 50, and 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After the sale of the Property and the disbursement to Sandra Johnson of the proceeds of her undisputed interest in the Property, the Trustee continues to hold $550,343.67 in proceeds (the \"\n   <em>\n    Net Sale Proceeds\n   </em>\n   \") from the sale of the Property. These are the net proceeds of sale of the one-half (\u00bd) interest in the Property owned by the Debtor at the beginning of 2011. Along with the Trustee, the IRS, Synovus, and Stephens each claim an interest in the Net Sale Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Arguments of the Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Trustee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the Trustee contends that each of the Liens is subject to avoidance as a preferential transfer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the avoided transfers\n   should be preserved for the benefit of this bankruptcy estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee argues that, under applicable state law, following the Transfer the Debtor had no interest in the Property, and that Sandra Johnson became the sole owner of the Property. Entry of the Superior Court Judgment subsequently resulted in two (2) distinct transfers; (1) a transfer of an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in the Property back to the Debtor, and (2) the attachment, fixing, and/or perfection of the Liens on the Debtor's reacquired interest in the Property. The Trustee maintains that this attachment of the Liens occurred within ninety (90) days of the Petition Date, while the Debtor was insolvent, and enabled the Creditors to receive more on their existing claims than they would have otherwise received. On this basis, the Trustee contends that the Liens are subject to avoidance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Trustee contests any assertion that the Liens should be deemed effective based on their original filing date, arguing that these contentions mistakenly rely on the perceived effect of the Superior Court voiding the Transfer\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   . The Trustee insists that, under Section 547(e)(3), a transfer \"is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnhill v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229968\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/393/#p397\">\n    503 U.S. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229968,6508951\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/1386/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229968\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/393/#p397\">\n    118 L.Ed.2d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the Trustee asserts that, having made the Transfer, the Debtor did not acquire an interest in the Property until the entry of the Superior Court Judgment on November 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, in the alternative, the Trustee seeks a declaration that if the other Liens are not avoided, the Tax Lien is senior to the other Liens, subject to surcharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and subordination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20724\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), because the other\n   Liens were \"inchoate\" prior to entry of the Superior Court Judgment and thus are junior to the IRS Lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IRS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The IRS filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking summary judgment on the issue of whether the Transfer resulted in a preference to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRS argues that, unlike the other Creditors, its Tax Lien was filed against both the Debtor and Sandra Johnson. Thus, irrespective of the legal effect of the Transfer, the Tax Lien arose upon the assessment of the 2010 tax liability and attached to all property of these joint taxpayers (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206321\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Because the IRS could enforce its Tax Lien against the entirety of the Property in collecting the tax debt regardless of the Superior Court Judgment, the voiding of the Transfer did not in any way affect its lien rights or improve its relative position as to the Net Sale Proceeds. Thus, the IRS maintains that the voiding of the Transfer did not enable it to receive more than it would have otherwise received had the disputed conveyance in the Deed not been avoided, and so the fixing of the Tax Lien is not voidable as a preference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Synovus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Synovus argues that, because the Superior Court expressly ruled the Transfer was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , no transfer in fact occurred. Hence, the Debtor never effectively conveyed his interest in the Property, and so he did not reacquire such interest. Synovus insists that the Debtor was in full possession of his interest when Synovus\n   recorded its lien, which was long before any other lien was filed. Based on this reasoning, Synovus asserts that it holds a valid, perfected, and first priority lien superior to all competing claims in accordance with O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-323. The Synovus Lien attached to the Debtor's interest in the Property when it was originally filed four (4) years before the Petition Date, and entry of the Superior Court Judgment does not support its avoidance as a preferential transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Anticipating Stephens' contention that only he may rely on the Superior Court Judgment voiding the Transfer, Synovus counters that this argument ignores the fact that the Superior Court declared the transfer void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Georgia's U.F.T.A. provides that \"[a] transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor\" where the intent to defraud or other circumstances are proved (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-74(a) ), a court may declare a transfer absolutely void as to the world.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-77(a)(3)(C) (creditor may obtain \"[a]ny other relief the circumstances may require\"). As Synovus points out, even if a fraudulent transfer may be voided only for the benefit the creditor who presents a successful claim, thereby leaving the transfer intact in regard to other creditors, here the Superior Court did not void the Transfer to Stephens alone or declare the Transfer merely voidable. Instead, the Superior Court, aware of the various claims asserted against the Property, declared the Transfer null and void, thereby rendering it void as to the whole world for the benefit of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   creditors of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, Synovus states that under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-5-88 (\"Gifts void against creditors and bona fide purchasers\"), expressly cited in the Superior Court Judgment as an additional basis for relief, \"[a]n insolvent person may not make a valid gift to the injury of his existing creditors.\" As an illegal gift made while the Debtor was insolvent in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-5-88, the Transfer was not merely voidable, but instead is now and always has been null and void and without any legal effect as to all the Debtor's creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons as well as other reasons,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Synovus asserts that it is entitled to receive the Net\n   Sale Proceeds based on its relative status as the highest-priority secured creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Stephens\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Stephens urges that his claim to the Net Sale Proceeds is not voidable as a preference because it neither depends on nor derives from the Stephens Lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, it arises from his successful prosecution of the Superior Court Action and his right under the U.F.T.A. as a creditor to satisfy the debt owed to him by the Debtor against the Property by invalidating its conveyance. He claims that it is this status that entitles his claim to priority over the senior Synovus Lien. In other words, Stephens maintains that his claim is based on the Superior Court Judgment and its declaration regarding the Transfer, which the Trustee acknowledges did not operate as a \"conveyance\" by the Debtor (but an acquisition of an interest in the Property). Therefore, Stephens maintains that his claim cannot be preferential, and further that the Trustee is not entitled to a surcharge against him since Stephens' claim is not reliant upon a secured claim against property of this estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With regard to Synovus, Stephens further notes that, due to the Transfer, no subsequently filed judgment or tax lien attached to an interest of the Debtor in the Property. Moreover, under Georgia law, a fraudulent transferor of property acquires no interest in the property recovered by\n   virtue of the avoidance of its transfer adjudged as fraudulent. Citing the Official Comments to the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act as adopted in Georgia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stephens contends that the remedy set forth in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-77(a)(1) provides that not only is the property not restored to the debtor, but the avoidance only inures to the benefit of the acting creditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated differently, the U.F.T.A. is not designed to invalidate transfers generally, but to provide a cause of action for a particular petitioning creditor to have a transfer set aside as a form of relief. This remedy is provided whether or not the petitioning creditor holds a judgment against the debtor or even enjoys any lien rights in the subject property. In sum, Stephens contends that Synovus never attained a lien on any interest of the Debtor in the Property, and has no claim to the Net Sale Proceeds since it did not bring a timely claim under the U.F.T.A. within the four (4) year period required under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-79.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-74(a)(1) &amp; (2) ; O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-75(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Summary judgment may be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, applicable herein through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Because the Superior Court Judgment was entered within the ninety (90) day preference period, the Trustee asserts that the Liens are avoidable. The IRS contends that the Superior Court Judgment is not determinative as to its claim because the Tax Lien attached to the Property whether owned jointly by the Debtor and Sandra Johnson or solely by Sandra Johnson, and thus its rights are not affected by the Superior Court Judgment. Synovus insists that, by the express terms of the final Superior Court Judgment, there was no transfer, and its senior Lien takes priority as being filed first-in-time. Lastly, Stephens argues that, based on the Superior Court Judgment, the Debtor had no ownership interest in the Property on the Petition Date, and the one-half (1/2) interest conveyed by the Debtor to Sandra Johnson in 2011 was avoided for his benefit alone under Georgia law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, as to the claims of the IRS, a federal tax lien arises by operation of law under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206321\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and \u00a7 6322 upon the assessment of the tax and attaches to all property and rights to property that belong to the taxpayer.

The Notice of Federal Tax Lien, however, was not filed until October 2, 2012, which was after the Liens of the other Creditors were filed, and so it is subordinate to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Craft-Latimer,supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205042108\">\n    2015 WL 5042108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the distinction between a \"void\" and a \"voidable\" transfer may have been significant in characterizing the effect of the Transfer under a fraudulent conveyance analysis at some point, it is no longer relevant here. In this case, the Superior Court, a state superior court with competent jurisdiction has, supported by the two distinct provisions of Georgia law it cited, determined that the Transfer \"is NULL AND VOID and was NULL AND VOID\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 18-2-70\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-5-88.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit \"K,\" Documentary Appendix. Based on the Superior Court Judgment, the Property remained an asset of the Debtor subject to the rights of his creditors. In the case of a void transfer, Georgia law provides that the judgment liens obtained by existing creditors may attach to such property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although some of the authority for this proposition cites to prior codifications of Georgia fraudulent transfer law, no basis has been offered or found to discount their value in construing the applicable law cited in the Superior Court Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, more recently, another judge of this Court held that a creditor holding a claim against a debtor at the time of a fraudulent conveyance who thereafter reduces that claim to judgment and files its judgment lien (a \"pre-transfer creditor\") may seek to set aside the conveyance under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-74 and recover such property on grounds of either actual or constructive fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kipperman v.

Under this provision, a putative transfer may be declared and treated void as an invalid gift made \"to the injury of [a debtor's] existing creditors\" by an insolvent debtor and set aside for the benefit of creditors.

As Stephens admits\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stephens' Brief in Support, p. 11 (Docket No. 89) ), by virtue of the agreed sale of the Property\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Sandra Johnson's abandonment of any claim to the Net Sale Proceeds, the Superior Court Judgment has become final.

Georgia law recognizes such liens as a remedy for holders of a beneficial interest wrongfully transferred to another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"991503\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/213/202/#p204\">\n    213 B.R. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (Bankr.

Even if Stephens held such a lien as of the date when he filed the Superior Court Action, however, such date was subsequent to the date of recordation of the Synovus Lien. Stephens has provided no authority for creating an exception to Georgia rules for determining priorities among liens on real property ( O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-323 ; \u00a7 9-12-87), or allowing his equitable lien priority over an earlier filed lien under a diligent creditor analysis.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamchick, Glucksman &amp; Johnston, P.A.,supra\n   </em>\n   , 659 So.2d at 1119 (applying Florida law). Although Stephens was the diligent creditor who initiated the action that resulted in the avoidance of the Transfer as a defined remedy, the Court finds no legal basis to displace the existing priorities of valid judgment liens just because he did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Recognizing the existing rights and relative priorities of the judgment lien creditors of the Debtor, the Superior Court decided under Georgia law that the Transfer is void as a fraudulent conveyance and as an illegal gift. Although such judicial declaration is essential, and an additional act by a creditor needed to complete enforcement, affirmation that the Transfer is void did not enable Synovus to improve its position such that it would receive more than it otherwise would have.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Synovus obtained its lien interest when it recorded its Lien (and thus outside of the preference period), so that it is not subject to avoidance as a preference by the Trustee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the\n   Synovus Lien was filed of record prior to the other Lien claimants herein, Synovus has priority as to the Net Sale Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This conclusion does not, however, entirely resolve the matter. There remain the claims by Stephens and the Trustee for recovery of their expenses incurred in certain parts of this enforcement odyssey. First, Stephens contends that he is entitled to a recovery based on the Georgia \"common-fund\" doctrine, which allows for the payment of attorney's fees when litigation pursued by one party produces benefits in which others may share who were not a party to that proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This doctrine of taxing certain costs in equitable actions against beneficiaries to a successful lawsuit who did not otherwise contribute to its cost, is a well-recognized exception to the rule that litigants bear their own attorney's fees. It protects a party who labors to create the common fund and prevents unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here, Stephens stresses that it was his efforts and those of his counsel in the Superior Court Action that produced what is now the Net Sale Proceeds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his right to recover from this \"common fund\" as created by state law prior to the Petition Date should be respected. Stephens seeks between fifteen (15%) and thirty (30%) percent of the Net Sale Proceeds. Synovus disputes Stephens' entitlement to payment of his attorney's fees or other costs out of its claim to the Net Sale Proceeds based on the \"common-fund\" doctrine. Synovus insists that such a recovery from a bankruptcy estate is unfounded based on a judgment lien, and because this doctrine is inconsistent with the scheme of distribution provided under federal bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Chewning &amp; Frey Sec., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938194\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/328/899/#p918\">\n    328 B.R. 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (Bankr.

S.D. Tex. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The concern expressed in\n   <em>\n    Chewning,supra\n   </em>\n   , however, does not appear to be implicated in this case. Although Stephens is, in effect, seeking a priority claim, this situation is different from the one presented in\n   <em>\n    Chewning,supra\n   </em>\n   , for several reasons. Unlike special counsel in that case, Stephens did not bring the Superior Court Action on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, and was not employed by the Debtor as in\n   <em>\n    Patton,supra\n   </em>\n   . Further, unlike special counsel in\n   <em>\n    Chewning\n   </em>\n   , Stephens did not intentionally assume the risk that any potential recovery would be insufficient to satisfy his claim or legal fees based on an administratively\n   insolvent bankruptcy estate. Stephens' rights in relation to the recovery awarded in the Superior Court Judgment were fixed as of the Petition Date. That distinguishes this case from the others, where professionals volunteered post-petition to perform legal services on behalf of an estate. Here, Stephens' attorney obtained an order setting aside the Transfer before the Debtor filed this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on the present record, Stephens' rights under state law to a recovery of expenses in the context of a meritorious prepetition fraudulent conveyance action should not be disregarded. Avoidance of a fraudulent conveyance is a creditor's remedy sought in equity. It was the initiative and action of Stephens that brought the Property, and hence the Net Sale Proceeds, into court and permitted the Creditors to contend over it and Synovus to benefit from it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on application of the common-fund doctrine, and to avoid the prospect of unjust enrichment, Synovus should bear the reasonable and necessary legal fees and expenses incurred by Stephens that enabled Synovus' ultimate recovery. Stephens will be entitled to recover his fees and expenses incurred in obtaining the Superior Court Judgment, to the extent that they are reasonable in light of the circumstances, including the services provided and the amount at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, the Trustee claims entitlement to a surcharge against the Net Sale Proceeds as compensation for the \"reasonable, necessary costs and expenses of preserving, or disposing, of [the Property] to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such claim,\" which in this case is Synovus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The parties herein all agreed to the sale of the Property conducted by the Trustee that generated the Net Sale Proceeds, and it is undisputed that his efforts regarding same benefitted Synovus on its secured claim. These efforts are detailed in the\n   <em>\n    Report of Sale\n   </em>\n   filed by the Trustee on June 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Docket No. 51;\n   <em>\n    see also Order\n   </em>\n   entered on June 16, 2016 (Main Case Docket No. 46)(granting\n   <em>\n    Trustee's Motion For Authority To (A) Sell Real Property of the Estate Free and Clear of Liens, Claims, Interests, and Encumbrances and (B) Disburse Proceeds at Closing\n   </em>\n   (Main Case Docket No. 32) ); and\n   <em>\n    Order Approving Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   entered on June 16, 2016 (Main Case Docket No. 45)(granting\n   <em>\n    Motion for Approval of Agreement Between Trustee and Sandra Thome Johnson\n   </em>\n   (Main Case Docket No. 36) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court agrees that the Trustee may recover an appropriate portion\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   of such fees and costs as an administrative expense, recoverable from the Net Sale Proceeds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The Court also agrees that the Trustee may recover the fees and expenses incurred in filing the Complaint. The distribution of the Net Sale Proceeds would have ultimately required judicial decision or consensual agreement, and the Trustee's efforts in initiating this process conferred a benefit on the secured claimants to that extent. The Trustee is not, however, entitled to all of his fees and expenses incurred in conducting this litigation. A substantial discount may be required for fees\n   and expenses related to his argument for one distribution scheme over another, since the Trustee could have simply interpled the Net Sale Proceeds rather than taking a position on their distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Synovus is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that it holds a valid, perfected, first-in-priority judgment lien that attaches to the Net Sale Proceeds, subject to the rights of Stephens and the Trustee to recover certain fees and expenses incurred by them that benefitted Synovus as described above. No voidable preference arises from the entry of the Superior Court Judgment, since once the Transfer was declared void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   the Transfer is treated as if it did not occur. Synovus is not entitled to immediate distribution of the Net Sale Proceeds because allowance must be made for certain fees and expenses incurred by Stephens and the Trustee in making the Net Sale Proceeds available. Once the amount of the recoverable fees and expenses has been determined, the Net Sale Proceeds will be distributed by the Trustee to Synovus, less the fees and expenses allowed to Stephens and to the Trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   All other claims as asserted by the parties herein against the Net Sale Proceeds are dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the foregoing discussion, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Synovus Bank's Renewed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   as provided herein; and, it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   except as provided herein; and, it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the United States' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   to the extent that its interest in the Net Sale Proceeds is not avoided as a preference; and, it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant J.

Such lien does not grant the creditor the right to proceed against the subject property unless and until the lien is perfected by the entry and recording of a judgment. In response to the Trustee's assertion that the Liens were inchoate when the IRS filed its Tax Lien, Synovus contends that in recording its judgment lien, it identified the Debtor (and itself as lienor), the property subject to the Lien, and the amount of the Lien such that nothing further was required for its perfection.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Because the Debtor retained his interest in the Property under state law (as set forth below), the Debtor owned rights to the property when the Synovus Lien and the Stephens Lien were recorded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n      14\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The IRS did not assert a counterclaim with its answer to the Complaint. In its motion, the IRS seeks that summary judgment be granted to it as to Counts I and II of the Complaint because the Tax Lien is not subject to avoidance as a preferential transfer. It does not seek summary judgment on the issue of its priority\n    <em>\n     vis a vis\n    </em>\n    the other Liens or Creditors. The IRS filed a Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue To Be Tried (Docket No. 88). In their responses, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Docket Nos. 95, 100, and 101), the other parties hereto generally agree there is no dispute of material fact. Synovus does object to any characterization of the Superior Court Judgment's legal effect as recognizing that a transfer, in fact, occurred. The IRS has not responded to the other summary judgment motions. Under Local Rule BLR 7007-1(c), a failure to respond indicates that the motion is unopposed. It is not disputed that the IRS filed its Notice of Federal Tax Lien on October 2, 2012, which post-dates both the Transfer and the filing of the Liens. Further, the IRS filed a Proof of Claim asserting only an unsecured claim in the amount of $4,544,390.40.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Claim No. 1, filed April 4, 2016.

Because property rights in bankruptcy cases are generally determined by state law, Synovus contends that this Court is bound by the holding in the Superior Court Judgment that the Transfer was void from its inception, and not merely voidable. Further, although federal law governs the priority of federal tax liens (\n    <em>\n     In re McTyre Grading &amp; Pipe, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6461081\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/193/983/#p986\">\n     193 B.R. 983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 986 (Bankr.

As noted above (note 13,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ), the Court accepts Synovus' argument disputing the Trustee's assertion that the Synovus Lien was inchoate when the IRS filed its Tax Lien.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fr16\" name=\"fr16\">\n      16\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    According to Stephens, because the Debtor conveyed away his interest in the Property before any liens attached, no other creditor holds a valid lien against such an interest of the Debtor, and Stephens' claim takes priority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fr17\" name=\"fr17\">\n      17\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    This statute provides that -\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    (a) An insolvent person may not make a valid gift to the injury of his existing creditors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-5-88(a). Synovus contests the attempt by the Trustee or Stephens to collapse this independent provision for relief into the remedial scheme set forth under the U.F.T.A. Because an illegal gift is void, a creditor with a judgment does not need to use the remedies of the U.F.T.A. including any requirement that it first obtain an attachment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-77(a)(2) ;\n    <em>\n     but see\n    </em>\n    O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-77(b).

Finally, because there was no transfer, Synovus argues the Trustee's argument that, hypothetically, the Trustee could have sued under the U.F.T.A. and used the statute of limitations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is not relevant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fr19\" name=\"fr19\">\n      19\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Stephens urges that the Superior Court Judgment did not act to re-convey a property interest to the Debtor based on an avoidance of the Transfer under the U.F.T.A. According to Stephens, it is his status as a creditor that is determinative in his U.F.T.A. action, not his rights as a judgment lien holder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fr20\" name=\"fr20\">\n      20\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Stephens adds that the Trustee has no stake in the ultimate distribution of the Net Sale Proceeds because there are no unsecured creditors of this estate. With respect to the IRS, Stephens avers in his uncontested Statement of Material Facts that the income taxes covered by the Tax Lien were for tax year 2010 and were not yet due and payable when the Deed was recorded. Docket No. 89, para. 7. Stephens further points out that the IRS did not file a timely response to the original complaint herein and is in default. In addition, as mentioned above, the Proof of Claim filed by the IRS (Claim No. 1) was filed as a general unsecured claim, which operates as an estoppel regarding its assertion of a secured interest in the Net Sale Proceeds. Finally, Stephens states that the IRS is not a good faith transferee for value under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-78(b) since the Tax Lien was involuntary. Thus, the argument that the Tax Lien attached to the Property when title was in the name of Sandra Johnson does not protect the Tax Lien against Stephens' right to recovery. To date, the IRS has not responded to Stephens' Motion or any of his statements of fact or legal arguments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Local Rule BLR 7056-1(a)(2)(facts not controverted deemed admitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fr21\" name=\"fr21\">\n      21\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The cited portion of these Comments state as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n    \"Avoidance\" is a term of art in this Act, for it does not mean that the transfer or obligation is simply rendered void. It has long been established that a transfer avoided by a creditor under this Act or its predecessors is nevertheless valid as between the debtor and the transferee. For example, in the case of a transfer of property worth $100 by Debtor to Transferee, held voidable in a suit by Creditor-1 who is owed $80 by Debtor, \"avoidance\" of the transfer leaves the $20 surplus with Transferee. Debtor is not entitled to recover the surplus. Nor is Debtor's Creditor-2 entitled to pursue the surplus by reason of Creditor-1's action (though Creditor-2 may be entitled to bring its own avoidance action to pursue the surplus). The foregoing principle is embedded in the language of subsection (a)(1), which prescribes \"avoidance\" only \"to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim.\" Section 9(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was similarly limited.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Official Comments, Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (as amended in 2014), Section 7, Remedies of Creditor, \u00b6 7, p. 38 (citations omitted)(available at http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/Fraudulent% 20Transfer/2014_AUVTA_Final% 20Act_Amended_2016mar8.pdf).

In addition, the proof of claim filed by the IRS (Claim No. 1) was filed as a general unsecured claim and operates as an estoppel to any assertion of a secured interest in the Net Sale Proceeds. Finally, it appears that the IRS is not a good faith transferee for value under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-78(b) since the Tax Lien is an involuntary lien. In view of all of the foregoing and the above, although the motion of the IRS is meritorious to the extent that the Tax Lien is not avoidable as a preference, it does not result in the IRS taking priority over Synovus or Stephens.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fr29\" name=\"fr29\">\n      29\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    As noted above, the Trustee alternatively argues that any interest re-conveyed to the Debtor was subject to the Tax Lien that attached to the entire interest in the Property when it was titled in the name of Sandra Johnson.

Acknowledging there is no direct Georgia case authority on point, Stephens adds, however, that the Transfer was voidable only insofar as a remedy was created in favor of Stephens' based on the meritorious assertion of his right to recovery in bringing the avoidance suit. Comment 7, as cited by both the Trustee and Stephens in their briefs, states that \"[i]t has long been established that a transfer\n    <em>\n     avoided\n    </em>\n    by a creditor under this Act or its predecessors\n    <em>\n     is nevertheless valid as between the debtor and the transferee\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis supplied)(\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    note 21,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ). This statement follows its description of \"avoidance\" as not being the same as \"simply rendered void\" and tends to support Stephens' reading of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-77(a)(1) that the beneficiaries of an avoidance are limited. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    note 22,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ). However, this argument about what might happen under the U.F.T.A.
