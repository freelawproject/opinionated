(the \"Debtor\") filed this Chapter 11 single asset real estate case on February 3, 2017. (Dckt. 1). The Debtor, a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Georgia, owns and operates a 96-unit apartment complex in Beaufort County, South Carolina, known as August on Southside (the \"Property\"). The Debtor's principal creditor is FCRE REL, LLC (\"FCRE\"), which holds a first priority lien in the Property. FCRE has been an active creditor, both before and after the filing of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is FCRE's Motion Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) to Convert this Case to a Case under Chapter 7 and for the Appointment of a Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Motion to Convert\"), which was filed on June 13, 2017. (Dckt. 161). In the Motion to Convert, FCRE only requested conversion to Chapter 7, not dismissal of the case. However, in its second supplemental brief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed on February 2, 2018, FCRE appeared to request, in the alternative, dismissal of the case. (Dckt. 358). At a hearing on April 16, 2018, FCRE clarified through counsel that it only seeks conversion, not dismissal. (Transcript,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   p. 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its Motion to Convert (dckt. 161) and supplemental briefs (dckt. 333, 358, 388, 418, 475), FCRE essentially makes two arguments concerning the Debtor's eligibility to proceed with reorganization under Chapter 11 based on its limited partnership status under Georgia law. First, FCRE contends that the entity that filed the petition, ABGP, Inc., ostensibly the Debtor's general partner as of 2010, lacked authority to do so because it was never properly admitted as a general partner. Second, FCRE contends that the Debtor cannot be a debtor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) because the limited partnership was dissolved, or at least rendered moribund, by the administrative dissolution in 2005 of its erstwhile general partner, also called ABGP, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although this case has been proceeding toward confirmation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court must not further delay a resolution of these fundamental questions. Accordingly, at a status conference held on February 21, 2018, the Court advised counsel that an evidentiary hearing would be scheduled as to the narrow issues surrounding the organization of the Debtor and whether certain alleged defects in its general partner's status would prevent this case from moving forward. The Court directed the parties to stipulate to as many facts (and there are dozens, if not hundreds, bearing on these issues) as possible, and to stipulate to the admissibility of as many documents (and there are dozens of these, as well) as possible, so that any evidence that may be needed to supplement an otherwise replete record could be received with a minimum of time. (Dckt. 370, p. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter was scheduled for hearing on April 16, 2018. (Dckt. 375). The parties failed to accommodate the Court's request regarding factual stipulations and instead submitted separate \"stipulations.\" (Dckt. 385, 390). Prior to the hearing, however, the parties did stipulate to the admissibility of numerous documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Transcript, pp. 17, 28-30). At the hearing, the Court heard testimony from L. Christopher Kettles (\"Mr. Kettles\"), the authorized representative of ABGP, Inc., the Debtor's \"managing\" general partner. The Court also admitted certain additional exhibits into evidence. The parties were given an opportunity to brief the Court on the issues, and the matter is now ripe for ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As set forth below, the Court finds that the limited partnership formed in 1976 known as A &amp; B Associates, L.P. remains a viable limited partnership under Georgia law, eligible to be a debtor under Chapter 11 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and that the petition in this case was filed by its general partner with authority to do so. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Motion to Convert (dckt. 161) as to this narrow ground. By separate order the Court will also deny the Motion to Convert on all other grounds asserted by FCRE, and this case will proceed to confirmation. This Opinion constitutes the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. To the extent that any findings of fact herein are construed to be conclusions of law, they are hereby adopted as such. To the extent that any conclusions of law herein are construed to be findings of fact, they are hereby adopted as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the Standing Order of Reference signed by then Chief Judge Anthony A. Alaimo on July 13, 1984. This is a \"core proceeding\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the sources of information regarding the Debtor's formation and subsequent history are limited to the stipulated documents and to the testimony of Mr. Kettles. No other witness with personal knowledge has testified in this case as to matters relating to the limited partnership agreement, amendments to the same, the admission and withdrawal of limited and general partners from the inception of the limited partnership, or the intentions of those parties to the limited partnership agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A number of attorneys participated in the preparation of amendments to the limited partnership agreement, the formation of corporate general partners over the years, and efforts to resurrect administratively-dissolved entities. None of those attorneys appeared as witnesses. Moreover, Mr. Kettles himself did not become a party to the limited partnership until 1990. Thus, the Court has heard no testimony regarding the initial formation of the limited partnership in November of 1976 or regarding the initial financing for the construction of the apartment complex. Nevertheless, the Court can make certain limited findings regarding the history of the limited partnership prior to Mr. Kettles' acquisition (through one or more entities) of an interest in the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Formation of the Limited Partnership and Identity of Early General Partners\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement of A &amp; B Associates, L.P. (the \"Limited Partnership Agreement\") (FCRE Ex. 1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Debtor is a limited partnership organized under Georgia law on November 1, 1976, for the purpose of \"developing and operating 96 two-story garden type apartments known as the Versailles Apartments\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... on approximately 10.2 acres ... located in Beaufort County, [South Carolina].\" (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 1). The original general partner was PHB, Inc. (\"PHB\"), the name of which apparently was later changed to The Uniflex Corporation (\"Uniflex\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FCRE Ex. 6, p. 1), which owned a 25.03% interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 13). The limited partnership interests were acquired by a variety of individuals and trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Limited Partnership Agreement was amended several times between 1976 and 2015. Many of these are minor changes, reflecting a realignment of limited partnership interests. Other amendments reflect changes in the identity of general partners for this limited partnership and the ownership interests held by such general partners. Still other amendments to the Limited Partnership Agreement were made as a condition of obtaining financing from various lenders. Apart from these amendments to the Limited Partnership Agreement, the record is devoid of information about the Debtor's activities until Mr. Kettles became involved in 1990. His history with the Debtor requires some elaboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Kettles began working as a corporate officer for Uniflex in the late 1970s. (Transcript, pp. 68, 74). In the mid-1980s, Mr. Kettles left Uniflex and began working as a certified public accountant. (Transcript, p. 79). On February 2, 1988, an entity called Montgomery Management\n   Corp. (\"MMC\") was incorporated by H. Bruce Montgomery (\"Mr. Montgomery\") and Bette F. Montgomery. (FCRE Ex. 15). Although Mr. Kettles and Mr. Montgomery shared office space, Mr. Kettles testified that he was not involved with MMC. (Transcript, p. 88). On October 3, 1990, an entity called Montgomery Management Corp. II (\"MMC II\") was incorporated. (FCRE Ex. 16). Mr. Kettles testified that both he and Mr. Montgomery had ownership interests in MMC II. (Transcript, p. 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 27, 1990, a Certificate of Limited Partnership, executed by Mr. Montgomery, was filed with the Georgia Secretary of State identifying MMC II as the general partner of the Debtor. (FCRE Ex. 17). The record contains no documentation as to how or when MMC II became the general partner. Mr. Kettles, however, testified that MMC II acquired its interest as general partner from Uniflex. (Transcript, p. 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 1, 1993, an entity called The August Group, Inc. (the \"August Group\") was incorporated under Georgia law. (FCRE Ex. 18). According to Mr. Kettles, the August Group came about as a result of a conversation he had with Mr. Montgomery in August\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   of 1993 in which they decided to create a corporation for the purpose of replacing MMC II as general partner of the Debtor. (Transcript, pp. 93-95). Mr. Kettles could not recall whether Mr. Montgomery initially owned any interest in the August Group. (Transcript, pp. 92, 94). If so, Mr. Kettles bought out such interest early on, leaving Mr. Kettles as the August Group's sole owner. (Transcript, p. 92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Kettles testified that on January 1, 1996,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   he bought out (either in his individual capacity or through the August Group\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Mr. Montgomery's interest in MMC II, leaving Mr. Kettles as the sole shareholder of that entity, as well. (Transcript, p. 90). Although Mr. Kettles made reference to the existence of a transfer document evidencing this January 1, 1996 transaction, no such contemporaneous documentation has been produced. (Transcript, p. 114). Mr. Kettles then \"merged\" MMC II with the August Group, which was the surviving corporation following the merger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Transcript, pp. 90, 92, 96). Apparently, no documentation was filed with the Georgia Secretary of State to effectuate this merger, although Mr. Kettles testified that he informed the Internal Revenue Service that the two entities had merged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Transcript, p. 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sometime during 1999, the Debtor\n   sought to refinance its long-term debt\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and identified General Electric Capital Corporation (\"GECC\") as a potential lender. At this point, it must have occurred to the Debtor or to Mr. Kettles that documentation of the admission of the August Group as the general partner, backdated to 1996, would be useful in preparing to borrow $2,459,000.00 from GECC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   To that end, on December 14, 1999, Mr. Kettles, \"as sole shareholder of a dissolved corporation\" (MMC II) and as President of the August Group, executed an amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement (the \"first December 14, 1999 Amendment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FCRE Ex. 19). This amendment provides in full as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This Amendment is entered into effective as of the 1st day of January, 1996, by and between Montgomery Management II Corp., administratively dissolved Georgia corporation (\"Montgomery\") and August Group, Inc., a Georgia corporation (\"August\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    WITNESSETH:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   WHEREAS, Montgomery was the General Partner of A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership (\"A &amp; B\"), pursuant to that Limited Partnership Agreement dated November 1, 1976, as modified and amended (the \"Partnership Agreement\") and owned a 20.224% general partnership interest in A &amp; B; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   WHEREAS, the certificate of partnership for A &amp; B Associates, L.P., was filed with the Georgia Secretary of State on December 27, 1990; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   WHEREAS, as of January 1, 1996, August acquired all of the stock of Montgomery, caused Montgomery to transfer its 20.224% general partnership interest in A &amp; B to August and subsequently allowed Montgomery to be dissolved;\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   WHEREAS, as of January 1, 1996, L. Christopher Kettles owned 100% of the stock in Montgomery and 100% of the stock in August and was the sole director and officer of each corporation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend the Partnership Agreement and certificate of Limited Partnership to reflect that August is now the General Partner of A &amp; B,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises, obligations and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. Montgomery hereby withdraws as a General Partner of the Partnership and transfers all right, title and interest as\n   General Partner of the Partnership to August.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. The Partnership Agreement and Certificate is hereby amended to admit August to the Partnership as General Partner in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement, as amended. All references in the Partnership Agreement to the General Partner shall be deemed, on and after the date of this Amendment, to refer to August.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   3. By execution of this Amendment, August as General Partner, specifically adopts and approves each and every provision of the Partnership Agreement, as amended, and specifically ratifies and agrees to be bound by all actions undertaken by the Partnership and the partners prior to this date and in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   4. August is the General Partner of A &amp; B and owns a 20.224% general partnership interest in the capital, profits, losses and cash flow of A &amp; B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   5. The Partnership has obtained the requisite vote of the Limited Partners in accordance with the provisions of the Partnership Agreement for the withdrawal of Montgomery as a General Partner of the Partnership and for the admission of August as General Partner. The Partnership has also obtained the consent of the Limited Partners for the appointment of August with full power to act as the true and lawful attorney in fact of the Limited Partners, as provided in Section 11 of the Partnership Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   6. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Partnership Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership shall remain in full force and effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 19). This first December 14, 1999 Amendment (made effective, retroactively, to January 1, 1996) was consented to by 61.926%\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the limited partnership interests, in addition to the 20.224% interest of the August Group. (FCRE Ex. 19, pp. 5-24). All consent forms were signed by the limited partners in December of 1999, although on various dates throughout the month. Mr. Kettles testified that this amendment \"was a cleanup-type thing\" made in connection with the later admission of ABGP, Inc., as general partner. (Transcript, p. 104). At times, FCRE has pointed out certain alleged weaknesses in the admission of the August Group,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the Court finds that this entity was properly admitted as general partner in place of MMC II by virtue of the first December 14, 1999 Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    ABGP, Inc. Becomes General Partner Under the GECC Loan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As a condition of financing, GECC required that a single-purpose entity be established to serve as the Debtor's general partner holding a one-percent interest. (Transcript, pp. 93, 111, 115). To this end, a corporation called ABGP, Inc. (hereinafter \"ABGP I\" to avoid confusion with the corporate entity of the same name created\n   on November 4, 2010) was formed under Georgia law on December 13, 1999. (FCRE Ex. 20). This entity was assigned Control # K951295 by the Georgia Secretary of State. (FCRE Ex. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On December 14, 1999, on the heels of the amendment confirming the admission of the August Group as the Debtor's general partner in 1996, Mr. Kettles executed a\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   document entitled \"Amendment to the Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership for A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia Limited Partnership\" (the \"second December 14, 1999 Amendment\"). (FCRE Ex. 21). This document confirmed the admission of ABGP I as the Debtor's general partner to\n   <em>\n    replace\n   </em>\n   the August Group. (FCRE Ex. 21, p. 2). It also confirmed the transfer of a one-percent interest as general partner from the August Group to ABGP I, resulting in the reduction of the August Group's interest in the Debtor from 20.224% to 19.224%. (FCRE Ex. 21, p. 3). This interest of the August Group was reclassified as a \"Special Limited Partner\" interest, resulting in the withdrawal of the August Group from general partner responsibilities and liabilities. (FCRE. Ex. 21, p. 2). The second December 14, 1999 Amendment was consented to by 82.15% of the limited partnership interests, including the interests of the August Group and of ABGP I. (FCRE Ex. 21, pp. 8-26). As with the first December 14, 1999 Amendment, these consent forms were signed by the limited partners on various dates throughout December, concurrent with the GECC loan origination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, as of December 14, 1999, ABGP I was the Debtor's sole general partner. FCRE has not challenged the admission of ABGP I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Administrative Dissolution of ABGP I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After ABGP I became the Debtor's general partner on December 14, 1999, the limited partnership continued with its ownership and operation of the Property. It is undisputed, however, that on July 9, 2005, ABGP I was administratively dissolved by the Georgia Secretary of State. Apparently, this occurred solely as a result of Mr. Kettles' failure to pay, in two successive years, the $50.00 annual fee. (Transcript, pp. 124-25, 127). Mr. Kettles testified that at the time, he owned \"a dozen or so corporations.\" (Transcript, pp. 125). On a Saturday morning every March, Mr. Kettles would pay the annual fee for each of his corporations using the control number from the receipt from the prior year. (Transcript, pp. 125). According to Mr. Kettles, at some point he must have misplaced a prior year's receipt for ABGP I, and he therefore failed to pay that entity's annual fee for two consecutive years prior to the administrative dissolution in 2005. (Transcript, p. 126). Mr. Kettles testified that the Georgia Secretary of State did not notify him of the missed payments, and thus he was unaware of the administrative dissolution. (Transcript, p. 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The January 1, 2006 Amendment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On January 1, 2006, an \"Amendment to the Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership for A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia Limited Partnership\" (the \"January 1, 2006 Amendment\") took effect. (FCRE Ex. 22). This document purported to amend the Limited Partnership Agreement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   This Amendment is entered into effective as of the 1st day of January, 2006, by and among the undersigned and binding on all partners of A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend the Partnership Agreement to evidence the admission of new Limited Partners and the retirement of other Limited Partners as of December 15,\n   2005, and to reflect other changes to the Partnership Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises, obligations and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned (being the General Partner and the majority-in-interest of the Limited Partners each voting as a class)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   do hereby agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, without the consent of Partners holding a total of 87% partnership interest in the Partnership, the General Partner shall have no authority to\n   <em>\n    sell or lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or to amend, modify or alter this provision.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 22) (emphasis added). This January 1, 2006 Amendment has several puzzling features. It was signed only by Mr. Kettles as President of (then administratively-dissolved) ABGP I and as President of the August Group, which entity is identified on the signature page as \"Majority of Interest of Limited Partners.\" (FCRE Ex. 22, p. 4). It was not consented to in writing by any limited partners other than the August Group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the amended list of partners in this document identifies Mr. Kettles in his individual capacity as owning a 20% interest in the Debtor and identifies the August Group as owning a 51% interest. (FCRE Ex. 22, p. 2). According to this list, ABGP I still owned a one-percent interest as general partner. (FCRE Ex. 22, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In explaining the features of this document, Mr. Kettles testified that at some point prior to January 1, 2006, he offered to buy out all of the limited partners. (Transcript, p. 118). Some of the limited partners accepted this offer, and this was how Mr. Kettles personally acquired 34% of the limited partnership interests, although there is no documentation in the record evidencing these transactions. (Transcript, p. 119). Other limited partners\n   declined Mr. Kettles' offer but agreed to have their interests reduced. (Transcript, p. 118, 120). Subsequently, Mr. Kettles sold 12% to John Christopher Williams and Mary Ellen Williams, 1% to Christopher J. Williams and Diana D. Williams, and 1% to Michael D. Williams, leaving Mr. Kettles with the 20% interest reflected in the January 1, 2006 Amendment. (Transcript, p. 118-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Kettles did not recall precisely how the August Group's interest in the Debtor increased from 19.224% on December 14, 1999, to 51% on January 1, 2006. (Transcript, pp. 122-23). He testified only that the August Group acquired this interest from other limited partners, and he was unable to produce any supporting documentation for these transactions. (Transcript, p. 123). Based on Mr. Kettles' credible testimony, the Court finds that at the time the January 1, 2006 Amendment was executed, he was unaware that ABGP I had been administratively dissolved on July 9, 2005. (Transcript, pp. 124, 127-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Request for Reinstatement of ABGP I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Kettles testified that, at some point, his attorneys learned of the administrative dissolution of ABGP I and advised him to seek reinstatement from the Georgia Secretary of State. (Transcript, pp. 128-29). On March 28, 2008, Mr. Kettles signed a Request For Reinstatement Application Of Administratively Dissolved Entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FCRE Ex. 23). The document appears to have been faxed to the Office of the Secretary of State on the same day it was signed. (FCRE Ex. 23; Transcript, pp. 132-33). For reasons that are not clear, ABGP I was not reinstated. (Transcript, p. 130). However, neither is there evidence that the request was rejected. Possibly, the Georgia Secretary of State simply did not respond to the request. (Transcript, p. 133). At the time, Mr. Kettles believed that ABGP I was not reinstated because he had failed to request reinstatement within a two-year period\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   following administrative dissolution, and thus he took no further action in furtherance of reinstatement. (Transcript, p. 133-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Refinancing with Coastal Federal and Incorporation of ABGP II\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Meanwhile, the existing ten-year loan with GECC, which had originally prompted the incorporation of ABGP I on December 13, 1999, matured on January 1, 2010. (Dckt. 289-10, p. 7). The Debtor continued to make monthly payments to GECC after the maturity date, and the record does not reflect that GECC declared a formal default of the balloon payment that came due. At some point, the Debtor began negotiating new financing with Coastal Federal Credit Union (\"Coastal Federal\"). By this time, Mr. Kettles and his attorneys were aware that ABGP I had not been reinstated by the Georgia Secretary of State. (Transcript, p. 134). The record is silent as to Coastal Federal's knowledge of this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   According to Mr. Kettles, Coastal Federal (like GECC) required an amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement to provide for the formation and admission of a new corporate general partner. (Transcript, p. 137). The Debtor accommodated this request. On November 4, 2010, an amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement (the \"November 4, 2010\n   Amendment\") took effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FCRE Ex. 25). This amendment was executed by Mr. Kettles as President of \"ABGP, Inc., a Georgia Corporation\" and as President of the August Group (the \"Majority of Interest of Limited Partners\"). (FCRE Ex. 25, p. 5). It added the following relevant provisions to the Limited Partnership Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Certain Prohibited Activities\n   </em>\n   . The Partnership shall only incur indebtedness in an amount necessary to acquire, operate and maintain the Property. For so long as any mortgage lien in favor of Coastal Federal Credit Union, or its successors or assigns (the \"First Mortgage\") exists on any portion of the Property, the Partnership shall not incur, assume, or guaranty any other indebtedness. For so long as the First Mortgage exists on any portion of the Property, the Partnership shall not dissolve or liquidate, or consolidate or merge with or into any other entity, or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entity or transfer any of its partnership interests to any entity. For so long as the First Mortgage exists on any portion of the Property, the Partnership will not voluntarily commence a case with respect to itself, as debtor, under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any similar federal or state statute without the unanimous consent of all of the Partners of the Partnership. For so long as the First Mortgage exists on any portion of the Property, no material amendment to this Partnership Agreement may be made without first obtaining approval of the mortgagee holding the First Mortgage on any portion of the Property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Separateness Covenants\n   </em>\n   . For so long as the First Mortgage exists on any portion of the Property, in order to preserve and ensure its separate and distinct identity, in addition to the other provisions set forth in the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership shall conduct its affairs in accordance with the following provisions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   m. It shall have a corporate general partner which shall be organized to be a single purpose, \"bankruptcy remote\" entity with organizational documents substantially similar to the organizational documents of the current corporate general partner of the Partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Dissolution\n   </em>\n   . The partnership shall not terminate or dissolve solely as a consequence of the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more of the general partners of the Partnership, but the Partnership shall continue so long as there remains a solvent general partner of the Partnership. Subject to applicable law, dissolution of the Partnership shall not occur so long as the Partnership remains owner of the Property subject to the First Mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 25, pp. 2-4). Importantly, Section 4(m) of this amendment contemplated\n   the admission of a new corporate general partner, although the name of that entity was not set out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On the same day that this amendment was signed, November 4, 2010, the Secretary of State filed a Certificate of Incorporation for a new ABGP, Inc. (hereinafter \"ABGP II\"). (FCRE Ex. 24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   This new corporation was allowed to use the identical name, ABGP, Inc., and was assigned Control # 10076518 by the Georgia Secretary of State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FCRE Ex. 24, p. 1). According to the Certificate of Incorporation, the express purpose of forming ABGP II was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (i) To acquire a general partnership interest in and act as general partner of A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership (the \"Partnership\") which is engaged solely in the ownership, operation and management of the real estate project known as August on Southside Apartments located in Port Royal, South Carolina (the \"Property\"), pursuant to and in accordance with these Articles of Incorporation and the Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (ii) to engage in such other lawful activities permitted to corporations by the Business Corporation Code of the State of Georgia as are incidental, necessary or appropriate to the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 24, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   With respect to the November 4, 2010 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement made at Coastal Federal's behest, Mr. Kettles was unable to confirm whether he signed as President of the administratively-dissolved ABGP I or of the newly-created ABGP II. It is clear, however, that he executed this document after mailing the Articles of Incorporation for ABGP II to the Georgia Secretary of State on November 3, 2010. (Transcript, p. 138). The Court therefore finds that whether he signed on behalf of ABGP II as the newly-admitted general partner or on behalf of ABGP I as the outgoing general partner, ABGP II was the unnamed corporate general partner referenced in Section 4(m) of the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Thus, over five years after the administrative dissolution of the limited partnership's sole general partner, Mr. Kettles essentially took steps to install as general partner a sort of corporate doppelg\u00e4nger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was able to secure use of the same corporate name\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the new general partner, and because he controlled both the ownership and management of these two corporate entities, his transfer of the\n   1% interest from ABGP I to ABGP II was seamless, and apparently paperless. (Transcript, pp. 140-42).\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   To all outward appearances, then, the Debtor continued to be a properly organized limited partnership under Georgia law with a valid corporate general partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    General Partner Certification in Support of FCRE's April 2015 Refinance\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In April of 2015, approximately four-and-a-half years after borrowing from Coastal Federal, the Debtor again sought new financing, this time from FCRE. In preparation for extending credit to the Debtor, FCRE appears to have engaged in meaningful due diligence. Among the documents that Mr. Kettles was required to execute in his representative capacity as President of ABGP, Inc., was a Certificate of General Partner (dckt. 385-27), which set forth, in relevant part, the following representations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   1.

Mr. Kettles executed this Certificate of General Partner on April 15, 2015, as President of \"ABGP, Inc., a Georgia corporation,\" which is identified as the Debtor's general partner. (Dckt. 385-27, p. 3). The documents attached to this Certificate of General Partner, comprising 87 pages, were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit \"A\"\n   </strong>\n   - A one-page legal description of the Property.

(Dckt. 385-27, p. 87).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   What this collection of documents does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reveal is that ABGP I was administratively dissolved in 2005 and that Mr. Kettles attempted, unsuccessfully, to have it reinstated in 2008. It appears that FCRE did not inquire as to the status of the general partner (ABGP I), which ABGP II was created to replace. And the Debtor, acting, as always, through Mr. Kettles, did not volunteer that in 2010, as part of Coastal Federal's requirement that a new general partner be formed, it had ABGP I transfer its interest as general partner to a newly-created corporation of the same name. The Court does not find this non-disclosure either sinister or fraudulent. The Court finds that Mr. Kettles had a subjective belief that he properly caused ABGP II to be admitted as the new general partner in November of 2010 and therefore that ABGP II had the authority to effectuate the loan transaction with FCRE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On April 15, 2015, the same date that Mr. Kettles signed the Certificate of General Partner, he executed the Loan Agreement (Claim 2-1, Part 3); the Promissory Note (Claim 2-1, Part 4); and the Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (Claim 2-1, Part 5) with FCRE. The principal amount of the loan was $3,900,000.00. (Claim 2-1, Part 4, p. 2). In connection with this loan, Mr. Kettles, as President of ABGP, Inc. and of the August Group, executed an amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement which, among other things, required the Debtor not to \"seek or effect the liquidation, dissolution, winding up, liquidation [sic], consolidation, or merger, in whole or in part, of Partnership nor permit any constituent party of Partnership to do any of the foregoing ....\" (FCRE Ex. 26, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   H.\n   <em>\n    FCRE Declares a Default of the Loan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   From the date of the loan until the filing of its bankruptcy on February 3, 2017, the Debtor never failed to make its monthly payment to FCRE. Nor has the Debtor ever failed to make timely post-petition payments. But after FCRE was unable to securitize\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   this loan as originally contemplated, it undertook a very aggressive posture toward certain, and varied, alleged\n   <em>\n    non-monetary\n   </em>\n   defaults.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   This culminated\n   in an attempted seizure of the Property by FCRE on July 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   FCRE's attempted seizure of the Property led in turn to the filing of a complaint against FCRE by the Debtor on August 15, 2016, in the Court of Common Pleas, County of Beaufort, South Carolina, Case No. 2016-CP-07-1778, alleging that FCRE improperly declared a non-monetary default and unlawfully removed the Debtor from the Property. (Dckt. 219-2). The following day, August 16, 2016, Judge Marvin H. Dukes, III, Master in Equity and Special Circuit Judge for Beaufort County, South Carolina, issued an Order Granting Temporary Injunction, which restored the Debtor to the management of the Property. (Dckt. 66-2). On September 6, 2016, FCRE filed an answer, counterclaims, and a third-party complaint against Mr. Kettles in that case. (Dckt. 66-3). On September 23, 2016, Judge Dukes entered an Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Contempt, finding that FCRE failed to comply with the temporary injunction. (Dckt. 66-4). FCRE appealed both the temporary injunction and the finding of contempt, which are consolidated under Appellate Case No. 2016-001899 in the South Carolina Court of Appeals. (Dckt. 66-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Filing of the Bankruptcy Petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   On February 3, 2017, the Debtor filed its Voluntary Petition for Non-Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy (the \"Original Petition\") under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Dckt. 1). This Original Petition was signed by Mr. Kettles in his alleged capacity as \"Managing General Partner\" of the Debtor. (Dckt. 1, p. 22). The Debtor also filed its List of Equity Security Holders identifying 18 limited partners and the following\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   partners:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-114\">Name... Security Class Number of Securities Kind of Interest ABGP, Inc. General Partner 1% General Partner L. Christopher General Partner 20% General Partner Kettles The August Group, General Partner 51% General Partner Inc.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   (Dckt. 1, pp. 20-21). As pointed out by FCRE in its Emergency Motion of FCRE REL, LLC For Appointment of Chapter 11 Trustee Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), filed February 17, 2017, the Debtor's only general partner is ABGP, Inc. (Dckt. 32, p. 27). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Mr. Kettles\n   </em>\n   was not the Debtor's \"Managing General Partner\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In its amended Petition (dckt. 49), filed days later on February 24, 2017, the Debtor corrected the capacity in which Mr. Kettles signed the petition. The Court finds that Mr. Kettles properly signed the amended Petition as \"L. Christopher Kettles for ABGP, Inc.,\" which correctly identified him as the authorized representative of the Debtor's \"Managing General Partner.\" (Dckt. 49, p. 4). The Debtor also corrected its List of Equity Security Holders to indicate that ABGP, Inc. was the sole general partner with a 1% interest and that the August Group and Mr. Kettles in his individual capacity were merely\n   limited partners, not general partners. (Dckt. 46, pp. 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   J.\n   <em>\n    FCRE Challenges the Debtor's Eligibility\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As this Chapter 11 case progressed, FCRE began to suggest that the Debtor lacked authority to file bankruptcy. In its Motion to Convert filed on June 13, 2017, FCRE argued for the first time that Mr. Kettles lacked the requisite ownership interests to file the bankruptcy petition. (Dckt. 161, pp. 9-10). In its objection to the Debtor's Disclosure Statement Proposed September 29, 2017 (dckt. 265), FCRE argued that the administrative dissolution of ABGP I on July 9, 2005, left the Debtor without a valid general partner, thereby resulting in the dissolution of the Debtor itself under Georgia limited partnership law, and that since that date the Debtor's activities should have been limited to winding up its affairs. (Dckt. 289, pp. 5-8). FCRE has further developed this argument in its supplemental briefs. (Dckt. 333, 358, 388, 418, 475).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   K.\n   <em>\n    The Ratification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   FCRE's repeated challenges to the Debtor's authority to file bankruptcy finally elicited a response from the Debtor. On January 10, 2018, Mr. Kettles, both in his individual capacity (as owner of a 20% limited partnership interest) and as President of the August Group (of which Mr. Kettles was the sole shareholder and which held a 51% limited partnership interest), executed a document entitled \"Ratification and Confirmation of Actions Related to A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia Limited Partnership\" (the \"Ratification\"). (FCRE Ex. 30). This document provides in full as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Comes now, L.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The limited partnership known as A &amp; B Associates, L.P. was properly formed on November 1, 1976, and has continued to operate the August on Southside apartment complex through the present day. No general partner or limited partner has\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   sought dissolution of the limited partnership. The\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   party challenging the viability of the limited partnership is a creditor, FCRE, which had no involvement with the Debtor prior to April 15, 2015. Now, FCRE asks this Court to\n   reach back in time to July 9, 2005, to declare, as a consequence of the administrative dissolution of the Debtor's corporate general partner for failure to pay nominal fees, that the limited partnership itself was dissolved, that its activities were limited to winding up its affairs, that all of its subsequent actions (including two multimillion-dollar loan transactions) were undertaken impermissibly, and that it cannot reorganize its business in this bankruptcy case. This the Court will not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Positions of the Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   As this case progressed, the parties pursued discovery, conducted numerous examinations under Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and exchanged various documents. With the benefit of additional information about the Debtor's organizational history, FCRE's arguments have evolved somewhat since its Motion to Convert (dckt. 161) was filed on June 13, 2017. There, FCRE argued that Mr. Kettles, who owned or controlled (directly or indirectly) only a 72% interest in the Debtor, lacked the requisite ownership interest to file the Chapter 11 petition on the Debtor's behalf pursuant to the 87% Requirement set forth in the January 1, 2006 Amendment. (Dckt. 161, p. 9). FCRE has not pursued this argument, and the Court finds that the 87% Requirement did not bar the Debtor from filing this Chapter 11 reorganization case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As discussed above, FCRE first challenged the Debtor's status as a valid limited partnership, based on the administrative dissolution of ABGP I, in its objection (dckt. 289) to the Debtor's Disclosure Statement Proposed September 29, 2017. (Dckt. 265). More recently, in its Memorandum of Authorities (dckt. 388) filed on April 11, 2018, FCRE succinctly summarized its own arguments as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   (1) The administrative dissolution of ABGP, Inc. (the sole general partner of Debtor) on July 9, 2005 resulted in a dissolution of the limited partnership, A &amp; B Associates, L.P.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   (2) A &amp; B Associates, L.P. is a dissolved limited partnership, and is restricted to activities which constitute the \"winding up of affairs\" within the meaning of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-803 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   (3) While A &amp; B Associates, L.P. (as a dissolved limited partnership) may seek bankruptcy relief, it is limited to liquidation, and cannot pursue a Chapter 11 reorganization; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   (4) The attempted ratification dated January 10, 2018 is not sufficient to change the status of A &amp; B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   (Dckt. 388, pp. 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   For its part, the Debtor contends that any infirmities in its limited partnership\n   status following the administrative dissolution of ABGP I were cured by the incorporation and admission of ABGP II, that FCRE is estopped from denying that the Debtor is a valid limited partnership, and that by its Ratification the Debtor agreed to be bound by all prior actions taken by ABGP I and ABGP II. (Dckt. 391, pp. 1-3, 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Section 109(d)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \"Eligibility to be a debtor is governed by \u00a7 109 of the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4150947\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/73/#p82\">\n    478 B.R. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 82 (Bankr.

In this case, the Debtor's eligibility is based on its alleged status as a \"person that may be a debtor under chapter 7\" of the Bankruptcy Code. Subsection (b), which governs eligibility for Chapter 7, provides that, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, \"[a] person may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). \"The term 'person' includes individual, partnership, and corporation[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (41). A limited partnership qualifies as a person under this definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Energy Partners, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4139205\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/422/68/#p79\">\n    422 B.R. 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2009). Thus, the Debtor's status as a person under \u00a7 101(41), and therefore its eligibility to file this Chapter 11 case under \u00a7 109(d), depends on whether it is a valid limited partnership under Georgia law. FCRE contends that it is not. Accordingly, the Court must turn to Georgia law to determine whether the Debtor is a valid limited partnership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Westover Hills Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6105294\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/46/300/#p303\">\n    46 B.R. 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (Bankr.

Under this statute, the term \"limited partnership\" is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   A limited partnership is a partnership formed by two or more persons under Code Section 14-9A-20, having as members one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The limited partners as such shall not be bound by the obligations of the partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9A-2. In 1988, Georgia adopted the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 14-9-100,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which became effective as to all limited partnerships formed on or after July 1 of that year. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-1201. However, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-1201 provides for the following election for limited partnerships already in existence prior to the effective date of the act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   (b) A domestic limited partnership formed before July 1 of the year in which this chapter becomes effective may voluntarily elect, in accordance with any provision in its partnership agreement\n   permitting it to do so or by complying with the procedures provided in its partnership agreement for amending the partnership agreement, to adopt the provisions of this chapter and thereafter may become subject to its provisions as of July 1 of the year in which this chapter becomes effective by filing with the Secretary of State at any time after April 15 of the year in which this chapter becomes effective a certificate of limited partnership that complies with this chapter or a certificate of amendment that would cause its certificate of limited partnership to comply with this chapter and that, in each case, specifically states that the limited partnership is electing to adopt the provisions of this chapter. Upon the later of July 1 of the year in which this chapter becomes effective or the filing of a document complying with the immediately preceding sentence, all provisions of this chapter shall thereafter apply to the limited partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   (c) A domestic limited partnership formed before July 1 of the year in which this chapter becomes effective that does not adopt the provisions of this chapter pursuant to subsection(b) of this Code section shall continue to be governed by Article 1 or Article 2 of Chapter 9A of this title, as applicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-1201(b), (c). In other words, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act does not apply to a limited partnership formed prior to July 1, 1988,\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the limited partnership specifically elected to be covered by the new act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In this case, nowhere in the record is there any document in which the Debtor specifically elected to be covered under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. However, as noted above, a Certificate of Limited Partnership, executed by Mr. Montgomery on behalf of MMC II (then the Debtor's general partner), was filed with the Georgia Secretary of State on December 27, 1990. (FCRE Ex. 17, p. 2). In response to this filing, the Georgia Secretary of State generated a document entitled \"Certificate of Limited Partnership Filing.\" Although this document is barely legible, it appears to read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   Certificate of Limited Partnership Filing\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   I, Max Cleland, Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, do hereby certify, under the seal of my office, that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   A &amp; B Associates, L.P.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   a filing under prior Georgia Limited Partnership Act(s)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   has filed with the Secretary of State filing/effective date set forth above [i.e. December 27, 1990] a Certificate of Limited Partnership [\"of\" or \"or\"] an amendment to its Certificate of Limited Partnership\n   <em>\n    to incorporate the provisions of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of 1988\n   </em>\n   as provided by the laws of the State of Georgia, and the fees therefore have been paid as provided by law, and that attached hereto is a true copy of said certificate of amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   Witness my hand and official seal, in the City of Atlanta, and the State of Georgia on the date set forth below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   Date Certificate: [illegible, but possibly \"01/14/91\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 17, p. 1) (emphasis added). Inexplicably, the attached Certificate of Limited Partnership itself makes no reference whatsoever to any election under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. (FCRE Ex. 17, p. 2). The only other document referencing a supposed election is the post-petition Ratification filed on January 10, 2018, which states that the December 27, 1990 Certificate of Limited Partnership was \"a way to elect that the partnership be governed by the Georgia Limited Partnership Act of 1988 ....\" (FCRE Ex. 30, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   At the hearing held on April 16, 2018, the parties stipulated that the Debtor properly elected to be covered under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-1201(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Transcript, p. 27-28). Having reviewed the record, the Court agrees and finds that the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act is the applicable Georgia limited partnership statute. Additionally, the statutory scheme contemplates that \"in any case not provided for\" under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 14-8-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , \"shall govern.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-1204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   A brief history of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act is in order.

To reach this conclusion, FCRE asks the Court to travel thirteen years back in time to unravel the status of ABGP I as corporate\n   general partner. And to begin this unraveling, FCRE would have the Court first tug on those statutory provisions that require a limited partnership to have at least one general partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   FCRE's argument goes something like this. Under the Georgia Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, a limited partnership is \"a partnership formed in accordance with Code Section 14-9-201 by two or more persons under the laws of this state and\n   <em>\n    having one or more general partners\n   </em>\n   and one or more limited partners.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-101(8) (emphasis added). Here, it is undisputed that ABGP I had been the Debtor's sole general partner since December 14, 1999. On July 9, 2005, however, ABGP I was administratively dissolved based on Mr. Kettles' failure to pay, for two consecutive years, the $50 annual fee for that entity. The consequences to the Debtor were fairly immediate, FCRE argues. And that is because, pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   (a) A person ceases to be a general partner of a limited partnership upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   (9) Unless otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement or approved by written consent of all partners at the time,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     in the case of a general partner that is a corporation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the filing of a certificate of the corporation's dissolution or the equivalent for the corporation or the revocation of its charter and the lapse of 90 days after notice to the corporation of revocation without a reinstatement of its charter ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9) (emphasis added). In other words, this statute provides that a corporation ceases to be a general partner upon the occurrence of either of two alternatives: (1) the filing of a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent; or (2) the revocation of a corporation's charter and the corporation's failure to have its charter reinstated within 90. days of receiving notice of that revocation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   What do the terms \"certificate of dissolution\" and \"revocation of charter\" mean? The notion of revoking a corporation's charter appears to be an artifact of earlier law governing corporations and thus is not applicable in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Venable Bros. v. Southern Granite Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534996,535117\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/135/508/\">\n    135 Ga. 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20S.E.%20822\">\n    69 S.E. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1910) (\"A corporation is an artificial person, created by law for specific purposes, the limit of whose existence, powers, and liberties is fixed by its charter.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, the term\n   \"certificate of dissolution\" references, indirectly, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1421. Under this provision, the Georgia Secretary of State is required to notify a corporation that grounds for dissolution exist. And, under \u00a7 14-2-1421(b),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   (b) If the corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Secretary of State does not exist within 60 days after notice is provided to the corporation,\n   <em>\n    the Secretary of State shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a certificate of dissolution that recites the ground or grounds for dissolution and its effective date.\n   </em>\n   The Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1421(b) (emphasis added). If these procedures were followed with respect to ABGP I, then presumably the Georgia Secretary of State would have filed a certificate of dissolution. Unfortunately, this document does not appear in the record before the Court. Indeed, the first documentary reference to the administrative dissolution of ABGP I appears in Mr. Kettles' request for reinstatement dated March 28, 2008. (FCRE Ex. 23). Nevertheless, the parties have stipulated that ABGP I was administratively dissolved on July 9, 2005, apparently due to nonpayment of fees. Thus, FCRE contends that ABGP I ceased to be the Debtor's general partner pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9). Importantly, this statutory provision is a default rule, applicable \"[u]nless otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9). It nevertheless applies, according to FCRE, because \"[t]here is nothing in the Limited Partnership Agreement ... that specifically addresses 'dissolution.' \" (Dckt. 388, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The next thread in FCRE's argument is O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-101(3), which defines the term \"event of withdrawal of a general partner\" as \"an event that causes a person to cease to be a general partner as provided in Code Section 14-9-602.\" If ABGP I ceased to be a general partner under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9), then this would have constituted an event of withdrawal of a general partner under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-101(3). Such an event of withdrawal would then, in turn, have invoked O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-801(3), which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    A limited partnership is dissolved and its affairs must be wound up\n   </strong>\n   upon the first of the following to occur:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   (3) An event of withdrawal of a general partner unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   (A) There remains at least one other general partner and the written provisions of the partnership agreement permit the business of the limited partnership to be carried on by the remaining general partner or general partners alone or together with new general partners, and that partner or those general partners do so; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   (B) Within 90 days after the withdrawal, all partners other than the general partner with respect to which the event of withdrawal has occurred (or such partners as are provided for in the written provisions of the partnership agreement) agree in writing to continue the business of the limited partnership and, if there is no remaining\n   general partner, to the appointment, effective as of the date of withdrawal, of one or more new general partners ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-801(3) (emphasis added). Subsection (3)(A) does not apply in this case because ABGP I was the sole general partner. So, FCRE contends, unless all remaining partners agreed in writing within 90 days to continue the limited partnership and to appoint one or more general partners, the event of withdrawal of ABGP I would have resulted in the dissolution of A &amp; B Associates, L.P. Based on Mr. Kettles' testimony, prior to 2008 none of the limited partners were aware that ABGP I had been administratively dissolved. Thus, within 90 days of July 9, 2005, there was no written agreement to continue the business of the limited partnership and to appoint a new general partner. Following the lapse of the 90-day period, FCRE contends, the limited partnership would itself have been dissolved under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-801(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   FCRE goes on to argue that, as a dissolved limited partnership, the Debtor's activities would have been limited to winding up its affairs pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-803, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   (a) After dissolution, except as provided in the partnership agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   the general partners who have not withdrawn or, if none, the limited partners may wind up the limited partnership's affairs but, if one or more of such general partners have engaged in wrongful conduct, or upon other cause shown, the court may wind up the limited partnership's affairs upon the application of a partner, his legal representative, or assignee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   (b) Unless otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement, the persons winding up the limited partnership's affairs may, in the name of, and for and on behalf of, the limited partnership:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   (1) Prosecute and defend suits, whether civil, criminal, or administrative;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   (2) Settle and close the limited partnership's business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   (3) Dispose of and convey the limited partnership's property for cash;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   (4) Discharge the limited partnership's liabilities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   (5) Distribute to the partners any remaining assets of the limited partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-803. According to FCRE, \"[w]hile there is no Georgia authority on point, general law is that the partnership cannot continue in business but must confine its activities to winding up its affairs.\" (Dckt. 388, p. 6). FCRE acknowledges that \"[t]here appears to be no time limit within which a limited partnership is required to complete the winding up of its partnership affairs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dckt. 388, p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Having supposedly established that the Debtor was dissolved under Georgia limited partnership law, FCRE concludes by citing numerous bankruptcy cases which, collectively, appear to stand for the proposition that a dissolved entity cannot seek reorganization under Chapter 11 but, at most, may only liquidate its assets under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    C-TC 9th Avenue Partnership v.

Thus, as a dissolved limited partnership, A &amp; B Associates, L.P. would have been ineligible to file this Chapter 11 case seeking reorganization. Accordingly, FCRE argues, this case should be dismissed or the Debtor should be forced to liquidate the Property, whether in this Chapter 11 case or in a case under Chapter 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    The Limited Partnership Agreement Otherwise Provides\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   FCRE makes a compelling argument. If every one of its premises is correct, then the administrative dissolution of the general partner ABGP I on July 9, 2005, led inexorably to the Debtor's destruction as a limited partnership, rendering it ineligible to file this bankruptcy case. But the Court finds that one of FCRE's premises is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   correct, namely that ABGP I ceased to be a general partner under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9) when a certificate of dissolution was (presumably) filed by the Georgia Secretary of State. Indeed, this statutory provision is not applicable because, by its terms, it only applies \"[u]nless otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement ....\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-602(a)(9). Contrary to FCRE's assertion, the Limited Partnership Agreement\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   otherwise provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   First, Section 4 of the Limited Partnership Agreement\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   governs the term of the partnership. Under Section 4.1,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   4.1 The term of the Partnership shall commence upon the filing for [re]cord of the Agreement of Limited Partnership in the office of the Clerk [of] the Superior Court of Fulton County and shall continue until May 31, 1996;\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   [pr]ovided, however, that the Partnership shall be terminated and dissolved [pr]ior to such date upon:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   c) the transfer by the General Partner of its entire interest [in] the Partnership in breach of the covenant contained in Section 16.2 [here]of unless all of the then Limited Partners elect a new General Partner\n   <em>\n    [to] continue the Partnership\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   d) the happening of a Disabling Event, as defined in Section 18 [he]reof, to the General Partner unless all of the then Limited Partners elect [a] new General Partner to\n   <em>\n    continue the Partnership\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   f) a material breach by the General Partner of any covenant contained herein unless a majority in interest of the Limited Partners elect\n   <em>\n    to continue the Partnership\n   </em>\n   notwithstanding any such breach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 2) (emphasis added). Section 18, which governs the liquidation and dissolution of the limited partnership, is also relevant. It provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   18.1\n   <em>\n    Method of Liquidation.\n   </em>\n   Upon the termination of the Partnership [p]ursuant to Section 4 hereof, the General Partner shall proceed to liquidate [t]he Partnership's assets and to dissolve the Partnership ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   18.2\n   <em>\n    Date of Dissolution.\n   </em>\n   The partnership shall terminate and dissolve when all or substantially all of the property owned by the partnership shall have been disposed of in accordance with Section 18.1 above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 11). Section 18.1 presumes that there will be a general partner capable of liquidating the assets of the limited partnership. And Section 18.2 states that the limited partnership will dissolve when the Property is sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Although Section 4.1(d) indicates that the term \"disabling event\" is defined in Section 18, the applicable provision is actually Section 17. It is Section 17.1 that governs the termination of a general partner, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   17.1 General Partner. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.1 e)\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   [h]ereof,\n   <em>\n    in the event the General Partner\n   </em>\n   (hereinafter referred to as the [\"]Disabled General Partner\")\n   <em>\n    terminates\n   </em>\n   , has its net worth decline to less than 15% of the total Limited Partners' equity capital accounts, becomes legally insolvent or bankrupt, or withdraws from the Partnership in breach of the covenant contained in Section 14 hereof (each of which events are hereinafter referred to as a \"Disabling Event\"),\n   <em>\n    the Partnership shall continue\n   </em>\n   and the Partnership interest of the Disabled General Partner shall [b]e converted into a Limited Partner's interest with the same rights in income as the Disabled General Partner had with respect to its interest [a]s a General Partner; provided, however, that the Disabled General Partner or its personal representative, as the case may be, shall become a substituted Limited Partner only upon compliance with the same terms and conditions applicable to a transferee of a Limited Partner pursuant to [S]ection 16 hereof;\n   <em>\n    provided further that a Disabling Event shall not [s]erve to terminate the Partnership if the majority-in-interest of the [L]imited Partners agree, within sixty days thereafter, to elect a successor [G]eneral Partner to serve in the place of the Disabled General Partner\n   </em>\n   . Such [s]uccessor General Partner shall have all of the rights and liabilities of the previous General Partner, except that the successor shall not have the rights [t]o the General Partner's profit and equity interest in the Partnership if such [G]eneral Partner has already assigned such interest pursuant to Section 16.2 [h]erein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 11) (emphasis added). This provision, although not a model of clarity, states that, in the event that the general partner \"terminates,\" the limited partnership will continue so long as the majority-in-interest of the limited partners elect a successor general partner within 60 days. Admittedly, when ABGP I was administratively dissolved, the limited partners did not comply with Section 17.1. No successor general partner was elected within 60 days after July 9, 2005. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the limited partners continued the business of the limited partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Limited Partnership Agreement reflects a simple business model, namely construction, ownership, and management of an apartment complex:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   <em>\n    [Se]ction 3. Purpose of Partnership\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   3.1 The primary purpose of the Partnership shall be to develop the [Pr]operty and to construct thereon for rental and investment purposes the [96] unit apartment project in accordance with the plans and specifications [la]beled \"Versailles Apartments\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 2). This is a long-term proposition. To be sure, the limited partnership could elect to sell the Property at any point along the way. But the provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement reflect an intention to continue the operation of the Property. And that is exactly what the limited partners did. Notwithstanding the administrative dissolution of the corporate general partner, the limited partnership continued to operate the apartment complex as if nothing had changed. And, in both 2010 (with Coastal Federal) and 2015 (with FCRE), the limited partnership sought and obtained new financing. In connection with the first of these loans, the November 4, 2010 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Dissolution.\n   </em>\n   The Partnership shall not terminate or dissolve\n   <em>\n    solely as a consequence of the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more of the general partners\n   </em>\n   of the Partnership, but\n   <em>\n    the Partnership shall continue so long as there remains a solvent general partner\n   </em>\n   of the Partnership. Subject to applicable law,\n   <em>\n    dissolution of the Partnership shall not occur as long as the Partnership remains owner of the Property subject to the First Mortgage\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 25, p. 4) (emphasis added). Thus, through their conduct, including the execution of this amendment, the limited partners evinced an intent to continue the business of the limited partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Moreover, the Limited Partnership Agreement by its terms contemplated the admission and withdrawal of general partners:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   16.2\n   <em>\n    Transfer of General Partner's Interest\n   </em>\n   . The General Partner [h]ereby covenants and agrees that it will not sell, assign, or transfer all or [a]ny part of its interest in the Partnership to any person, firm, or corporation\n   <em>\n    [w]ithout the majority-in-interest consent of the Partners.\n   </em>\n   Nothing in [t]his agreement shall prohibit the General Partner from transferring its [p]rofit and equity interest in the Partnership to anyone of its choice [w]hich is permissible and constitutes a valid transfer, so long as the [G]eneral Partner is subject to the obligations herein at the time of [t]ransfer, which is specifically permissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   16.3\n   <em>\n    Permitted Transfer of General Partner's Interest\n   </em>\n   . In the event the [G]eneral Partner transfers all or any part of its interest in the Partnership [t]o a third party with the consent of the Partners pursuant to Section 16.2 [a]bove,\n   <em>\n    the Partnership shall continue\n   </em>\n   and the transferee of such interest shall [b]e admitted to the Partnership as a General Partner with the same interest\n   in [t]he Partnership capital, profits, losses, tax items, and distributable income as [t]he transferring General Partner had with respect to the transferred interest in [t]he Partnership; provided, however, that any such transferee shall be subject [t]o the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall promptly upon demand of [t]he Limited Partners execute a consent to be bound by such terms and con[d]itions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 1, p. 10) (emphasis added). Consistent with the intent (if not the letter) of these provisions, the identity of the general partner has changed from PHB (renamed Uniflex) to MMC II to the August Group to ABGP I (prior to its administrative dissolution). The Court thus finds that the Limited Partnership Agreement was designed to facilitate the regime changes represented by these new general partners and, further, to avoid an unnecessary disruption in the business of the limited partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The Court's conclusion is consistent with the \"policy of freedom of contract and maximum flexibility\" embodied in the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. 59A Am. Jur. 2d\n   <em>\n    Partnership\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 796 (August 2018 update).

This is because, under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-1204, the provisions of Georgia's Uniform Partnership Act shall govern in any case not provided for under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. The Court finds that this provision authorizes the continuation of a limited partnership's business pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-8-38 (\"Right of partners to application of partnership property\"), which provides in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   (a) Unless otherwise agreed by the partners in the partnership agreement,\n   <em>\n    at the time of the transaction or at any other time, including but not limited to, an agreement to continue the business of the partnership, when dissolution is caused in any way\n   </em>\n   , other than wrongfully either in contravention of the partnership agreement or as a result of other wrongful conduct of a partner, any partner, or the legal representative of the estate of a deceased partner, as against his copartners and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interests in the partnership, may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities and the surplus applied to pay in cash or its equivalent the net amount owing to the respective partners.

If the partners continue the business, they shall pay to any partner who has caused the dissolution wrongfully the value of his interest in the partnership at the dissolution less any damages or other amounts recoverable under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection and obtain his discharge or appropriately hold him harmless from all present or future partnership liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-8-38 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   This statute plainly contemplates that, when dissolution is caused \"in any way\" (except wrongfully), the remaining partners can agree \"at any ... time\" to \"continue the business of the partnership.\" The Comment to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-801, which governs events triggering the dissolution of a limited partnership, supports the Court's interpretation. This Comment, which was prepared under the supervision of the Joint Committee on Partnership Law of the Real Property and Corporate and Banking Law Sections of the State Bar of Georgia, states that \"the [limited] partnership business can be continued after dissolution pursuant to Section 14-8-38, which applies pursuant to Section 14-9-1204.\" Comment to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-9-801. Based on the aforementioned actions of the limited partners to continue the operation of the apartment complex, the Court finds that they elected to continue the limited partnership notwithstanding any dissolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   For these reasons, the administrative dissolution of ABGP I did not render the limited partnership unviable. It\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   necessitate admitting a new general partner. And so the question remains: Did ABGP I have the power to hand off its interest as general partner to a new general partner?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Time Period to Request Reinstatement of a Dissolved Corporation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Business corporations organized under the laws of Georgia are governed by the Georgia Business Corporation Code, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 14-2-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Under this statute, a corporation is required to pay a $50 annual fee. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-122(3). Mr. Kettles testified that he must have failed to pay this fee on behalf of ABGP I for two successive years. This oversight then authorized the administrative dissolution of ABGP I pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1420(2), which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   The Secretary of State may commence a proceeding under Code Section 14-2-1421 to dissolve a corporation administratively if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   (2) The corporation does not deliver its annual registration to the Secretary of State, together with all required fees and penalties, within 60 days after it is due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1420(2).

On March 28, 2008, he requested reinstatement of ABGP I. For unknown\n   reasons, the Georgia Secretary of State did not respond to this request. At the time, Mr. Kettles believed that Georgia law required an administratively-dissolved corporation to seek reinstatement within two years and that the Secretary of State's failure to respond was due to the expiration of this two-year period. (Transcript, p. 133-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Under Georgia law, a corporation that is administratively dissolved has a limited time within which to seek reinstatement, and the expiration of that limitation period may affect the post-dissolution actions that such corporation is permitted to undertake. However, the controlling statutory provision, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1422, has been amended several times over the years, creating uncertainty as to which limitation period applies to ABGP I. In their briefs and oral arguments, the parties have variously suggested that the applicable limitation period for ABGP I to seek reinstatement was either two years, five years, or an indefinite length of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   This issue therefore requires some discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   In 1988, Georgia adopted a version of \u00a7 14-2-1422 that required applications for reinstatement to be filed within two years of dissolution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   (a) A corporation administratively dissolved under Code Section 14-2-1421 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement within two years after the effective date of dissolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988%20Ga.%20Laws%201219\">\n    1988 Ga.

It was this 1997 version of the statutory text, which did not provide any time limit, that was in effect when ABGPI was administratively dissolved on July 9, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   In 2008, Georgia adopted yet another version of \u00a7 14-2-1422 that again featured the five-year limitation period:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   (a) A corporation administratively dissolved under Code Section 14-2-1421 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement within five years after the effective date of such dissolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20Ga.%20Laws%20256\">\n    2008 Ga. Laws 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This language was not changed by a 2011 amendment, and thus the current version of the statute contains the five-year period for seeking reinstatement. FCRE would have the Court apply this five-year limitation period retroactively to July 9, 2005, based on subsection (e), which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   (e) This Code section shall apply to all corporations administratively dissolved under Code Section 14-2-1421 or any\n   similar former statute, regardless of the date of dissolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1422(e).

As a general rule, Georgia \"[l]aws prescribe only for the future; they cannot impair the obligation of contracts nor, ordinarily, have a retrospective operation.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 1-3-5. However, this general rule is subject to certain exceptions.

The record reflects that it did two things. First,\n   acting through Mr. Kettles, it executed the January 1, 2006 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement. Second, it allegedly transferred its interest as the Debtor's general partner to ABGP II. Were these permissible actions for an administratively-dissolved corporation to take? In other words, what can an administratively-dissolved corporation do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Section \u00a7 14-2-1421 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code, which sets forth the procedures for administrative dissolution and the effect thereof, provides in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    A corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under Code Section 14-2-1405.\n   </em>\n   Winding up the business of a corporation administratively dissolved may include the corporation's proceeding, at any time after the effective date of the administrative dissolution, (1) in accordance with Code Section 14-2-1406\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   to notify known claimants, and (2) to mail or deliver, with accompanying payment of the cost of publication, a notice containing the information specified in subsection (b) of Code Section 14-2-1407\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   for publication in accordance with subsection (b) of Code Section 14-2-1403.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon such notice, claims against the administratively dissolved corporation will be limited as specified in Code Sections 14-2-1406 and 14-2-1407, respectively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   (d) The administrative dissolution of a corporation does not terminate the authority of its registered agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1421 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, following administrative dissolution, the corporation may only take actions necessary to wind up its affairs. Subsection (c) identifies two actions that a corporation may take during this winding up period: (1) notifying the corporation's known claimants; and (2) mailing or delivering certain additional notices of dissolution. But this list is not exhaustive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Section 14-2-1421 also states that an administratively-dissolved corporation may take certain actions enumerated in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1405 (\"Effect of notice of intent to dissolve\"), which appears in the portion of the Georgia Business Corporation Code governing voluntary dissolution. This section provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   A corporation that has filed a notice to dissolve continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business\n   except that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs, including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   (1) Collecting its assets;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   (2) Disposing of its properties that will not be distributed in kind to its shareholders;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   (3) Discharging or making provision for discharging its liabilities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   (4) Distributing its remaining property among its shareholders according to their interests; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   (5) Doing every other act necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1405. Clearly, this is not an exhaustive list, either. In any event, the statutory scheme recognizes that certain actions must or may be taken by, or on behalf of, an administratively-dissolved corporation. This reflects the legislature's recognition that administrative dissolution has far-reaching consequences and that an abrupt ending would work real harm. Thus, the question before the Court is whether the actions of ABGP I following its administrative dissolution were \"necessary to wind up and liquidate\" the business and affairs of that entity. Several Georgia cases bear on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   <em>\n    Gas Pump, Inc. v.

The history of that case, originally filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia on March 21, 1991, deserves some attention. As set forth by the district court, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Gas Pump\n   </em>\n   were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n   Gas Pump, a corporation owned by Jack Karesh, purchased soft drinks from the Defendants for resale to customers in the Savannah area. In May of 1988, the Georgia Secretary of State administratively dissolved Gas Pump for failure to satisfy the state's annual filing and fee requirements for a Georgia corporation. Gas Pump did not seek reinstatement within two years, as permitted by the Georgia statute. Therefore, Gas Pump was a dissolved corporation when it filed this civil antitrust suit, in the spring of 1991, alleging that the Defendants conspired to fix prices in the soft drink industry between 1979 and 1985.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   <em>\n    Gas Pump, Inc. v.

More specifically, the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   The expiration of the time for reinstatement puts a stamp of finality on the demise of the corporation-it can no longer be resuscitated. The unavoidable conclusion is that the corporation cannot, after the time its demise is deemed complete,\n   <em>\n    initiate any activity\n   </em>\n   . To permit a suit to be initiated in the name of the dissolved corporation after that time would be to sanction a form of legal necromancy, reanimation of the empty husk of a dead corporate entity. We reject, therefore, Gas Pump's assertion that the legal existence of an administratively-dissolved corporation continues indefinitely and without practical limit on its ability to conduct any business which it asserts is necessary to winding up its affairs. Read together \u00a7\u00a7 14-2-1421, and 14-2-1422 provide a period of two years in which an administratively-dissolved corporation can initiate activities necessary to the winding up and liquidation of its affairs and business.

Thus, although the Supreme Court stated that, after the period for seeking reinstatement expires, an administratively-dissolved corporation \"cannot ... initiate any activity\" and \"can take no further action,\" these statements do not foreclose the possibility that ABGP I could transfer to ABGP II its interest in A &amp; B Associates, L.P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1236804\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/263/583/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Returning to the statutory language, the Georgia Business Corporation Code provides that an administratively-dissolved corporation \"may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs ....\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1421(c).

The statute appears to support this broad definition of that term.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1421(c) (referencing actions that are \"necessary\" under \u00a7 14-2-1405 )\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1405 (\"A corporation that has filed a notice to dissolve continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Under this standard, the Court finds that the execution of the November 1, 2006 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement was permissible under Georgia law. This amendment merely amended the list of partners to the limited partnership to \"reflect the buyout of certain Limited Partners and the recent admission of others,\" to reclassify the various interests in the Debtor, to make certain changes to the\n   distribution of distributable income and distributable capital, and to require the consent of 87% of the limited partnership interests before the general partner may \"sell or lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership ....\" (FCRE Ex. 22, pp. 1-3). These changes to the Limited Partnership Agreement were consistent with and appropriate to the winding up of the business of ABGP I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   What about the transfer from ABGP I to ABGP II of the interest as the Debtor's general partner? Was this necessary or appropriate to the winding up of ABGP I? The Court finds that it was. Notwithstanding its administrative dissolution on July 9, 2005, which commenced a five-year winding up period, the Court finds that ABGP I continued its corporate existence for the purposes of winding up its affairs through and until the incorporation of ABGP II on November 4, 2010. At that time, Mr. Kettles, who was the sole shareholder of both corporate entities, properly transferred the interest as general partner from the administratively-dissolved ABGP I to the newly-incorporated ABGP II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   That interest, which was the sole asset of ABGP I, then became the sole asset of ABGP II. The November 4, 2010 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement explicitly provided for the creation of a new corporate general partner. Although ABGP II was not identified by name, the Court finds that ABGP II was the entity intended to be the new general partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Supporting the Court's conclusion is the fact that ABGP I and ABGP II both had the same\n   <em>\n    raison d'etre\n   </em>\n   , namely to serve as the general partner of A &amp; B Associates, L.P. Specifically, the Articles of Incorporation of ABGP I provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n   The Corporation's business and purpose shall consist solely of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-300\">\n   (i) To acquire a general partnership interest in and act as general partner of A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership (the \"Partnership\"), which is engaged solely in the ownership, operation and management of the real estate project known as Versailles Apartments located in Port Royal, South Carolina (the \"Property\"), pursuant to and in accordance with these Articles of Incorporation and the Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-301\">\n   (ii) to engage in such other lawful activities permitted to corporations by the Business Corporation Code of the State of Georgia as are incidental, necessary or appropriate to the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 20, p. 3). Likewise, the Articles of Incorporation of ABGP II state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   The Corporation's business and purpose shall consist solely of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   (i) To acquire a general partnership interest in and act as general partner of A &amp; B Associates, L.P., a Georgia limited partnership (the \"Partnership\"), which is engaged solely in the ownership, operation and management of the real estate project known as August on Southside Apartments located in Port Royal, South Carolina (the \"Property\"), pursuant to and in accordance with these Articles of Incorporation and the Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   (ii) (ii) [sic] to engage in such other lawful activities permitted to corporations by the Business Corporation Code of the State of Georgia as are incidental, necessary or appropriate to the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   (FCRE Ex. 24, p. 3). By virtue of its administrative dissolution on July 9, 2005, ABGP I lost the ability to carry on indefinitely as the Debtor's general partner. On its deathbed, when it could no longer fulfill its sole purpose in life, it passed that responsibility on to a new entity, ABGP II. In so doing, ABGP I fulfilled its fiduciary duties to the limited partnership and to the other limited partners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendry v.

Thus, if the only action that ABGP I could undertake following its administrative dissolution was to wind up its affairs, then it did so successfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   It is true that in\n   <em>\n    Gas Pump\n   </em>\n   , after the Supreme Court of Georgia answered the certified question, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the shareholder's argument that the administratively-dissolved corporation could assign its antitrust claim to him.\n   <em>\n    Gas Pump,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524112\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/12/181/#p182\">\n    12 F.3d at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Exclusive Properties, Inc. v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals of Georgia rejected a similar argument, explaining that the administratively-dissolved corporation's \"cause of action against defendants is not a corporate asset to which [the corporation's] former shareholders became legally entitled upon [the corporation's] administrative dissolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Exclusive Prop.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"849287\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/218/229/#p229\">\n    218 Ga.

These cases, however, do not preclude the transfer of ownership from ABGP I to ABGP II, for two reasons. First, in both of these cases, the relevant asset was the right to initiate a lawsuit, not an interest as general partner in a limited partnership, as is the case here. Second, and more importantly, Mr. Kettles, the sole shareholder of both ABGP I and ABGP II, did not transfer that asset to himself. Instead, he created a new entity, which shared the same purpose, to receive that asset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Nor, as previously mentioned, was there anything sinister about Mr. Kettles' use of the same corporate name, ABGP, Inc., for the entity created on November 4, 2010. Under Georgia law,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   The Secretary of State shall reserve the name of a corporation administratively-dissolved under Code Section 14-2-1421 for such corporation's specific use for a period of five years after the effective date of the dissolution or until the corporation is reinstated, whichever is sooner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1422(b). Thus, it was merely a happy coincidence that the corporate name became available on July 9, 2010, five years after the administrative dissolution of the original entity of that name. The incorporation of ABGP II on November 4, 2010, and the transfer of an interest as general partner to that entity\n   were not part of any scheme to hoodwink FCRE, which had no relationship with the Debtor until April 15, 2015. Indeed, ABGP II was created in connection with the loan transaction with Coastal Federal, and there is no evidence in the record that Coastal Federal had any qualms about the Debtor's status as a valid limited partnership under Georgia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    ABGP Properly Exercised its Power of Attorney\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   The post-dissolution actions of ABGP I were also consistent with provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement that invested the power of attorney in the Debtor's general partner, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-313\">\n   <em>\n    [Section] 11.

Through its admission as general partner pursuant to the second December 14, 1999 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement, ABGP I received this broad grant of power of attorney, which included the power (subject to the majority-in-interest consent, which it obtained) to amend the Limited Partnership Agreement and to effectuate the admission of a new general partner. And, pursuant to section 11.2 of the Limited Partnership Agreement, this power of attorney survived the termination of the general partner. Thus, the only actions\n   taken by ABGP I following its administrative dissolution, namely the execution of the January 1, 2006 Amendment and the transfer of an interest as general partner to ABGP II, were authorized under the irrevocable grant of power of attorney set forth in the original Limited Partnership Agreement. The Court finds that ABGP I properly exercised its power of attorney in connection with the winding up of its business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Without trying to define the absolute outer limits of what an administratively-dissolved corporation can do or, acting through its authorized agents, have done for it, the Court concludes that it was permissible and proper for ABGP I to convey its interest as general partner in the Debtor to ABGP II in November of 2010. The Court further finds that ABGP II was properly admitted as general partner pursuant to the November 4, 2010 Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement, which expressly contemplated the admission of \"a corporate general partner which shall be organized to be a single purpose, 'bankruptcy remote' entity with organizational documents substantially similar to the organizational documents of the current corporate general partner [i.e. ABGP I] of the Partnership.\" (FCRE Ex, 25, p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   J.\n   <em>\n    Corporation by Estoppel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Finally, the Debtor contends that, under the doctrine known as corporation by estoppel, FCRE should be prohibited from challenging the legal existence of the limited partnership. Specifically, the Debtor states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   FCRE made a loan to Debtor, A &amp; B, in April, 2015. At that time, before and since, FCRE has dealt with ABGP, Inc. as the General Partner of Debtor, A &amp; B, as well as having dealt with Debtor, A &amp; B, as a limited partnership in its loan relationship. The long standing [sic] doctrine of corporation by estoppel was codified in Georgia O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-5-4. The cases citing that statute recognize the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. The statute states: \"The existence of a corporation claiming a charter under color of law cannot be collaterally attacked by persons who have dealt with it as a corporation. Such persons are estopped from denying its corporate existence.\" (Civil Code 1895, \u00a7 1862; Civil Code 1910, \u00a7 2226; Code 1933, \u00a7 22-714; Code 1933, \u00a7 22-5103, enacted by Ga. L. 1968, p. 565, \u00a7 1; O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-5-4 ). Although there is not a similar statute as to limited partnerships, there is no reason that the doctrine would not apply in this case as to Debtor and its legal existence under Georgia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   (Dckt. 391, p. 2-3). It is true that under Georgia law, as codified at O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-5-4, \"one who deals with a corporation as such an entity cannot ... deny the legality of the corporate existence ....\"\n   <em>\n    BP Prod.

It incorrectly states that ABGP I had a two-year period in which to seek reinstatement (FCRE Ex. 20, p. 2), a position that the Debtor later abandoned. (Dckt. 391, p. 10).

Based on this language, FCRE contends that Mr. Kettles lacked the necessary 87% partnership interest in the Debtor to file the Chapter 11 petition. (Dckt. 161, p. 9). It is true that Mr. Kettles only owned or controlled a 72% interest in the Debtor. Specifically, he owned a 20% interest as limited partner in his individual capacity, a 51% interest as limited partner via the August Group (of which he was the sole shareholder), and a 1% interest as general partner via ABGP, Inc. (of which he was the sole shareholder). (Dckt. 46, pp. 4-5). This 72% interest, of course, does not meet the 87% threshold. The Court, however, finds that the 87% Requirement is not applicable in this case. The Debtor, acting through Mr. Kettles as the authorized representative of the general partner ABGP, Inc., filed this Chapter 11 case seeking reorganization. There has been no suggestion that ABGP, Inc., intends \"to sell or lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"43\">\n   <p id=\"p-375\">\n    In its brief filed on April 13, 2018, the Debtor acknowledged that it \"elect[ed] to become bound by the 1988 Limited Partnership Act ....\" (Dckt. 391, p. 9).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"44\">\n   <p id=\"p-376\">\n    FCRE appears to have consistently misread this provision as allowing a dissolved corporate general partner to seek reinstatement within 90 days regardless of whether a certificate of dissolution was filed or its charter was revoked.
