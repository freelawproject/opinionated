Moyer (the \"Trustee\") filed Trustee's Objection to Amended Claim of Exemption (ECF No. 43, the \"Objection\"), seeking an order denying any exemption in the Cause of Action as contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor opposes the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The court held a hearing on November 16, 2018, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to consider the Debtor's exemption and whether the Trustee has met his burden under Rule 4003(c) of persuading the court that the Debtor has not properly claimed it. The Debtor and the Trustee both appeared at the hearing through counsel. The Debtor's former counsel also appeared through counsel, but only to monitor the hearing for any impact on the Trustee's adversary proceeding against her and her firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court has considered the arguments presented at the hearing and in the Trustee's Brief in Support of Objection to Amended Claims of Exemptions filed after the hearing (ECF No. 54, the \"Post-Hearing Brief\"), and will overrule the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By way of background, before the Debtor amended her exemption claims, the Trustee had filed a complaint against the Debtor's former counsel alleging legal malpractice due to counsel's alleged failure to file the Debtor's petition in time to preserve a possible preference recovery (and exemption rights) under \u00a7\u00a7 522(g) and 547. Through that adversary proceeding, the Trustee contends that if counsel had filed the Debtors' bankruptcy petition in time, the Debtor could have exempted approximately $6,047.00 from a likely preference recovery against her judgment creditor, GFI, LLC, who garnished a deposit account at Portland Federal Credit Union. The Trustee alleges that because former counsel failed to file the bankruptcy petition within ninety days of the service of the creditor's garnishment writ, she negligently foreclosed the Debtor from exempting the $6,047.00 that the Trustee, or the Debtor, might have avoided under \u00a7 547 and recovered under \u00a7 550.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g-h), 547, and 550.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties to this exemption controversy agree that the Cause of Action qualifies as a prepetition asset to which the Trustee succeeded under \u00a7 541(a)(1) upon the commencement of the Debtor's case.\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.

Where the text is clear, the inquiry begins and ends there. Given the central role that \u00a7 522(g) plays in this dispute, the court begins with the text of the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (g) Notwithstanding sections 550 and 551 of this title, the debtor may exempt under subsection (b) of this section property that the trustee recovers under section 510(c)(2), 542, 543, 550, 551, or 553 of this title, to the extent that the debtor could have exempted such property under subsection (b) of this section if such property had not been\n   <em>\n    transferred\n   </em>\n   , if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1)(A) such\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   was not a voluntary\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   of such property by the debtor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (B) the debtor did not conceal such property; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) the debtor could have avoided such\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   under subsection (f)(1)(B) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphasis added). In his Objection, during the hearing, and again in the Post-Hearing Brief, the Trustee contended that the Debtor's former counsel concealed the Cause of Action allegedly transferred by the Debtor, but when pressed he was unable to identify what\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   the Debtor effected-the obvious focus of the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Last year, this court construed the text of \u00a7 522(g) and described its purpose as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In effect, \u00a7 522(g)\"provides a further opportunity for a debtor to claim an exemption in property that was not in the debtor's portfolio when the bankruptcy proceeding began\" if the transfer was involuntary and the property was not concealed by the debtor.\n   <em>\n    Stornawaye Financial Corp. v.

The court rejects the Trustee's narrow view of \u00a7 522(g) for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Most generally, as a remedial or \"rehabilitative statute,\" \u00a7 522 should be \"construed liberally.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6540092,1369806\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/640/888/\">\n    640 F.2d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 891 (7th Cir. 1981) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wengerd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180846\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/243/#p247\">\n    453 B.R. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247 (6th Cir. B.A.P. 2011) (construing Ohio exemption statute liberally in favor of exemption). Even without this maxim of statutory construction, the text of the statute does not support the Trustee's reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The opening line-\"[n]otwithstanding sections 550 and 551 of this title\"-is the reader's first signal that \u00a7 522(g) is designed to expand, not limit, a debtor's exemption rights. It reveals that the point of the provision is to relax the restrictions in the two cited statutes that would otherwise preclude a debtor from claiming property as exempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, by suspending \u00a7\u00a7 550 and 551, \u00a7 522(g) ensures that debtors may exempt property that is not initially available for exemption, either as a legal or practical matter, because title or control of the asset is initially outside the bankruptcy estate. In this way, the text of \u00a7 522(g) expands, rather than limits, exemption rights which, in general, are determined as of the petition date when the rights of the parties to a bankruptcy proceeding are usually fixed.\n   <em>\n    In re O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731059\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/443/117/#p130\">\n    443 B.R. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130-31 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Of course, the expanded exemption right is not unlimited: if the debtor took steps to put the property beyond the reach of the trustee by voluntarily transferring and concealing it, the debtor cannot benefit when the trustee later unwinds the transfer, using the avoidance and recovery powers under chapter 5. This should come as no surprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Trustee, however, seizes on the limiting language of \u00a7 522(g), arguing that the restrictions apply not just to property over which a trustee gains control using the chapter 5 powers, but to all property automatically included within the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(1). His argument invites the court to write out of the statute the references to \u00a7 550 and 551, and stands the text of \u00a7 522(g) on its head. He does this principally by identifying the transfer at issue as the transfer or conveyance that is said to occur by operation of law under \u00a7 541(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Hearing Brief at pp. 2-5. In addition to being at odds with\n   <em>\n    Mickens\n   </em>\n   and unsupported by any citation to case law, interpreting \u00a7 522(g) as a limitation on exempting any property included in the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(1) (not just recovered property) would render the exemptions under \u00a7 522(b) inapplicable in every bankruptcy proceeding. In addition to ignoring the opening proviso in \u00a7 522(g), the Trustee's argument proves too much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By identifying the transfer to which \u00a7 522(g) refers as the voluntary transfer of property into the estate automatically effected upon the filing of a petition, the Trustee ensures that no debtor in a voluntary case could ever satisfy \u00a7 522(g)(1), which authorizes exemptions only if the \"transfer was not a voluntary transfer\" of the property to be exempted. Indeed, in voluntary and involuntary cases alike, the Trustee's argument would preclude any exemptions, though for a slightly different\n   reason. This is because a debtor may claim an exemption under \u00a7 522(g) only \"to the extent that the debtor could have exempted such property under subsection (b) of this section if such property had not been transferred....\" But if the \"transfer\" is the transfer into the estate (as the Trustee argues), no debtor could ever satisfy this aspect of \u00a7 522(g) because debtors may only exempt property that is included within the estate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then only if the \"property had not been transferred\" into the estate in the first place (as \u00a7 522(g) requires the court to hypothesize). Consequently, whether the case is voluntary or involuntary, under the Trustee's interpretation, there would never be any eligible property within the estate for the debtor to exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Indeed, identifying the transfer as did the Trustee, and arguing that \u00a7 522(g) is a general limitation on all exemptions, would render the rest of the statute irrelevant: there would be no point in inquiring whether the transfer was voluntary or whether the debtor concealed it because if the transfer did not occur as \u00a7 522(g) requires us to pretend, the debtor could not have exempted the transferred property in any event. The Trustee's reading is tortured and leads to an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The more natural view of the statute, and the one the court adopts, is that the \"transfer\" referred to in \u00a7 522(g) is the prepetition transfer (either of title or possession) that made it necessary for the trustee to exercise the chapter 5 avoidance and recovery powers enumerated in the section and to reel the property back into the estate, not the transfer that occurs upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mickens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269497\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/797/#p803\">\n    575 B.R. at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In a further effort to squeeze the Debtor's exemption claim into \u00a7 522(g), the Post-Hearing Brief suggests that a trustee who sues on a state law cause of action is exercising the turnover power under \u00a7 542. The court, however, has doubts about this proposition as well, because it would transform an obviously non-core proceeding-a suit on a state law cause of action-into a core proceeding, and the Trustee has offered no authority for this proposition in his Post-Hearing Brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Just as the court will not permit a label that a litigant applies to his lawsuit to transform a non-core into a core proceeding, neither will it permit clever labeling to restrict the Debtor's exemption rights. Moreover, the policy that undergirds \u00a7 522(g)'s reference to \u00a7 542-preventing the unfairness of permitting a debtor who puts property beyond the trustee's reach to benefit from the trustee's efforts to recover the transferred and concealed property-is simply not implicated on the present record, where the parties both agree that the Cause of Action is automatically included within the estate. That the Trustee is attempting to transform the asset from an intangible, prepetition malpractice claim into cash does not change the fact that the estate already included the Cause of Action on the petition date. Moreover, the Trustee certainly cannot complain that he filed the adversary proceeding without knowing the Debtor might exempt the Cause of Action, because the parties discussed this possibility earlier this year when the Trustee was undertaking his pre-suit discovery against the Debtor's former counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Decision &amp; Order dated June 21, 2018 (ECF No. 32) at p. 4 (noting former counsel's argument that the Debtor could exempt the Cause of Action and deprive the Trustee of the benefit of a potential malpractice lawsuit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, although today's decision does not rest on rejecting the Trustee's allegations of concealment, the court is not persuaded that counsel's resistance to pre-suit discovery earlier this year amounts to concealment of the Cause of Action by the Debtor. Indeed, as Debtor's counsel argued during the hearing, former counsel may have concealed\n   <em>\n    documents\n   </em>\n   that would be useful to the Trustee in prosecuting the Cause of Action, but not the Cause of Action itself. The Cause of Action was obvious to this savvy trustee, probably as early as the first meeting of creditors, and it clearly prompted him to demand the documents. He was not on a fishing expedition, trolling for the unknown catch, but was seeking specific correspondence that he assumed existed and that would support the malpractice claim he clearly had in mind at the time of the turnover demand, and now. It is disingenuous to argue otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, under agency principles, it is far from clear that a principal is chargeable with the acts of an agent who acts for the agent's own interests, against the interests of her principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MCA Financial Corp. v. Grant Thornton, L.L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1396861\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/263/152/\">\n    263 Mich.App. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20N.W.2d%20850\">\n    687 N.W.2d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 857 (Mich. App. 2004) (discussing \"adverse interest\" exception to principal's vicarious liability for agent's acts when agent is acting solely in her own interest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In any event, the court need not decide whether the Debtor is chargeable with her former counsel's supposed \"concealment\" because the court has already rejected the Trustee's interpretation of \u00a7 522(g). Because the Debtor may exempt the Cause of Action under \u00a7 522(b) and (d)(5) without implicating \u00a7 522(g) in any way, the court will overrule the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, as the Trustee acknowledged on the record during the hearing, the court's ruling in favor of the Debtor's exemption renders the Cause of Action of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate under \u00a7 554, so the court will order the Trustee to abandon it to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Trustee's Objection (ECF No. 43) is OVERRULED and the Cause of Action is ABANDONED to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk shall serve a copy of this Memorandum of Decision &amp; Order pursuant to Fed.
