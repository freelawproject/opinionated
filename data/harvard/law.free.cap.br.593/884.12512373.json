FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 21, 2018, Trustee filed her Amended Complaint against Defendants, Cadwalader, Grant Thornton LLP (\"\n   <em>\n    GT\n   </em>\n   \"), and Greene Espel, PLLP (\"\n   <em>\n    GE\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively the \"\n   <em>\n    Defendants\n   </em>\n   \") relating to pre-petition professional services that Defendants provided to Debtors (\"\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \") [ECF No. 7]. As against all Defendants, the Trustee asserts a claim for aiding and abetting fraud on account of such pre-petition services. The Trustee also seeks an accounting and turnover of Debtors' property allegedly still in Defendants' hands. No other claims are asserted against Cadwalader. The allegations in the Complaint, summarized below, are assumed as true solely for purposes of the Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtors were part of a global Ponzi scheme that from 2010 to 2016 raised over $64 million in the United States and $150 million worldwide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 37. Antonio Buzaneli (\"\n   <em>\n    Buzaneli\n   </em>\n   \"), who has since pled guilty to thirteen counts of criminal misconduct, was the Chief Executive Officer (\"\n   <em>\n    CEO\n   </em>\n   \") of the Debtors, as well as the CEO of numerous affiliates of the Debtors in the United States, and throughout the world, including London, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai, Suzhou, Singapore, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Guernsey, Canada, Istanbul, Dubai, and Panama (collectively the \"\n   <em>\n    Providence Entities\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 31. The Providence Entities commingled funds and were operated without corporate formalities such that their independent identities were non-existent and they were merely alter egos of the Debtors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 97. The Providence Entities recruited investors to purchase promissory notes, the proceeds of which would be used to provide working capital in the form of intercompany loans to various businesses in Brazil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 49. The Brazilian companies would then use the intercompany loan proceeds to acquire receivables or other financial instruments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. In total, the Providence Entities promised annual returns of 12% to 13% to the investors through the investments in factoring accounts receivable in the Brazilian businesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 49. The investors' funds, however, were instead diverted to other uses, some being used to pay principal and interest payments to old investors (the \"\n   <em>\n    Fraud\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 31, 2016, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"\n   <em>\n    SEC\n   </em>\n   \") served several of the Providence Entities with an SEC Subpoena requesting various financial, accounting, and tax records, as well as documentation on the investor promissory notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. The SEC also requested a presentation addressing the details on the transactions involving the Providence Entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to the Subpoena, Providence Financial and non-Debtor Providence Entity Providence Global, Inc. (\"\n   <em>\n    Providence Global\n   </em>\n   \") engaged Cadwalader \"in connection with responding to civil subpoenas\n   issued to some of the Providence Entities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. On February 1, 2016, in order to document the engagement, Buzaneli, as Chief Executive Officer of Providence Financial and Providence Global, signed an engagement letter with Cadwalader (\"\n   <em>\n    Engagement Letter\n   </em>\n   \"). Motion at Ex. A. The Engagement Letter, in the section titled \"Resolution of Disputes - Mediation and Arbitration\" (\"\n   <em>\n    Arbitration Provision\n   </em>\n   \") provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"any dispute arising out of or relating to [Cadwalader's] rendering professional services to you or [Cadwalader's] fees, disbursements, and charges will first be submitted to private, non-binding mediation ....\" Engagement Letter at 5. \"If resolution through mediation is not achieved, any such dispute will be finally resolved by private, confidential binding arbitration ... [which] will be conducted in New York City ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Any issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation or enforceability of any of these procedures shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and resolved by the arbitrators.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, Buzaneli, on behalf of the Providence Entities, also engaged GE and GT, to respond to the Subpoena. Compl. at \u00b6 65. In that capacity, GT representatives interviewed Buzaneli and other officers of the Providence Entities regarding their use of investor funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trustee alleges that it was during that investigation that GT purportedly learned of the Fraud, and in late February 2016, shared its findings with GE and Cadwalader.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75, 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to the Engagement Letter, Cadwalader, together with GT and GE, prepared a PowerPoint presentation, as requested by the SEC, and on March 21, 2016, Cadwalader, GT, and GE made the presentation to representatives of the SEC in Chicago.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79, 82. The Trustee alleges that the Defendants \"took painstaking efforts to omit any references to fraud as they collaboratively refined the PowerPoint presentation\" and that because of such efforts, Buzaneli continued to solicit and enroll new investors, continued to transfer funds between the Providence Entities, and continued to utilize the funds for his personal use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80, 89;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two and half months later, on June 7, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, against the Debtors and other Providence Entities, alleging violation of various securities laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86. A month and a half after that filing, Debtors filed separate voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 7, title 11, United States Code, which cases are being jointly administered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 21, 2018, Trustee filed her Amended Complaint, which asserts the following claims against the Defendants, including Cadwalader: Count I for Aiding and Abetting Fraud (\"\n   <em>\n    Aiding and Abetting Claim\n   </em>\n   \"), Count VIII for Turnover (\"\n   <em>\n    Turnover Claim\n   </em>\n   \"), and Count IX for Equitable Accounting (\"\n   <em>\n    Accounting Claim\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively the \"\n   <em>\n    Cadwalader Claims\n   </em>\n   \"). Counts II through VII consist of fraudulent transfer counts asserted against only GE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In its Motion, Cadwalader argues that its Arbitration Provision specifically encompasses the Cadwalader Claims, as they are disputes \"arising out of or related to [Cadwalader's] rendering professional services to\" Providence Financial pursuant to the Engagement Letter and as such, are subject to binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"\n   <em>\n    FAA\n   </em>\n   \") and applicable law. Motion at \u00b6 3. Cadwalader also argues in response to the Trustee, that even though Providence Fund was not a signatory to the Engagement Letter, the\n   claims asserted by the Trustee on behalf of Providence Fund are arbitrable because Providence Fund's claims against Cadwalader are inextricably intertwined with Providence Financial's claims against Cadwalader. Reply at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Trustee opposes Cadwalader's Motion to Compel, arguing that the Arbitration Provision does not apply to the Cadwalader Claims because the Aiding and Abetting Claim is really a tort claim that has no relationship to the Engagement Letter. Response, ECF No. 22, at \u00a7 1. The Trustee also argues that there is an inherent conflict between arbitrating the Cadwalader Claims and the underlying purpose of the Bankruptcy Code because sending the Cadwalader Claims to arbitration, while retaining the claims against the remaining Defendants, would be inefficient, risk inconsistent results, and would be too costly to the Trustee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2. Lastly, the Trustee argues that the Court cannot order Providence Fund to arbitrate since it was not a signatory to the Engagement Letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16; Response to Motion to Clarify at 3-7. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In its analysis, the Eleventh Circuit confirmed that this judicial precedent mandated that the court recognize the parties' clear and unmistakable intent to refer gateway issues of arbitrability to an arbitrator - going so far as to quote \"comparable language [that] expressed a clear and\n   unmistakable intent to delegate questions of arbitrability in general.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 939. The \"comparable language\" is almost identical to the gateway provision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the present case, it is clear and unmistakable that Providence Financial and Cadwalader delegated the gateway determinations to the arbitrator (\"\n   <em>\n    Gateway Provision\n   </em>\n   \"). The Gateway Provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      [a]ny\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    issue concerning the extent to which\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      any\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    dispute is subject to arbitration, or concerning the applicability, interpretation or enforceability of any of these procedures\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      shall\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      resolved by the arbitrators\n     </em>\n     .\n    </strong>\n    \"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Engagement Letter at 5 (emphasis added). The parties not only agreed to arbitrate whether they agreed to arbitrate in the first place, but also whether the Arbitration Provision covers a certain controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Trustee argues that the Gateway Provision only addresses \"[a]ny issue concerning the extent to which ...\n   <em>\n    any dispute\n   </em>\n   is subject to arbitration...\" Transcript of Hearing, ECF No. 37, p. 12, ll. 22-24 (emphasis added). The term \"any dispute,\" the Trustee continues, must be read within the confines of the first paragraph of the Arbitration Provision, in which the parties agreed to arbitrate \"\n   <em>\n    any dispute arising out of or relating to [Cadwalader's] rendering professional services to [Providence Financial].\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13, ll. 1-7 (emphasis added). Thus, according to the Trustee, since the Cadwalader Claims do not fall under the description of \"any dispute arising out of or relating to [Cadwalader's] rendering of professional services to [Providence Financial],\" they are similarly not subject to the Gateway Provision. The Court disagrees. If the parties meant to include in the Gateway Provision only \"any dispute arising out of or relating to [Cadwalader's] rendering of professional services to [Providence Financial]\" they would have so stated. Instead, the parties included the term \"any dispute\" in the Gateway Provision, without any clarifying language to follow. The Court believes the unequivocal language of the Arbitration and Gateway Provisions allows the arbitrators to decide,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the Cadwalader Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Trustee also argues that because the Cadwalader Claims include a tort claim, they cannot be referred to arbitration. Response at \u00a7 1. The Trustee's argument is unpersuasive. The parties agreed to arbitrate \"any dispute\n   <em>\n    arising out of\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   [Cadwalader's] rendering professional services\" to Providence Financial. While the Trustee's Aiding and Abetting Claim may not arise out of the Engagement Letter, it most certainly is related to the Engagement Letter. Cadwalader was engaged to respond to the Subpoena on behalf of Providence Financial, including making a presentation to the SEC on behalf of Providence Financial relating to the Subpoena. Compl. at \u00a7 60-62. The Trustee's characterization that the presentation to the SEC and the preparation leading up to presentation somehow allegedly provided \"substantial assistance\" to the Fraud, does not negate or diminish the simple fact that Cadwalader was still \"rendering professional services\" to Providence Financial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Trustee cited case law to support the argument that an arbitration clause in a contract does not cover a dispute concerning a tort claim, but those cases do involve the type of \"gateway provision\" discussed herein.

If they made a bad deal, that's unfortunate ....\" Transcript of Hearing at p. 17, ll. 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Providence Fund Will Not Be Compelled to Arbitrate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Trustee in this case represents two related but distinctly separate bankruptcy estates, whose cases are being jointly administered, but are not substantively consolidated. The claims by the Trustee are asserted on behalf of each debtor's estate, for the benefit of the creditors of each respective estate. The Trustee argues that regardless of whether the Court orders Providence Financial to arbitrate the Cadwalader Claims, the Court cannot order Providence Fund, a non-signatory to the Engagement Letter, to arbitrate the Cadwalader Claims. Response at 15-16; Response to Motion to Clarify at 3-7. The Trustee relies on\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Life of the S. Ins.

Cadwalader cites principles of estoppel as a basis to require arbitration of claims involving nonparties to arbitration agreements, relying on\n   <em>\n    MS Dealer Serv. Corp. v.

U.S. Home Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474519\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/750/633/#p636\">\n    750 So.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (Fla. 1999). It is apparent from the record that the parties did not agree to arbitrate their claims. Cadwalader and Providence Fund could\n   have entered into an arbitration agreement, as Cadwalader did with Providence Financial, but they did not. Without such an agreement, the Court cannot conclude that the parties intended and agreed to arbitrate their claims. Thus, Providence Financial being the only signatory to the Engagement Letter containing the arbitration provision, only Providence Financial is compelled to arbitrate its claims against Cadwalader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Trustee's Claims, on Behalf of the Providence Financial Bankruptcy Estate, Against Cadwalader are Stayed, Pending Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Cadwalader further seeks a stay of this adversary proceeding, in its entirety, pending arbitration of the Trustee's claims against it in the Providence Financial case. Cadwalader cites the FAA to support its position.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees that the FAA provisions require the Trustee's claims against Cadwalader on behalf of the Providence Financial estate to be stayed, but the Court does not read the FAA provisions so expansively as to require a stay of the entire adversary case. Accordingly, the claims asserted by the Trustee on behalf of Providence Financial's estate against Cadwalader, which are subject to arbitration as stated herein, are stayed pending arbitration. However, all other claims by the Trustee on behalf of Providence Financial's estate against other third parties that are not subject to arbitration shall not be stayed. So too, all claims by the Trustee on behalf of the estate of Providence Fund against Cadwalader and/or other third parties are not stayed. It is therefor\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion to Compel is GRANTED IN PART as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   1. The Trustee shall initiate arbitration of all claims by and on behalf of the Providence Financial bankruptcy estate against Cadwalader, pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter, within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2. All claims and litigation with respect to the Trustee's claims on behalf of Providence Financial against Cadwalader in this adversary proceeding are STAYED pending the resolution of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   3. The Expedited Motion for Clarification is DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As noted in footnote 1 to the Motion, Cadwalader simultaneously filed an Expedited Motion to Stay the Adversary Proceeding Pending Adjudication of the Motion to Compel (\"\n    <em>\n     Motion to Stay\n    </em>\n    \") [ECF No. 11]. On September 11, 2018, the Court granted the Motion to Stay, but that parties have sought clarification with respect to the scope of the Court's ruling. On September 12, 2018, Cadwalader filed its Expedited Motion for Clarification of Ruling on the Motion to Stay (\"\n    <em>\n     Motion to Clarify\n    </em>\n    \") [ECF No. 25], Trustee filed her Response to the Motion to Clarify (\"\n    <em>\n     Response to Motion to Clarify\n    </em>\n    \") [ECF No. 26], and Cadwalader filed its Reply to the Response to Motion to Clarify (\"\n    <em>\n     Reply\n    </em>\n    \") [ECF No. 28].
