The homestead exemption is one of the most fundamental protections from creditors afforded to debtors. It has its roots in England at common law and it, along with other exemptions, serves both \"beneficent sociological and economic purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Dodge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10416707\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/685/260/#p263\">\n    685 P.2d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263 (Colo.

However, she passed away before her Chapter 7 case, a \"no asset\" case, was closed. Thus, if Ms. Irwin had not filed her motions to avoid the judicial liens, the case would have been closed and the real property would have been abandoned to the Debtor pursuant to Section 554(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Ms. Irwin as the Debtor's \"next-of-kin,\" moved to compel the Trustee to abandon the real property so she could sell it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the same time, Ms. Irwin filed her motions seeking to avoid the judicial liens of two judgment creditors against the real property to be sold. She as \"next-of-kin\" and Personal Representative of the Debtor's Probate Estate (the \"PR\"), not the Debtor, hopes to avail herself of the protections Congress granted to debtors in Section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She seeks to stand in the shoes of the Debtor, effectively to be substituted for the Debtor, in a contested matter which the Debtor had not commenced before she passed away. She endeavors to maximize the Debtor's homestead exemption for her benefit when she would not be afforded that right under Colorado Probate Law. As a policy matter, if this Court were to grant the request of the Debtor's \"next-of-kin,\" her entitlement to a homestead exemption, if any, would be elevated over the Debtor's creditors which hold liens on that residential real property. This Court cannot\n   interpret the Bankruptcy Code to effect such a result. The Court afforded Ms. Irwin the opportunity to submit legal authority which analyzes and construes the language of Section 522(f), particularly whether someone other than the \"debtor\" is permitted to bring a motion under that section. Despite that opportunity, Ms. Irwin has failed to provide persuasive legal authority to justify the Court interpreting the statute to have a meaning other than its plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Posture and Matters Pending Before the Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Documents Filed and the Court's Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The issue presented comes to the Court in the context of two motions to avoid judicial liens against the residential real property of the Debtor filed by the \"Estate of Noreen A. Boddy\" (the \"Probate Estate\"). On May 3, 2018, the Probate Estate filed a \"Motion to Avoid Judicial Lien\" of GE Money Bank (Docket No. 31, the \"GE Money Bank Motion\") and the \"Motion to Avoid Judicial Lien\" of LVNV Funding (Docket No. 34, the \"LVNV Motion\") (collectively, the \"Motions\"). In the Motions, the Probate Estate sought to avoid the judicial liens held by GE Money Bank and LVNV Funding, respectively, in real property \"of Estate of Debtor\" located at 2508 29\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Avenue, Greeley, CO 80634 (the \"Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court reviewed the Motions and, for various reasons more fully stated therein, issued its \"Order on Motions to Avoid Judicial Liens of GE Money Bank and LVNV Funding\" (Docket No. 47, the \"Order\"). The most pressing concern which this Court expressed in the Order and the question the Court directed to the Probate Estate was whether the Probate Estate was statutorily permitted to bring a motion to avoid a judicial lien pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 18, 2018, purportedly the Debtor, Noreen A.

P. 1016 provides no mechanism for substituting someone in the debtor's place \"with regard to normal administration of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Inyard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908385\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/532/364/\">\n    532 B.R. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Irwin argues that the language of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1016 is \"plain\" and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   does not contemplate much effort, if any, on behalf of a debtor after her death ... Likewise, the Rule's provision \"... the case may proceed and be concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as though the death or incompetency had not occurred\" requires no cooperation of the debtor, or trustee, in the context of avoiding a lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Response to Order, at 7. This Court understands Ms. Irwin's contention to be: Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1016 is unequivocal as to what happens in a liquidation case upon the death of the debtor - the case is not abated. There is a trustee appointed to conclude administration of a Chapter 7 case and the debtor's cooperation is not needed. Because the Debtor's cooperation is not needed to prosecute these Motions to Avoid Liens, Ms. Irwin asserts, the prosecution of the motions may proceed even though the Debtor is deceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The logic of Ms. Irwin's argument escapes the Court. But what does not escape the Court is that Ms. Irwin never satisfactorily addresses the question posed to her by the Court. Does Section 522(f) permit a non-debtor to bring a motion to avoid a judgment lien in a Chapter 7 case when the statute is explicit that the \"\n   <em>\n    debtor\n   </em>\n   may avoid the fixing of a lien of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled.\" On what basis may Ms. Irwin bring these contested matters, which the Debtor herself had not commenced before she died, matters not involving the administration of the estate?\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction and Venue\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court's jurisdiction to enter final judgment on the issues presented in this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is in doubt. If the Debtor was before the Court, it would be clear that the matters are core proceedings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B) (matters concerning exemptions from property of the estate) and (b)(2)(O) (other proceedings affecting the debtor-creditor relationship). Given that Ms. Irwin has sought to avail herself of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and purports to stand in the shoes of the Debtor, the Court has jurisdiction to enter final judgment. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201408\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The record in this case is the source of the facts which form the basis for this Opinion and Order and are undisputed. Debtor filed this Chapter 7 case on January 14, 2018. She attested that she resided at the Property, included it as a wholly owned asset on her Schedule A/B, and claimed a homestead exemption in the Property in the amount of $92,710.24 under C.R.S. \u00a7 38-41-201(1)(b). (Docket No. 1, 2, 17 and 23.) She further attested that she was not married, had no dependents and no codebtors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 8, 31 and 34.) At the time she filed her case, the Debtor was represented by an attorney, James L. Leerssen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\") was appointed and the Section 341 Meeting of Creditors was set (Docket No. 13). The case was initially designated a \"no asset\" case. The Trustee never recovered nor liquidated any non-exempt assets so the case's status as a \"no asset\" case never changed. Thus, no deadline was set to file proofs of claim in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the day after the Debtor filed her case, she filed two motions to avoid judicial liens (Docket Nos. 10 and 11). In one, the Debtor sought to avoid the judicial lien of Capitol One Bank (USA), N.A. (\"Capitol One\") against the Property. In the other, she moved to avoid the judicial lien of Discover Bank (\"Discover\") against the Property. Neither Capitol One nor Discover objected. Thus, on February 8, 2018 the Court entered orders avoiding the judicial liens of Capitol One and Discover against the Property. (Docket Nos. 20 and 21.) Debtor did not file any other motions to avoid judicial liens against the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   No objections were posed to the Debtor's claim of exemption in the Property and no objections to discharge or dischargeability of debts pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) were filed by the April 10, 2018 deadline. On February 10, 2018, the Debtor filed her Certificate of Debtor Education. (Docket No. 22.) On April 16, 2018, the Court entered the Debtor's discharge. (Docket No. 25, the \"Discharge.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the interim, on February 12, 2018, the Chapter 7 Trustee made a docket text entry. In that docket text entry she indicated that: (1) she had neither received any property nor paid any money; (2) after diligent investigation there were no non-exempt assets available for distribution; and (3) the estate had been fully administered. (Docket text on Feb.12, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 2, 2018, Ms. Irwin's counsel filed a Notice that the Debtor had died on March 31, 2018 (Docket No. 27, the \"Notice\"). Contemporaneously, Ms. Irwin filed three motions to avoid judicial liens. (Docket Nos. 28, 31, and 34.) Two of the motions are the pending GE Money Bank and LVNV Motions and the third was directed to Discover Bank (Docket No. 28). However, the judicial lien of Discover Bank against the Property was the subject of the Debtor's earlier motion and had been avoided. Thus, the Court issued a\n   separate order disposing of that motion. (Docket No. 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the GE Money Bank Motion and the LVNV Motion, Ms. Irwin identifies herself only as the Debtor's \"next-of-kin,\" not as niece, cousin, second cousin, daughter or otherwise. In the Response to Order she represents she was appointed as the Personal Representative (the \"PR\") of the Probate Estate after she filed her Motions. Nevertheless, the Court infers from that designation as \"next-of-kin\" and from the record in this case that Ms. Irwin is not a dependent, a surviving spouse, or a minor child of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Irwin is before this Court requesting pursuant to Section 522(f) to avoid the judicial liens against the Property. Ms. Irwin argues that the judicial liens of GE Money Bank and LVNV impair the Debtor's homestead exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Legal Discussion.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Section 522(f)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 522(f) permits the \"debtor to avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled...\".

For example, only the \"debtor\" who is a \"person\" as defined in Section 101(41) may file a case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"The definition (of person in Section 101(41) does not include an estate or a trust, which are included only in the definition of 'entity' in proposed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14).\" H.R.

But, the same rule offers courts dealing with the death of a debtor in a Chapter 13 reorganization little guidance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Chapter 13 is an altogether different process in which the debtor plays a central and ongoing role, from the filing of the petition through discharge some three to five years later. So, the last sentence of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1016 (governing Chapter 13 cases) operates differently than the first two sentences of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1016. In Chapter 13:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ...\n   <em>\n    the case may be dismissed; or if further administration is possible and in the best interest of the parties\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    the case may proceed\n   </em>\n   and be concluded in the same manner, so far as possible, as though the death or incompetency had not occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (emphasis added.) Thus, unlike a Chapter 7 liquidation, in a Chapter 13 debt adjustment case there are two options upon the death of the debtor: (1) the case may be dismissed; or (2) the case may proceed. And the case may proceed\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if \"further administration is possible\" and continuing the case \"is in the best interests of the parties.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Given the structure of the Chapter 13 process, it should not be surprising that the normal default presumption upon death is dismissal. In fact, the Advisory Committee Note accompanying the text of Fed. R. Bankr.

R. Bankr. P. 1016 Advisory Committee Note (1983) (emphasis added). However, ultimately the decision is discretionary with the bankruptcy court. In making the determination, the bankruptcy court should consider whether \"further administration is possible;\" however, the meaning of that phrase is not spelled out either in the Bankruptcy Code or in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. In any event, if \"further administration is possible,\" then it would be necessary to assess the \"best interests of the parties.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343533\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/555/754/#p759\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343533\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/555/754/#p759\">\n    at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Given that a Chapter 7 debtor is not needed for the \"administration\" and \"conclusion\" of Chapter 7 case, Fed.

As a result, courts are called upon to exercise their discretion to determine the fate of a Chapter 13 case following the debtor's death. Because of that inherent distinction and the integral role a Chapter 13 debtor plays in the administration of the Chapter 13\n   case, the case law addressing the impact of a debtor's death on the viability of a Chapter 13 case, including the debtor's entitlement to a discharge or hardship discharge, both of which are tied intrinsically to the extent to which the debtor completed payments under the plan, is neither applicable nor useful in the context of a Chapter 7 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Interplay Between Section 522(f) and Fed.

Furthermore, the prosecution of such motions is dictated by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(d) which requires that such motions be prosecuted in the manner prescribed by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014, making them contested matters. In a contested matter, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7025 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 25 determines how and whether a successor may be substituted for a deceased debtor. Fed. R.

The Trustee did not administer the Property and the Trustee will close the case as a \"no asset\" case in due course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, the Debtor's entitlement to her discharge is not at issue.

The creditors of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate whose debts have been discharged as personal liabilities of the Debtor will not have claims against the probate estate. Those creditors include both GE Money Bank and LVNV Funding. However, to\n   the extent both creditors hold liens against the Property which have not been avoided pursuant to Section 522(f), they retain their liens.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The result here is that the exempt amount of the Property when sold by Ms. Irwin, will be subject to the judgment liens of GE Money Bank and LVNV Funding. Such a result is consistent with Ms. Irwin's right to the exemption under Colorado Probate Law as \"next-of-kin.\" As noted above, the Colorado legislature has limited the benefit of a homestead exemption to the debtor's surviving spouse and minor children. If the debtor leaves neither a surviving spouse nor minor children, the exemption is available to satisfy the debtor's creditors.

The statute explicitly provides that the \"debtor\" may avoid the fixing of a lien against exempt property and she has submitted no legal authority to conclude otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Furthermore, Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1016 is not applicable to absolve her of a need to substitute for the Debtor. Because the Motions are contested matters, if the Debtor had filed these Motions prior to her death, Ms. Irwin\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have been able to be substituted as a \"party\" under Fed.

This Advisory Committee note, however, suggests that the change is purely stylistic to incorporate the ability of the debtor to seek avoidance under Section 522(f) both in a motion and in a Chapter 12 or 13 plan.

The same type of thing happens in litigation. When a plaintiff dies its cause of action against a defendant is no longer extinguished but passes to another, whether to its estate or its heirs. That successor becomes the new owner of the claim and is entitled to prosecute it in their own right, on their own behalf... Unlike a claim which can survive a plaintiff's death or even be sold by the plaintiff, the opportunity to seek bankruptcy and the discharge which results from it are personal to the debtor. Furthermore, a debtor's heirs do not become liable for the debtor's obligations simply because the debtor has died. Consequently, after a debtor's death there is no one who owns or succeeds to the debtor's opportunity to obtain a bankruptcy discharge.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <em>\n     In re Shepherd\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175544\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/490/338/#p340\">\n     490 B.R. 338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 340-41 (Bankr.
