INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The matter before the Court is the Motion of RREF II Kenmore Lessor II, LLC (\"RREF\") for Relief from Stay to Proceed with Summary Process Eviction (the \"Stay Relief Motion\"). RREF, a Massachusetts limited liability company and an affiliate of Related Beal, supported its Stay Relief Motion with the Affidavit of Will Grosvenor, a Director and General Manager for Related Beal, a real estate development and management company, which, through affiliated companies, owns commercial real estate throughout the region, including 648 Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts where Boston Language Institute, Inc. (the \"Debtor\") operates its business as a tenant under a written Lease for premises, defined as \"[t]he entire third (3rd) floor\" of \"One Kenmore Centre, 642-648 Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts (the 'Building').\" It seeks relief from the automatic stay pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) and (d)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court heard the Stay Relief Motion on August 17, 2018. At that time, the Court deemed the Stay Relief Motion and the Debtor's Opposition a contested matter under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014 to which the adversary rules apply, and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for September 20, 2018. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing held on September 20, 2018, the Court directed the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and rulings of law. In addition, RREF stated on the record that it waived its rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The issue presented by the Stay Relief Motion is whether RREF has established that it, in fact, intends to \"substantially rehabilitate all or any substantial portion\n   of the Building (two or more floors)\" containing the Debtor's leased premises pursuant to a \"Notice of Termination of Lease and Tenant's Right to Possession\" dated June 28, 2017, 2017. In its Stay Relief Motion, it stated that it had determined \"to renovate the premises and building, specifically, the First, Second, and Third Floors,\" although it also stated that \"[i]t has been planned that space on the Third Floor [occupied by the Debtor] will house a site construction and sales office for premises owned by Related Beal or its affiliates.\" The Debtor, in its Opposition, denied that RREF is planning \"substantial rehabilitation\" referencing the records of the Boston Redevelopment Authority in which RREF and Related Beal represented that they planned \"modest modifications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon consideration of the evidence presented and the submissions of the parties, the Court now makes its findings of fact and conclusions of the law pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor commenced a Chapter 11 case on June 29, 2018. On July 19, 2018, it filed its schedules of assets and liabilities, and Statement of Financial Affairs. On Schedule A/B: Assets - Real and Personal Property, it listed a leasehold interest at 348 [sic] Beacon Street, Boston, MA, disclosing that the leasehold contained approximately 7,745 square feet of space and that the Lease expires December 31, 2020. The Debtor indicated that the value of the Lease was \"Unknown.\" On Schedule E/F, it listed Trustees of Boston University (\"Boston University\") as the holder of a claim in the sum of $13,535. The Debtor did not list Boston University or RREF on Schedule G: Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 10, 2018, the Debtor filed an Emergency Motion to Extend Time to Assume or Reject Lease of Non-Residential Real Estate. On October 12, 2018, the Court entered the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon consideration of the RREF II Kenmore Lessor II, LLC's Motion for Relief from Stay to Proceed with Summary Process Eviction, which motion is under advisement following an evidentiary hearing, the Court hereby overrules RREF II Kenmore Lessor II, LLC's Objection to the Emergency Motion and grants the Debtor's Emergency Motion in part. The Court extends the time within which the Debtor may assume or reject its lease with RREF II Kenmore Lessor II, LLC's until December 21, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   RREF and the Debtor are parties to a written Lease which Lease originally was between One Kenmore Centre Limited Partnership (\"One Kenmore\") as Landlord and the Debtor as Tenant for premises at the One Kenmore Centre located at 642-648 Beacon Street, Boston (the \"Premises\"). The Building at 642-648 Beacon Street contains six floors and the Debtor's Premises includes the entire third floor as well as \"adjacent sidewalks ... together with the right to use in common, with others entitled thereto, the hallways, stairways, and elevators, necessary for access to the Premises.\" The ground floor of the Building contains three entrances, one at 648 Beacon Street which is used primarily for offices located on the second through sixth floors, as well as for Back Bay Publishing, and the two other separate entrances, one for the former Bruegger's Bagels space and the other for the former Amsterdam Falafelshop space at 646 and 642 Beacon Street, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 13, 2007, One Kenmore's successor and RREF's predecessor-in interest, Trustees of Boston University\n   (\"Boston University\"), and the Debtor entered into a First Amendment to Commercial Lease. The First Amendment to Commercial Lease provided in paragraph 3 the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    LANDLORD'S TERMINATION OPTION\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Lease to the contrary, if Landlord determines\n   <em>\n    to demolish or substantially rehabilitate all or any substantial portion of the Building (two or more floors),\n   </em>\n   Landlord may elect to terminate the Lease as of any date by giving Tenant written notice of such election no later than twelve (12) months before the effective date of such termination, which shall be specified in Landlord's notice.

On May 5, 2009, Boston University and the Debtor entered into a Second Amendment to Commercial Lease. On December 26, 2012, Boston University and the Debtor entered into a Third Amendment to Commercial Lease. On October 30, 2015, Boston University and the Debtor entered into a Fourth Amendment to Commercial Lease, which provided: \"The Term of the Lease is hereby extended for an additional five (5) year term commencing January 1, 2016 and expiring December 31, 2020 ('Third Extension Term'). Tenant has no further option to extend the Lease.\" In addition, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to Commercial Lease, \"Landlord and Tenant ... explicitly acknowledge[d] that the termination options of Landlord and Tenant in the First Amendment to Commercial Lease remain in effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By virtue of written assignments of Lessor's interest in the Lease, RREF is successor-in-interest to Landlord's interest in the Lease for the Premises, which are currently occupied by the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   RREF and 642 Beaconaf, LLC d/b/a the Amsterdam Falafelshop were parties to a lease dated April 1, 2014, demising approximately 2,010 square feet of space located at 642-648 Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts. On February 10, 2017, RREF and 642 Beaconaf, LLC entered into a Lease Termination Agreement with the lease termination effective on the date of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 22, 2017, RREF, through counsel, sent a Notice to Quit to Back Bay Publishing in which it stated: \"notice is hereby given to you of the termination of your tenancy as a month-to-month Tenant-At-Will [for premises at 648 Beacon Street] and you are requested to surrender, deliver up, and quit the Premises no later than June 30, 2017, as the expiration of that month of your tenancy which shall begin next after this date.

According to Roux, ACBM were found in 9? x 9? floor tiles and associated black mastic adhesive throughout the third floor. In addition, other hazardous materials were present, including LBP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At trial two witnesses testified, Alexander Provost (\"Mr. Provost\"), an employee of Related Beal overseeing the development of the nine-building portfolio Related Beal acquired from Boston University in October of 2016 for $14.4 M, and Siri Karm Singh Khalsa (\"Mr. Khalsa\"), the President of the Debtor. Mr. Provost testified about Related Beal's development plans, stating that it intended to demolish six of the nine buildings it acquired from Boston University (i.e., 650, 652-654, and 656 Beacon Street, and 553, 535-539, and 541 Commonwealth Avenue). Mr. Provost described 648 Beacon Street as a six-story building with approximately 48,000 square feet that was built between 1940 and 1960. He indicated that it was originally built as a car dealership and thus contains structural steel components. Mr. Provost testified that the Building was \"quite dated,\" adding that the exterior stone needs to be repointed and the windows need to be replaced. He also testified that interior was outdated and that asbestos and PCBs were present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to Mr. Provost, when Related Beal purchased the Building, Boston University was the primary tenant, occupying floors 2, 4, 5, and 6 and that it executed a short term lease with Boston University for that space as the existing lease had just recently expired. With respect to the remaining floors, Mr. Provost testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   On the third floor was The Boston Language Institute. They [sic] occupied the entirety of the third floor. And then moving down to the first floor really broken up into four different spaces, one being the main office lobby to access the second through sixth floor, as well as two retail spaces, one belonging to Bruegger's Bagels and one belonging to the Amsterdam Falafelshop. And then in the back of the building was the Boston University student newspaper, The Daily Free Press, on the first floor, so a total of five tenants, but, you know, while there were different institutions within BU, BU was the lessee of the space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   According to Mr. Provost, Bruegger's Bagels and the Falafelshop have vacated the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Provost described the plans for 648 Beacon Street as involving \"the fit-out or build-out of our construction office, which we will be using during the portion of time that we will be building new components next door.\" He added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   We will also be building a marketing suite in order to provide flexibility during that time. We are also build -- demolishing some significant portion of the first floor to bring the retail portions of the building back to where\n   <em>\n    The Daily Free Press\n   </em>\n   were [sic] as well as extending the lobby substantially and refinishing the lobby, the elevator cabs, and all of the common corridors up through the building which have been, you know, the same since the '70s or '80s to kind of bring it up to more of a 21st Century office space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Provost testified that PCA, the architectural firm engaged by Related Beal, was to explore \"re-subdivision\" of the ground floor for retail purposes and the second floor for a potential office tenant moving from one of the buildings that is\n   being demolished.\" With respect to the third floor, he testified that PCA was to going to look at it \"to create a marketing suite for Related Beal's purposes.\" According to Mr. Provost, PCA has produced design and construction documents and submitted invoices to Related Beal. Mr. Provost also indicated that Related Beal had engaged a mechanical engineer for the installation of new plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems. In addition, Related Beal has engaged Roux to investigate the presence of hazardous materials and to plan for any remediation, as well as a general contractor, Corderman &amp; Company. He disclosed that Roux, as noted in its August 9, 2018 letter, discovered the presence of asbestos in the mastic, the adhesive used to lay carpet or linoleum tiles, as well as PCBs and lead-based paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mr. Provost testified about the effect of the continued presence of the Boston Language Institute on the premises as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   to our understanding the tenant has several students who come through the building all day long. We do have a lot of work going on within the common spaces of the building that they would use to access elevators, access the lobby, access their specific tenant space. However, there also is a large amount of demolition that will be happening, not only on the tenants' floor but also below and, you know, really our first step would be going in and removing a lot of those hazardous materials that would need to be removed before we would realistically allow another tenant to come into the building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mr. Provost also testified about the January 26, 2018 letter from Related Beal to the Boston Redevelopment Authority in which it described the Proposed Project as involving \"modest modifications to Buildings 1 and 9 to provide improvement to the streetscape as well as interior improvements to the office and commercial retail/restaurant space.\" He stated: \"the word 'modest' or 'modest modifications' was merely to let the public understand that that is not - you know, it is modest in comparison to a demolition and new construction for -- you know, to 60 to 80 million-dollar buildings next door.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   With respect to the lease with JVPT, Mr. Provost explained that that entity leased space in two of the buildings that Related Beal intends to demolish. He further explained that Related Beal was \"trying to accommodate them at one of the other buildings that will not be coming down, but that they can continue to occupy space within their building until the building comes down and then hopefully transition them over to one of the buildings that is not being demolished.\" He added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The way it's structured is that they would not be paying rent for six months in order to leave them six months to fit out the project, which kind of coordinates with our construction or at least our proposed plan to begin work within the building. So the way we worked it out with them was our contractor would likely be doing all of the other work on the third floor, first floor and the common spaces on all the floors, but also their subdivision and tenant fit-out on the second floor during that same period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Mr. Provost concludes that the Notice of Termination sent to the Debtor on June 28, 2017 was based on a good-faith determination that substantial rehabilitation would occur in the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On cross-examination, counsel to the Debtor asked Mr. Provost how he could reconcile the \"substantial rehabilitation\" referenced in the June 28, 2017 Notice of Termination of Lease and Tenant's Right to Possession with the January 26, 2018 letter to the Boston Redevelopment Authority\n   in which Related Beal referenced \"modest modifications\" to 648 Beacon Street, as well as the project description employed by PCA for Building 9 which was prepared in March of 2018 and referenced \"no alterations or updates to existing tenant spaces.\" He responded: \"That is a component of substantial renovation.\" Mr. Provost was asked whether those descriptions were intended to appeal to neighborhood entities that were concerned about a major demolition project. Mr. Provost stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   This was to differentiate the review process for the Buildings 2 through 8 versus Buildings 1 through 9 [sic]. When we say \"modest\" it is due to a threshold which triggers that review process. You know, we currently plan to spend five million dollars within Building 1 [sic], which we believe is a substantial renovation as well. However, it does not trigger an entitlement permitting process like the buildings when they are coming down and you are spending much more than the building value on a new -- the new construction of those buildings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On cross-examination, counsel to the Debtor also asked Mr. Provost whether the Notice of Termination of Lease was a pretext to avoid an unfavorable lease because the Debtor's base rent per square foot was $25 while the base rent in the lease contemplated with JVPT was $53 per square foot. Mr. Provost admitted that there was a substantial increase in the rental obligations under the new lease, but, nevertheless, testified that there would be substantial rehabilitation of the lobby space and the entire building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Mr. Provost also admitted that Related Beal was in discussions with an entity planning to open a restaurant known as Cornwall's on the first floor of 642-648 Beacon Street. The restaurant would have its own separate entrance between the existing lobby entrance and common areas affording access to the six floor offices, including the Debtor's third floor space, and new retail space which also would have separate access. Mr. Provost admitted that the planned demolitions had nothing to do with the plans for 648 Beacon Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Mr. Khalsa testified that the Debtor has been in business for 21 years. Occupying 7,745 square feet of space on the third floor of 648 Beacon Street, it provides foreign language instruction to approximately 175 people per day, as well as translation services in many languages. He testified that the Debtor was \"part of the lifeblood of the Kenmore Square.\" Nevertheless, he admitted that the Debtor's business suffered a downturn in 2017 owing to dramatically increased competition. Mr. Khalsa indicated that, as a consequence, he caused the Debtor to take out some merchant lender loans with onerous terms, resulting in some rent arrears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mr. Khalsa testified that the Debtor has had the same Lease, subject to amendments, since 1997 when it executed the Lease with One Kenmore Centre Limited Partnership. Mr. Khalsa explained that Boston University became the Debtor's Landlord prior to the execution of the First Amendment to Commercial Lease and that, as president of the Debtor, he had a cordial relationship with Boston University. Moreover, Boston University affiliated entities occupied several floors of the building, including its Department of Psychology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Mr. Khalsa testified that students utilize a separate entrance to the lobby to obtain access to elevators and the Debtor's facilities on the third floor, and anyone entering the restaurant spaces formerly occupied by Bruegger's Bagels and the Falafelshop had to use separate entrances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Khalsa further testified about his view of the genesis of the Lease Termination provision set forth in paragraph 3 of the First Amendment to Commercial Lease, specifically, the meaning of \"substantially rehabilitate all or any substantial portion of the Building (two or more floors).\" He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [T]he words we used in the conversation were gut two complete floors in the building minimally before -- that they had determined to do that before they had the -- they could issue a 12-month notice.... There was concern that the psychology department wanted our space to demand. And so it was written so that they couldn't do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Khalsa also testified that the lobby was not considered one of the floors as \"[i]t's a long empty hallway leading to the elevators with some rooms at the back\" and that [i]t was always Floors 2 to 6 that we were talking about.\" He added that Bruegger's Bagels and the Falafelshop were not considered to be located on one of the floors subject to paragraph 3, stating \"[i]t never entered into our minds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Mr. Khalsa further testified that he had discussions regarding the Lease with representatives of RREF in which he learned that the Landlord was contemplating $65 per square foot for base rent. In addition, he confirmed that he was aware of a lease for the second floor with a base rent obligation of $53 per square foot. Accordingly, he testified that he considered the Debtor's leasehold interest to be \"a very important asset\" that also would be important for its plan of reorganization. Mr. Khalsa elaborated, testifying that the Debtor was in discussions with a potential investor from China, as well as with various lenders. He also testified that he was prepared to sell the Debtor's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Mr. Khalsa opined that a build-out of the other floors could be accomplished without \"aggravating\" the Debtor's clients, teachers, and other employees or visitors. He conceded, however, that he lacked knowledge about the removal of hazardous materials. In addition, he acknowledged that the Debtor was searching for alternative rental space within which to operate and had a potential agreement to move to 540 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, a location across the street from its existing location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Provost, in rebuttal, examined architectural plans prepared by PCA, including demolition plans for the first floor. Mr. Provost admitted that the existing plans provided for gutting only the third floor, although other floors would be gutted in the future. Moreover, he acknowledged that Related Beal wished to occupy the third floor and that floors 2 and 4-6 are to receive only cosmetic improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    III. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    RREF\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   RREF maintains that it has hired consultants and taken measures to cause the building to be vacant for purposes of preparing for substantial rehabilitation. It points to 1) a Lease Termination Agreement with 642 Beaconaf, LLC, which occupied a portion of the first floor, space that is now vacant; 2) a Notice to Quit directed to Back Bay Publishing which occupied a small portion of the first floor which is now vacant; and 3) a Notice of Termination sent to Bruegger's Enterprises, Inc., resulting in a vacancy of the first floor space it occupied. It adds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The rehabilitation of the 648 Beacon Street Building will be extensive and substantial. Mr. Provost testified that the work proposed for the floors in the Building is budgeted initially at $3.5 million dollars, with a likely $4 to $5 million \"down the road.\" The rehabilitation includes\n   but is not limited to a reconfiguration of the ground floor which includes a reconfiguration of the lobby area and total refinishing of that space including signage, lighting, wall, and floor treatments. Adjacent to the lobby a ground floor retail tenant plans to expand and fully renovate its space. All new work will need to comply with the building code for new construction. This work will involve a high level of coordination with existing elements and systems and will be a substantial undertaking within the existing building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   RREF contends floors 2 through 6 will be improved with upgraded common corridors, restrooms, and elevators, as well as removal and replacement of floors, walls, and ceiling treatments with attention to hazardous materials that are present in the building. With respect to the third floor, it references a \"a comprehensive 'gut' renovation of the tenant space,\" with new walls, doors, lights, HVAC and other interior fit-out accommodations. RREF recognizes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The interior renovations to 648 Beacon Street are an important component of the overall Project. Compared to the demolition or exterior renovation of other buildings in the project as a whole (which renovations are currently being reviewed by the Boston Planning Department as a \"large project\" under Article 80 of the Boston Zoning Code), the rehabilitation of 648 Beacon Street is more modest (as referenced in Related Beal's January 26, 2018 letter to the Boston Planning &amp; Redevelopment Agency) ... but the work being planned and implemented is nevertheless and clearly substantial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   RREF in support of its Lift Stay Motion references evidence of expenses it has incurred, proposals it has received for architectural works, environmental studies, and hazardous material surveys. In particular, it cites the Roux proposal and the PCA construction documents. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The Plans contemplate substantial rehabilitation of the first and third floors, as well as substantial rehabilitation of other floors including for work to be performed involving but not limited to the remediation of hazardous materials at the Building's floors. Among the work items for the first floor alone, for example, are the removal of an \"entire wall from floor to underside of deck,\" another partial wall, the existing ceiling, an entire storefront system; and demolition of wall finish/wallboard\" ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   With respect to Roux's Building Materials Inspection, RREF emphasizes the presence of ACBM in floor title, carpet mastic adhesive, window caulking, window glazing and elsewhere on all floors and that removal of those materials must precede renovation and demolition work. RREF also notes the presence of lead paint throughout the site and PCBs in window glazing compounds. RREF concludes that the building must be vacant to undertake the remediation work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With respect to the JVPT lease, it states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   RREF has had drafted [sic] an Office Lease Agreement with JVPT for potential occupancy of 3,750 square feet on the second floor of the Building \"SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION UPON FINALIZATION OF LAYOUT PLAN.\" (Emphasis in Draft Lease, 1.03.) ... The Term Commencement Date is the earlier of when Tenant first enters possession of the Premises for the regular conduct of its business or the Substantial Completion Date of the work set forth in Exhibit C to the proposed Lease.... The Rent Commencement Date is not until one-hundred\n   eighty days after the Term Commencement Date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   RREF also challenges the Debtor's evidence to its prospects of reorganization. It argues that the Debtor has failed to obtain permanent financing and that Mr. Khalsa's testimony about a potential investor reveals that the existence of such an investor is illusory. It contends that its failure to secure substitute premises or to secure financing undermine the Debtor's argument that a plan is likely to be successful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Barclays Bank PLC v.

This is therefore a multi-million dollar, substantial rehabilitation justifying the notice of termination provided to BLI [the Debtor] more than a year ago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   RREF also contends that the Debtor cannot show that a plan is likely to succeed and that the Lease is not necessary to an effective reorganization, particularly because it avers the Debtor can locate comparable rental space elsewhere, adding the Premises are not unique or irreplaceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Debtor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   According to the Debtor, RREF issued conflicting statements regarding the Debtor's Premises, noting the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   On January 26, 2018, RREF's affiliate Related Beal sent the Boston Redevelopment Authority a Letter of Intent filed in accordance with the Executive Order Relative to the Provision of Mitigation by Development Projects in Boston. That letter states that with respect to 648 Beacon Street, Boston, MA (\"Building 9\") its proposed project \"as currently envisioned includes: (1)\n   <em>\n    modest modifications\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) ... to provide improvement to the streetscape as well as interior improvements to the\n   office and commercial retail/restaurant spaces.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Debtor also points to PCA's architectural proposal in which it proposed to update finishes but proposed \"no alterations to the existing tenant spaces\" and \"no alterations or updates to the building exterior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In addition, the Debtor relies upon a value of $53 per square foot as the value of its lease hold interest based upon the JVPT Letter of Intent for the second floor, resulting in a value of $820,000 for 24 months. In addition, Mr. Khalsa testified that RREF offered to re-let the Premises to it for $55 per square foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Debtor argues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Notwithstanding RREF's purported Notice of Termination Letter of June 28, 2017 that it had determined that to \"to demolish or substantially rehabilitate all or any substantial portion of the Building (two or more floors), the evidence, both testimonially [sic] and in the stipulated facts shows that RREF made completely contradictory statements to the BRA on January 26, 2018 ... and the March 1, 2018 architectural proposal from PCA it had requested .... That architectural proposal, in particular clearly demonstrates that the Movant, as of the June 26, 2017 purported termination letter had NOT made the required determination in order to trigger the relevant clause of the lease. A reasonable inference is that RREF was engaged [in] an attempt [to] rid itself of an under-market lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Debtor further argues that RREF only introduced evidence of \"recent (post-petition) documentation to support its \"substantial rehabilitation\" contention, concluding that \"RREF had clearly not determined to substantially rehabilitate two or more floors as required under the termination clause of the First Amended Lease.\" Thus, the Debtor concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   The term \"substantial rehabilitation\" is defined in the termination option of the First Amended Lease as (two or more floors). The words otherwise should be interpreted in accordance with ordinary English language meanings. In addition to being contradicted by the term \"modest\" in the BRA letter and the minimal scope of work in the PCA proposal ..., since floors 2-6 are not contemplated to be rehabilitated, it is impossible for RREF to exercise the termination option, however defined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, the Debtor contends that Mr. Khalsa's testimony that the Lease is necessary for an effective reorganization was unrebutted. Accordingly, in its view, RREF's Motion must be denied pursuant to \u00a7 362(d)(2)(B) and that because the Debtor is paying post-petition rent at the contract rate, RREF's interest in the Lease is adequately protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Initially the balance favors the debtor in possession. But the burden of proof rapidly shifts in favor of secured creditors, requiring a heightened showing by the debtor of its chances for reorganization. Immediately after the case is filed, a debtor in possession opposing stay relief may offer a \"less strenuous\" showing of \"a reasonable possibility of successful reorganization within a reasonable time.\" During this stage, the debtor sustains the burden of proof by offering sufficient evidence that a successful reorganization within a reasonable time is \"plausible.\" The standard is low, requiring the debtor only to present evidence that is \"superficially worthy of belief\" that it is capable of producing a plan. The terms of the plan can be obscure and vague, as long as it is plausible that a successful reorganization may occur. The bankruptcy court's mandate is to balance the reasonableness of the delay borne by the secured creditors against the debtor's ability to formulate a plan. Immediately after the case is filed, if the debtor presents any evidence that a confirmable plan is plausible, the balance favors the debtor and the creditors are expected to wait while the debtor attempts to craft a plan.\n   <em>\n    Holly's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507399\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/140/643/#p700\">\n    140 B.R. at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    In re BB Island Capital, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349605\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/540/16/\">\n    540 B.R. at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Souza\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-13341,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%208441318\">\n    2012 WL 8441318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr.

The exhibits submitted at the evidentiary hearing and the testimony discussed above establish that both the first and third floors will undergo substantial rehabilitation.

Nevertheless, RREF's present position that it intends to gut the third floor occupied by the Debtor is a recent contrivance, particularly where it referenced \"modest modifications\" in the January 26, 2018 letter to the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the absence of alterations or updates to existing tenant spaces in PCA's March 1, 2018 proposal.

Applying that test here, the Court concludes that the Debtor would be greatly prejudice if it were required to defend an eviction proceeding during the very early stages of its reorganization and the hardship to the Debtor outweighs the hardship to the Landlord at this juncture\n   in the bankruptcy case. Moreover, the Court concludes that RREF has taken steps to implement its rehabilitation of 642-648 Beacon Street and has a probability of prevailing on its claim that the Notice of Lease Termination was valid.

The Debtor, at this stage of its case, has established that an effective reorganization is in prospect. Mr. Khalsa testified that he was exploring all options, including obtaining a new lease for premises across the street from 648 Beacon Street, obtaining an infusion of capital, or selling the business. The Debtor has been a debtor-in-possession for approximately four months. Within that time, it has engaged a certified public accountant and obtained Court authority to use cash collateral on an interim basis through January 15, 2019. Accordingly, under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Souza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%208441318\">\n    2012 WL 8441318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 ; and\n   <em>\n    In re Morton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204396719\">\n    2015 WL 4396719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4, the Court concludes it has established a likelihood of reorganization.

In other words, even accepting the Debtor's position that RREF's Notice of Lease Termination was a pretext for ridding itself of an unfavorable lease, the Debtor cannot occupy the third floor of 648 Beacons Street after the expiration of the stated term of its Lease unless it negotiates a new lease with RREF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Under all these circumstances, the Court concludes that RREF has not set forth a colorable claim to relief at this time. Because the Debtor is providing RREF with adequate protection and has demonstrated a commitment to an effective reorganization, the Court denies RREF's Stay Relief Motion without prejudice to renewal in the event the Debtor fails to file a plan of reorganization and disclosure statement on or before February 15, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
