INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The adversary proceeding pending before this Court was filed due to an unscrupulous attorney's theft of $2.4 million. This attorney has no moral compass whatsoever, and his perfidy has resulted in litigation among his former clients, friends, and various third parties who did not have the displeasure of knowing him. While he deservedly spends time behind bars-he has recently been sentenced to six years in prison for his illegal greed-the individuals and entities he deceived and cheated are left duking it out over who has a superior claim to the remaining proceeds that he stole but was prevented from spending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court conducted a multi-day trial in this adversary proceeding, and then took the matter under advisement. The Court now issues this Memorandum Opinion explaining\n   why it has decided to deny all relief requested by the plaintiff except for one of its claims against the dishonest attorney. Set forth below are this Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which this Court makes pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy Rule 7052. To the extent that any finding of fact is construed as a conclusion of law, it is adopted as such; and to the extent that any conclusion of law is construed as a finding of fact, it is adopted as such. The Court reserves the right to make additional findings and conclusions as it deems appropriate or as any of the parties may request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Relevant Pre-Bankruptcy Events Concerning TransWorld and Prins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1. Transworld is a leasing company headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, that leases a myriad of items, including automobiles, medical equipment, airplanes, bulldozers, and even a brewery. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 28:23-29:8]. Lenny Cash (\"\n   <em>\n    Mr. Cash\n   </em>\n   \") founded TransWorld in 1979. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:25-29:10]. Mr. Cash and Peggy Cash (\"\n   <em>\n    Ms. Cash\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Cashes\n   </em>\n   \") were married in 1996; shortly thereafter, Ms. Cash became the 100% shareholder of TransWorld. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:11-30:3]. Ms. Cash is presently the president of TransWorld. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:7-9]. TransWorld currently has 12 full-time employees, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:10-14]; at one point, TransWorld had as many as 30 employees, as well as an office in Dallas, Texas, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:15-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2. Prins, who was licensed to practice law in 1991,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was referred to the Cashes by a friend and client of the Cashes. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:8-12]. Prins began providing legal services to the Cashes and to TransWorld in approximately 1999. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 17:14-18, 33:16-23; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 93:5-13]. Aside from Prins representing the Cashes and TransWorld, Prins and his wife, Paula Prins (\"\n   <em>\n    Ms. Prins\n   </em>\n   \"), were personal friends of the Cashes. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 225:17-22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   3. In 2005 or 2006, a tax issue arose with certain of TransWorld's taxes due to the misdeeds of a TransWorld employee. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 31:8-32:16]. Eventually, a tax suit was commenced by the Bexar County Tax Assessor-Collector in Bexar County, Texas (the \"\n   <em>\n    Tax Assessor\n   </em>\n   \") and a default judgment against TransWorld was entered on December 21, 2006, in the amount of $230,853.66. [TransWorld's Ex. K; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 98:2-9]. On February 4, 2008, TransWorld wrote a check in the amount of $230,853.66 payable to the order of the IOLTA account of the Prins Law Firm (the \"\n   <em>\n    IOLTA\n   </em>\n   \")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at BBVA Compass Bank (\"\n   <em>\n    BBVA\n   </em>\n   \") for the past due taxes related to the tax suit commenced by the Tax Assessor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 16:25-17:4; Pl.'s Ex. 46, Ex. D; TransWorld's Ex. D]. At this time, Prins told Ms. Cash she needed to make the check payable to the IOLTA, and that he would then write a check to Linebarger,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Linebarger would then apply the money to the accounts for the county. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7,\n   2018, Trial Tr. 35:16-24]. Ms. Cash initially questioned why she could not make the check directly payable to Sylvia Romo (\"\n   <em>\n    Romo\n   </em>\n   \")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to Linebarger, instead of to the IOLTA, as it was \"kind of, you know, a long chain of everybody,\" [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:20-36:6], and Prins replied that this was the way things were done in order for the Tax Assessor to avoid receiving a bad check from the taxpayer, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:6-8]. In reliance upon Prins' advice, Ms. Cash thus wrote the check payable to the order of the IOLTA instead of to the Tax Assessor directly because she believed \"that's the way things are done.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:11-13]. Prins subsequently told the Cashes that TransWorld's debt to the Tax Assessor had been paid and was resolved. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 16:25-17:8; TransWorld's Ex. D, Prins Dep. 116:17-117:5, 118:2-5]. At his deposition, Prins asserted that he did in fact pay these monies to the Tax Assessor, [TransWorld's Ex. D, Prins Dep. 98:12-19, 99:1-19, 117:1-8], but TransWorld is currently in a half million dollar lawsuit with the Tax Assessor over the payment of these monies, interest, and legal fees,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 13:23-14:4, 23:20-24:15, 36:14-37:1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   4. In 2011, Mr. Cash was diagnosed with cancer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:9-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   5. Sometime around the beginning of January 2014, Ms. Cash was reviewing TransWorld's 2014 tax statement regarding its 2013 taxes when she learned that TransWorld owed delinquent taxes in the amount of $496,198.52.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 19:7-12; TransWorld's Ex. U at 2]. Ms. Cash contacted Prins regarding the 2014 tax statement from the Tax Assessor, as she believed that TransWorld did not owe any taxes and had already settled the matter back in 2008 when it gave Prins $230,853.66 to pay to the Tax Assessor. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 19:7-15]. Prins assured Ms. Cash that TransWorld did not owe any taxes, that everything had been settled and paid previously, and that Prins would \"take care of it.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:7-15]. Ms. Cash did not hear anything else about this tax dispute issue until a TransWorld customer called her in 2016 to let her know that TransWorld was on a delinquent tax list in a newspaper article. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:15-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   6. At his deposition, Prins testified that in late 2015 or early 2016, he, as the attorney for TransWorld, was negotiating with the Tax Assessor over monies allegedly owed by TransWorld. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 77:2-7]. In addition to the amounts allegedly in dispute, Prins testified that the Tax Assessor stated that there were also monies due that were not in dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:2-7]. Thus, in January 2016-without TransWorld's (i.e., the Cashes') knowledge or permission-Prins claims that he paid the Tax Assessor approximately $143,000.00 for TransWorld's alleged tax obligations that were not in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 18:19-19:1; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 77:17-25, 83:19-23, 223:13-21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   7. At or around this point in time (i.e., late 2015 to early 2016), Mr. Cash was suffering from terminal cancer. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 11:17-22, 17:9-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   8. In January of 2016, Ms. Cash learned from a TransWorld customer that TransWorld was listed on a delinquent tax list for Bexar County, Texas, in a local newspaper article. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:23-18:2, 19:15-17, 38:7-17]. The Cashes contacted Prins about TransWorld's taxes being listed as delinquent, as the Cashes believed that TransWorld had paid all delinquencies and the matter had been settled back in 2008. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:18-20]. In response, Prins told the Cashes that the Tax Assessor had likely \"misapplied\" the $230,853.66 that TransWorld had paid to the IOLTA in 2008 (and that Prins was then to have paid to the Tax Assessor on TransWorld's behalf) and that the Tax Assessor needed to research the issue and straighten out its records.\n   <em>\n    [Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:21-25, 37:14-25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   9. Even though Prins allegedly paid approximately $143,000.00 to the Tax Assessor in January 2016 (without the Cashes' knowledge or consent), in approximately April 2016, he told the Cashes that the Tax Assessor wanted TransWorld to deposit into his IOLTA a percentage of the taxes it owed as \"good faith\" money in the amount of $169,807.29 while he and the Tax Assessor worked out the disputed tax issues. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 19:21-20:1; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 78:2-10, 78:19-25]. To convince TransWorld to place the $169,807.29 into his IOLTA, Prins created a false letter dated April 6, 2016, from Linebarger (using this law firm's letterhead), stating that TransWorld owed delinquent taxes in the amount of $169,807.29. [Pl.'s Ex. 46, Ex. A; TransWorld's Ex. A; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 93:23-95:4, 114:3-13, 223:22-224:5]. Ms. Cash questioned Prins as to why she needed to put the disputed money into the IOLTA, as she did not believe that TransWorld owed any taxes. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 20:2-11]. Prins told Ms. Cash that it was \"just a formality,\" and then Ms. Cash questioned whether she could obtain a bond, instead of placing the alleged disputed money into the IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:3-6]. Prins told Ms. Cash that she could procure a bond, but that she would have to put down 125% of the money that was in dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:7-8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10. Based on the representations from Prins that TransWorld needed to deposit a percentage of the taxes in dispute as \"good faith\" money to be held in the IOLTA so\n   that TransWorld's tax issues could be resolved-and not wanting to post a bond, as Ms. Cash did not want to put down 125% of the disputed amount-on May 17, 2016, TransWorld (i.e., Ms. Cash as its president) \"reluctantly\" delivered a check in the amount of $169,807.29 to Prins for deposit into the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 19:16-20:14; Pl.'s Ex. 12; TransWorld's Ex. G].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Relevant Pre-Bankruptcy Events Concerning United Sentry, MacKenzie, the Debtor, Amos, and Prins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   11. On June 16, 2015, Triple Gate, in order to obtain financing from United Sentry, executed that one certain promissory note in the original principal amount of $1,537,500.00 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Note\n   </em>\n   \"). [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 46:10-47:4; Pl.'s Ex. 13]. Triple Gate (through its authorized representatives, the Debtor and Amos) executed the Note to obtain financing for its purchase of certain residential real property-namely, 5506 Holly Springs Drive, Houston, Texas 77056-which is located in the very toney west Houston neighborhood of Tanglewood (the \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   \"). [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 46:10-13, 47:2-8; Pl.'s Ex. 13]. Twelve individual investors, including MacKenzie, plus United Sentry, contributed funds to United Sentry in order for this entity to finance the loan to Triple Gate. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 47:9-19, 49:13-16, 93:21-94:4, 219:12-220:6]. At the time of the filing of the Debtor's Chapter 7 petition, the Debtor and Amos, plus their children, were residing at the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   12. In addition to executing the Note, Triple Gate also executed a deed of trust on June 16, 2015, naming MacKenzie as the trustee on the Property (the \"\n   <em>\n    Deed of Trust\n   </em>\n   \"). [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 51:25-52:11; Pl.'s Ex. 14]. The Deed of Trust secures repayment of the Note and contains the following language:\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Beneficiary's Rights\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   4.

There is conflicting testimony regarding whether the issue of Prins personally filing for bankruptcy arose at this meeting on October 4, 2016: Gabriel testified that Prins filing for personal bankruptcy was not raised at the meeting, while Prins testified that the issue did arise. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 119:16-22; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 31:18-24]. Because-as discussed more in depth\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in the Credibility of Witnesses Section-the Court finds Gabriel to be a very credible witness and Prins not to be a credible witness, the Court finds that the issue of Prins' personal bankruptcy was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   mentioned or discussed at the meeting on October 4, 2016. As a result of the settlement meeting, the Gabriel Family, Eleanor, and Pfirrmann negotiated an agreement in which the Gabriel Family agreed to buy out Eleanor\n   and Pfirrmann's interest in Industry Drive. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 120:4-9]. The agreement, however, due to the need to obtain financing for the purchase of Eleanor and Pfirrmann's interests, was not completely finalized until approximately September 2017.

Despite being on notice of the Debtor's bankruptcy case, Prins made the unilateral decision to proceed with the foreclosure sale because he believed that the Property was owned by Triple Gate and, therefore, was not property of the Debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate that was protected by the automatic stay. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 2 of 20, \u00b6 4]. Prins and the Prins Law Firm undertook no efforts to determine whether the Property was owned by the Debtor or Triple Gate as of October 4, 2016.

Bustamante testified that Jabbour, Abdullatif, and he purchased the Property as its beneficial owners, and that Elbar acquired legal title to the Property. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 91:2-10; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 142:5-145:5].

Bustamante is also an attorney by training, having received his law degree from the University of Houston and an LLM from New York University. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 51:12-15].

[Pl.'s Ex. 20]. Even though four of the cashier's checks were paid to the order of Elbar, Bustamante clearly testified at his deposition that the $2.4 million paid in cashier's checks was comprised of $800,000.00 each from himself, Abdullatif, and Jabbour. [TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 137:12-138:8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   33. Bustamante, Abdullatif, and Jabbour each put up $800,000.00 to purchase the Property, thus giving them each a one-third ownership interest in the Property. [Adv. Doc.

Bustamante testified, however, that he has an agreement with Elbar in which he advances the purchase money and Elbar has a 25% percent cut of Bustamante's portion; Elbar then pays Bustamante back later. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 82:13-23]. Here, Elbar paid Bustamante $200,000.00 for 25% of Bustamante's 1/3 portion of the Property, thus making Elbar's stake in the Property $200,000.00. [Adv. Doc.

Bustamante also testified that Elbar has previously purchased properties when it knew the owner was in bankruptcy. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 134:11-14]. Additionally, Elbar has been involved in other lawsuits involving the automatic stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:5-120:1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   35. After the foreclosure sale, Shum returned from Houston (where the foreclosure sale was held) to San Antonio (where the Prins Law Firm was located) with the cashier's checks; however, Prins testified that his bank, BBVA, would not negotiate the cashier's checks.

[Pl.'s Ex. 26; TransWorld Ex.'s HH, Prins Dep. 154:5-17]. Shum also stated that Prins and she believed the warranty deed from Triple Gate to Amos and the Debtor was a fraudulent transfer. [Pl.'s Ex. 26]. At 2:53 p.m. that same afternoon, Twyman replied to Shum, copy to Prins, thanking her for the information and stating that he would pass along the information to his client-i.e., to Elbar. [Pl.'s Ex. 27; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 154:18-25]. Thus-at the latest-as of 2:53 p.m. on October 5, 2016, Elbar was aware (through Twyman, its vice president and attorney) that an individual who claimed to own the Property had filed for bankruptcy. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 27]. Bustamante did not remember taking any steps-except to perhaps check PACER\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   -to verify the information about the Debtor's bankruptcy after he learned about her bankruptcy, [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 85:19-86:7, 100:17-21]; Bustamante further testified that learning about the Debtor's bankruptcy did not change his mind about wire-transferring the $2.4 million to the substitute trustee (i.e., to Prins), [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 87:12-19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Elbar's Violation of the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   38. At some point after learning that the Debtor was claiming that she owned the Property and thus the automatic stay was in effect, Bustamante, on behalf of Elbar and the Purchasers, decided to go forward with the purchase of the Property and to send a wire of $2.4 million to the substitute trustee-i.e., to the Prins Law Firm. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 87:12-88:8; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 165:8-9, 166:21-167:4, 167:8-15, 170:15-18, 173:19-22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   39. On October 6, 2016, at 11:53 a.m., Bustamante emailed Abdullatif, requesting that the wire of the $2.4 million (the \"\n   <em>\n    Proceeds\n   </em>\n   \") show Elbar Investments, Inc. as the sending party. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 63:12-16; Pl.'s Ex. 31]. At 12:53 p.m., Twyman emailed Shum, copy to Prins, requesting that Shum send a copy of the notice confirming the bankruptcy filing. [Pl.'s Ex. 29]. At 12:58 p.m., Prins sent an email to Twyman, stating that he had received notice from the Debtor's bankruptcy attorney that the Debtor, not Triple Gate, had filed for personal bankruptcy; that subsequent to the foreclosure\n   sale, the Debtor's bankruptcy attorney sent a deed that was executed six months after the execution of the Note and the Deed of Trust whereby the Debtor and Amos had transferred the Property from Triple Gate to themselves personally;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he (i.e., Prins) was going to file a motion for relief from stay since this was a \"fraudulent transfer.\" [Pl.'s Ex. 30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   40. Despite learning that the Property had been deeded to the Debtor personally and that the Debtor had filed for bankruptcy-and, thus, that the automatic stay was in effect-on October 6, 2016, at approximately 1:13 p.m., at Bustamante's direction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Abdullatif's bank wire-transferred the Proceeds to the IOLTA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Pl.'s Ex. 31; Pl.'s Ex. 2, at 6]. At 1:13 p.m. on October 6, 2016, Abdullatif received an email from his bank, informing him that the wire of $2.4 million had been sent. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 63:24-64:8; Pl.'s Ex. 31]. Shortly thereafter, at 1:17 p.m. that same day, Abdullatif forwarded the email from his bank confirming the successful wire to Bustamante. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 64:10-15; Pl.'s Exs. 31-32]. At trial, Bustamante admitted that Elbar had notice of the Debtor's bankruptcy and of the automatic stay at the time the Proceeds were wire-transferred. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 64:16-24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   41. According to Bustamante, Elbar has previously paid a purchase price at a foreclosure sale knowing of a bankruptcy approximately ten (10) times out of thousands of foreclosure sales-in other words, to pay the purchase price after learning about a bankruptcy is \"unusual.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 116:14-17; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 124:15-125:4]. In Bustamante's own words: \"We paid the money knowing about the bankruptcy. It doesn't get more complicated than that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   [TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 228:17-20]. Bustamante testified that he instructed that the $2.4 million be wire transferred after learning about the Debtor's bankruptcy because he wanted the replace the cashier's checks that were rejected, that he \"committed to send the wire\" and he \"was just completing what I committed,\" that if he did not \"send the wire, then I have not made my bid good, I have no right to anything,\" so that the Purchasers \"would have standing as the highest bidder of the\n   sale,\" and that one of his goals was to acquire the Property. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 88:19-89:1, 89:17-25, 133:13-134:10]. Bustamante also testified unequivocally that Elbar had previously purchased properties when it knew the owner was in bankruptcy. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:11-14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Post-Foreclosure Events\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   42. Upon receipt of the $2.4 million that Elbar wired to the IOLTA, Prins did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   provide Elbar with title to the Property. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 3 of 20, \u00b6 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   43. On October 11, 2016, Prins filed a motion for relief from stay on behalf of United Sentry in order to \"allow movant to complete foreclosure of the Property\" (\"\n   <em>\n    Motion for Relief\n   </em>\n   \"). [Main Case Doc. No. 7]. The Motion for Relief was set for hearing on November 8, 2016. Shum, the lawyer who actually conducted the foreclosure sale, drafted the Motion for Relief, but it was signed by Prins. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 3-4 of 20, \u00b6 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   44. On October 13, 2016, Prins, on behalf of United Sentry, filed an amended motion for relief from stay (the \"\n   <em>\n    Amended Motion for Relief\n   </em>\n   \"). [Main Case Doc. No. 9]. The Amended Motion for Relief contains additional legal authorities compared to the Motion for Relief, but essentially requests the same relief as the Motion for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   45. As of October 17, 2016, the closing balance of the Wells Fargo Operating Account was $13,414.57. [Pl.'s Ex. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   46. On October 18, 2016, Prins transferred $2.0 million from the IOLTA to the Wells Fargo Operating Account. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 4 of 20, \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Exs. 2, 7; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 18:10-15]. Prins was the only person who was authorized to make withdrawals from and charges to the Wells Fargo Operating Account. [Main Case Doc. No. 121, Jan. 9, 2017, Hrg. 28:11-29:5]. Prins did not advise United Sentry, or anyone else, of the $2.0 million transfer. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 4 of 20, \u00b6 11; Main Case Doc. No. 121, Jan. 9, 2017, Hrg. 38:11-19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   47. Between October 19, 2016, and December 12, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prins freely spent the Proceeds, which were by that time in the Wells Fargo Operating, for his own personal and business needs. Prins' expenditures from the Wells Fargo Operating Account, which are directly traceable to the Proceeds, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TransWorld's Ex.

On October 20, 2016, Prins purchased four plane tickets on United Airlines, each in the amount of $1,868.90. [Pl.'s Ex. 7; Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 4 of 20, \u00b6 12]. Prins' testimony regarding the timing of his decision to take a trip overseas has been contradictory. Prins testified that when he transferred the $2.0 million into the Wells Fargo Operating Account on October 18, 2016, he did not yet have the intention to leave for an overseas vacation. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 20:11-19]. Prins later testified that as of October 19, 2016, he was contemplating the trip overseas. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:14-22, 24:21-25]. Later still, Prins testified that as of October 21, 2016, he had not made the decision to travel overseas but had made the decision to \"shut down the practice and leave.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:1-4].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   B.

On October 27, 2016, Prins made a charge to the Wells Fargo Operating Account in London, England. [Pl.'s Ex. 7; Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 4 of 20, \u00b6 15]. In subsequent weeks, Prins continued to charge tens of thousands of dollars to the Wells Fargo Operating Account for recreational purchases in (i) London, England, (ii) Edinburgh, Scotland, and (iii) Copenhagen, Denmark, with the last of the international charges occurring on November 28, 2016. [Pl.'s Exs. 7-8; Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 4 of 20, \u00b6 15]. Upon returning from his month-long trip to Europe, Prins immediately traveled to Portland, Oregon, based on further recreational charges on the Wells Fargo Operating Account in Portland between November 29, 2016, and December 5, 2016.

[Pl.'s Ex. 8; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 43:1-22]. At Prins' deposition (taken approximately one year later on November 15, 2017), he testified that this $10,000.00 was \"Elbar's money.\" [TransWorld's, Ex.

HH, Prins Dep. 96:2-97:3]. The Cashes believed that the $164,807.29 check the Prins Law Firm issued to TransWorld represented TransWorld recovering the \"good faith\" money of $169,807.29 it had given Prins to deposit into the IOLTA, less the $5,000.00 settlement amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   [Adv.

The screenshot Prins sent to MackKenzie was not an accurate screenshot of the funds in the IOLTA on October 24, 2016; instead, Prins used editing software on his computer to create a screenshot that would appear to show that the IOLTA still held all of the Proceeds.

However, Prins had sent an email to the Court's case manager in the early hours of November 8, 2016, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Along with the Show Cause Hearing and the Continued Status Conference, I have filed and sent an Amended Motion for Relief from Stay on behalf of United Sentry Mortgage that is set on the Docket for 9:30 a.m. I have fallen very ill and cannot make the trip into Houston, so I would respectfully request that my hearing be dropped at this time so that I may appear in person at a later date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Parks had not spoken with Prins about the hearing and believed that Prins was out of the country at the time, likely in Germany. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 of 20, \u00b6 20]. Parks further stated that Prins had left the country on October 22, 2016, and had told his associates that he would be retiring. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Parks also alluded to the firm undergoing a \"unique set of circumstances\" and said that he was doing his \"best to keep the wheels from falling off.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. However, at this time, Parks disclosed no specifics about Prins' recent frequent use of the\n   Proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the Court's request, Parks provided Prins' cell phone number, which allowed the Court's case manager to contact Prins and inform him that the Court wanted him to immediately appear at the hearing by telephone. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. No. 117, Nov. 8, 2016, Hrg. 13:9-14:23, 24:12-13]. Prins complied and then called in to appear by telephone. [Main Case Doc. No. 117, Nov. 8, 2016, Hrg. 24:12-13; Tape Recording, Nov. 8, 2016, Hrg. at 10:48:10 A.M.]. Upon questioning from the Court, Prins reiterated the statement in his email that he was ill and stated that he was dialing in from San Antonio, Texas. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 6 of 20, \u00b6 22]. Prins claimed that he was not retiring but instead \"cutting back\" on the number of his clients in order to spend more time with his family. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Critically, Prins was asked by Elbar's counsel whether the $2.4 million Elbar had wired on October 6, 2016, was still held in the IOLTA. [Main Case Doc. No. 117, Nov. 8, 2016, Hrg. 44:8-11; Tape Recording, Nov. 8, 2016, Hrg. at 11:11:45 A.M.]. Prins answered \"Yes, it is\" and he confirmed that he was continuing to maintain the IOLTA. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 6 of 20, \u00b6 23]. Prins' response was a blatant lie, as by this time, he had already transferred at least $2.3 million of the $2.4 million out of the IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 46, 57].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   59. On November 8, 2016, when Prins told this Court that he was in San Antonio and too ill to appear at the hearing, the Wells Fargo Operating Account showed several charges that Prins was making on this same date in London, England. [Pl.'s Ex. 8; Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 6 of 20, \u00b6 24]. Thus, Prins' response that he was too ill to appear at the hearing and was in San Antonio was another blatant lie-as he actually was in London freely spending some of the Proceeds that he had transferred from the IOLTA to the Wells Fargo Operating Account. Indeed, the balance in the Wells Fargo Operating Account on November 8, 2016, was $1,757,348.78. [Pl.'s Ex. 8; Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 6 of 20, \u00b6 24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   60. On November 8, 2016, at 3:03 p.m., (i.e., after the hearing on the Motion for Relief and the Debtor Show Cause) Richard Battaglia (\"\n   <em>\n    Battaglia\n   </em>\n   \"), counsel for Elbar, emailed Prins and requested-for the first time-that the Proceeds be returned to Elbar. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 101:8-16, 118:1-4; Pl.'s Ex. 40; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 106:10-19]. Between the dates of October 6, 2016, and November 8, 2016, Elbar did not ask for the deed to the Property because, as stated by Bustamante, \"there was a bankruptcy estate, we're [i.e., Elbar] not entitled to a deed.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 101:17-23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   61. Also on November 8, 2016, an article was published in the San Antonio Express-News stating that Prins was being accused by former clients (the Ozers) of fabricating court documents. [Pl.'s Ex. 39].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   62. At least by November 8, 2016, MacKenzie, on behalf of United Sentry, requested that Prins return the $2.4 million to Elbar. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 6 of 20, \u00b6 25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   63. Sometime after the November 8, 2016, hearing, the Chapter 7 Trustee's counsel became aware that (i) Prins had filed a personal Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas on September 29, 2016, and (ii) there was an adversary\n   proceeding filed against Prins on November 4, 2016, alleging that Prins had misappropriated funds from his IOLTA and that he had perpetuated a fraud on former clients by forging court orders. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 6-7 of 20, \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. No. 34].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   64. On November 9, 2016, at 11:46 a.m., Prins emailed Battaglia, inquiring whether or not Elbar still wanted to buy the Note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   [United Sentry's Ex. 3]. Battaglia responded to Prins via email that same day at 5:40 p.m., stating that Elbar might \"still have an interest but would need to see all the loan documents.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   65. Also on November 9, 2016, MacKenzie emailed Prins at 3:44 p.m., asking that Prins move the Proceeds to another account and referenced the article that appeared in the San Antonio Express-News. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 233:1-8, 233:24-234:13, 235:19-236:1; United Sentry's Ex. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   66. On November 10, 2016, MacKenzie emailed Prins, requesting a screenshot of the funds in the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 233:9-11; United Sentry's Ex. 7]. MacKenzie wanted Prins to send him a screenshot showing the amount of the funds in the IOLTA \"to see that the funds were available and that ... they were available for everybody involved, security.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 233:12-15]. In response, Prins sent a falsified screenshot of the IOLTA balance to MacKenzie, showing a balance of $3.3 million in the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 241:4-15; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 186:25-187:18]. Subsequently, at his deposition (taken on November 15, 2017), Prins admitted that the IOLTA did not have $3.3 million in it at that time and that he had manufactured the screenshot. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 186:25-187:18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   67. On November 10, 2016, at 5:56 p.m., Battaglia emailed Seidler and stated that he \"literally found out about Mr. Prin's BK within the last 30 minutes and am extremely concerned as to the safekeeping of those funds.\" [Industry Drive's Ex. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   68. On November 11, 2016, Twyman emailed Prins and requested that Prins wire the Proceeds from his account (i.e., the IOLTA) to Abdullatif's account. [United Sentry's Exs. 4, 6]. Prins responded, stating that he would try to wire the funds the next day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   [United Sentry's Ex. 4]. On November 12, 2016, Twyman replied, in which he stated that he would like Prins to immediately wire the Proceeds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On November 14, 2016, Prins emailed Twyman and attached a release of escrow funds for execution by Elbar and United Sentry. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. In the same email, Prins stated that he had received conflicting instructions about to whom to wire the Proceeds-one instruction to wire the Proceeds to Elbar and another instruction to wire the Proceeds to Abdullatif.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   69. On November 18, 2016, MacKenzie once again emailed Prins and requested a screenshot of the funds in the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 241:16-22; United Sentry's Ex. 8]. Prins-continuing his deceit-once again sent MacKenzie a falsified screenshot of the IOLTA, showing a balance of $3,144,000.00. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 241:23-242:10; United Sentry's Ex. 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   70. Also on November 21, 2016, Twyman emailed Prins and stated that Elbar would not execute any release prior to receiving funds, as this was Elbar's standard procedure. [United Sentry's Ex. 4]. Twyman asked Prins whether he would be willing to wire the funds into this Court's registry in Houston. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Prins replied to Twyman on November 22, 2016, stating that he would be willing to consider interpleading the funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   71.

HH, Prins Dep. 189:20-190:8]. In his email, MacKenzie wrote the following to Prins: \"I must admit I am very Concerned about this matter another case you have against you With a estate matter of roughly 360,000 has popped up people Are losing there patience and trust Do not let me down Todd.

In response, Prins sent MacKenzie a screenshot of the IOLTA showing a balance of $3.14 million; Prins, however, like the previous responses to MacKenzie's requests for screenshots of the IOLTA, edited the screenshot in order to deceive MacKenzie. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 243:4-13; United Sentry's Ex. 12; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 189:20-190:8]. In fact, Prins had already transferred most of the Proceeds out of the IOLTA into the Wells Fargo Operating Account and the BBVA Operating Account. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 46, 57].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   72. On or around November 30, 2016, MacKenzie again requested a screenshot of the IOLTA to confirm the amount of funds in it. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 243:14-25]. In reply, Prins sent MacKenzie another falsified screenshot of the IOLTA, once against showing a balance of $3,144,000.00. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 243:14-244:3; United Sentry's Ex. 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   73. On December 2, 2016, MacKenzie and United Sentry's counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   contacted the FBI regarding MacKenzie's suspicions that Prins was sending him doctored screenshots of the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 104:11-105:18, 245:8-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   74. On December 3, 2016, MacKenzie again requested another screenshot of the IOLTA from Prins. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 244:4-24; United Sentry's Ex. 14]. Prins responded to MacKenzie's email on December 4, 2016, and once again attached a falsified screenshot showing a balance of $3,144,000.00 in the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 245:18-24; United Sentry's Ex. 14]. This was at least the sixth time since October 24, 2016, that MacKenzie had requested that Prins send him a screenshot of the IOLTA as proof of the amount of funds in the account. In Prins' own words: \"Mr. MacKenzie expressed to me a great deal of concern about this money. Mr. MacKenzie was-for lack of a better term-like a dog on a bone on it and contacted me more than anybody, yes.\" [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 190:16-20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   75. On December 5, 2016, pursuant to yet another request from MacKenzie for verification of the amount of funds in the IOLTA, Prins, with MacKenzie listening in on the call, impersonated a BBVA employee-one \"Levon Martin\"-in order to falsely confirm the balance in the IOLTA as $3,144,000.00. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 246:9-18, 247:10-14, 248:17-20; United Sentry's Ex. 16; TransWorld's Ex.

On the same day, Prins also created a false email from \"Levon Martin,\" confirming the balance of the IOLTA as $3,144,000.00. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 248:3-16; United Sentry's Ex. 15; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 191:18-192:8]. Prins then forwarded this email to MacKenzie to continue attempting to deceive MacKenzie into believing that all of the Proceeds were still in the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 248:11-16; United Sentry's Ex. 15; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 191:18-192:8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   76. Around the beginning of December of 2016, because of MacKenzie's concerns about Prins based on news articles in San Antonio newspapers and the security of the Proceeds in the IOLTA, MacKenzie hired two ex-Texas Rangers to watch Prins and Ms. Prins 24 hours a day, so that MacKenzie would be alerted if Prins or Ms. Prins attempted to leave the country. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 252:22-253:24]. MacKenzie believed this \"was the right thing to do for the whole situation.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 253:14-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   77. On December 6, 2016, this Court held a status conference at the request of the Chapter 7 Trustee. At this hearing, the\n   respective attorneys for the Chapter 7 Trustee, United Sentry, and Elbar raised very troubling concerns about Prins' misappropriation of funds from his IOLTA. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 7 of 20, \u00b6 27]. Specifically, United Sentry's counsel stated that he had learned from communications with the FBI that Prins had transferred funds out of his IOLTA on October 18, 2016, which would make his statements on the record at the hearing held on November 8, 2016, that he was still holding all of the $2.4 million in the IOLTA blatantly false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   78. On December 7, 2016, based upon the statements made by the attorneys who appeared at the status conference on December 6, 2016, this Court entered its Order (1) Requiring Todd Prins to Wire Transfer $2.4 million to the Chapter 7 Trustee by No Later than 5:00 P.M. on December 12, 2016; and (2) Requiring Todd Prins to Personally Appear in Court and Show Cause Why He Should Not be Sanctioned (\"\n   <em>\n    Prins Show Cause Order\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Main Case Doc. No. 52]. The Prins Show Cause Order provided that in the event Prins failed to wire the $2.4 million to the Chapter 7 Trustee by the deadline of 5:00 p.m. on December 12, 2016, the Court would hold a hearing on December 14, 2016, at 11:30 a.m. at which Prins was ordered to personally appear and show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to turn over the $2.4 million to the Chapter 7 Trustee. [Main Case Doc. No. 52]. The Prins Show Cause Order further provided that, regardless of whether the $2.4 million was transferred, the Court would hold a hearing on January 9, 2017, at which Prins was ordered to personally appear and show cause why he should not be sanctioned for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   A. violating the automatic stay on October 4, 2016 by conducting a foreclosure sale on 5506 Holly Springs Drive, Houston, Texas 77056 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   \"), which is property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   B. violating the automatic stay on October 6, 2016 by accepting a wire of the Proceeds from Elbar Investments, Inc., which monies represent the funds attributable to the foreclosure sale of the Property; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   C. making a specific representation on the record via his telephonic appearance at the status conference held in this case on November 8, 2016 regarding the Proceeds: to wit, that on that day, the Proceeds were on deposit in his law firm's IOLTA account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   79. On December 7, 2016, the Chapter 7 Trustee served Prins with a copy of the Prins Show Cause Order by email and facsimile. [Main Case Doc. No. 53]. The Chapter 7 Trustee also served a courtesy copy of the Prins Show Cause Order on Prins' bankruptcy counsel, Seidler. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. There is no question that Prins received notice of the Prins Show Cause Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   80. Prins did not wire transfer $2.4 million to the Chapter 7 Trustee by 5:00\n   p.m. on December 12, 2016, as required by the Prins Show Cause Order. [Main Case Doc. No. 60; Main Case Doc.

On December 12, 2016, the United States (through the Department of Justice) seized the entirety of the funds in the Wells Fargo Operating Account, which amounted at that time to $1,601,542.14.

On December 14, 2016, Prins filed his response to the Prins Show Cause Order (the \"\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   \"), [Doc. No. 63], in which he asserted that (a) he did not violate the automatic stay because he believed the Property was owned by Triple Gate and was not property of the Debtor's estate, and (b) it was \"impossible for him to effectuate the Court's [Prins Show Cause] [O]rder [because] [t]he United States, through the Department of Justice, has seized the account of Respondent rendering it impossible for him to transfer any funds or even afford transportation to Houston, Texas from San Antonio, Texas.\" [Main Case Doc. No. 63 at 3 of 5, \u00b6 11]. In the Response, Prins admitted that by no later than 10:15 a.m. on October 5, 2016, he had knowledge that the Property was titled in the name of the Debtor and her non-debtor spouse, i.e., Amos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Main Case Doc. No. 63-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   84. On December 14, 2016, this Court held a hearing on the Prins Show Cause Order (the \"\n   <em>\n    Show Cause Hearing\n   </em>\n   \"). Prins failed to appear at the Show Cause Hearing as required by the Prins Show Cause Order. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 9 of 20, \u00b6 37]. Counsel for United Sentry also informed the Court at this hearing about the United States' seizure of funds in Prins' accounts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On December 14, 2016, this Court entered its Order (1) Holding Todd A. Prins in Contempt of this Court's Order of December 7, 2016; and (2) Requiring the U.S. Marshals Service to Take Todd A. Prins Into Custody and Produce Him in Court (the \"\n   <em>\n    Contempt Order\n   </em>\n   \"). [Main Case Doc. No. 64]. In the Contempt Order, the Court found that (a) Prins had received adequate notice of the Prins Show Cause Order, (b) Prins failed to turn over the $2.4 million as required by the Prins Show Cause Order, and (c) Prins failed to appear before the Court at a hearing on the Prins Show Cause Order held on December 14, 2016, at 11:30 a.m. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. As a result, the Court held Prins in civil contempt of the Prins Show Cause Order and required the U.S. Marshals Service to take him into custody and produce him in court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   85. On December 15, 2016, Prins voluntarily appeared at the Bob Casey Federal Courthouse, 515 Rusk, Houston, Texas, 77002 and turned himself into the custody of the U.S. Marshals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 9-10 of 20, \u00b6 39]. The Marshals then brought Prins to the undersigned judge's courtroom; the Court then immediately held the Show Cause Hearing; and Prins proceeded to give testimony about the Prins Show Cause Order and the Response. One day after representing in the Response that he lacked funds to come to the scheduled Show Cause Hearing, Prins admitted that: (a) he was able to come to Houston on the bus for $10 after receiving\n   the Contempt Order; and (b) the statement in his Response regarding his inability to appear was false. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. At the Show Cause Hearing held on December 15, 2016, Prins admitted receiving notice of the December 14, 2016, Show Cause Hearing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 of 20, \u00b6 40]. The Court then asked Prins why he did not appear at the Show Cause Hearing to which Prins responded: \"Inability to answer questions, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment[.]\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. At the Show Cause Hearing held on December 15, 2016, Prins asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to answer questions posed by the Chapter 7 Trustee's counsel regarding transfers of the $2.4 million out of the IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 of 20, \u00b6 41]. Prins also asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege to questions regarding the statements made in the Response regarding the seizure of his accounts by the Department of Justice. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 of 20, \u00b6 42].\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court continued the Show Cause Hearing to December 19, 2016, and released Prins from the custody of the U.S. Marshals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 11 of 20, \u00b6 45; Main Case Doc. No. 69].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   86. At the continued Show Cause Hearing on December 19, 2016, the parties made further oral arguments about the testimonial and documentary Fifth Amendment privilege issues raised at the Show Cause Hearing held on December 15, 2016. After listening to these oral arguments, the Court requested the parties to file written briefs on the privilege issues raised at the December 15 hearing. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. Nos. 74 (Prins' brief) and 75 (Trustee's brief) ]. The Court therefore recessed the Show Cause Hearing for approximately six hours. After considering the parties' written submissions, the Court went back on the record and ruled that Prins did not have a Fifth Amendment privilege over his bank statements and, therefore, had to produce them to the Chapter 7 Trustee. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 12 of 20, \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. No. 77]. The Court further ruled that Prins had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege and was required to answer questions regarding the status of the $2.4 million wired by Elbar and into the IOLTA. [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 12 of 20, \u00b6 47]. Thus, counsel for the Trustee was allowed to resume examining Prins. Prins admitted that, even if the IOLTA had not been seized by the United States, he would not have been able to comply with the Show Cause Order because all $2.4 million had been transferred out of the IOLTA and several hundred thousand dollars of the $2.4 million was no longer in the Wells Fargo Operating Account-i.e., he had spent many of the Proceeds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 of 20, \u00b6 48]. Prins further admitted that he had no justification or basis for transferring the $2.4 million from the IOLTA to the Wells Fargo Operating Account. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Prins also admitted to transferring substantial sums to two entities, TransWorld and Industry Drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 12 of 20,\n   \u00b6 49]. Prins also told the Court that the rest of depleted funds from the $2.4 million were used for \"operating expenses of the practice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 of 20, \u00b6 50]. The Court continued the Show Cause Hearing until January 9, 2017, in order to afford the Trustee time to review bank statements that the Court decided to require Prins to produce to the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   87. On December 21, 2016, the Court entered an order requiring Prins to produce to the Chapter 7 Trustee bank statements for September to December 2016, for the IOLTA, the BBVA Operating Account, and the Wells Fargo Operating Account. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case Doc. No. 77]. The Court gave Prins until noon on January 6, 2017, to comply with the order. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   88. On January 2, 2017, Elbar filed the instant adversary proceeding against the Debtor, Amos, the Trustee, Prins, United Sentry, MacKenzie, TransWorld, and Industry Drive. [Adv. Doc. No. 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   89. On January 3, 2017, Elbar filed a lis pendens on the Property. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 126:8-23; Industry Drive's Ex. 10]. Elbar filed this lis pendens knowing that the Debtor claimed an interest in the Property and that therefore the Property was property of her Chapter 7 estate and protected by the automatic stay. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. 26-27; Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 126:8-23; TransWorld Ex.'s HH, Prins Dep. 154:5-25]. Elbar did not seek relief from the automatic stay from this Court before filing the lis pendens. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 126:11-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   90. On January 9, 2017, this Court held the continued Show Cause Hearing. The Chapter 7 Trustee introduced the bank statements Prins had produced for the Wells Fargo Operating Account and the BBVA Operating Account discussed above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Main Case Doc. No. 197 at 13 of 20, \u00b6 52]. During this hearing, Prins testified that he did not believe he was in violation of the automatic stay when he transferred approximately $700,000 to $800,000 of the $2.4 million to Industry Drive and Transworld.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 of 20, \u00b6 53].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   91. On January 27, 2017, Mr. Cash died. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 11:17-22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   92. In late February of 2017, when she (as president of TransWorld) was served with a lawsuit, Ms. Cash learned for the first time that the check in the amount of $230,853.66 that TransWorld had made to the order of the IOLTA on February 4, 2008, for the purpose of Prins settling TransWorld's tax dispute with the Tax Assessor,\n   may not have in fact been paid to the Tax Assessor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:20-24:1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   93.

On March 13, 2017, Elbar filed a proof claim in the Debtor's Chapter 7 case, setting forth that its claim totals $1,594,424.17 and that it believes the Property is worth $3,500,000.00. [Proof of Claim, Case No. 16-35021, Claim 11, at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   95. On March 27, 2017, this Court, having completed the Show Cause Hearing on the Prins Show Cause Order, entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Order (1) Requiring Todd Prins to Wire Transfer $2.4 Million to the Chapter 7 Trustee By No Later Than 5:00 P.M. on December 12, 2016; and (2) Requiring Todd Prins to Personally Appear in Court and Show Cause Why He Should Not Be Sanctioned. [Main Case Doc. No. 197]. The Court then entered an order imposing sanctions against Prins, which ordered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   [1] [Prins] is liable to Elbar for sanctions in the amount of $800,000.00, representing [the] approximate difference between the $2.4 million paid by Elbar at the foreclosure sale and the funds frozen by the United States; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   [2] Prins is liable for sanctions in the following amount of attorneys' fees to the following parties:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   [A] The Trustee in the amount of $20,485.00;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   [B] Elbar in the amount of $13,350.00 for Richard A.

This Court ordered that Prins was immediately liable for all sanctions set forth in the order and that Prins was to immediately pay all sanctions. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Prins has failed to comply with any portion of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   96. On March 29, 2017, the Trustee filed a motion requesting this Court to approve the sale of the Property, [Main Case Doc. No. 199], which this Court granted. [Main Case Doc. No. 200]. Pursuant to the Court's order granting approval of the sale of the Property, as amended, the amount of proceeds necessary to pay off United Sentry's mortgage on the Property was to be placed into the Court's registry. [Main Case Doc. Nos. 200, 209].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   97. On April 5, 2017, the Debtor and Amos were indicted for conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On April 27, 2017, in the adversary proceeding at bar, this Court granted the Trustee's motion to dismiss and dismissed all claims asserted by Elbar against the Trustee. [Adv. Doc. No. 45]. Elbar did not file any opposition to the Trustee's motion to dismiss all of the claims against the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   99. On May 26, 2017, the Trustee closed on the sale of the Property. [Main Case Doc. Nos. 218, 219].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   100. On May 30, 2017, pursuant to the Court's order approving the sale of the Property, $1,719,062.93, was placed into the Court's registry. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket entry in Main Case dated 05/30/2017]. This action was taken because prior to the sale, Elbar had filed the instant adversary proceeding and, among other relief requested, asserts that it should receive some or all of these sale proceeds in order to be made whole before United Sentry receives any portion of these proceeds. [Adv. Doc. No. 1 at 6-7 of 9, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28].\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   101. On June 7, 2017, Prins entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas regarding the matter of\n   <em>\n    United States of America v. Todd A. Prins\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Prins' Criminal Case\n   </em>\n   \"). [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 1;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Todd A. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Crim.

In the plea agreement, Prins stated that he \"well knew and believed[ ] the true balance of the IOLTA account was less than $1,000, having been $2,041.17 prior to the receipt of the $2,400,000 transfer from E[lbar] I[nvestments], Inc.\" [Pl.'s Ex. 1;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because Triple Gate defaulted under the Note, the 13 investors who invested in United Sentry's loan to Triple Gate have not received any return on their investments in the form of interest payments by Triple Gate. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 77:6-24]. However, since July of 2017, MacKenzie himself has been making interest payments to the 11 investors (minus United Sentry and himself), in the amount of approximately $13,000.00 a month, as he believes that it is the \"right thing to do.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:6-24, 94:7-14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   103. On July 6, 2017, Elbar filed a first amended complaint in this adversary proceeding, asserting the following claims: (1) equitable subrogation as to Prins, United Sentry, and MacKenzie; (2) fraud in real estate transactions as to Prins, United Sentry, and MacKenzie; (3) common law fraud as to Prins, United Sentry, and MacKenzie; (4) Texas Theft Liability Act as to Prins, United Sentry, and MacKenzie; (5) theft as to Prins; and (6) money had and received, unjust enrichment, theft, and conversion against TransWorld and Industry Drive. [Adv. Doc. No. 68].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   104. On August 10, 2017, Elbar, Bustamante, Abdullatif, and Jabbour filed a petition in the Prins' Criminal Case, claiming that they are entitled to recover the entire $1,601,542.14 that the United States government seized from the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 77:9-15; Pl.'s Ex. 49].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   105. On August 11, 2017, Elbar filed a proposed order approving dismissal of Elbar's theft claim against Industry Drive. [Adv. Doc. No. 114]. The Court subsequently signed the proposed order later that same day, thereby dismissing Elbar's theft claim against Industry Drive. [Adv. Doc. No. 116].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   106. On February 6, 2018, a three-day trial commenced in the instant adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of the trial: (1) Elbar's counsel represented to the Court that Elbar had decided to dismiss all of Elbar's claims against the Debtor, Amos, and MacKenzie;\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) this Court granted United Sentry and MacKenzie's motion to dismiss the cross-claims brought against them by the Debtor and Amos;\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) Elbar's counsel represented to the Court that Elbar was dismissing Elbar's claim of theft against TransWorld.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   107. Thus, the only causes of action asserted by Elbar remaining in this adversary proceeding are the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   A. As to United Sentry: causes of action for equitable subrogation, fraud in real estate transaction, common law fraud, and the Texas Theft Liability Act;\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   B.

On February 22, 2018, in the Prins' Bankruptcy, Bankruptcy Judge Gargotta entered an Order Granting Motion of the United States of America, Internal Revenue Service, to Approve Compromise Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019. [\n   <em>\n    Todd A. Prins and Paula R. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 16-52187-cag, Bankr. W.D. Tex., ECF. No. 135]. Judge Gargotta found that (1) the $82,373.28 paid to the IRS by Prins on October 19, 2016, from the IOLTA is the sole property of Elbar; and (2) the $82,373.28 is not part of the bankruptcy estate of Prins and Ms. Prins. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On that same day, Judge Gargotta approved an Agreed Final Judgment in the adversary proceeding that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service had filed in the Prins' Bankruptcy. [\n   <em>\n    United States of America, Internal Revenue Service v. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Pro. No. 17-05063-cag, Bankr. W.D. Tex., ECF. No. 38]. The Agreed Final Judgment ordered, in relevant part, that (1) the $82,373.28 paid to the IRS on October 19, 2016, is the sole property of Elbar; and (2) the IRS is directed to turn over the $82,373.28 to Elbar within 30 days of the date of the order. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   111. On March 20, 2018, Elbar received a check from the United States Treasury in the amount of $82,373.28, in accordance with the Agreed Final Judgment signed by Judge Gargotta in the Prins' Bankruptcy. [Adv. Doc. No. 237].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   112. On May 15, 2018, Prins was sentenced in the Prins' Criminal Case to 72 months imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $2,975,264.00 in restitution (of which, $2.4 million is restitution to Elbar). [\n   <em>\n    United States v. Todd A. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Crim. No. 5:17-cr-00482-DAE-1, W.D. Tex., ECF. Nos. 58, 59]. Also on May 15, 2018, the District Court in the Prins' Criminal Case granted\n   the United States' motion to set aside the preliminary order of forfeiture in lieu of restitution, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF No. 62], essentially meaning that the government would not seek the funds and would allow the funds to be returned to Elbar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   113. On June 7, 2018, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas filed a \"Process Receipt and Return\" in the Prins' Criminal Case, requesting that the Clerk of the Court in the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, transfer funds in the amount of $1,601,542.14 to Elbar for the purpose of payment as restitution. [\n   <em>\n    United States v. Todd A. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Crim. No. 5:17-cr-00482-DAE-1, W.D. Tex., ECF. No. 63]. On July 2, 2018, Elbar in fact received a check from the United States Treasury in the amount of $1,601,542.14. [Adv. Doc. No. 237].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   114. Of the $2.4 million that it initially sought to recover by initiating the instant adversary proceeding, Elbar has now received a total of $1,683,915.42: $82,373.28 from the IRS in the Prins' Bankruptcy plus $1,601,542.14 from the Prins' Criminal Case. [Adv. Doc. No. 237]. Thus, in this adversary proceeding, Elbar now seeks the return of $716,084.58 in order to be made whole (i.e., $2,400,000.00 minus $1,683,915.42 equals $716,084.58). Additionally, Elbar seeks to recover attorneys' fees for the prosecution of this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   115. For their part, United Sentry, TransWorld, and Industry Drive seek to recover from Elbar all of the attorneys' fees that they have incurred in defending themselves against the claims brought by Elbar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Vincent Bustamante\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Bustamante gave testimony both as a fact witness and as an expert witness. With respect to serving as a fact witness, the Court finds that Bustamante, for the most part, forthrightly answered the questions posed to him, and therefore the Court finds that he is a credible witness and gives some measure of weight to his testimony. The Court wants to emphasize, however, that this finding is not to be construed as this Court condoning Bustamante's apparent belief that it is acceptable to violate the automatic stay by: (1) wiring funds to Prins with the knowledge that the Property was protected by the automatic stay, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 38-41]; and (2) filing a lis pendens against the Property with the knowledge that the Property was protected by the automatic stay, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 89].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   With respect to serving as an expert witness, the Court does not find Bustamante to be credible when he suggests that it is acceptable to consummate any foreclosure sale knowing that the automatic stay is in place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it is no mean\n   point that Bustamante was a party in the case of\n   <em>\n    Bustamante v. Cueva\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Cueva)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9227380,9232229\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/232/\">\n    371 F.3d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2004), where he purchased property at a foreclosure sale that was subject to the automatic stay. The Fifth Circuit held that the foreclosure sale was void because this sale had been held in violation of the stay-and that therefore Bustamante was not entitled to a deed-and this ruling was issued despite the fact that Bustamante, at the time he purchased the property, was himself unaware of the bankruptcy filing. If the Fifth Circuit can hold that a foreclosure sale is void because of the automatic stay and deny Bustamante's request for a deed even though Bustamante was unaware of the bankruptcy's existence, then assuredly the Fifth Circuit would hold that the foreclosure sale in the suit at bar is void because of the automatic stay and Elbar is not entitled to a deed when\n   <strong>\n    Bustamante knew that the stay was in effect\n   </strong>\n   . Essentially, Bustamante's expert testimony at the trial was an attempt to convince this Court to disregard controlling Fifth Circuit law.

Todd Prins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Court finds that Prins is a dishonest individual whose credibility is sorely lacking. After all, Prins, among other despicable acts, did the following: (1) he improperly transferred the Proceeds from the IOLTA to the IRS, to the Wells Fargo Operating Account, and to the BBVA Operating Account, and used many of these funds for his own personal benefit, [Finding of Fact Nos. 46-50, 57, 59]; (2) he lied at the hearing held on November 8, 2016, when he stated-in response to a question by Elbar's counsel-that the $2.4 million was still in the IOLTA when in fact he had already transferred these funds out of the IOLTA and had begun using them, [Finding of Fact No. 58]; (3) he lied at the hearing held on November 8, 2016, when he stated-in response to a question by this Court-that he was ill at home in San Antonio when in fact he was in London, England with his wife and two children on a trip that was made possible through his use of a portion of the Proceeds that he had stolen, [Finding of Fact Nos. 58-59]; (4) on April 6, 2016, he fabricated a letter on the letterhead of Linebarger (outside counsel for the Tax Assessor) setting forth that TransWorld owed taxes of $169,807.29 in order to trick Ms. Cash into delivering a check for this amount to Prins, which he deposited into the IOLTA, and thereafter spent for his own purposes, [Finding of Fact Nos. 9-10]; and (5) on December 5, 2016, he impersonated an employee of BBVA Compass Bank on a conference call with MacKenzie in an effort to convince MacKenzie that Prins had not spent the Proceeds and that these funds were still in the IOLTA, [Finding of Fact No. 75]. These five examples by no means represent the universe of Prins' skullduggery-there are many more. However, for purposes\n   of this credibility section, these five examples underscore his lack of trustworthiness; and because he is not trustworthy, this Court does not give much weight to Prins' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Indeed, given his outrageous behavior this Court would ordinarily give no weight whatsoever to any of his testimony. However, there is one reason to give at least some weight to portions of his testimony, much of which was given by deposition in this adversary proceeding on November 15, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is this: on June 7, 2017, Prins entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, [Finding of Fact No. 101]; therefore, it behooved him thereafter to cooperate in all matters involving the Proceeds-as he believed that his cooperation (or lack thereof) might affect the length of the prison sentence to be imposed by the U.S. District Court in the Prins' Criminal Case. This Court has reviewed the transcript of Prins' deposition and finds that, in some instances, his testimony on certain discrete issues appears to be truthful. Thus, in rendering its findings of fact and conclusions of law for this adversary proceeding this Court does give some weight to certain portions of Prins' testimony-being careful of course to take even this testimony with a grain of salt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

TransWorld, Industry Drive, and United Sentry argue that if this Court is to find in Elbar's favor on any of Elbar's claims, the most Elbar can recover is $200,000.00, as that is the amount of money Elbar itself contributed to the purchase price of the Property, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Adv.

There is no doubt that if this Court grants the relief requested by Elbar, Elbar will recover all of the $200,000.00 from the Proceeds presently in the registry of this Court. Thus, there is no question that Elbar has constitutional standing to bring this suit and to recover a judgment for up to its $200,000.00 share of the Proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The question therefore is whether Elbar may prosecute this adversary proceeding in order to recover a judgment for not only its own $200,000.00, but also for the $2.2 million contributed by the other Purchasers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Elbar's expert witness, Bustamante, testified that Elbar's share of the $2.4 million that was wired to Prins was only $200,000.00;\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   he further testified that of the Proceeds wire transferred to the IOLTA, $800,000.00 was contributed by Abdullatif, another $800,000.00 was contributed by Jabbour, and the remaining $800,000.00 was contributed by himself. [Finding of Fact No. 53]. Yet, none of these individuals are plaintiffs in the suit at bar; Elbar is the only plaintiff here. The Court therefore must consider Elbar's prudential standing to bring this adversary proceeding: that is, whether Elbar-as the sole plaintiff-can obtain a judgment for the full amount paid by all of the Purchasers, as opposed to just the $200,000.00 paid by Elbar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Elbar's Prudential Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Elbar easily meets two of the prudential standing grounds.

Even though the eleven cashier's checks, and later the wire-transfer of the Proceeds, came from Abdullatif, Jabbour, and Bustamante themselves, it is clear that Elbar was the contemplated purchaser of the Property at the foreclosure sale. First, Twyman-who is a vice president of Elbar-was the individual who attended the foreclosure sale (and was the successful highest bidder) as a representative of Elbar. [Finding of Fact No. 32]. Second, even though the money came from Bustamante himself, the four cashier's checks (that were not from Abdullatif and Jabbour) given to Shum at the foreclosure sale on October 4, 2016, were made payable to the order of Elbar. [Finding of Fact No. 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 20]. Third, the receipt tendered by Shum-that is signed by both Shum as substitute trustee and Twyman as Elbar's vice president-sets forth that payment was received from Elbar. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 20]. Fourth, Bustamante testified that when purchasing real property, the individuals (and Elbar itself) provide the funds to purchase properties as their beneficial owners, and that Elbar then acquires the legal title to the properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Finding\n   of Fact Nos. 30-31, 33; Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 91:2-10; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 142:5-145:5]. Similarly, Klaimy testified that when buying property, the property is only titled in Elbar's name because \"[t]his is, kind of, like a requirement, that if a group of people are buying it, the property goes into Elbar, because Elbar is a registered company and has been doing business for a long time, and they do business legally.\" [TransWorld's Ex. JJ, Klaimy Dep. 12:1-10]. Moreover, Abdullatif testified that he participates in buying properties with Elbar and that Bustamante, as an officer of Elbar, is in charge of the purchase. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 165:13-16, 166:21-167:4, 167:8-15, 168:11-12]. Hence, even though the wire of the $2.4 million came from Abdullatif, Abdullatif wire transferred the $2.4 million at the direction of Elbar, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 167:21-25], and for the benefit of all the Purchasers, [\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 168:11-12]. Likewise, Jabbour testified that at the foreclosure sale on the Property, Elbar did the bidding and the Purchasers put up the money for the purchase of the Property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172:9-12]. Jabbour also testified that he relied on Bustamante to sort out whatever he needed to do next to complete the purchase of the Property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173:19-22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Fifth, before the wire transfer of the $2.4 million was sent to the IOLTA, Bustamante requested that the wire show Elbar as the sending party. [Pl.'s Ex. 31]. Sixth, all of the correspondence after the occurrence of the foreclosure sale on October 4, 2016, concerning the return of the cashier's checks and payment by wire was between Shum/Prins and Twyman, as the attorney and vice president representing Elbar. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. 21-31]. Thus, the evidence shows that Elbar, although not fronting all of the money for the purchase of the Property, was the intended legal purchaser of the Property. All of the above described circumstances show that the Purchasers were the intended third-party beneficiaries of the agreement that Elbar entered into with United Sentry's substitute trustees to purchase the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   These circumstances make Elbar a real party in interest pursuant to FRCP 17(a)(1)(F), as Elbar is \"a party with whom\n   or in whose name a contract has been made for another's benefit.\" As Elbar is a real party in interest to this adversary proceeding, Elbar has prudential standing to prosecute this action and seek the remaining funds ($716,084.58) it has yet to collect on behalf of all Purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   For all these reasons, Elbar has the right to prosecute this suit on behalf of itself and all other Purchasers seeking a judgment to recover all amounts still owed to all of the Purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

An act to obtain title to estate property violates the stay pursuant to the very language of \u00a7 362(a)(3). The sole objective of any purchaser at a foreclosure sale in giving money to the trustee is to have the trustee execute and deliver to the money-giver a deed to the property.

The Fifth Circuit, articulating a concept called \"arguable\" property of the estate, held that if there is a bona fide dispute over whether a debtor has an interest in certain real property, then the non-debtor party should assume that it is indeed property of the estate that is protected by the automatic stay; and that the non-debtor party should therefore\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   proceed to foreclose, but rather should file a motion to lift stay requesting approval from the bankruptcy court to go forward with the foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8929432,8921976\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fifth Circuit cogently explained its reasoning for this holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   Whether an asset is property of the estate is a legal determination which frequently entails complex analyses involving a number of legal elements and a variety of facts ....

Elbar's second willful violation of the automatic stay further underscores Elbar's cavalier attitude towards the automatic stay and abiding by the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Elbar's business model and prior litigation history regarding foreclosure sales make its willful violations of the stay on October 6, 2016, and January 3, 2017, particularly egregious-which in turn makes this Court's finding of Elbar's bad faith and lack of equitable and righteous dealing even more pronounced. Elbar's entire business is based upon conducting research about real properties that have been posted for foreclosure, deciding on which properties to bid, and then attending and participating at these sales. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 53:9-11, 111:24-112:15, 112:25-113:2, 113:16 -22, 114:4-7; TransWorld's Ex. JJ, Klaimy Dep. 7:10-18, 8:14-18, 13:5-7, 13:17-14:7]. Elbar has been pursuing this business model for approximately 34 years, and has frequently participated in sales where the owner of the property has filed for bankruptcy. [TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 67:15-20, 182:6-10; TransWorld's Ex. JJ, Klaimy Dep. 13:13-15; Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 134:11-14]. So, there is no question that Elbar is an\n   <strong>\n    extremely sophisticated\n   </strong>\n   entity that understands that property owners frequently file bankruptcy petitions at the last second in order to stop the foreclosure process through the imposition of the automatic stay. Indeed, Elbar's in-house counsel-Twyman-has a substantial background himself representing home lenders in consumer bankruptcy cases in the Southern District of Texas before joining Elbar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   He, of all people,\n   knows that once a participant in a foreclosure sale receives notice of the property owner's bankruptcy filing, the automatic stay immediately bars all participants from taking any further steps to consummate the sale. So, in the suit at bar, Elbar cannot gain any sympathy from this Court (as it analyzes all of the facts and circumstances) on the grounds that it is inexperienced in participating at foreclosure sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   The circumstances here are similar to\n   <em>\n    In re Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6519276\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/147/955/\">\n    147 B.R. 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 1992). In\n   <em>\n    In re Burke\n   </em>\n   , the court found that a \"local investor who purchases foreclosure properties on the courthouse steps\" acted in willful violation of the automatic stay when two public records (i.e., a lis pendens filed against the property and a judgment lien against the property) existed prior to the foreclosure sale that connected the property to the debtor's bankruptcy, even though there was no evidence presented that the investor had actual knowledge of the bankruptcy estate's interest in the property.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6519276\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/147/955/\">\n    147 B.R. at 957-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite there being no evidence that the investor had actual knowledge of the estate's interest in the property, the court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   [The investor]'s purchase of the property was a deliberate attempt to exercise control over estate property and he is deemed to have had notice of the bankruptcy estate's interest such that he should have known of that interest.\n   <strong>\n    [The investor] is not an innocent consumer who purchased this property for a residence. He is an inveterate investor in distress properties and a regular buyer of foreclosure property. As such a higher standard of knowledge foreshadows his actions\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6519276\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/147/955/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6519276\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/147/955/\">\n    at 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, too, the Purchasers are very experienced and established investors in distressed properties and are regular purchasers of properties sold at foreclosure sales. [Finding of Fact Nos. 30-34]. As such, as in\n   <em>\n    In re Burke\n   </em>\n   , the Purchasers are held to a higher standard, i.e., they are required to do greater due diligence in determining whether the property to be sold at a foreclosure sale is owned by someone who is in bankruptcy. For example, here, once Twyman learned on October 5, 2016, from the Prins Law Firm that the Debtor took the position that she had an interest in the Property pursuant to a deed, Twyman could have asked Prins, or Shum, or Payne (the Debtor's bankruptcy attorney), for a copy of this deed in order to determine the strength of the Debtor's assertion that she did own an interest in the Property on the date of the filing of her bankruptcy petition. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 37]. Had Twyman taken this action, he would have-or at least should have-informed Bustamante that the Property was arguably property of the estate and that therefore the automatic stay was in effect, and that Bustamante would therefore be violating the stay by wire transferring funds to the IOLTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   But, there is more. Not only are Elbar and Bustamante experienced in participating at foreclosure sales, they are also experienced in appeals involving foreclosure sale disputes. Indeed, Elbar and Bustamante have been on the losing end of two disputes that have resulted in published opinions from the Fifth Circuit:\n   <em>\n    Elbar Investments Inc. v. Pierce\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Pierce)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1437332,9247366\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/91/927/\">\n    91 F.

These two opinions merit inclusion in this Court's weighing of the equities based upon the totality of the\n   circumstances when assessing whether Elbar should prevail on its claims for equitable subrogation, money had and received, and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Pierce\n   </em>\n   , Elbar purchased property at a judicial tax sale without knowledge of the bankruptcy petition and automatic stay.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1437332,9247366\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/91/927/\">\n    91 F.

To the extent that Elbar suggests that it has clean hands because \u00a7 362(d) allows it-or, United Sentry-to seek to annul the stay in order to overcome any violation of the stay, this Court disagrees. The problem with this position is that there is ample case law holding that only innocent parties-in-interest who had no knowledge of the bankruptcy-and therefore no notice that the automatic stay was in effect-are able to obtain annulment of the stay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The Deed of Trust also expressly states what Prins, as trustee and agent of United Sentry, has the authority to do with the proceeds generated from a foreclosure sale. [Finding of Fact No. 12]. Specifically, the Deed of Trust states that the trustee, if requested by the beneficiary to foreclose on the lien shall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n   1.

Did Prins, as United Sentry's agent, in fact stay within the authority conferred upon him by the Deed of Trust?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   He most certainly did not. The Deed of Trust did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   authorize Prins to steal the Proceeds and use them for his own personal benefit. Indeed, the Deed of Trust did not authorize Prins: (1) to hold the sale\n   <strong>\n    after learning about the Debtor's bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n   , [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 29]; or (2) to accept the $2.4 million wire transfer from Elbar\n   <strong>\n    at a time when he knew of the Debtor's filing of her bankruptcy petition and her position that she owned the Property\n   </strong>\n   , [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 29, 36, 39, 40]. Stated differently, the Deed of Trust did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   authorize Prins to violate the automatic stay. Further, there was no trial testimony that MacKenzie expressly directed Prins to go forward with the foreclosure sale after MacKenzie learned about the Debtor's bankruptcy. To the contrary, MacKenzie testified at trial that it was Prins who decided to proceed with the sale on October 4, 2016, [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 256:17-19], and that October 11, 2016, was the first time Prins told MacKenzie that Elbar had wire transferred the Proceeds to the IOLTA, [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 221:3-10, 222:10-15; United Sentry's Ex. 1]. Therefore, Prins did not have actual authority to hold the foreclosure sale on the Property illegally or to accept the $2.4 million wire transfer from Elbar after the automatic stay was in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   The Court next considers the scope of any apparent authority Prins may have had. \"An agent's authority ... depends on some communication by the principal ... to the third party ( [to establish] apparent ... authority).\"\n   <em>\n    Utils.

Here, there was no testimony at trial that MacKenzie (or any other person who would be considered a principal of United Sentry) communicated\n   <strong>\n    at all\n   </strong>\n   with Elbar at the time of the foreclosure sale. Nor was there any testimony from any representatives of Elbar concerning any assumptions Elbar might have had regarding whether or not Prins was acting within the scope of authority given to him by United Sentry when he held the foreclosure sale after learning about the Debtor's bankruptcy and accepting the $2.4 million wire transfer from Elbar after the automatic stay was in place. As the party asserting the agency relationship, it was Elbar's burden to prove that apparent authority existed for Prins to take the actions that he did,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGowan &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203422366\">\n    2015 WL 3422366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 n.13, and this Elbar did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Even if it was within the scope of Prins' employment as trustee under the Deed of Trust to accept the $2.4 million wire transfer from Elbar after notice of the bankruptcy and imposition of the automatic stay, it is wholly unforeseeable that Prins, as trustee, would engage in such serious criminal activity after receiving the $2.4 million by absconding with all of the funds for his own personal benefit. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 46-50, 57]. It is so unforeseeable for a trustee under a deed of trust to misappropriate and steal such funds that even Elbar's own expert witness, Bustamante, testified that in his over 40 years of experience, he has never seen anything like Prins' misconduct. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 81:21-82:2]. Under Texas law, United Sentry simply cannot be held liable for Prins' unforeseeable serious and egregious criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917990\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/745/#p763\">\n    426 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   764 ;\n   <em>\n    Zarzana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8318121\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/218/152/#p160\">\n    218 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   160 ;\n   <em>\n    Adami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10135311\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/440/330/#p334\">\n    440 S.W.2d at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For all of these reasons, Prins was not acting as United Sentry's agent; therefore, United Sentry is not liable to Elbar for fraud in real estate transactions, common law fraud, or theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Finally, Prins, in first accepting and thereafter absconding with the $2.4 million, was acting adversely to the interest of United Sentry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

Any argument that the $2.4 million Prins took constituted his \"fee\" for acting as substitute trustee under the Deed of Trust is without merit. There is no question that any trustee under a deed of trust is entitled to a fee, and the Deed of Trust here certainly provided for a \"normal hourly fee\" for the trustee (i.e., Prins);\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   but, there is no question $2.4 million is not a normal hourly fee for Prins (or, for that matter, for any trustee selling property for $2.4 million). Moreover, while the Deed of\n   Trust did authorize Prins to distribute monies legitimately received from a valid foreclosure sale, it did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   authorize Prins to: (1) abscond with the $2.4 million from Elbar and go on a European vacation and spending spree, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 46, 47(E) ]; (2) use the Proceeds to pay his personal taxes, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 48]; (3) remit funds to clients, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 47(H) ]; or (4) pay employees' of the Prins Law Firm, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 47(B) ].

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 29, 36, 39-40, 46-50, 57]. And, because Prins had no authority from United Sentry to take these illegal actions, the claims brought by Elbar against United Sentry for fraud in real estate transactions, common law fraud, and the Texas Theft Liability Act must necessarily fail-indeed, Elbar has admitted that if this Court finds that Prins had no authority, then these claims must be denied.

First, Elbar has not shown that Prins made a \"material misrepresentation\" that caused Elbar to enter into a contract for the purchase of the Property, as required by the first type of statutory fraud set forth in Texas Business &amp; Commerce Code \u00a7 27.01. The evidence does not show that at the relevant time period (i.e., at the foreclosure sale of the Property), Prins made any material misrepresentations to induce Elbar to purchase the Property. Second, Elbar has also failed to meet its burden to show that Prins engaged in the second type of statutory fraud set forth in Texas Business &amp; Commerce Code \u00a7 27.01 : the evidence simply does not show that Prins made a false promise to do an act with the intention of not fulfilling it. There is nothing in the record evidencing that Prins did not intend to deliver the deed to the Property at the time the foreclosure sale took place on October 4, 2016. Further, he learned about the Debtor's bankruptcy and her claim that she had an interest in the Property it made sense for him not to deliver a deed to Elbar: to do so would have violated the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6538133\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/5/600/#p604\">\n    5 B.R. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 604 (Bankr.

Further, although Prins' testimony regarding the timing of his decision to take a trip overseas using a portion of the $2.4 million that was transferred to the IOLTA and subsequently transferred by Prins to the Wells Fargo Operating Account, has been contradictory,\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prins' testimony is clear that he did not form an intent to use the Proceeds for his own benefit until approximately\n   <em>\n    two weeks after\n   </em>\n   the foreclosure sale of the Property and Elbar's wire-transfer of the Proceeds to the IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 47(A) ]. Indeed, Elbar introduced no evidence to the contrary. There is also no evidence that at the time Elbar decided to purchase the Property at the foreclosure sale, Prins had already formed an intent to use the Proceeds to pay his own personal taxes, the salaries of the employees of the Prins Law Firm, and his personal attorneys (Hilley &amp; Solis and Seidler), or to return money to a former client, Carlos Pumarejo, that Prins had been holding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Finding of Fact No. 47].

As the court in\n   <em>\n    Arrow Marble, LLC v.

When a plaintiff's claims are dismissed with prejudice, the doctrine of res judicata prohibits the plaintiff from re-asserting his claims against that defendant in a later suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-366\">\n   Res judicata attaches to a dismissal with prejudice even though the plaintiff's claims have not been fully litigated at trial. Res judicata applies because a dismissal or nonsuit with prejudice is tantamount to a judgment on the merits, and the effect of res judicata in that instance works a permanent, inalterable change in the parties' legal relationship to the defendant's benefit: the defendant can never again be sued by the plaintiff or its privies for claims arising out of the same subject matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911234\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/702/#p706\">\n    441 S.W.3d at 706-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).

As discussed above, this Court has found that Prins had neither actual nor apparent authority from United Sentry to take the actions that he did: i.e., holding the foreclosure sale, despite being on notice of the Debtor's Chapter 7 case, then accepting the $2.4 million wire transfer in violation of the automatic stay, and then absconding with all of these funds for his own personal benefit. [Finding of Fact Nos. 29-41, 46-48]. And, because Prins had no authority from United Sentry to take these actions, the TTLA claim brought by Elbar against United Sentry must necessarily fail and the Court will therefore deny this claim with prejudice against United Sentry.

Tex. 2011) ). If Elbar means to argue that it should be subrogated to United Sentry's lien because the Property was subject to a non-judicial sale which, due to irregularities in the process (i.e., Prins stealing the Proceeds), failed to convey title, the Court still believes this argument fails, as discussed in more detail below, because \"the vendor's lien upon lands\" was never discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   United Sentry argues that Elbar is not entitled to equitable subrogation of United Sentry's interest on the Property because Elbar was negligent when it willfully violated the automatic stay, Elbar was aware of United Sentry's lien on the Property, and United Sentry will be extremely prejudiced if equitable subrogation is allowed. [Adv. Doc. No. 218 at 12-14 of 24]. United Sentry also argues that Elbar is not entitled to equitable subrogation because there is no evidence that Elbar discharged a lien on the Property. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 of 24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   The Court finds that Elbar has failed to satisfy all the elements to prevail under its equitable subrogation claim. Here, because\n   Prins stole the Proceeds, the debt to United Sentry-i.e., the balance owed under the Note-was never paid. The Fifth Circuit, citing the Texas Supreme Court, has stated that \"[a]s a general rule, a person is not entitled to subrogate to the rights of a creditor until the creditor's claim against the debtor has been satisfied or paid in full.\"\n   <em>\n    Dietrich Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513533\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/568/#p572\">\n    988 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   572 (citing\n   <em>\n    Providence Inst. for Sav.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10142450\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/441/516/#p519\">\n    441 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   519 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206016827\">\n    2011 WL 6016827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. United Sentry's claim-i.e., the balance due under the Note-has not been satisfied or paid in full due to Prins' theft of the Proceeds and, thus, Elbar is not entitled to equitable subrogation. Even assuming that Elbar's wire transfer of the Proceeds to Prins as the substitute trustee satisfied the requirement that the creditor's claim has been \"satisfied or paid in full\"-notwithstanding the fact that United Sentry has not received one cent of the Proceeds-this Court is still required to weigh the equities when determining whether a party is entitled to equitable subrogation.\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180264\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/291/#p300\">\n    257 S.W.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court now undertakes this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   The first factor a court may consider in conducting this balancing test is the negligence of the party claiming subrogation-in this instance, Elbar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180264\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/291/#p300\">\n    257 S.W.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"negligence\" of the party claiming subrogation is examined not in the strict legal sense in which one owes a duty, but rather whether the acts (or non-acts) of the party claiming subrogation were careless or sloppy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206016827\">\n    2011 WL 6016827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10 (describing negligence of the party claiming subrogation as not knowing the nature of their investments, failing to undertake due diligence, and presenting no proof they sought information about the loans they were extending or the loan documents, among other \"deficiencies\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, once Elbar received notice from Prins that one of the principals of Triple Gate (i.e., the Debtor) was claiming that the Property was deeded in her name personally and that she had filed for bankruptcy prior to the foreclosure sale, Elbar should have taken further action to determine the legitimacy of the Debtor's claim that the Property was deeded in her name-and therefore property of the estate\n   subject to the automatic stay-before Elbar wire transferred the Proceeds. Elbar received this information (i.e., that the Debtor was claiming that the Property was deeded in her name), at the latest, at 2:53 p.m. on October 5, 2016. [Finding of Fact No. 37]. Once Elbar received this information, Elbar should have, at the least, taken the following steps: (1) contacted Payne (the Debtor's attorney) to further investigate the Debtor's assertion that the Property was deeded in her name; (2) requested the unrecorded deed that the Debtor claimed transferred ownership of the Property from Triple Gate to herself and her husband; and/or (3) done its own title work on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   Elbar did none of these things. Instead of investigating whether a wire transfer of the $2.4 million purchase price would violate the automatic stay if in fact the Property had pre-petition been deeded to the Debtor, Elbar did nothing. Further, once it was confirmed the next day (prior to the Proceeds being wire transferred) that the Property had in fact been deeded to the Debtor pre-petition, Bustamante did not change his mind about wire-transferring the $2.4 million to Prins; stated differently, he did not worry that wiring the Proceeds would violate the automatic stay. [Finding of Fact Nos. 27-41]. In Bustamante's own words, \"We paid the money knowing about the bankruptcy. It doesn't get more complicated than that.\" [Finding of Fact No. 41]. Bustamante testified that he \"didn't know of any\" downside to tendering the $2.4 million when he already knew about the Debtor's bankruptcy filing. [TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 83:5-10]. In Bustamante's mind, one of two scenarios would happen if the Purchasers wire-transferred the money after learning about the bankruptcy filing and the automatic stay: the stay would either be annulled and the Purchasers would receive a deed to the Property or the stay would not be annulled and the Purchasers would receive their money back. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial. Tr. 96:25-97:4, 133:13-25, 135:2-6; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 190:6-17, 194:13-19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   Essentially, the Purchasers-and it must be kept in mind that Elbar is one of the Purchasers-were willing to roll the dice and see what happened when they violated the automatic stay by wire transferring the Proceeds; according to Bustamante, wiring the money (i.e., violating the automatic stay) was just something the Purchasers had to do to preserve their right to the Property. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial. Tr. 89:19-21, 133:13-134:10, 135:19-25; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 82:10-83:3]. Stated differently, it did not matter to the Purchasers that the Debtor held title to the Property and that the automatic stay was in effect; the Purchasers really wanted the Property and they were willing to violate the automatic stay to make sure its bid on the Property was secure. Elbar's failure to conduct due diligence regarding whether the Debtor held title to the Property-and, frankly, Elbar's bald apathy regarding violating the automatic stay as expressed by Bustamante's testimony\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   -lead this Court to find that this \"negligence\" factor weighs strongly against a finding that Elbar is subrogated to United Sentry's interest in the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206016827\">\n    2011 WL 6016827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10 (finding that negligence factor weighed against party seeking equitable subrogation when that party (1) did\n   not know the nature of their investments, (2) failed to undertake due diligence, and (3) presented no proof they sought information about the loans they were extending or the loan documents, among other \"deficiencies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   The second factor a court may consider is whether the party claiming subrogation had \"notice of other interests.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Kaleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206016827\">\n    2011 WL 6016827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.

As stated above, the only other interest related to the Property is United Sentry's Deed of Trust lien on the Property. United Sentry has filed a claim in the Main Case in the amount of $1,568,782.76. [Proof of Claim, Case No. 16-35021, Claim No. 12, at 2]. United Sentry has not received any funds from the Debtor's bankruptcy estate related to its claim. There is $1,719,062.93 in the registry of this Court as a result of the sale of the Property. [Finding of Fact No. 100]. Elbar has also filed a claim in the Main Case in the amount of $1,594,424.17, [Proof of Claim, Case No. 16-35021, Claim No. 11, at 2], and asserts in its pleadings that it is seeking the entire $2.4 million it wire transferred to the IOLTA. At trial, Battaglia correctly stated that any recovery Elbar receives as a result of the other actions it is pursuing will offset the amount of recovery Elbar seeks from this Court. Since the conclusion of the trial in this adversary proceeding Elbar has received $1,683,915.42 of the $2.4 million it seeks: specifically, Elbar received $1,601,542.14 from the Prins' Criminal Case and $82,373.28 from the Prins' Bankruptcy. [Finding of Fact Nos. 111, 113-114]. In order to be made whole, Elbar still seeks the amount of $716,084.58. Thus, United Sentry's interest in the Property will be prejudiced if its interests are subrogated to the $716,084.58 Elbar still seeks to recover. United Sentry's claim in the amount of $1,568,782.76 will be reduced to $565,804.41-but not paid in full-if Elbar is subrogated to United Sentry's interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   Stated differently, United Sentry will be prejudiced if equitable subrogation is allowed here. This factor therefore weighs against a finding that Elbar is subrogated to United Sentry's interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   Besides considering the three factors identified above when deciding whether equitable subrogation should apply in a particular suit, a court may also consider whether the party who is requesting equitable subrogation has come to the court with unclean hands.\n   <em>\n    Cho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203301529\">\n    2017 WL 3301529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"[E]quitable subrogation-like all equitable remedies-is sometimes denied to litigants who come to court with unclean hands.\").

For the doctrine to apply, a party's conduct does not need to be one punishable as a crime or one that would justify legal proceedings of any sort. Any willful act concerning the cause of action which rightfully can be said to transgress equitable standards of conduct is sufficient cause for the court to invoke the doctrine. The wrongful acts upon which the claim of unclean hands is premised must in some measure affect the equitable relations between the parties in respect of something brought before the court for adjudication. Plaintiff's alleged wrongdoing will not bar relief unless the defendant establishes personal injury resulting from plaintiff's conduct.

This, United Sentry cannot do. The unclean hands doctrine does not apply here because United Sentry is unable to show that it has been personally injured by Elbar's conduct. United Sentry's injury-the failure to receive payment of the balance due under the Note from the $2.4 million paid by Elbar at the foreclosure sale-was not caused by Elbar's actions, but rather by Prins' actions. Even though Elbar violated the automatic stay, Elbar does not have \"unclean hands\" because any injury United Sentry might suffer is due to Prins' actions, not Elbar's. Thus, the unclean hands doctrine does not come into play as the Court weighs the equities in this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   Another factor to consider when weighing the equities based on the totality of the circumstances is that United Sentry is the party who selected Prins to serve as the substitute trustee. MacKenzie has known Prins for approximately 20 years and during that time, Prins occasionally performed legal work for MacKenzie. [Finding of Fact No. 13]. Prior to Prins stealing the Proceeds, during the time that MacKenzie knew Prins and Prins performed legal work for MacKenzie, MacKenzie did not have any indication that Prins might be engaged-to use MacKenzie's own words-in \"questionable activities.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 92:21-93:4]. MacKenzie, for his part, did everything he could to protect and return the Proceeds to Elbar. After Twyman directly contacted MacKenzie around the beginning of November 2016 and asked him to instruct Prins to return the Proceeds to Elbar, MacKenzie, at Prins' suggestion, had Prins draft a release-which MacKenzie immediately signed and returned to both Prins and Twyman-so that the Proceeds could quickly be returned to the Purchasers. [Finding of Fact No. 68 and Footnote 39]. After MacKenzie began to suspect that something suspicious was going on with Prins, it was MacKenzie who contacted the FBI and provided assistance to the FBI regarding the recovery of approximately $1.6 million of the Proceeds. [Finding of Fact No. 73]. It was MacKenzie's actions that led to the FBI becoming involved and ultimately seizing the funds in the Wells Fargo Operating Account. [Finding of Fact No. 82]. The $1,601,542.14, that was seized by the FBI in the Wells Fargo Operating Account\n   eventually went to Elbar as restitution in the Prins' Criminal Case. [Finding of Fact No. 113]. MacKenzie also tried to safeguard the Proceeds-once he became suspicious of Prins-by paying for two ex-Texas Rangers to watch Prins and Ms. Prins 24 hours a day, so that MacKenzie would be alerted if Prins or Ms. Prins attempted to leave the country. [Finding of Fact No. 76]. Thus, although it was MacKenzie who selected Prins to serve as the substitute trustee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was also MacKenzie who played a significant role in the recovery of approximately 66% of the Proceeds in the Wells Fargo Operating Account. The funds that were recovered from the Wells Fargo Operating Account have been given\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to Elbar-the other individuals and entities who are to receive restitution pursuant to Prins' plea agreement did not receive any of these funds, nor did United Sentry, which, it must be remembered, held the lien on the Property that has since been sold by order of this Court. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 113]. The work MacKenzie did in helping to recover these funds directly and solely benefitted Elbar. Thus, under all of these circumstances, the Court views the fact that MacKenzie chose Prins to serve as the substitute trustee under the Deed of Trust as a neutral factor when weighing the equities based on the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   Finally, the Court emphasizes that the \"general purpose of equitable subrogation is 'to prevent the unjust enrichment of the\n   <em>\n    debtor\n   </em>\n   who owed the debt that is paid.' \"\n   <em>\n    Babu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320759\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/340/917/#p926\">\n    340 S.W.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    First Nat'l Bank of Kerrville v.

[Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 24 of 35, \u00b6 53]. Elbar further argues that TransWorld had notice of Prins' poor financial condition. [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 21-23 of 35, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50]. Essentially, Elbar argues that TransWorld does not meet the requirements, as articulated by\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   and other cases, to qualify as an exception to the general rule that one who acquires stolen property does not acquire its title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   TransWorld argues that Elbar's claim for money had and received fails for lack of tracing because Elbar gave its $200,000.00 share directly to Bustamante and there was no testimony that Bustamante used this exact $200,000.00 to fund (in part) the purchase of the Property. [Adv. Doc. No. 216 at 15-25 of 43]. Unlike conversion, \"tracing\" is not an element of the claim of money had and received,\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   and this argument therefore fails. In any event, there is no question that the $164,807.29 Prins gave to TransWorld on\n   October 21, 2016, from the Wells Fargo Operating Account is directly traceable to the Proceeds. [Finding of Fact Nos. 46-50].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   To be successful on its claim for money had and received, Elbar must show that the $164,807.29 Prins gave to TransWorld, in equity and good conscience, belongs to Elbar.\n   <em>\n    Plains Expl. &amp; Prod.

The Court first considers the \"good conscience\" element.

When determining whether Elbar has shown that TransWorld holds money which in \"good conscience\" belongs to Elbar, this Court will examine in turn each of the three considerations identified by the court in\n   <em>\n    GE Capital Commercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   -\"due course of business,\" \"in good faith,\" and \"for valuable consideration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   <em>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     \"Good Conscience\" Considerations\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Good Conscience: Due Course of Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   Elbar argues that there was no evidence that the $164,807.29 that Prins paid to TransWorld on October 21, 2016, was received in the due course of TransWorld's business of leasing property. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 24 of 35, \u00b6 53; Adv. Doc. No. 230 at 6 of 19, \u00b6 18]. TransWorld argues that a business paying its taxes and/or settling its tax disputes-as TransWorld believed it was doing when Prins gave TransWorld the $164,807.29 on October 21, 2016, and told it that TransWorld had settled its outstanding issues with the Tax Assessor for $5,000.00-falls within the due course of a business. [Adv. Doc. No. 225 at 13-14, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   The Court finds that settling a tax dispute is not in the due or ordinary course of TransWorld's business. TransWorld is a leasing company. [Finding of Fact No. 1]. If, for example, Prins had wanted to lease a truck and gave TransWorld $164,807.29 in order to lease that truck, then the $164,807.29 TransWorld received from Prins would have been received in the \"due course\" of TransWorld's business-i.e., leasing personalty. Here, however, at least from TransWorld's point of view, the $164,807.29 Prins gave TransWorld represented a settlement with the Tax Assessor over outstanding tax issues. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 50].

[Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 24 of 35, \u00b6 53]. Moreover, Elbar argues that TransWorld had notice about Prins' poor financial condition because (1) Ms. Cash testified that she was curious as to why TransWorld's check to the Tax Assessor in 2008 for taxes due was made out to the IOLTA instead of directly to the Tax Assessor; (2) Ms. Cash testified that in January of 2016 she discovered that TransWorld was listed in the local newspaper as one of the largest delinquent taxpayers in San Antonio; and (3) TransWorld was listed as a creditor in the Prins' Bankruptcy and, thus, had notice of all proceedings in the Prins' Bankruptcy. [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 21-23 of 35, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50]. Citing no case law, Elbar further argues that after experiencing continued issues with TransWorld's taxes after Prins claimed they had been paid, TransWorld had a \"duty of inquiry that could not be satisfied by simply continuing to rely solely on information obtained from Prins\" and that TransWorld's continued reliance on Prins from 2008 to 2016 was not reasonable. [Adv. Doc. No. 230 at 15-16 of 19, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40]. Elbar further argues that after TransWorld learned about the Prins' Bankruptcy, TransWorld should have continually monitored the Prins' Bankruptcy and doing so would have led to notice of the contents of the Wasserteil Motion to Lift Stay and the Ozer Adversary, both of which made allegations regarding Prins' wrongful conduct towards the Wasserteils and the Ozers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 230 at 16-17 of 19, \u00b6 41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   TransWorld argues that the good faith element is met because TransWorld did not acquire the $164,807.29 in an unlawful manner and there is no evidence that TransWorld knew that the funds were stolen. [Adv. Doc. No. 216 at 33 of 43]. TransWorld further argues that Ms. Cash did not know about the Prins' Bankruptcy until October 21, 2016, and-citing Elbar's Amended Complaint-that even if TransWorld had known about the Prins' Bankruptcy prior to receiving the $164,807.29, there is no evidence to suggest that such knowledge should have put TransWorld on notice that the $164,807.29 Prins paid to TransWorld might have been stolen. [Adv. Doc. No. 216 at 35-37 of 43].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   The Court finds that TransWorld received the $164,807.29 in good faith. TransWorld had been working, through Prins, from sometime in 2008 through October 2016 to sort out the tax issues TransWorld believed it had with the Tax Assessor. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 19:7-21:14]. Because of his poor health, it was very important to Mr. Cash to resolve all outstanding issues with the business that he founded, TransWorld, as soon as possible. [Finding of Fact Nos. 7, 49]. Ms. Cash testified that she believed that the $164,807.29 TransWorld received from Prins on October 21, 2016-which represented the amount it had paid to the IOLTA on May 17, 2016, in order to resolve the tax issues with the Tax Assessor, minus $5,000.00-represented a settlement with the Tax Assessor regarding TransWorld's outstanding tax issues, and that the money it was receiving from Prins was TransWorld's own money, less $5,000.00 paid for the settlement. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 22:5-15]. As noted in the Credibility of Witnesses Section, the Court has found Ms. Cash to be a very credible witness. Further, Prins himself testified that he told TransWorld that the matter with the Tax Assessor was settled for $5,000.00, [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 96:19-97:3], and that is why TransWorld would be receiving back from Prins the amount of $164,807.29, [Finding of Fact No. 50]. Having known Prins as a personal friend for several years, and also having trusted him as TransWorld's attorney for this same period of time, [Finding of Fact No. 2], this Court finds that Ms. Cash was reasonable to believe that Prins' representation was truthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   Additionally, Ms. Cash has testified that she did not know about the Prins' Bankruptcy until after TransWorld received the $164,807.29. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 163:3-21]. Even if Ms. Cash and/or TransWorld had learned about the Prins' Bankruptcy prior to receiving the $164,807.29 from Prins, the mere fact that Prins had personally filed for bankruptcy would not automatically put the Cashes and/or TransWorld on notice that any business dealings with Prins should be suspect. As TransWorld pointed out in its briefing, the vast majority of people who file for bankruptcy every year do so in good faith. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 216, at 36 of 43]. Prins had worked as TransWorld's attorney for almost two decades, and Prins had a personal relationship with the Cashes, and they trusted him. [Finding of Fact No. 2]. Prins also had no history of professional misconduct that could put a client on notice-at least the Cashes-that Prins was not the upright attorney he presented\n   as. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 12:1-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Elbar's argument that TransWorld lacked good faith because it continued to rely upon Prins as its attorney once the tax issues were brought to its attention in January 2014 and January 2016. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 5, 9-10]. While it may be true that a reasonable business would have conducted a more thorough investigation once tax issues that it believed were settled in 2008 were twice again brought up in 2014 and 2016, TransWorld's reliance on Prins-which perhaps could be characterized as na\u00efve-was honest. Only when the receiver of the money has actual knowledge that the money was stolen will the receiver of the money be found to be not in \"good faith\": \"[M]ere ground of suspicion of defect of title, or knowledge of circumstances which would excite such suspicion in the mind of a prudent man, or gross negligence on the part of the taker, will not defeat title.\n   <strong>\n    Bad faith alone will defeat the right of the taker without knowledge\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merchants' Loan &amp; Trust Co. v.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 of 43].

[Adv. Doc.

Even if TransWorld is correct regarding the general proposition that satisfaction of an antecedent debt constitutes valuable consideration in Texas, in the dispute at bar, there was no antecedent debt that was satisfied when Prins gave TransWorld the $164,807.29 because there was no actual settlement between TransWorld and the Tax Assessor. As such, no consideration passed between those two parties. \"Consideration is a present exchange bargained for in return for a promise. It consists of either a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee. The detriment must induce the making of the promise, and the promise must induce the incurring of the detriment.\"\n   <em>\n    Roark v. Stallworth Oil &amp; Gas, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9984037\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/813/492/#p496\">\n    813 S.W.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (Tex. 1991) (internal citations omitted). In order for the exchange of \"valuable consideration\" to occur, there must be two parties to the promise. Here, the Tax Assessor was not a party to any alleged settlement with TransWorld in October of 2016. [Finding of Fact No. 50]. Indeed, Prins testified that he lied to TransWorld about the settlement and that none actually existed. [Finding of Fact No. 50]. There can be no consideration exchanged when only one of the parties to the alleged promise is aware of the promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   TransWorld's argument that forbearance constitutes valuable consideration-i.e., TransWorld not pursuing any claims against Prins-also fails. Again, this argument fails because there was no present bargained-for exchange between Prins and TransWorld specifically setting out that TransWorld would not pursue any potential claims against Prins as long as Prins paid back TransWorld all the money he owed to TransWorld. In order for the exchange of consideration to occur, there must be two parties to the promise. There is absolutely no evidence indicating that Prins and TransWorld exchanged consideration on this subject. For example, there is no evidence that TransWorld signed a release of all claims it had-or might have-against Prins when he gave the $164,807.29 to TransWorld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   Thus, in determining whether Elbar has shown that TransWorld holds money which \"in good conscience\" belongs to Elbar, of the three considerations identified by the court in\n   <em>\n    GE Capital Commercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , one weighs in favor of TransWorld and the other two weigh in favor of Elbar. Specifically, TransWorld received the\n   $164,807.29 from Prins in good faith. However, TransWorld did not receive the $164,807.29 from Prins in \"due course of business,\" nor did TransWorld give valuable consideration for the $164,807.29. Under these circumstances, Elbar has satisfied the first element of its claim against TransWorld for money had and received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   The second element the Court must consider is whether the equities of the case \"in view of the totality of the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180264\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/291/#p300\">\n    257 S.W.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , show that TransWorld holds money that belongs to Elbar. When balancing these equities, a court may consider, but is not limited to, the following: (1) any detrimental reliance suffered by the defendant;\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the plaintiff's unclean hands;\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) \"what the parties knew and intended.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   <em>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     \"Balancing the Equities\" Considerations\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Balancing the Equities: Detrimental Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   TransWorld argues that it materially changed its position in reliance on the payment, which it claims is a full defense to a claim for money had and received.

Republic Nat'l Bank of Dallas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9970232,9970138\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/619/399/\">\n    619 S.W.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (Tex. 1981). While TransWorld argues in its briefs that it materially changed its position once it received the $164,807.29 by no longer pursuing Prins or other possible legal remedies against Prins that were available at the time, there was\n   <em>\n    no testimony adduced or exhibits introduced\n   </em>\n   that TransWorld was even considering legal action against Prins, let alone that TransWorld changed its position of \"going after\" Prins for the $164,807.29, after Prins returned the $164,807.29. At the time Prins returned the $164,807.29 to TransWorld on October 21, 2016, TransWorld was under the impression that it was getting back the $164,807.29 because Prins had negotiated a settlement with the Tax Assessor on TransWorld's behalf, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 50]; TransWorld had no idea at that point in time that the $164,807.29 Prins gave it could be traced to Elbar and that in fact no settlement with the Tax Assessor had taken place, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 50]. There is absolutely no evidence in the record to the\n   effect that TransWorld had a strategy of pursuing legal remedies against Prins prior to the $164,807.29 being returned to TransWorld, and that the return of the $164,807.29 in fact caused TransWorld to materially change its position to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   pursue any legal remedies against Prins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   Further, Ms. Cash testified that she did not discover until late February of 2017 when she was served with a lawsuit that Prins had not, in fact, resolved TransWorld's tax issues, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 92]. Thus, any impetus for TransWorld to pursue legal action against Prins related to the $164,807.29 (or other amounts related to taxes Prins supposedly paid on TransWorld's behalf but did not) arose in late February 2017-when Ms. Cash found out for the first time that the check in the amount of $230,853.66 that TransWorld made to the order of the IOLTA on February 4, 2008, (for the purpose of Prins settling TransWorld's tax dispute with the Tax Assessor) may not have in fact been paid to the Tax Assessor, [Finding of Fact No. 92]. Since Prins gave TransWorld the $164,807.29 on October 21, 2016, and the earliest possible date that TransWorld states that it learned that Prins was not being honest in its dealings with TransWorld was late February of 2017, then TransWorld could not possibly have materially changed its position on reliance of the payment of $164,807.29 when the first indication that TransWorld received that Prins was not being honest with TransWorld regarding the tax issues occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   October 21, 2016. Thus, any detrimental reliance allegedly suffered by TransWorld does not come into play as the Court weighs the equities in regards to Elbar's claim of money had and received against TransWorld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Balancing the Equities: Unclean Hands\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Section IV.D.5 regarding equitable subrogation, in the Fifth Circuit, \"[t]he alleged wrongdoing of the plaintiff does not bar relief unless the defendant can show that he has personally been injured by the plaintiff's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell Bros.

Here, TransWorld is unable to show that it has been personally injured by Elbar's conduct. Any injury suffered by TransWorld is due solely to Prins' conduct relating to his representation of TransWorld in its tax issues with the Tax Assessor. Further, even though Elbar broke the law when it violated the automatic stay, TransWorld was not personally injured by this act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   Finally, even if this Court were to find that TransWorld was liable for at least some percentage of Elbar's claim for money had and received, the source of TransWorld's injury (i.e., having to pay Elbar all or some portion of the $164,807.29) is due to Prins' misconduct of stealing the $2.4 million, not any misconduct of Elbar. Thus, the unclean hands doctrine does not come into play as the Court weighs the equities in regards to Elbar's claim of money had and received against TransWorld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Balancing the Equities: What the Parties Knew and Intended\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   \"What the parties knew and intended are all relevant factors in balancing the equities ....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hwang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762417\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/452/187/#p194\">\n    452 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   194 (citing\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180264\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/291/#p300\">\n    257 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   300 ). This factor weighs heavily in favor of TransWorld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   What Elbar \"knew and intended\" demonstrates that Elbar has little respect for the Bankruptcy Code and has acted solely in its perceived best interests. Elbar violated the automatic stay on October 4, 2016, when it was the highest bidder at the foreclosure sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761386\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/392/666/#p671\">\n    392 B.R. at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the foreclosure sale, conducted the day after the filing of\n   the Bankruptcy Petition, constituted an act 'to obtain possession of property of the estate' in violation of \u00a7 362\") (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) );\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

It does not matter that Elbar did not know that the Debtor had filed for bankruptcy at the time of the foreclosure sale; a technical stay violation occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   If this had been the only violation of the automatic stay, the Court would perhaps have more sympathy for Elbar. However, two days later, on October 6, 2016, Elbar\n   <strong>\n    willfully\n   </strong>\n   violated the automatic stay when it wire transferred the $2.4 million into the IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 40];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9122708\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/293/234/\">\n    293 B.R. at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]ayment of the bid price must be regarded as an 'act to obtain possession of property of the estate.' \");\n   <em>\n    In re Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116202\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/75/572/#p574\">\n    75 B.R. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that post-petition action taken by purchaser to perfect a pre-petition sale of debtor's real property \"was an attempt to affect and exercise control over the bankruptcy estate's interest in the [d]ebtor's real property, contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)\");\n   <em>\n    In re Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343925\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/296/537/#p543\">\n    296 B.R. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that postpetition foreclosure sale, where foreclosing creditor received notice of bankruptcy filing, violated the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a) ).

II, Bustamante Dep. 228:17-20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   There is even more. Elbar willfully violated the automatic stay for a\n   <strong>\n    second\n   </strong>\n   time when it filed a lis pendens against the Property on January 3, 2017. [Finding of Fact No. 89]. As discussed more fully\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Section IV.C, Elbar's two willful violations of the automatic stay-particularly when Elbar is a sophisticated purchaser who has been involved in hundreds of foreclosure sales where the debtor was in bankruptcy, [Finding of Fact Nos. 30-31, 33-34, 41]-lead this Court to find Elbar's stay violations egregious and in bad faith, and this finding works heavily against Elbar as the Court weighs the equities of what \"the parties knew and intended.\" Elbar intended to preserve its ability to complete the purchase of the Property, [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 133:13-134:10], and Elbar's two willful stay violations show the extreme lengths Elbar was willing to go to meet that goal. Elbar is not an innocent party here;\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is a sophisticated entity who knowingly violated the automatic stay twice with the ultimate goal of reaping a huge profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   TransWorld, on the other hand-without knowledge of Prins' dishonest dealings or knowledge of Elbar's existence-was genuinely trying to work out\n   its tax issues with the Tax Assessor in a timely manner, as TransWorld wished to settle all outstanding tax issues before Mr. Cash passed away. [Finding of Fact Nos. 5, 8, 10, 49].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   Another fact that Elbar knew was that its chosen line of work-purchasing foreclosed properties in nonjudicial foreclosure sales, [Finding of Fact No. 30]-is a risky business. The amount of risk Elbar is willing to undertake is measured against the profit it expects to make on any given foreclosed property. Here, Elbar hoped to make a substantial profit in its purchase of the Property. [Finding of Fact No. 34]. This Court can consider the type of work Elbar engages in when weighing the equities, and the fact that Elbar is engaged in a line of business that has inherent monetary risks that Elbar has freely chosen to take on and build into its business model works against Elbar when weighing the equities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Mid-Continent Office Distributs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399635\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/252/833/\">\n    252 S.W.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 n.10 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, pet. denied) (affirming trial court's judgment that plaintiff take nothing in a claim for money had and received when, in balancing the equities, the trial court found that \"[t]he transaction between [the parties] was a high-risk transaction through which [the plaintiff] hoped to make a significant profit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   In regards to what TransWorld \"knew and intended\" when Prins transferred the $164,807.29 to TransWorld on October 21, 2016, TransWorld (i.e., the Cashes) honestly believed that it was getting back its own money-the original $169,807.29 TransWorld gave to Prins, minus $5,000.00, allegedly representing a settlement with the Tax Assessor. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 22:2-12; Pl.'s Ex. No. 46]. TransWorld did not have any knowledge or any reason to believe that the $164,807.29 Prins gave to TransWorld was related to Elbar, or anyone else for that matter. [Pl.'s Ex. No. 46]. Further, at this point in time, October of 2016, in addition to trying to work out the issues related to TransWorld's tax delinquencies, Ms. Cash was also heavily focused on Mr. Cash's health, as his cancer had recently taken a turn for the worst:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-442\">\n   Well, my husband had been very, very [ill] with cancer for almost six years. And in October we found out that not only was the cancer in his lungs and reactive but also in his brain and had gone to the bone. And so where he had not been in pain before, now he was in excruciating pain constantly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 11:17-22]. Given that Ms. Cash was devoting most, if not all, of her time to caring for and trying to comfort her dying husband, it is not surprising that she was not focused on Prins and his representation about TransWorld's tax issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   Elbar argues that TransWorld had notice about Prins' poor financial condition and that this notice should have put TransWorld on alert to further investigate its own tax issues with the Tax Assessor because (1) Ms. Cash testified that she was curious as to why TransWorld's check to the Tax Assessor in 2008 for taxes due was made out to the IOLTA instead of directly to the Tax Assessor; (2) Ms. Cash testified that in January of 2016 she found out that TransWorld was listed in the local newspaper as one of the largest delinquent taxpayers in San Antonio; and (3) TransWorld was listed as a creditor in the Prins' Bankruptcy and, thus, had notice of all proceedings in the Prins' Bankruptcy. [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 21-23 of 35, \u00b6\u00b6 47-50]. Citing no case law, Elbar further argues that after experiencing continued issues with TransWorld's taxes after Prins claimed they had been paid, TransWorld had a \"duty of inquiry that could not be satisfied by simply\n   continuing to rely solely on information obtained from Prins\" and that TransWorld's continued reliance on Prins from 2008 to 2016 was not reasonable. [Adv. Doc. No. 230 at 15-16 of 19, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40]. Elbar further argues that after TransWorld learned about the Prins' Bankruptcy, TransWorld should have continually monitored the Prins' Bankruptcy and doing so would have led to notice of the contents of the Wasserteil Motion to Lift Stay and the Ozer Adversary, in which allegations regarding wrongful conduct of Prins were brought forth. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 of 19, \u00b6 41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   The Court agrees that TransWorld should have done more on its own to investigate its tax issues once it received notice in January 2014, [Finding of Fact No. 5] and January 2016, [Finding of Fact Nos. 5, 8], that it was delinquent in its tax payments, especially since TransWorld was under the impression that its tax issues had been resolved in February 2008, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 3]. Although it is true that not only was TransWorld relying on Prins-its attorney of more than 15 years-to remedy its tax issues but also that Prins was actively telling TransWorld that he was working on the tax issues and that there was some kind of internal mistake with the Tax Assessor regarding the taxes due, a more prudent business would have investigated the matter itself, especially after receiving notice on two occasions that the tax issues were not resolved. Even though a more shrewd business might have acted differently under these circumstances, this Court has already found Ms. Cash to be a very credible witness and believes that TransWorld was not acting in bad faith or duplicitously in regard to its tax issues. On the contrary, this Court believes that TransWorld was doing what it believed was best in order to resolve the tax issues, even though a more sophisticated business might have taken different steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   Additionally, the fact that Ms. Cash testified that she twice called into question-once in 2008 and again in 2016-why TransWorld's check for tax payments needed to be made out to the IOLTA instead of directly to the Tax Assessor but did not further question Prins on the matter is also troubling to the Court. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 3, 8]. When writing a check in 2008 to cover TransWorld's tax issues, Prins told Ms. Cash that she needed to make the check payable to the IOLTA, and that he (i.e., Prins) would then write a check to Linebarger and Linebarger would then apply the money to TransWorld's accounts for the county. [Finding of Fact No. 3; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 35:22-24]. Ms. Cash initially questioned why she could not make the check directly payable to Romo (the actual Tax Assessor for Bexar County at that time) or to Linebarger, instead of to the IOLTA, as it was \"kind of, you know, a long chain of everybody,\" [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 35:20-36:6], and Prins replied that this was the way things were done in order to avoid a tax payer writing a bad check, [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 36:6-8]. Ms. Cash then wrote the check to the order of the IOLTA instead of to the Tax Assessor directly because she believed that \"that's the way things are done.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 36:11-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   In 2016, Ms. Cash again questioned why she needed to provide money directly to the IOLTA for TransWorld's tax issues. In approximately April 2016, Prins told the Cashes that the Tax Assessor wanted TransWorld to deposit into his IOLTA a percentage of the monies it owed as \"good faith\" money in the amount of $169,807.29 while he and the Tax Assessor worked out the issues. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7,\n   2018, Trial Tr. 19:21-20:1; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 78:2-10, 78:19-25]. Ms. Cash questioned Prins as to why she needed to put the disputed money into the IOLTA, as she did not believe that TransWorld owed any taxes. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 20:2-3]. Prins told Ms. Cash that it was \"just a formality\" and that TransWorld would get the money back as soon as the matter was settled [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 20:3-5]. \"Reluctantly\"-her words-Ms. Cash wrote out the check that Prins had requested to the order of the IOLTA. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 20:5-11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   Although in hindsight it is easy to question why TransWorld (i.e., the Cashes) did not more fully question Prins' suspicious activity of requiring that the money for TransWorld's tax issues be directly deposited into the IOLTA, Prins was, by all accounts, a crafty liar who was very skilled at hiding his thieving and skullduggery from his clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prins had been juggling funds for a number of years before his misdeeds came to light. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 22:5-6, 22:21, 22:24-23:4, 227:19-228:12]. Further, not only was Prins verbally telling TransWorld lies about the status of the tax matter with the Tax Assessor, Prins also created at least one false letter from Linebarger (on that law firm's letterhead) stating that TransWorld owed delinquent taxes in the amount of $169,807.29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 35:10-14; Pl.'s Ex. 46; TransWorld's Ex. A; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 94:1-95:4, 114:3-13, 223:22-224:5]. Moreover-and this is no small point-Prins presented himself as an upstanding family man who represented sophisticated clients, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 92:25-93:4; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 166:10-20]; even though some of his actions alerted some warning bells in Ms. Cash's head, she ultimately relied on her long-time attorney to best represent TransWorld's interest, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 2, 10]. It was not unreasonable for her to do so. Indeed, the Cashes were personal friends of Prins and Ms. Prins [Finding of Fact No. 2], and this relationship no doubt engendered Ms. Cash's trust of Prins. Moreover, as already noted, Mr. Cash was seriously ill with lethal cancer for several months, [Finding of Fact Nos. 4, 7], and both he and Ms. Cash were understandably focused on his physical and painful demise, as opposed to concentrating on Prins' actions and investigating them. The Court also notes that Prins had no prior history of professional suspensions, reprimands, or grievances, so it was not as if the Cashes had any known basis to think that Prins was lying to them. [TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 12:1-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   The Court rejects Elbar's argument that by merely being listed as a creditor in the Prins' Bankruptcy, TransWorld had an affirmative\n   duty to monitor the bankruptcy and thus would have discovered Prins' misdeeds through the filing of the Wasserteil Motion to Lift Stay and the Ozer Adversary. Just because an entity is listed on a creditor matrix does not mean that the entity has an affirmative duty to monitor the bankruptcy docket. Granted, if an entity is represented by counsel and the entity files pleadings in the bankruptcy, the entity's counsel might then have a duty to monitor the bankruptcy; here, however, TransWorld had no counsel representing it in the Prins' Bankruptcy, as they had no inclination to believe that they needed representation in the Prins' Bankruptcy. Further, even though TransWorld was listed as a creditor in the Prins' Bankruptcy, there was no evidence that TransWorld received actual notice of the Wasserteil Motion to Lift Stay or the Ozer Adversary, which Elbar claims would have alerted TransWorld to Prins' misdeeds. In fact, TransWorld is not listed on the certificate of service on the motion for relief from stay filed by the Wasserteil Estate, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Todd A. Prins and Paula R. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 16-52187-cag, Bankr. W.D. Tex., ECF. No. 14], nor was the complaint in the Ozer Adversary served on TransWorld, [\n   <em>\n    Ozer v. Prins\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 16-05090-cag, Bankr. W.D. Tex., ECF. No. 1], so it is not as if Ms. Cash (or some other TransWorld employee) had the opportunity to conveniently open the mail and read these pleadings about various dishonest acts of Prins. Additionally, TransWorld received the $164,807.29 from Prins on October 21, 2016, [Finding of Fact No. 50], which was\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the Wasserteil motion for relief from stay\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Ozer Adversary\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   were even filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Cash very credibly testified that the first time she received any notice that the check in the amount of $230,853.66 (that TransWorld had made to the order of the IOLTA on February 4, 2008, for the purpose of Prins settling TransWorld's tax dispute with the Tax Assessor) may not have in fact been paid to the Tax Assessor was when she was served with a lawsuit in February of 2017.

Thus, this Court finds her very credible when she asserts that she did not first become suspicious of Prins' dishonesty until February of 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   In sum, when weighing the equities, detrimental reliance and unclean hands do not factor into the Court's analysis of Elbar's claim for money had and received; however, what the parties knew and intended weigh in TransWorld's favor. When weighing the equities, the Court is given much leeway and is permitted to give certain factors more weight than other factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Office Distributs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399635\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/252/833/\">\n    252 S.W.3d at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"a trial court exercises broad discretion in balancing the equities involved in a case seeking equitable relief\");\n   <em>\n    Dominguez v.

Tex. Oct. 8, 2009) (citing\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Office Distributs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a trial court has broad discretion in balancing the equities). Here, this Court gives most weight to the factor of what the parties knew and intended. The Purchasers\n   are sophisticated businessmen-two of them trained and seasoned attorneys with experience in bankruptcy law-who went into the foreclosure sale of the Debtor's Property hoping to make a large return on their investment. [Finding of Fact No. 30-32, 34, 41]. It is Elbar's entire business model to purchase distressed properties at foreclosure sales in order to make a profit. [Finding of Fact No. 30]. Yet, the Purchasers-including Elbar-\n   <strong>\n    willfully violated the automatic stay twice\n   </strong>\n   in pursuit of receiving the deed to the Property. First, Bustamante did not hesitate to make the decision to wire transfer the $2.4 million after the Purchasers learned of the automatic stay because, according to Bustamante, the Purchasers would either receive the deed to the Property if the automatic stay was eventually annulled or they would get their money back if the automatic stay was not annulled. [Finding of Fact No. 40; Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial. Tr. 96:25-97:4, 133:13-25, 135:2-6; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 190:6-17, 194:13-19]. Prins stealing the Proceeds was an unforeseeable consequence of wire transferring the Proceeds, but the Purchasers would not be in the position that they are if they had not violated the automatic stay in the first place by wire transferring the Proceeds. Second, Elbar filed the lis pendens on the Property on January 3, 2017, i.e., approximately three months after Elbar became aware of the Debtor's bankruptcy. [Finding of Fact Nos. 37, 89]. Elbar had no hesitation about taking this action despite its violation of the automatic stay because, as Bustamante testified, \"[a]ll of our title suits involve Lis Pendens.\" [TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 236:6-10]. The Court finds this violation of the stay to be brazen and a huge strike against Elbar in this Court's weighing of the equities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   TransWorld, on the other hand, while its management (i.e., the Cashes) was perhaps na\u00efve or unsophisticated in some of its business dealings, justifiably trusted its attorney and personal friend (Prins) and worked in good faith with Prins to resolve its tax issues. As some courts have noted when considering claims for money had and received: \"[O]ther courts have held that as between two innocent parties, the party that must suffer the loss is the one that mistakenly created the situation and was in the best position to have avoided it.\"\n   <em>\n    First Am.

Here, in the Court's view, Elbar and TransWorld are not equally innocent parties. Both are innocent in the sense that both are victims of Prins' bad acts, but Elbar is less innocent than TransWorld because Elbar twice willfully violated the automatic stay-that is, Elbar blatantly violated the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because of this stark fact, Elbar must suffer the loss on its claim for money had and received because it\n   <em>\n    purposefully\n   </em>\n   created the situation-by wire transferring the Proceeds knowing that the stay was in effect-and it was in the best position to have avoided it. Thus, when balancing all the equities, the Court concludes that Elbar cannot prevail on its claim for money had and received against TransWorld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Industry Drive\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   Elbar argues that it should prevail on its claim for money had and received against Industry Drive because (1) the $300,000.00 Prins gave to Industry Drive was not received in due course of Industry Drive's business; (2) the $300,000.00 Prins gave to Industry Drive was not received in good\n   faith; and (3) Industry Drive did not pay valuable consideration for the $300,000.00 it received from Prins. [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 17-19 of 35, \u00b6 41]. Elbar further argues that Industry Drive had notice of Prins' poor financial condition, and thus that Industry Drive \"was on actual and inquiry notice that any money Industry [Drive] received from Prins did not belong to Prins.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 19 of 35, \u00b6 42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   Industry Drive argues that Elbar cannot show that Industry Drive lacked good faith in the acceptance of the $300,000.00 sent by Prins. [Adv. Doc. No. 219 at 7-8 of 16]. Industry Drive also argues that, if the Court chooses to weigh the equities, there was no evidence adduced at trial that Industry Drive did anything wrong, whereas Elbar engaged in several questionable activities, including wiring the Proceeds when Elbar was aware that the automatic stay was in effect, filing a lis pendens against the Property with knowledge of the existence of the automatic stay, and only suing certain recipients of the funds traceable to the Proceeds. [Adv. Doc. No. 219 at 8-11 of 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-455\">\n   There is no question that the $300,000.00 Prins gave to Industry Drive on November 4, 2016, from the BBVA Operating Account is directly traceable to the Proceeds. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 40, 57]. To be successful on its claim for money had and received, Elbar must show that the $300,000.00 Prins gave to Industry Drive, in equity and good conscience, belongs to Elbar.\n   <em>\n    Plains Expl. &amp; Prod.

The Court first considers the \"good conscience\" element. When considering this element, \"courts have concluded that, 'one who receives money which has been illegally obtained by a third party in due course of business, in good faith, and for valuable consideration, can keep it without liability to him from whom it was stolen.' \"\n   <em>\n    GE Capital Commercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20124237\">\n    2011 WL 124237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sinclair Houston Fed.

When determining whether Elbar has shown that Industry Drive holds money that in \"good conscience\" belongs to Elbar, this Court will examine (just as it has done with the claim against TransWorld) each of the three considerations identified by the court in\n   <em>\n    GE Capital Commercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   -\"due course of business,\" \"in good faith,\" and \"for valuable consideration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   <em>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     \"Good Conscience\" Considerations\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Good Conscience: Due Course of Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   Elbar argues that there was no evidence that the $300,000.00 Prins gave to Industry Drive on November 4, 2016, was received in the due course of Industry Drive's business of managing real estate. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 17-19 of 35, \u00b6 41; Adv. Doc. No. 228 at 11 of 19, \u00b6 28].

[Finding of Fact No. 18].

As Industry Drive did not receive the $300,000.00 from Prins as a result of Industry Drive's core business dealings-maintaining the G5 property-the $300,000.00 was not received in the \"due course of business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Good Conscience: In Good Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   Elbar asserts that TransWorld offered no evidence that TransWorld was acting in good faith when it received the $300,000.00 from Prins. [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 17-19 of 35, \u00b6 41]. Moreover, Elbar argues that Industry Drive had notice about Prins' poor financial condition because Industry Drive had been made aware (1) that Prins had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; and (2) of the Ozer Adversary that accused Prins of wrongdoing. [Adv. Doc. No. 217 at 19 of 35, \u00b6 42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   For its part, Industry Drive argues that it received the $300,000.00 in good faith, and that there was no evidence at trial that Industry Drive knew of Elbar's existence or knew that the $300,000.00 it received was traceable to misappropriated funds. [Adv. Doc. No. 219 at 12 of 16; Adv. Doc. No. 226 at 5 of 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   The Court finds that Industry Drive received the $300,000.00 in good faith. Industry Drive did not know anything about Elbar or even about Elbar's existence when Prins transferred the $300,000.00 to Industry Drive on November 4, 2016. [Finding of Fact No. 57; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial. Tr. 149:7-11, 149:21-23]. Thus, Industry Drive had no reason to believe that the $300,000.00 that Prins transferred into the Industry Drive account was not the \"original\" $300,000.00 that was withdrawn by Pfirrmann and placed into Prins' IOLTA. From the moment Gabriel learned that Pfirrmann had taken $300,000.00 out of the Industry Drive account and given it to Prins to place in his IOLTA, she, as well as other members of the Gabriel Family, were singular in their efforts to have the money returned, including imploring Pfirrmann to return the money, [Finding of Fact No. 22; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 123:23-124:7]; indeed, they even went so far as to file a lawsuit against Pfirrmann for return of the money, [Finding of Fact No. 23; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 115:19-25]. In the year long period the $300,000.00 was missing from the Industry Drive account, Prins never indicated to Gabriel or to Pfirrmann that the money was no longer in his IOLTA. [Finding of Fact No. 24; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 33:7-12]. In fact, Pfirrmann assured Gabriel that Prins was holding the money and that it was safe. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 117:19-20]. When Prins eventually returned the $300,000.00 to Industry Drive in November of 2016, the Court finds that Industry Drive genuinely believed that it was getting back the $300,000.00 Pfirrmann had taken in October 2015 and placed into Prins' IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Hrg. 146:16-20, 149:7-11, 149:21-23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 57].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   Elbar asserts that prior to the $300,000.00 being returned to Industry Drive on November 4, 2017, Industry Drive had notice about the Prins' Bankruptcy and about the adversary proceeding filed by the Ozers in the Prins' Bankruptcy,\n   which alleged that Prins committed fraud. As discussed previously, the Court has already found that the Prins' Bankruptcy was not discussed at the meeting among Gabriel, the Gabriel Family, and Pfirrmann on October 4, 2016, [Finding of Fact No. 24]. Further, there was no evidence adduced at trial indicating that Gabriel, the Gabriel Family, or Industry Drive were aware of the Ozer adversary in the Prins' Bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Elbar's argument that Industry Drive was on notice about Prins' poor financial condition fails. Only when the receiver of the money has actual knowledge that the money was stolen will the receiver of the money be found not to be in \"good faith\": \"[M]ere ground of suspicion of defect of title, or knowledge of circumstances which would excite such suspicion in the mind of a prudent man, or gross negligence on the part of the taker, will not defeat title.\n   <strong>\n    Bad faith alone will defeat the right of the taker without knowledge\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merchants' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1673329\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app/90/18/#p21\">\n    90 Ill.

Doc. No. 219 at 12 of 16]. In its briefs, however, Industry Drive does not identify exactly what antecedent debt the return of the $300,000.00 satisfied. During closing argument, counsel for Industry Drive merely argued that \"[t]he evidence did show that the return of the funds satisfied an antecedent debt because Mr. Pfirrmann had taken the $300,000 out and given it to Mr. Prins, who was allegedly holding it ....\" [Adv. Doc. No. 222, Feb. 8, 2018, Trial Tr. 173:1-4]. Elbar argues that antecedent debt does not constitute present value or a valuable consideration for bona fide purchaser status, and that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   Chapter 24 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code do not apply to this action. [Adv. Doc. No. 228 at 9 of 19, \u00b6 24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   Even if Industry Drive is correct regarding the general proposition that satisfaction of an antecedent debt constitutes valuable consideration under Texas law, here, there was no antecedent debt that was satisfied when Prins gave Industry Drive the $300,000.00 because (1) Pfirrmann did not owe a debt to Industry Drive; nor (2) did Prins owe a debt to Industry Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   First, Industry Drive has not identified any debt that Pfirrmann owed to Industry Drive. At least one Texas court has defined \"debt\" as \"a contract by which one party agrees to let another party have the use of a specific sum of money for a definite period with the stipulation that the borrower repay it with or without interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Trevino v. Trevino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9954531\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/555/792/#p802\">\n    555 S.W.2d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802 (Tex. Civ. App.-Corpus Christi 1977, no writ) ;\n   <em>\n    see also Debt\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"debt\" as \"[l]iability on a claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Pfirrmann and Industry Drive never entered into any type of agreement or contract for Pfirrmann to take the $300,000.00; he simply took it. This unilateral and surreptitious taking by Pfirrmann is more akin to a theft done out of spite, than a debt which arises in a contracts context. In fact, in Industry Drive's own pleadings in the Pfirrmann Lawsuit, Industry Drive brought claims for judicial dissolution under the Texas Business Organization Code, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and breach of partnership agreement. [Finding of Fact No. 23]. None of these claims are based in contract, and conversion is akin to a theft claim. Indeed, in response to the Court's question of why did Pfirrmann take the $300,000.00 and give it to Prins, Gabriel testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-469\">\n   Well, because my brother-in-law was used to controlling everything and I -- unfortunately when you want to sort of divorce someone, they don't take it very well when you say you don't want to be their partner anymore and, of course, this was all his in-laws and we were really his only family because he didn't really have one. He's not from Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-470\">\n   And so I just think emotionally it was more of a control issue for him and so he didn't want me to distribute it to the Partners. He liked to do all the distributions and control everything. And earlier on, we had a transaction where I actually did the distribution, not him and so he just wanted to control it. And so he gave it to his attorney, which was Mr. Prins.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-471\">\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 122:11-24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   Second, there is absolutely nothing in the record indicating that Prins himself owed any kind of debt to Industry Drive. The Court therefore rejects Industry Drive's argument that the return of the $300,000.00 was valuable consideration because it satisfied an antecedent debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   Thus, in determining whether Elbar has shown that Industry Drive holds money which \"in good conscience\" belongs to Elbar, of the three considerations identified by the court in\n   <em>\n    GE Capital Commercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , one weighs in favor of Industry Drive and the other two weigh in favor of Elbar. Specifically, Industry Drive received the $300,000.00 from Prins in good faith. However, Industry Drive did not receive the $300,000.00 from Prins in \"due course of business,\" nor did Industry Drive give valuable consideration for the $300,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   Under these circumstances, Elbar has satisfied the first element of its claim against Industry Drive for money had and received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   The second element the Court must consider is whether the equities of the case \"in view of the totality of the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180264\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/291/#p300\">\n    257 S.W.3d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , show that Industry Drive holds money that belongs to Elbar. As already discussed in this Court's evaluation of Elbar's money had and received claim against TransWorld, when balancing these equities, a court may consider, but is not limited to, the following: (1) any detrimental reliance suffered by the defendant;\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) a plaintiff's unclean hands;\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) \"what the parties knew and intended.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   <em>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     \"Balancing the Equities\" Considerations\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Balancing the Equities: Detrimental Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   Industry Drive asserts that it has \"materially changed\" its position in reliance on the $300,000.00 payment it received from Mr. Prins. [Adv. Doc. No. 219 at 4-5 of 16]. At trial, in response to the question of whether it would be a hardship to Industry Drive if it had to return the $300,000.00, Gabriel simply replied: \"Yes, because then it'll be $300,000 plus whatever the litigation costs have been, so we will be more in the negative than how we even started out.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 151:3-7]. Gabriel also testified that Industry Drive does not have much cash on hand. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 151:8-10]. Gabriel further testified that after receiving the $300,000.00 from Prins in November 2016, the $300,000.00 went back into Industry Drive's account and that Industry Drive paid its bills and other normal course of business expenses out of that account. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 133:24-134:5]. Industry Drive continued to do that until the other members of the Gabriel Family associated with Industry Drive bought out Pfirrmann and Eleanor's interests in the business in approximately September 2017. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 132:25-133:6, 136:6-8]. According to Gabriel, after Industry Drive \"closed on the repurchase of Jim [Pfirrmann] and Eleanor's interests ... their portion of everything was distributed out to them including their portion of the $300,000.\" [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 132:25-133:6].

The agreement the Gabriel Family and Eleanor and Pfirrmann reached when mediating the Pfirrmann Lawsuit was not a liability or obligation Industry Drive assumed as a result of receiving the $300,000.00; Gabriel testified that since at least 2015, the Gabriel Family had wanted to end the business relationship between themselves and Pfirrmann. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 113:14-114:3]. Further, litigation costs cannot be the basis for a detrimental reliance defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    News Am. Mktg.

Thus, Gabriel's testimony that Industry Drive has spent $44,000.00 defending itself in this lawsuit, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact No. 109], is of no moment. Finally, Gabriel specifically testified that Industry Drive would pay normal business expenses out of the account that the $300,000.00 was deposited into on November 4, 2016; these normal business expenses are obviously not liabilities or obligations that Industry Drive assumed or incurred as a result of receiving the $300,000.00. Thus, any detrimental reliance allegedly suffered by Industry Drive does not come into play as the Court weighs the equities in regards to Elbar's claim of money had and received against Industry Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-480\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Balancing the Equities: Unclean Hands\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-481\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Section IV.D.5 regarding equitable subrogation, in the Fifth Circuit, \"[t]he alleged wrongdoing of the plaintiff does not bar relief unless the defendant can show that he has personally been injured by the plaintiff's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell Bros.

Here, Industry Drive, like TransWorld, is unable to show that it has been personally injured by Elbar's conduct. At this point in time, Industry Drive has suffered no injury; after receiving the $300,000.00 from Prins on November 4, 2016, Industry Drive used these funds in the ordinary course of its business to pay expenses and make distributions to partners. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 133:24-134:5]. Further, even if this Court were to find that Industry Drive was liable for at least some percentage of Elbar's claim for money had and received, the source of Industry Drive's injury (i.e., having to pay Elbar all or some portion of the $300,000.00) is due to Prins' misconduct of stealing the $2.4 million, not any misconduct of Elbar. Thus, the unclean hands doctrine does not come into play as the Court weighs the equities in regards to Elbar's claim of money had and received against Industry Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-482\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Balancing the Equities: What the Parties Knew and Intended\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   \"What the parties knew and intended are all relevant factors in balancing the equities ....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hwang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762417\" index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/452/187/#p194\">\n    452 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   194 (citing\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180264\" index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/291/#p300\">\n    257 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   300 ). This factor weighs heavily in favor of Industry Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   What Elbar \"knew and intended\" demonstrates that Elbar has little respect for the Bankruptcy Code and has acted solely in its perceived best interests. Elbar violated the automatic stay on October 4, 2016, when it was the highest bidder at the foreclosure sale. [Finding of Fact No. 29 -\n   35];\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761386\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/392/666/#p671\">\n    392 B.R. at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the foreclosure sale, conducted the day after the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition, constituted an act 'to obtain possession of property of the estate' in violation of \u00a7 362\") (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) );\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

It does not matter that Elbar did not know that the Debtor had filed for bankruptcy at the time of the foreclosure sale; a technical stay violation occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   If this had been the only violation of the automatic stay, the Court would perhaps have sympathy for Elbar. However, two days later, on October 6, 2016, Elbar\n   <strong>\n    willfully\n   </strong>\n   violated the automatic stay when it wire transferred the $2.4 million into the IOLTA. [Finding of Fact No. 37-41];\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9122708\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/293/234/\">\n    293 B.R. at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]ayment of the bid price must be regarded as an 'act to obtain possession of property of the estate.' \");\n   <em>\n    In re Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116202\" index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/75/572/#p574\">\n    75 B.R. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that post-petition action taken by purchaser to perfect a pre-petition sale of debtor's real property \"was an attempt to affect and exercise control over the bankruptcy estate's interest in the [d]ebtor's real property, contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"368\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)\");\n   <em>\n    In re Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343925\" index=\"369\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/296/537/#p543\">\n    296 B.R. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that postpetition foreclosure sale, where foreclosing creditor received notice of bankruptcy filing, violated the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a) ). In Bustamante's own words: \"We paid the money knowing about the bankruptcy. It doesn't get more complicated than that.\" [TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 228:17-20]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   There is even more. Elbar knowingly violated the automatic stay for a\n   <strong>\n    second\n   </strong>\n   time when it filed a lis pendens against the Property on January 3, 2017, and Elbar took this action completely aware that the stay was in effect. [Finding of Fact No. 89]. As discussed more fully\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Section IV.C, Elbar's two willful violations of the automatic stay-especially when Elbar is a sophisticated purchaser who has been involved in hundreds of foreclosure sales where the debtor was in bankruptcy-lead this Court to find Elbar's stay violations egregious and in bad faith, and this finding weighs heavily against Elbar as the Court weighs the equity of what \"the parties knew and intended.\" Elbar intended to preserve its ability to complete the purchase of the Property, [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 133:13-134:10], and Elbar's two willful stay violations show the extreme lengths Elbar was willing to go to meet that goal. Elbar is not an innocent party here;\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is a sophisticated entity who knowingly violated the automatic stay twice with the ultimate goal of reaping a large profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   Industry Drive, on the other hand-without knowledge of Prins' dishonest dealings or knowledge of Elbar's existence-was\n   simply trying to recover money that was taken from its coffers by an in-law of the family (i.e., Pfirrmann), thus trying to balance delicate family relations with reaching a satisfactory business conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-487\">\n   Another fact that Elbar knew was that its chosen line of work-purchasing foreclosed properties in nonjudicial foreclosure sales, [Finding of Fact No. 30]-is a risky business. The amount of risk Elbar is willing to undertake is measured against the profit it expects to make on any given foreclosed property. Here, Elbar hoped to make a substantial profit in its purchase of the Property. [Finding of Fact No. 34]. This Court can consider the type of work Elbar engages in when weighing the equities, and the fact that Elbar is engaged in a line of business that has inherent monetary risks that Elbar has freely chosen to take on and build into its business model works against Elbar when weighing the equities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Office Distributs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399635\" index=\"370\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/252/833/\">\n    252 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   840 n.10 (affirming trial court's judgment that plaintiff take nothing in a claim for money had and received when, in balancing the equities, the trial court found that \"[t]he transaction between [the parties] was a high-risk transaction through which [the plaintiff] hoped to make a significant profit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-488\">\n   In regards to what Industry Drive \"knew and intended,\" Industry Drive did not know anything about Elbar or even about Elbar's existence when Prins transferred the $300,000.00 back to Industry Drive on November 4, 2016, [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial. Tr. 149:7-11, 149:21-23], and thus Industry Drive had no reason to believe that the $300,000.00 that Prins transferred into the Industry Drive account was not the \"original\" $300,000.00 that was withdrawn by Pfirrmann and placed into Prins' IOLTA. From the moment Gabriel learned that Pfirrmann had taken $300,000.00 out of the Industry Drive account and given it to Prins to place in his IOLTA, she, as well as other members of the Gabriel Family, were singular in their efforts to have the money returned, including imploring Pfirrmann to return the money, [Finding of Fact No. 22; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 123:23-124:7]; indeed, they even went so far as to file a lawsuit against Pfirrmann for return of the money, [Finding of Fact No. 23; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 115:19-25; Pl.'s Ex. 47; Industry Drive's Ex. 1]. In the year long period the $300,000.00 was missing from the Industry Drive account, Prins never indicated to Gabriel or to Pfirrmann that the money was no longer in his IOLTA. [Finding of Fact No. 24; TransWorld's Ex. HH, Prins Dep. 33:7-12]. In fact, Pfirrmann assured Gabriel that Prins was holding the money and that it was safe. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 117:19-20]. When Prins eventually returned the $300,000.00 to Industry Drive in November of 2016, Industry Drive believed that it was simply getting back the $300,000.00 that Pfirrmann had taken in October 2015 and placed into Prins' IOLTA. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Hrg. 146:16-20, 149:7-11, 149:21-23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-489\">\n   Additionally, Industry Drive did not have any business dealings, or any relationship at all, with Prins. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 115:10-18]. The only \"connection\" Industry Drive had to Prins was that a co-managing partner of Industry Drive (i.e., Pfirrmann) used Prins as his personal attorney. [Finding of Fact Nos. 19-20]. Further, as soon as Gabriel learned that there was an \"issue\" with Prins,\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   she immediately contacted Pfirrmann to get the $300,000.00 from the\n   IOLTA and return it to the Industry Drive account. [Finding of Fact No. 22]. At trial, Gabriel aptly summed up Industry Drive's relation to Prins as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-490\">\n   I'm just here trying to talk about my $300,000 and what role we had with Mr. Prins, which he was not our attorney. I was not making an investment with him. I was not trying to give - make some kind of return. I simply wanted to get out of real estate relationship with a brother-in-law who's still currently my brother-in-law and go down the road and not be in this court today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 155:17-23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   Elbar argues that prior to the $300,000.00 being returned to Industry Drive on November 4, 2017, Industry Drive had notice about the Prins' Bankruptcy and about the adversary proceeding filed by the Ozers in the Prins' Bankruptcy, which alleged that Prins committed fraud. As discussed above, this Court has already found that the Prins' Bankruptcy was not discussed at the mediation among Gabriel, the Gabriel Family, and Pfirrmann on October 4, 2016. [Finding of Fact No. 24]. Further, there was no evidence adduced at trial indicating that Gabriel, the Gabriel Family, or Industry Drive was aware of the Ozer adversary proceeding in the Prins' Bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Elbar's argument that Industry Drive was on notice about Prins' poor financial condition fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   Another factor the Court considers is that if Industry Drive is ordered to return the $300,000.00 to Elbar, Industry Drive will have no recourse to try and recover its $300,000.00 from Prins. Industry Drive was not listed as a creditor in the Prins' Bankruptcy or as a victim in the Prins' Criminal Case because Industry Drive had suffered no loss at that point. [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 147:25-148:8, 149:24-150:12]. Elbar, on the other hand, in addition to requesting relief from this Court, has had two other sources to look to for collecting its $2.4 million: the Prins' Criminal Case and the Prins' Bankruptcy. And, in fact, Elbar has so far been very successful in obtaining money from these two sources. In the Prins' Bankruptcy, Elbar has received $82,373.28, and in the Prins' Crinimal Case it has received $1,601,542.14. [Finding of Fact Nos. 110, 113-114].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   In sum, when weighing the equities, detrimental reliance and unclean hands do not factor into the Court's analysis of Elbar's claim for money had and received; however, what the parties knew and intended weigh in Industry Drive's favor. When weighing the equities, the Court is given much leeway and is permitted to give certain factors more weight than other factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Office Distributs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399635\" index=\"371\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/252/833/\">\n    252 S.W.3d at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"a trial court exercises broad discretion in balancing the equities involved in a case seeking equitable relief\");\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"372\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010692958\">\n    2009 WL 10692958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 n.5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Office Distributs., L.P.\n   </em>\n   for the\n   proposition that a trial court has broad discretion in balancing the equities).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   This Court gives most weight to the factor of what the parties knew and intended. The Purchasers are sophisticated businessmen-two of them trained and seasoned attorneys with experience in bankruptcy law-who went into the foreclosure sale of the Debtor's Property hoping to make a large return on their investment. [Finding of Fact Nos. 30-34, 41]. It is Elbar's entire business model to purchase distressed properties at foreclosure sales in order to make a profit. [Finding of Fact No. 30]. Yet, the Purchasers-including Elbar-\n   <strong>\n    willfully violated the automatic stay twice\n   </strong>\n   in pursuit of receiving the deed to the Property. Bustamante did not hesitate to make the decision to wire transfer the $2.4 million after the Purchasers learned of the automatic stay because, according to Bustamante, the Purchasers would either receive the deed to the Property if the automatic stay was eventually annulled or they would get their money back if the automatic stay was not annulled. [Finding of Fact No. 40; Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial. Tr. 96:25-97:4, 133:13-25, 135:2-6; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 190:6-17, 194:13-19]. Prins stealing the Proceeds was an unforeseeable consequence of wire transferring the Proceeds, but the Purchasers would not be in the position that they are if they had not violated the automatic stay in the first place by wire transferring the Proceeds. Industry Drive, on the other hand, had no business dealings with Prins; it was merely trying to recover the money a co-managing partner and brother-in-law unilaterally and surreptitiously took from Industry Drive's bank account. [Finding of Fact Nos. 21-24]. As some courts have noted when considering claims for money had and received: \"[O]ther courts have held that as between two innocent parties, the party that must suffer the loss is the one that mistakenly created the situation and was in the best position to have avoided it.\"\n   <em>\n    First Am.

Both are innocent in the sense that both are victims of Prins' bad acts, but Elbar is less innocent than Industry Drive because Elbar twice willfully violated the automatic stay. Because of this stark fact, Elbar must suffer the loss on its claim for money had and received because it\n   <em>\n    purposefully\n   </em>\n   created the situation-by wire transferring the Proceeds in violation of the stay-and it was in the best position to have avoided it. Thus, when balancing all the equities, the Court holds that Elbar does not prevail on its claim for money had and received against Industry Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-497\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Unjust Enrichment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-498\">\n   <em>\n    a.

[Adv. Doc. No. 228 at 6-9 of 19, \u00b6\u00b6 13-23]. Industry Drive argues that Elbar presented no evidence that Industry Drive obtained a benefit from Elbar by fraud, duress, or by the taking of an undue advantage. [Adv. Doc. No. 219 at 6 of 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   Just like its unsuccessful claim for unjust enrichment against TransWorld, there is also no nexus between Elbar and Industry Drive sufficient enough to sustain a claim for \"active\" unjust enrichment against Industry Drive. Elbar's loss (the\n   Proceeds being stolen by Prins) and Industry World's gain (Prins giving Industry Drive $300,000.00 after Pfirrmann took $300,000.00 from the Industry Drive account) came together by random chance: but for Prins stealing the Proceeds, Prins could not have used the money Elbar wire transferred to the IOLTA to return to Industry Drive. There was no money transferred directly from Elbar to Industry Drive; further, Industry Drive did not make any promises to Elbar to pay for any type of benefit. Thus, there are no circumstances here for \"active\" unjust enrichment to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   Elbar has also failed to show that \"passive\" unjust enrichment occurred. To be successful on a theory of \"passive\" unjust enrichment, Elbar would need to show that it would be unconscionable for Industry Drive to retain the money ($300,000.00) given to it by Prins when the $300,000.00 can be traced to the Proceeds that Prins pilfered. Elbar has not met this standard. There is no question that Elbar has been harmed by Prins' actions due to his theft of the Proceeds; whereas, Industry Drive (unlike Elbar and TransWorld) has not been harmed by Prins' actions in that it has recovered all of the $300,000.00 that Pfirrmann initially withdrew from Industry Drive's account and gave to Prins. All that can be said of Industry Drive is that it has had to pay $44,000.00 in attorneys' fees to defend itself in this suit, [Finding of Fact No. 109], although such expenditures do not constitute harm as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    News Am.

[Finding of Fact Nos. 37-41]. That the $300,000.00 Prins gave to Industry Drive (which, again, Industry Drive believed was Prins returning Industry Drive's own money, which had previously been taken from Industry Drive's bank account without permission by Pfirrmann) is traceable to the Proceeds does not in any way equate to Industry Drive breaking the law-at worst, it amounts to a windfall to Industry Drive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cty. of El Paso, Tex.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204730343\">\n    2009 WL 4730343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (\"[Unjust enrichment] [i]s not available merely because ... the benefits to the person sought to be charged amount to a windfall.\") (citation omitted).

Application of the Law of Conversion to the Facts at Bar\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   Here, Elbar fails to prove its conversion of money claim as to both TransWorld and Industry Drive. Elbar has failed to show the first element in a claim for conversion of money-that is, Elbar had to prove that money was delivered to the defendant for safekeeping. Here, Elbar did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   deliver\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   money to TransWorld or Industry Drive for safekeeping; to the contrary, Elbar delivered the $2.4 million to Prins for safekeeping. Alas, Elbar did not bring a conversion of money claim against Prins-even though Elbar brought a number of other claims against him-and thus Elbar's conversion of money claim fails. Further, even if the first element of the conversion of money claim could be construed as the portion of the Purchasers' money that Prins delivered to TransWorld and Industry Drive, this too would fail as Prins did not deliver the $164,807.29 and $300,000.00 to TransWorld and Industry Drive, respectively, for any kind of \"safekeeping\"; the opposite, in fact, occurred: Prins gave those respective sums to TransWorld and Industry Drive as a \"return\" of those parties' own money, which TransWorld and Industry Drive could then dispose of as they saw fit. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 50, 57]. Thus, because no money was delivered to TransWorld or Industry Drive for safekeeping, Elbar's claim for conversion of money must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-534\">\n   Elbar has brought numerous claims against Prins, United Sentry, TransWorld, and Industry Drive. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court finds that all of Elbar's claims must fail with one exception: Elbar has proven the elements of its TTLA claim against Prins. Accordingly, Elbar is entitled to judgment against Prins for $716,084.58, representing the difference between the $2.4 million that Prins stole and the $1,683,915.42 that Elbar has recovered through the Prins' Criminal Case and the Prins' Bankruptcy Case. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finding of Fact Nos. 110, 113-114]. Additionally, because Elbar has prevailed under its TTLA claim, Elbar is entitled to recover the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs it has expended in prosecuting this particular claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-535\">\n   Conversely, because Elbar is not the prevailing party in its TTLA claims against MacKenzie and United Sentry, Elbar is liable to these two defendants for their respective reasonable attorneys' fees\n   and costs in defending themselves against Elbar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-536\">\n   Counsel for MacKenzie and United Sentry has seven (7) days to provide to counsel for Elbar all invoices that his two clients believe represent the reasonable fees and costs incurred in defending themselves against Elbar's TTLA claim. If counsel for MacKenzie and United Sentry fails to deliver these invoices within the seven (7) day deadline, then the fees and costs will be deemed waived. If they are timely delivered, then counsel for Elbar has seven (7) days to file a certificate setting forth that Elbar either does object or does not object to the reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Elbar's counsel files a certificate that Elbar does not object to the reasonableness, then no further hearings will be held and the Court will enter a judgment consistent with these findings of fact and conclusions of law. Elbar's certification that it does not object to reasonableness will\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   constitute a waiver of Elbar's right to appeal any of this Court's rulings, including that Elbar is liable to MacKenzie and United Sentry for their reasonable fees and costs as the prevailing parties in Elbar's TTLA claim against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-537\">\n   If Elbar's counsel certifies that Elbar does object to the reasonableness of the requested fees and costs of MacKenzie and United Sentry, then this Court will hold a hearing on solely this issue, and thereafter will render a ruling on reasonableness and then enter a judgment consistent with these findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-538\">\n   Finally, with respect to Elbar's fees and costs for prosecuting its TTLA claim against Prins, Elbar's counsel has seven (7) days to submit to this Court all invoices that Elbar believes represent its reasonable fees and expenses. The Court will review these invoices\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and then issue a ruling on the amount it finds to be reasonable. As with the fees and costs of MacKenzie and United Sentry, Elbar's fees and costs will be incorporated into the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-542\">\n    On March 27, 2017, this Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Order (1) Requiring Todd Prins to Wire Transfer $2.4 Million to the Chapter 7 Trustee by No Later Than 5:00 P.M. on December 12, 2016; and (2) Requiring Todd Prins to Personally Appear in Court and Show Cause Why He Should Not Be Sanctioned.

Indeed, the Court made these findings and conclusions long before the trial of this adversary proceeding. Having heard extensive testimony at trial, and having admitted and reviewed numerous exhibits introduced at the trial, it is more accurate to find that the individuals and entity who provided the funds to purchase the Property were Bustamante, Abdullatif, Jabbour, and Elbar. [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 57:17-58:14; Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 166:5-9, 170:20-171:1; TransWorld's Ex.

No. 197], this Court found that three principals of Elbar attempted to pay the purchase price at the foreclosure sale by several cashier's checks. Based upon testimony adduced at trial, the Court has learned that Abdullatif and Jabbour have no formal roles in Elbar, [Adv. Doc. No. 221, Feb. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. 165:13-16; 166:5-9, 168:13-19; TransWorld's Ex. II, Bustamante Dep. 105:23-106:1, 137:17-21]; only Bustamante is an officer (vice president) of Elbar, [Adv. Doc. No. 220, Feb. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. 52:24-53:1, 130:8-20]. Thus, it is more accurate to state that three individuals attempted to pay the purchase price at the foreclosure sale by having Twyman deliver several cashier's checks to Shum. Moreover, even though Bustamante was personally purchasing an $800,000.00 interest in the Property, he signed his cashier's checks on behalf of Elbar, as one of its vice presidents. [Pl.'s Ex. 20].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-558\">\n    Bustamante was unable to recall when Elbar purchased 25% of Bustamante's 1/3 portion: \"...

Even though Bustamante was unable to recall the precise date Elbar paid him for its 25% share of his 1/3 interest in the Property, the Court emphasizes that it finds Bustamante's testimony credible that Elbar did in fact, at some point close in time to Elbar's wire transfer of the $2.4 million, purchase a portion of Bustamante's interest in the Property, thereby making Elbar a Purchaser of the Property as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-559\">\n    In fact, Bustamante further testified that Twyman paid him the sum of $24,000.00 so that Twyman himself could participate in acquiring an interest in the Property.

The Court concludes that Twyman should be included in the definition of \"Purchasers\" (as defined\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    by this Court in Finding of Fact No. 30), as Twyman, regardless of whether he purchased Bustamante's share pre or post wire transfer of the Proceeds, became a \"Purchaser\" with knowledge of the Debtor's bankruptcy and imposition of the automatic stay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-560\">\n    The Court notes that even though Bustamante testified that Elbar was hoping to make a 20% return on the Property, the actual return on the Property would have been much greater.

Therefore, as a matter of law, the Property was not only property of the estate on the date of the filing of her petition, it remained property of the estate because the Debtor failed in her attempt to remove the Property out of the estate.

Indeed, Prins had paid $300,000.00 to Industry Drive on November 4, 2016, [Finding of Fact No. 57], and therefore Industry Drive was made whole. On the other hand, TransWorld has suffered damages from Prins' actions. At a minimum, it is certain that TransWorld has suffered damages of $5,000.00 and it is quite probable that the harm is much higher. As discussed in depth\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at Finding of Fact Nos. 9-10, TransWorld gave Prins $169,807.29 as \"good faith\" money while Prins allegedly worked out TransWorld's tax issues with the Tax Assessor. TransWorld, however, only ever received $164,807.29 back from Prins-hence, TransWorld's damages are, at a minimum, $5,000.00. [Finding of Fact No. 50]. Given Prins' blatant theft of the $2.4 million, it is conceivable that Prins\n    <strong>\n     never\n    </strong>\n    paid any money to the Tax Assessor on behalf of TransWorld, thus making the damages suffered by TransWorld much higher. After all, TransWorld, aside from giving Prins the amount of $169,807.29 on May 17, 2016, had previously given Prins the sum of $230,853.66 on February 4, 2008, for the express purpose of providing Prins with sufficient funds to pay the Tax Assessor the amount owed by TransWorld at that time. [\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Finding of Facts No. 3]. Yet, it appears that Prins never paid the Tax Assessor any of the $230,853.66, as the Tax Assessor is now asserting that TransWorld owes almost a half million dollars. [Finding of Facts No. 3]. Under these circumstances, it is not clear why TransWorld was not included in Prins' plea agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"58\">\n   <p id=\"p-603\">\n    The Debtor, Amos, and Prins did not appear at trial.

Although the court in\n    <em>\n     Wernecke v.

There is no question that Prins told TransWorld that the $5,000.00 difference represented the amount he paid to the Tax Assessor to settle the tax issues that TransWorld had. However, this Court has already found that there was no such settlement and that Prins' representation to TransWorld was a bald-faced lie. [Finding of Fact No. 50]. Therefore, he unquestionably harmed TransWorld by $5,000.00. Moreover, it is quite likely that TransWorld has suffered substantially more harm than $5,000.00 because it is presently in a dispute with the same Tax Assessor, who alleges that TransWorld owes past due taxes totaling half a million dollars. It it worth emphasizing that TransWorld not only gave Prins $169,807.29 in May of 2016, but also $230,853.66 in February of 2008, and Prins never accounted for this latter sum-leading this Court to believe that Prins stole all or some of the $230,853.66 and therefore further damaged TransWorld in that its tax liability increased substantially as penalties and interest accrued.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"137\">\n   <p id=\"p-726\">\n    Examples of specific chattel would include certain coins or a certificate of deposit.\n    <em>\n     Jaffer v.

In fact, counsel for MacKenzie and United Sentry timely delivered its invoices to counsel for Elbar and, in the aggregate, seeks to recover fees and costs of $60,725.00 and $1,851.45, respectively.
