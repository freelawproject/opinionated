Justice McKinney</author>\n<p id=\"Acc\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">This is a suit to recover damages for an injury suffered by the plaintiff as a result of <em>a </em>defective sidewalk in the City of Nashville.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">To the declaration the defendant filed a plea of not guilty, and a special plea in which it was averred that more than five days before the accident defendant served written notice on the abutting lot owner to repair said defect, and thereby relieved itself of further liability, pursuant to chapter 183, Acts of 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The plaintiff demurred to this speoial plea upon the ground that the act relied upon was invalid. The trial court overruled the demurrer. The plaintiff refused to plead further, whereupon his suit was dismissed and he has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\"><em>(l) </em>The contention is made that chapters 182 and 183 of the Acts of 1915 became laws at the same time; that the two acts are repugnant and irreconcilably conflicting; that they neutralize each other and both are, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Said two acts, which we copy herein in parallel columns, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">\u201cCHAPTER NO. 182.

To each act, as published, there is appended the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cThis bill having been presented to the Governor for his signature on the third day of April, 1915, and the Governor having failed to return it within the time prescribed by law, the same is hereby declared to have become a law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cThis 29th day of March, 1916.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cAlbert E.

No bill shall become a law until it shall have been read and passed, on three different days in each house, and shall have received, on its final passage in each house, the assent of a majority of all the members to which that house shall be entitled under this constitution; and shall have been signed by the respective speakers in open session, the fact of such signing to be noted on the journal; and shall have received the approval of the governor, or shall have been otherwise passed under the provisions of this constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Section 18 of article 3 of the constitution contains these provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201cEvery bill which may pass both houses of the general assembly, shall before it becomes a law, be presented to the governor for his signature. ... If the governor shall fail to return any bill, with his objections within five days (Sunday excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall become a law without his signature, unless the general assembly, by its adjournment, prevents its return, in which case it shall not become a law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We find nothing in the journals that would justify us in saying that either bill became a law before the other, and that the latter thereby repealed the former by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>This question was involved in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Drane, </em>96 Tenn., 19, but in that case it affirmatively appeared from the journals that one of the bills was approved and became a law at a later hour of the same day than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">As previously stated, these bills were treated as companion acts, while, most likely, they were drafted and presented as alternative bills, the idea being to obtain partial relief1, if complete exemption from liability could not be had. But, by mistake or oversight, they were both enacted into law as though they were companion bills that were not in conflict with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">It being conceded that the two acts are contradictory and irreconcilable, and being unable to determine that either became effective, in point of time, before the other, it results that both are invalid, and the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, the demurrer .to the special plea sustained, and the case remanded for a trial upon the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
