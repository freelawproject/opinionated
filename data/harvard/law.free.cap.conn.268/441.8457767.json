J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT7\">The plaintiff, Cadle Company, is an unsecured creditor of the estate of F. Francis D\u2019Addario (decedent). The decedent was an entrepreneur with extensive real estate and business holdings. The defendants are the decedent\u2019s sons and the current coexecutors of the estate, David D\u2019Addario and Lawrence D\u2019Addario. The plaintiff filed a motion for order in the Probate Court seeking both the removal of the coexecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tors and an accounting and liquidation of the estate. The Probate Court denied the motion for order and the plaintiff appealed to the trial court. The trial court dismissed the appeal sua sponte at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case-in-chief. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly: (1) failed to shift the burden of proof to the defendants to show that they acted fairly with regard to the transactions once the court had determined that a fiduciary relationship existed; (2) determined that the plaintiff had not established a prima facie case; and (3) failed to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. The defendants also appealed, claiming that the court improperly denied their motion for summary judgment, which was made prior to the trial, on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the motion for order in the Probate Court. We dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We consider the issue raised by the defendants, however, as an alternate ground to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. With respect to the plaintiffs appeal, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">We first address the defendants\u2019 appeal challenging the plaintiffs standing to bring the motion for order in the Probate Court. As a preliminary matter, we note that the defendants were not aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court, which was rendered in their favor. \u201cOrdinarily, a party that prevails in the trial court is not aggrieved.\u201d <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>262 Conn. 107, 110-11, 809 A.2d 1114 (2002). Because aggrievement is a prerequisite to this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-263;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 61-1;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>supra, 110-11; we dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Despite our dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeal, however, we consider the issue raised by the defendants as an alternate ground to affirm the judgment in the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, we would consider the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance only after finding merit in at least one of the claims raised on appeal. [0]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised, [however, it] must be disposed of no matter in what form it is presented . . . and the court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dow &amp; Condon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brookfield Development Corp., </em>266 Conn. 572, 578-79, 833 A.2d 908 (2003). Here, as in Dow <em>&amp; Condon, Inc., </em>we consider as a preliminary matter whether the plaintiff had standing to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this issue. The decedent gave the Bank of New Haven (bank) a demand note in the amount of $1 million on May 31, 1985. After the decedent\u2019s death, the defendants published a notice in local newspapers announcing September 11, 1986, as the bar date for creditors\u2019 claims. On July 30, 1986, the bank sent the estate\u2019s attorney a letter demanding payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>on the note.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The estate\u2019s attorney twice replied to the bank\u2019s letter, seeking further information about the debt, but the bank did not respond. The bank sold the note to the plaintiff on September 23,1994. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for order in the Probate Court for the removal of the executors and an accounting of the estate. The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss contesting the plaintiffs standing to participate in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Probate Court denied both the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs motion for order and the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, again contesting the plaintiffs standing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants argued that the plaintiff had no standing because the plaintiffs assignor, the bank, had not filed a proper claim with the estate pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-391<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 45a-395.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The trial court determined that the estate had received the bank\u2019s letter prior to the bar date and that the letter was sufficient to meet the statutory notice requirements. The court also noted that the defendants: (1) had failed to disallow the claim during earlier proceedings; (2) repeatedly had listed the claim on the estate\u2019s return of claims; and (3) had received the benefits of a deduction based on the debt in the estate\u2019s federal estate tax return and its state succession tax return. Accordingly, the court denied the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The defendants argue on appeal that (1) the bank\u2019s letter was not sufficient to give the estate notice of the claim before the bar date and (2) the defendants\u2019 actions after the bar date did not cure the improper notice of the claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The trial court\u2019s subj ect matter jurisdiction is a matter of law and, therefore, our review is plenary. \u201cIf a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. ... A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ted.) <em>Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>267 Conn. 116, 127-28, 836 A.2d 414 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Section 45a-395 requires a decedent\u2019s creditors to give notice of their claims to the estate prior to a date set by the Probate Court. \u201cThe purpose of the statute is to enable the administrator to perform his duties by assuring that he is informed as to what claims there are which must be paid out of the estate and allowing him the opportunity to pass on them. ... Its meaning is that if a creditor fails to present his claim within the time limited, and no extension of time is granted, that omission is an effectual bar to any further demand against the estate. . . . Thus, the statute imposes a condition precedent to the enforcement of a right of action, the nonfulfilment of which extinguishes the right of action, in contrast to a statute of limitation which merely bars the remedy and is to be pleaded as a special defense.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>160 Conn. 320, 325, 278 A.2d 818 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Ravich, </em>111 Conn. 649, 151 A. 179 (1930), this court considered the question of what constitutes proper statutoiy notice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>In Roth, </em>a representative of an estate inquired by letter as to the nature of a claim. Id., 651. The claimant responded by handwritten answers to the estate\u2019s specific questions in the margin of the estate\u2019s letter. Id. The writing included: \u201cthe amount of the original mortgage note . . . the amount then due on the principal; the date of the note; rate of interest with the dates of payment thereof, and the dates to which the interest had been paid; the amount of principal instalments; [and] dates on which instalments were due . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. This court concluded that the writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>was sufficient to give the statutorily required notice. Id., 655. This court stated that \u201c[t]he form of the writing is of little importance so long as it furnishes information to the executor of the extent of the demand and the character of the transaction out of which it grew.\u201d Id., 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The more recent case of <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Binsse, </em>170 Conn. 212, 217, 365 A.2d 1195 (1976), further explained that \u201cthe purpose of the statute is to expedite the settlement of estates and is not to furnish a vehicle by which executors or administrators may refuse to apply the assets of an estate to the payment of debts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We conclude that the bank\u2019s letter to the defendants was sufficient to give notice pursuant to \u00a7 45a-395. As the trial judge noted, the letter described both the amount of the note and its origin. Thus, the estate was aware of both \u201cthe extent of the demand and the character of the transaction out of which it grew.\u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Ravich, </em>supra, 111 Conn. 654. We need not reach the defendants\u2019 remaining claim that their actions allegedly acknowledging the debt after the bar date should not have been considered by the court because, even in the absence of those actions, the writing received by the estate was sufficient to satisfy the statutory notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The defendants argue, however, that \u00a7 45a-395 (e), which provides that \u201c[t]he amount of a claim may not be increased after the time for the presentation of such claim has expired,\u201d implies that the exact amount of the claim must be known to the executors before the date set by the Probate Court. This argument lacks merit. The letter stated the principal amount of the debt, which under <em>Roth </em>was sufficient to satisfy statutory notice requirements because it apprised the coexecutors of the extent of the claim. Nothing in \u00a7 45a-391 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00a7 45a-395 prevents further details, including the exact amount of the claim, from being made available after the notice date. To hold otherwise would thwart the purpose of the statute, namely, expedient estate settlement, and would enable executors to avoid paying the decedent\u2019s debts. See <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Binsse, </em>supra, 170 Conn. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The defendants also assert that the bank\u2019s failure to specify the amount of principal due at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, as well as the terms of the loan, was fatal to its attempt to give the required statutory notice. They argue that those specific pieces of information not only constitute sufficient notice, but are also necessary to meet the requirements of \u00a7 45a-395. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">As we have stated, the <em>Roth </em>case stands for the more general principle that the estate must be made aware of \u201cthe extent of the demand and the character of the transaction out of which it grew.\u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Ravich, </em>supra, 111 Conn. 654. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor gave proper notice of its claim and the plaintiff had standing to bring its motion for order before the Probate Court. We need not reach the plaintiffs alternate grounds for affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling on the plaintiffs standing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s ruling is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">We next turn to the plaintiffs appeal. We begin by addressing its claim that the trial court improperly placed on it the burden of proving that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The case was tried to the court on July 29 through August 1, 2002. At the trial, the plaintiff presented evidence concerning its claims of breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement and waste of estate assets. The evidence related to purchases made by estate owned businesses, the retention of unprofitable estate businesses, the retention and sale of estate properties, and negotiations with the largest creditor of the estate, all of which the plaintiff claimed were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Specifically, the plaintiff presented evidence that estate businesses had paid the life insurance premiums on Ann D\u2019Addario, the widow of the decedent and a beneficiary of the estate. The estate was advised to insure the life of Ann D\u2019Addario because she was such a large beneficiary of the estate and the insurance would ease the tax burden on the estate at the time of her death. Estate businesses also paid life insurance premiums for David D\u2019Addario. The premiums were less than $15,000 per month. The proceeds of the life insurance were intended to benefit five irrevocable trusts set up by the decedent for the benefit of his children, including the defendants. The estate businesses were no longer making these payments at the time of the trial. The record does not show when they ceased, or which of the many estate owned businesses were paying the premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Estate businesses also paid the lease for a luxury car for David D\u2019Addario. This payment was part of his compensation for acting as chief executive officer of the estate\u2019s businesses. The payment was approximately $1100 to $1200 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The plaintiff presented evidence that one of the estate\u2019s parcels of real property, the so-called Honey Spot Road Extension, was sold at a tax hen sale because the estate could not pay the property taxes, which David D\u2019Addario estimated to exceed $1 million. The taxes due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>were in fact much lower. The property was purchased at the public tax lien sale by social friends of Mary Lou D\u2019Addario, the decedent\u2019s daughter. The third party then sold the property to Mary Lou D\u2019Addario. After Mary Lou D\u2019Addario took ownership of the property as a member of Honeyspot Ventures, LLC, she was joined in ownership by the defendants, David D\u2019Addario and Lawrence D\u2019Addario. Honeyspot Ventures, LLC, sold the property to Honeyspot Investors, LLP, which was formed by the same individuals who owned Pace Trucking, a neighboring company that had shown previous interest in the property. None of the profits from the sale of the land were taken into the estate because the property had been transferred from the estate at the tax sale. David D\u2019Addario also testified that the property was contaminated, that the estate had disputed the value of the property with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and that the estate had made attempts to sell the property prior to its loss at the tax lien sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The plaintiff also presented evidence that the estate owned four condominiums, located in Florida, New York, Vermont and San Francisco, which were used by family members and for business purposes. All four properties were sold to family members between 1996 and 1997. Prior to their disposal, the estate paid real estate taxes and maintenance costs on the properties and received no rental income from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The plaintiff also presented evidence that the estate held and operated unprofitable and debt-burdened businesses to which it transferred moneys from other estate owned businesses. The decedent\u2019s will directed the executors to continue operating the family businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">David D\u2019Addario explained that the estate was having difficulty selling its assets to pay its debts because the remaining assets had problems, such as fragmented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ownership and environmental contamination. He also spoke about the difficulty in finding potential buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The plaintiff also presented evidence of the defendants\u2019 failure to pay off a debt to the largest secured creditor of the estate, Red Knot Acquisitions, Inc. (Red Knot). The parties disputed the amount of the debt, which resulted from bank debt that was consolidated and bought by Red Knot. The estate believed it had paid off $6,650,000 of the debt to Red Knot, whereas Red Knot believed the estate had paid only $5 million. Red Knot and the estate entered into a forebearance agreement that gave the estate an option to pay off the debt at a discounted rate. The rate of discount was dependent upon the timeliness of the estate\u2019s payment and was set to expire on January 7, 2003. Negotiations to extend the payout period were ongoing at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The plaintiff also presented evidence of other miscellaneous transactions, including: the estate\u2019s loans to two beneficiaries, the decedent\u2019s daughter Virginia D\u2019Addario and the decedent\u2019s widow Ann D\u2019Addario; the estate\u2019s contribution to the Spray Trusts set up by the decedent for the benefit of his children to replace the amount improperly loaned from the trusts by the decedent prior to his death; the estate\u2019s inaccurate accounting of various transactions; and the estate\u2019s inaccurate accounting of inter-business transfers of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The plaintiff presented evidence of these improprieties through their expert witness, Carlton Helming, an accountant. The plaintiff also called Harold Miller, the accountant for the D\u2019Addario estate; David D\u2019Addario, the named defendant and the chairman and chief executive officer of D\u2019Addario Industries; Nicholas Vitti, the president and former chief financial officer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>estate\u2019s businesses; and Mary Lou D\u2019Addario, the decedent\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Shortly after the beginning of the trial, the plaintiff argued that the burden of proof should be placed upon the defendants to show that they had acted properly in their management of the estate. At the close of the plaintiffs case-in-chief, the plaintiff again argued that the burden of proof should be placed upon the defendants. The court ruled from the bench that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show why removal of the coexecutors was warranted. The court relied on General Statutes \u00a7 45a-242,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which governs the removal of fiduciaries; the decedent\u2019s will, in which he had appointed certain individuals to be executors;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the jurisdictional limitations on the trial court sitting as a Probate Court in a probate appeal. Immediately thereafter, the trial judge dismissed the case, sua sponte. The court made no finding of whether there had been a breach of fiduciary duty. Rather, the court focused on the lack of evidence warranting removal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Af2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The court stated that the plaintiff had faded to meet its burden of proof because the evidence had established that: (1) the coexecutors were engaged in ongoing negotiations with Red Knot to extend the timetable to pay off the debt; (2) the current executors would be in a better position to continue the negotiations than a new professional executor; and (3) assets that had been characterized as tax losses that should have been sold had other value. The court noted that the plaintiffs expert, in formulating his opinions, had failed to consider records that had been on file with the Probate Court for a year or longer, including dispositive court rulings that had approved certain transactions questioned by the plaintiff. The expert presented no plan for liquidation, but testified that a professional executor could wrap up the estate in one to two years subject to a litigation contingency. The court believed that the executors could wrap things up as quickly. Finally, the court rejected portions of the expert\u2019s report, including his estimate of the loss incurred by the estate on the loan to Virginia D\u2019Addario, which had been approved by the Probate Court, and the figures on the Spray Trusts claim, which had been audited by the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the court improperly assigned to it the burden of proving a breach of fiduciary duty. These alleged breaches were of two types: (1) acts of self-dealing and conflict of interest, specifically transactions involving the Honeyspot Road Extension property, the condominiums, and the life insurance policy for Ann D\u2019Addario; and (2) waste of estate assets, specifically the continued operation of failing businesses and the transfer of moneys to these businesses and the payments for condominium mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>nance, for Ann D\u2019Addario\u2019s life insurance policy and for David D\u2019Addario\u2019s company car.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We first set forth the proper standard of review. When a party contests the burden of proof applied by the trial court, the standard of review is de novo because the matter is a question of law. <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Kozek, </em>58 Conn. App. 768, 771, 755 A.2d 333, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 928, 761 A.2d 755 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We have held that an executor has a fiduciary duty to the creditors of the estate. \u201cAn executrix has a fiduciary responsibility \u2018to maintain an undivided loyalty to the estate\u2019; <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>202 Conn. 57, 65, 519 A.2d 1185 (1987); and must diligently represent \u2018the rights of the heirs and distributees and also those of <em>creditors.\u2019 Finnegan v. LaFontaine, </em>122 Conn. 561, 567, 191 A. 337 (1937).\u201d <em>Hall v. Schoenwetter, </em>239 Conn. 553, 559, 686 A.2d 980 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u201cOur law on the obligations of a fiduciary is well settled. [A] fiduciary or confidential relationship is characterized by a unique degree of trust and confidence between the parties, one of whom has superior knowledge, skill or expertise and is under a duty to represent the interests of the other. . . . The superior position of the fiduciaiy or dominant party affords him great opportunity for abuse of the confidence reposed in him. . . . <em>Konover Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>228 Conn. 206, 219, 635 A.2d 798 (1994). Once a [fiduciary] relationship is found to exist, the burden of proving fair dealing properly shifts to the fiduciary. . . . Furthermore, the standard of proof for establishing fair dealing is not the ordinary standard of fair preponderance of the evidence, but requires proof either by clear and convincing evidence, clear and satisfactory evidence or clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence. . . . <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 322-23, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 213 n.8, 682 A.2d 106 (1996). Proof of a fiduciaiy relationship, therefore, generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>imposes a twofold burden on the fiduciary. First, the burden of proof shifts to the fiduciary; and second, the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Wakelee, </em>247 Conn. 396, 400, 721 A.2d 1181 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u201cAlthough not always expressly stated, the basis upon which the aforementioned burden shifting and enhanced burden of proof rests is, essentially, that undue influence will not be presumed; <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 252, 571 A.2d 116 (1990) (fraud is not presumed and burden of establishing fraud rests on party who alleges it); and that the presumption of fraud does not arise from the relationship itself. We note, however, that [this] rule is somewhat relaxed in cases where a fiduciary relation exists between the parties to a transaction or contract, and where one has a dominant and controlling force or influence over the other. In such cases, <em>if the superior party obtains a possible benefit, </em>equity raises a presumption against the validity of the transaction or contract, and casts upon such party the burden of proving fairness, honesty, and integrity in the transaction or contract. ... 37 Am. Jur. 2d 601-602, Fraud and Deceit \u00a7 441 (1968); see also <em>United Founders Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>347 S.W.2d 295, 307 (Tex. App. 1961) (when fiduciary relationship is shown and involved transaction is attacked for fraud and party accused has obtained advantage, presumption of unfairness arises which such party must dispel by showing transactions fairly made), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 363 S.W.2d 236 (Tex. 1962). Therefore, it is only when the confidential relationship is shown together with suspicious circumstances, or where there is a transaction, contract, or transfer between persons in a confidential or fiduciary relationship, and where the dominant party is the beneficiary of the transaction, contract, or transfer, that the burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove fair dealing. 25 Am. Jur. 2d 551, Duress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and Undue Influence \u00a7 38 (1996). A fiduciary seeking to profit by a transaction with the one who confided in him has the burden of showing that he has not taken advantage of his influence or knowledge and that the arrangement is fair and conscientious. Id., 552; see also <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>[53 Conn. 299, 307-308, 23 A. 93 (1885)].\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Wakelee, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 405-406. Generally, therefore, when a breach of fiduciary duty is alleged, and the allegations concern fraud, self-dealing or a conflict of interest, the burden of proof shifts to the fiduciary to prove fair dealing by clear and convincing evidence. Id., 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Before applying this common-law burden shifting scheme to this case, we review the law concerning removal of fiduciaries. The court may remove an executor pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court of probate having jurisdiction may, upon its own motion or upon the application and complaint of any person interested or of the surety upon the fiduciary\u2019s probate bond, after notice and hearing, remove any fiduciary if: (1) The fiduciary becomes incapable of executing such fiduciary\u2019s trust, neglects to perform the duties of such fiduciary\u2019s trust, [or] wastes the estate in such fiduciary\u2019s charge . . . .\u201d The term \u201cfiduciary\u201d in \u00a7 45a-242 \u201cincludes an executor, administrator, trustee, conservator or guardian.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-199.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Our case law recognizes that \u201c[r]emoval of an executor is an extraordinary remedy designed to protect against harm caused by the continuing depletion or mismanagement of an estate. ... In the absence of continuing harm to the interests of the estate and its beneficiaries, removal is not justified merely as a punishment for a fiduciary\u2019s past misconduct.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Our case law governing the duties of testamentary trustees also provides some guidance. \u201cIn no case ought the trustee to be removed where there is no danger of a breach of trust, and some of the beneficiaries are satisfied with the management. Nor will a trustee be removed for every violation of duty, or even breach of trust, if the fund is in no danger of being lost. The power of removal of trustees appointed by deed or will ought to be exercised sparingly by the courts. There must be a clear necessity for interference to save the trust property. Mere error, or even breach of trust, may not be sufficient; there must be such misconduct as to show want of capacity or of fidelity, putting the trust in jeopardy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>148 Conn. 361, 369, 170 A.2d 897 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Our research has revealed only one case in which a party claimed that the burden shifting rule employed when breach of fiduciary duty is alleged applies in the context of removal proceedings. In <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Kozek, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 771, the plaintiffs had filed a petition to remove the defendant as the administrator of the estate of Charles Satti. The plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the estate is not clear from the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion. The Probate Court denied the petition and approved, in part, the defendant\u2019s final accounting of the estate. Id., 669. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Superior Court claiming that the defendant\u2019s interests conflicted with those of the estate and, therefore, he was required to prove fair dealing with the estate by clear and convincing evidence. Id., 771. The court concluded that \u201cthe fiduciary\u2019s performance was, by any applicable standard of proof, well within the range of acceptability\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 771-72; and rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Appellate Court claiming that the trial court improperly had failed to place the burden on the defendant to prove, by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>evidence, that he had not breached his fiduciary duty. Id., 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On appeal, the Appellate Court noted that \u201c[i]n certain instances where it is alleged that a fiduciary has breached his duty, the burden of proof shifts such that the fiduciary has the burden of proving fair dealing by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court then noted that the trial court\u2019s ruling had been premised on its conclusion that the defendant\u2019s performance had been acceptable \u201cby <em>any </em>applicable standard of proof.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 771-72. Accordingly, it concluded that the trial court had held the defendant to the appropriate standard and affirmed the judgment. Id., 772. The Appellate Court did not address our case law holding that removal of an executor is an extraordinary remedy and will not be ordered absent \u201ccontinuing harm to the interests of the estate and its beneficiaries . . . .\u201d <em>Ramsdell </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In the present case, the plaintiff relies on <em>Satti </em>to support its claim that the trial court improperly failed to place the burden on the defendants to prove that they had not breached their fiduciary duty to the plaintiff. As we have noted, however, because the Appellate Court in <em>Satti </em>relied on the trial court\u2019s statement that the defendants\u2019 conduct had satisfied <em>any </em>burden of proof, it simply had no need to consider the question whether, in removal proceedings, the fiduciary faces the same high burden of proof that it faces in other cases where a breach of fiduciary duty is claimed. Accordingly, we address that question in this case as a matter of first impression.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">In considering this question, it is useful to examine the policies underlying the apparently conflicting rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that: (1) the burden of proof is ordinarily shifted to the fiduciary when breach of fiduciary duty is alleged; and (2) removal of an estate\u2019s fiduciary will not be ordered except in extraordinary cases to avoid continuing harm to the interests of the estate. Underlying the former rule is the recognition that the fiduciary\u2019s principal has voluntarily placed \u201ca unique degree of trust and confidence [in the fiduciary, who] has superior knowledge, skill or expertise\u201d that is to be exercised on behalf of the principal. <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Corp., </em>261 Conn. 620, 640, 804 A.2d 180 (2002); <em>Konover Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 219. Accordingly, when the fiduciary has a \u201cdominant and controlling force or influence\u201d over his principal, or the transaction at issue, the burden shifts to the fiduciary to prove the \u201cfairness, honesty and integrity in the transaction . . . .\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Wakelee, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 405. In contrast, underlying the rule that removal is an extraordinary remedy to be applied sparingly is the recognition that the decedent has specifically chosen the fiduciary for the specific purpose of administering his estate and managing the claims of persons with conflicting interests in the estate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, although the decedent has voluntarily entrusted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>management of his estate into the hands of the executor because of his expertise, knowledge or skill, the creditor has not voluntarily entrusted the executor with managing its claim. Thus, the executor\u2019s primary duty is to the estate itself, and to fulfilling the intentions of the decedent with respect to the estate. Only secondarily is the executor\u2019s duty to those with conflicting interests in the estate, vis-\u00e1-vis the decedent, with whom, nevertheless, the fiduciary is obligated to deal fairly. Thus, although we have recognized that the executor of an estate has a fiduciary duty to its creditors; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Schoenwetter, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 559; that duty does not rise to the level of the duty owed by a fiduciary to a principal who voluntarily has placed his confidence and trust in the fiduciary for a specific purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">With these considerations in mind, we conclude that the burden shifting that ordinarily is employed when a plaintiff has alleged a breach of fiduciary duty does not apply in removal proceedings. Instead, the burden is on the party seeking removal to establish that removal is required to prevent continuing harm to the interests of the estate. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The plaintiffs remaining claims all stem from its assertion that the court improperly dismissed the case sua sponte due to the plaintiffs failure to establish a prima facie case. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the court, in dismissing the case sua sponte, improperly weighed the evidence and failed to view it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In support of its claim, the plaintiff relies on our case law stating that \u201cto establish a prima facie case, the proponent must submit evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to establish the <em>fact or </em>facts which it is adduced to prove. ... In evaluating a motion to dismiss, [t]he evidence offered by the plaintiff is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>taken as true and interpreted in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], and every reasonable inference is to be drawn in [the plaintiffs] favor. ... A party has the same right to submit a weak case as he has to submit a strong one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grondin </em>v. <em>Curi, </em>262 Conn. 637, 647-48 n.12, 817 A.2d 61 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The plaintiff fails to recognize, however, that these principles apply only in cases where the court\u2019s dismissal prevents the plaintiff from presenting his case to the fact finder for consideration on the merits. See <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>246 Conn. 594, 608, 717 A.2d 713 (1998) (\u201c[a] prima facie case ... is one sufficient to raise an issue to go to the trier of fact\u201d). In such cases, this court considers only whether there was sufficient evidence to allow the fact finder to consider the claim. In the present case, the trial court <em>was </em>the fact finder. Thus, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s characterization of its ruling as a dismissal for failure to establish a prima facie case, the question before us is not whether the evidence was sufficient to present the claim to a finder of fact, but whether, having presented its case to the fact finder at trial, the plaintiff sustained its burden of proof. \u201cIn a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony.\u201d <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 153, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). \u201cIt is within the province of the trial court, as the fact finder, to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>260 Conn. 296, 327, 796 A.2d 516 (2002). Upon careful review of the evidence, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the plaintiff did not sustain its burden of proof. Accordingly, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The defendants\u2019 appeal is dismissed; the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\"> Both the plaintiff and the defendants appealed to the Appellate Court and the matter was transferred to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial ... he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 61-1 provides: \u201cAn aggrieved party may appeal from a final judgment, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> The relevant portions of the letter state: \u201cConfirming our telephone conversation, please take this as notice to the executors, under the applicable rules and statutes, of claims against the estate of Francis D\u2019Addario on behalf of the Bank of New Haven whom we represent.

Therefore, we treat the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss and an objection to the motion to dismiss.
