The respondent parents, Jeffrey C. (father) and Shellie C.

They claim, among other things, that the trial court improperly drew an adverse inference against them, without prior notice, in violation of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f), for their failure to testify at the termination proceeding.

The respondents elected not to testify at the termination proceeding. The trial court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondents had failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation as required by \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii), and, accordingly, that court granted the petition. In doing so, however, the trial court expressly drew an adverse inference against the respondents for their failure to testify at the termination proceeding, stating that \u201cthe court infers from [the respondents\u2019] silence that they are continuing their volatile relationship and are unable to care for Samantha\u2019s needs.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. Samantha was bom on April 24, 1996, and was the respondents\u2019 first child. The respondents were married on April 15, 1999, shortly before the birth of their second child, Lewis C., on June 4, 1999. Although Lewis has remained in the respondents\u2019 care throughout his life, Samantha has been in the care of the department of children and families (department) since December 20, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The respondents have been involved with each other since 1994, but they have separated several times over the years. Moreover, their relationship has been marked by frequent domestic disputes, to some of which the police have been called to respond. The department began assisting the respondents in early 1997, and assigned an in-home parent aide to help the couple with basic child care tasks and safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Following a particular dispute to which the police were called,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the department investigated the respondents\u2019 home. On December 20, 1997, dissatisfied with Samantha\u2019s environment, particularly the uncleanliness of the home, the department exercised a ninety-six hour administrative hold over twenty month old Samantha. The department subsequently was granted an order of temporary custody over Samantha, allowing the respondents supervised visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">After two brief placements, Samantha was placed in the care of her maternal great aunt. The respondents rarely visited Samantha while she resided with her great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>aunt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result, on April 9,1999, the court adjudicated Samantha a neglected child. Thereafter, on January 24, 2000, Samantha was placed in another foster home, after the department had concluded that the great aunt\u2019s home was an inappropriate environment for Samantha.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was later discovered that Samantha also had been sexually abused by another relative while she was residing with her great aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Samantha\u2019s new foster parents tried to facilitate reunification and allowed the respondents to visit her. Nonetheless, the department noted that neither respondent had been following through with the department\u2019s referrals to service providers, the mother was not interacting with Samantha during visits, and the father, who remained unable to control his anger, seemed ambivalent about reunifying the family. For those reasons, in February, 2000, the petitioner filed the first of two petitions to terminate the respondents\u2019 parental rights with respect to Samantha.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Thereafter, the respondents began to make progress toward reunification. The father maintained employment, attended anger management counseling and participated in a fatherhood initiative group. The respondents both made good progress in their individual counseling sessions. Additionally, the respondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>engaged in couples therapy. Accordingly, on April 28, 2000, the petitioner withdrew that first termination petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In the fall of 2000, the department began to attempt to reunify the family. The respondents were now having overnight visits with Samantha at their home. During this time, however, the respondents were having marital problems. The department learned that the mother had taken Lewis and had left the father. Also around this time, Samantha\u2019s foster mother noticed a large bruise on the mother\u2019s neck. The foster mother also reported that Samantha had said her father was \u201c \u2018bad,\u2019 \u201d and that the mother had admitted that there were problems with the marriage. The mother had little contact with Samantha during this time, and she was uncertain whether she would seek a marital dissolution or continue with the reunification plan. The father expressed a desire to take Samantha on his own, but also made it clear that he would be unable to perform basic parenting functions, such as giving the child a bath. The department subsequently referred the respondents to couples counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In December, 2000, the respondents resumed living together as a couple. A few weeks later, in January, 2001, after a long weekend, the respondents returned Samantha to her foster parents. She was filthy and had a bruise on her leg. Although the respondents maintained that the bruise had been caused when Samantha had been playing with a calf, the petitioner contended that the bruise was caused when the father had stepped on the child with his boots. The department investigated the respondents\u2019 home and found it unclean, noting that there were dog feces on the floor in an area where Lewis played. In February, 2001, the petitioner filed this second petition to terminate the respondents\u2019 parental rights with respect to Samantha.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>During 2001, the respondents continued to visit Samantha, albeit in a supervised setting. The respondents\u2019 relationship, however, was not going well, and the mother reported that she had again separated from the father. Meanwhile, Samantha began to withdraw from her father and avoid interaction with him during his visits. The father admitted that his visits with Samantha were not going well. Additionally, Samantha\u2019s behavior had become worse. She began urinating and defecating in inappropriate places. As a result of her behavior, Samantha\u2019s foster mother requested that Samantha be placed elsewhere. On April 24, 2001, Samantha was placed in a preadoptive home, where she was residing at the time of the termination proceeding that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">At the termination hearing, the petitioner presented the testimony of seven witnesses: one of Samantha\u2019s former foster mothers; a police officer; two department caseworkers; two therapists who treated Samantha; and a court-appointed psychologist, Robert Meier, who evaluated both Samantha and the respondents. The respondents presented no witnesses, and both elected not to testily at the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court first concluded that the petitioner had proven by clear and convincing evidence, as required by \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify Samantha with the respondents. The court next turned to the issue of whether the petitioner had proven that the respondents had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as required by \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>(B) (ii).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the basis of the testimony before it, and the thirty documents in evidence, the court noted that the petitioner had proven the following facts by clear and convincing evidence. \u201cPrior to her recent preadoptive placement, Samantha had emotional and behavioral problems [including enuresis and encopresis].<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Samantha\u2019s multiple placements and her sexual abuse in a relativef\u2019s] foster placement contributed to her emotional and behavioral problems. It was, however, her parents\u2019 issues that brought her into [the department\u2019s] care. During the first two years of Samantha\u2019s placement in foster care, her parents visited her little. From the end of 1999 to October, 2000, the respondents\u2019 relationship appeared to have stabilized. In fact, it had not. Samantha\u2019s emotional and behavioral problems subsided when [the department] abandoned reunification attempts and when Samantha was placed with her present, preadoptive parents. Thus, when Meier observed Samantha, her behavioral and emotional problems were in remission. These problems, however, would resurface and be aggravated if Samantha were returned to an environment marked by much yelling and instability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Even assuming that the respondents could, individually, parent Samantha adequately, together they have chosen to maintain a relationship, and a lifestyle, that is chaotic, unstable and punctuated by domestic violence. Notably, Samantha has been in foster care for [more than four] years, far longer than is now prescribed by state [or federal] law .... Thus, the respondents have had more than enough time to rehabilitate. The court finds, as [Meier] opined, that all time for the respondents to rehabilitate has expired.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The trial court also stated, \u201c[t]he respondents, both of whom were present in the courtroom throughout the trial, elected not to testify. <em>The court infers from their silence that they are continuing their volatile relationship and are unable to care for Samantha\u2019s needs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court spent the next several pages<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of its analysis discussing its reasons for drawing an adverse inference in this context. The court then stated: \u201cHere, whether the respondents had eliminated the upheaval in their home caused by the father\u2019s behavior and the mother\u2019s periodically fleeing the home to parts unknown, such that either or both could care for Samantha, was a central issue in the adjudicatory portion of the case. [The department] presented evidence that the upheaval, indeed, was continuing. If the situation had changed, that evidence was uniquely within the power of the respondents to produce. With so much at stake, it was evidence that they naturally would have produced if they could have. They did not. Notably, the respondents were present in the courtroom throughout the trial. . . . <em>Weighing the evidence in light of the failure of the respondents to testify to the contrary, </em>the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondents have failed to achieve such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering Samantha\u2019s age and her needs, that they could assume a responsible position in her life.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">After making the required findings delineated in \u00a7 17a-112 (k),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that it was in Samantha\u2019s best interest that the respondents\u2019 parental rights be terminated. Accordingly, the court granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The respondents present four claims on appeal, any of which, if successful, would warrant reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. They claim that: (1) there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to have con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>eluded that the respondents\u2019 had failed to achieve rehabilitation; (2) the trial court improperly concluded that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; (3) the trial court improperly drew an adverse inference against the respondents for their failure to testify at the termination proceeding in violation of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f); and (4) even if an adverse inference may permissibly have been drawn in the present case, the trial court was required to have given the respondents\u2019 prior notice of its intent to do so. We disagree with the respondents\u2019 first two claims. In addition, we conclude that, as a general matter, Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) did not prohibit the trial court from drawing an adverse inference against the respondents. We agree, however, with the respondents\u2019 fourth claim, namely, that the trial court was required to have given them prior notice of its intent to draw such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The respondents\u2019 first two claims are not dependent on their last two claims. If they were to prevail on either of their first two claims, they would be entitled to a reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment and a judgment directed in their favor; whereas their last two claims would entitle them only to a reversal of the judgment and a new termination proceeding. Nevertheless, the respondents\u2019 first two claims are premised on the notion that the trial court made improper findings of fact. The trial court\u2019s factual findings, however, were based, at least in part, upon its drawing of an adverse inference. In this regard, we cannot say with any certainty whether the trial court would have ruled the way that it did in the absence of such an inference, nor can we conclude that it would have found the same facts by clear and convincing evidence. Thus, in order to reach properly the respondents\u2019 first two claims, we assume that the trial court would have made the same factual findings with or without the adverse inference. With those prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ciples in mind, we address each of the respondents\u2019 claims in seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">FAILURE TO ACHIEVE REHABILITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The respondents first claim that there was insufficient evidence on which the trial court could have concluded that they had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">We first turn to the standard of review that governs this claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s finding that a parent has failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 705, 741 A.2d 873 (1999). A finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>264 Conn. 286, 303-304, 823 A.2d 1184 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was factually supported and legally correct. Id., 303. In doing so, however, \u201c[g]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [Rather] every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 705-706.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In order to terminate a parent\u2019s parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the petitioner is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (1); (2) termination is in the best interest of the child; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2); and (3) there exists any one of the seven grounds for termination delineated in \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The sole ground alleged in this petition was that the respondents had failed to achieve rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii), which allows for termination if a child has been found to be neglected, <em>and </em>the parents have \u201cfailed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d \u201cPersonal rehabilitation . . . refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent . . . [and] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent\u2019s] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . . The statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely when she will be able to assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. Nor does it require her to prove that she will be able to assume full responsibility for her child, unaided by available support systems. It requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation she has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>that at some future date she can assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the evidence credited by the trial court adequately supported its conclusion that the respondents had failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation. The petitioner presented seven witnesses to the trial court: one of Samantha\u2019s former foster mothers; a police officer; two department caseworkers; two therapists who had evaluated Samantha; and Meier, a court-appointed psychologist. The court reasonably concluded that Samantha had emotional and behavioral problems, which, according to Meier, were likely to resurface if she were to be placed in an unstable environment. The evidence suggested, moreover, that the respondents\u2019 relationship had remained unstable and chaotic, which created significant doubt as to whether they could adequately meet Samantha\u2019s needs. Indeed, Samantha\u2019s behavior tended to become worse after overnight visitations with the respondents. In particular, the court credited Meier\u2019s testimony, who concluded that, given the amount of time that Samantha had remained in temporary care, and given her need for permanency, the time for rehabilitation had passed. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to have concluded that, considering the age and needs of the child, the respondents had failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that they could assume a responsible position in Samantha\u2019s life. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondents had failed to achieve rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii) was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The respondents argue, nonetheless, that their \u201cordinary marital problems\u201d did not provide a sufficient basis on which to terminate their parental rights. We are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>persuaded. Irrespective of how the respondents\u2019 marital problems are characterized, the heart of the trial court\u2019s conclusion was based, not solely on the respondents marital problems, but on Samantha\u2019s special needs. It is well established that a parent\u2019s rehabilitative status must be viewed with respect to the needs of the particular child at issue. <em>In re Eden F., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 706. Indeed, the evidence before the court suggested that Samantha, because of her unique behavioral problems, required care beyond that which the respondents were willing or able to provide. Thus, although the respondents\u2019 marital problems may arguably be characterized as \u201cordinary,\u201d at least in the sense that their problems may not have been as severe as marital problems in other termination cases, there was ample evidence for the court to find that they were unable to meet Samantha\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In addition, the trial court correctly noted that it was irrelevant that the respondents\u2019 second child, Lewis, had not manifested the same behavioral problems as Samantha. Although the respondents may be able to care adequately for Lewis, who does not have the same needs as Samantha, there was enough evidence on which the trial court could have concluded that the respondents could not meet Samantha\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The respondents further argue that trial court improperly relied on Samantha\u2019s past behavioral problems in terminating their parental rights because any behavioral problems of Samantha\u2019s were caused by the department and not by the respondents. In that regard, the respondents rely on <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 534-35, 613 A.2d 748 (1992), arguing that it is a violation of due process to terminate one\u2019s parental rights based on conditions caused solely by the department. We are not persuaded. Although some of Samantha\u2019s problems may have manifested themselves after the department had taken custody of her, for instance, the sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that had occurred during one of Samantha\u2019s foster placements, there was ample evidence on which the trial court could have concluded that Samantha\u2019s problems were caused and exacerbated by her exposure to the respondents\u2019 disputes. In addition, as noted by the trial court, Meier testified that it was the respondents\u2019 conduct that had placed Samantha in the department\u2019s care. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the trial court terminated the respondents\u2019 parental rights based solely on conditions caused by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Finally, the respondents argue that they were not given fair warning as to what conduct was required, or must have been avoided, in order to prevent termination of their parental rights. Specifically, the respondents contend that, because the department failed to discuss with them Samantha\u2019s special needs, termination was improper. This contention fails because there was evidence that the respondents were given ample notice regarding the problems with which the department was concerned. In one report, for instance, Meier laid out several steps the respondents must take in order to avoid the possibility that Samantha might be placed elsewhere. In addition, the respondents both engaged in couples therapy, and the father attended anger management counseling, as well as a fatherhood initiative group. Even if we were to assume that the respondents were not given <em>actual </em>notice of what conduct was required on their part, it is unreasonable to assume, based on their repeated interaction with the department, and the fact that Samantha had been in the department\u2019s care since late 1997, that they were unaware that certain conduct may have led to the filing of a termination petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">REASONABLE EFFORTS TO REUNIFY FAMILY</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">We now turn to the respondents\u2019 second claim, namely, that the trial court improperly concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family. We reject this claim. .</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In order to terminate parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112 (j), the department is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it \u201chas made reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds . . . that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 0) (1). The standard for reviewing reasonable efforts has been well established by the Appellate Court. \u201cTurning to the statutory scheme encompassing the termination of the parental rights of a child committed to the department, [\u00a7 17a-112] imposes on the department the duty, inter alia, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department\u2019s efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible. . . . The trial court\u2019s determination of this issue will not be overturned on appeal unless, in light of all of the evidence in the record, it is clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Daniel C., </em>63 Conn. App. 339, 361, 776 A.2d 487 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">There was adequate evidence on which the trial court could have concluded that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family. Since Samantha was placed in the department\u2019s custody beginning in late 1997, the department had offered to the respondents several programs to aid in their reunification. Indeed, as the trial court noted, these programs included: individual and family counseling; parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>classes; psychological evaluations; an in-home parent aide; home visits with Samantha; supervised visitation; and case management services. In addition, the department scheduled two reunifications prior to the filing of the petition in the present case. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the family was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The respondents argue, nonetheless, that the trial court\u2019s obseivation that the second reunification was \u201c \u2018prematurely aborted\u2019 \u201d necessitates a finding that the department did not make reasonable efforts. We are not persuaded. The respondents give too much credit to this observation because, although the trial court did opine that the second reunification was \u201cprematurely aborted,\u201d the court stated immediately thereafter that the services offered to the respondents were \u201cwell tailored\u201d in the present case. In addition, Meier testified that, given the age and needs of Samantha, the time allotted for the respondents\u2019 rehabilitation had since passed. Considering the extended amount of time that Samantha had been in foster care, it was not unreasonable for the department to abandon reunification efforts when it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">ADVERSE INFERENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The respondents next claim that the trial court improperly drew an adverse inference against them for their failure to testify at the termination proceeding in violation of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f). In support of their claim, the respondents first contend that the plain language of \u00a7 34-1 (f) dictated that no adverse inference could be drawn against a parent for his or her failure to testify. In addition, the respondents argue that, because the language in \u00a7 34-1 <em>(f), </em>providing that \u201c[n]o parent . . . shall be compelled to testify if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>testimony might tend ... to establish the validity of the facts alleged in the petition,\u201d mirrored that of the privilege against self-incrimination contained in the fifth amendment to the United States constitution, the two provisions ought to be interpreted the same way. Thus, the respondents contend, because the fifth amendment forbids an adverse inference from being drawn against a criminal defendant for electing not to testify at trial, \u00a7 34-1 (f) similarly forbade an adverse inference from being drawn against the respondents in the present case. The petitioner argues, to the contrary, that \u00a7 34-1 did not prohibit an adverse inference from being drawn against a parent; rather, the petitioner contends, it merely prohibited the petitioner from calling a parent to testify in a termination proceeding in an effort to prove the facts alleged in the petition. That is, the petitioner contends, although a parent has a right to refuse to testify in a termination proceeding, the petitioner may, as in any other civil proceeding, place a cost on a parent\u2019s assertion of that right, namely, allowing the trier of fact to draw an adverse inference. We agree with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the law regarding adverse inferences drawn from a party\u2019s failure to testify in noncriminal proceedings. As a general rule, one party may call the other as a witness in any proceeding unless the latter is privileged not to testify. For instance, \u201c[t]he fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination not only protects the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Olin Corp. </em>v. <em>Castells, </em>180 Conn. 49, 53, 428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>A.2d 319 (1980). The privilege against self-incrimination also carries with it the added benefit that no adverse inference may be drawn against the accused in any criminal proceeding from the accused\u2019s invocation of the privilege. <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 305, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981) (upon defendant\u2019s request, court must charge jury that no adverse inference may be drawn from defendant\u2019s failure to testify); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614-15, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965) (prosecutor may not comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify); see also General Statutes \u00a7 54-84<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (state constitution prohibition against unfavorable inference from accused\u2019s failure to testify). \u201cThe privilege does not, however, forbid the drawing of adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them. The prevailing rule is that the fifth amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause.\u201d <em>Olin Corp. </em>v. <em>Castells, </em>supra, 53-54; <em>see Mitchell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 328, 119 S. Ct. 1307, 143 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In the absence of an express statutory provision to the contrary; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-138a<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>adverse inference may be drawn against accused juvenile for failure to testify in delinquency proceeding); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k (f)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (no adverse inference may drawn if battered women\u2019s counselor fails to testify regarding privileged communications); \u201clogic suggests that an adverse inference is warranted\u201d when a witness invokes a nonconstitutional privilege. C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 5.5.2 (b), pp. 304-305.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cThus, aside from the privilege against compelled self-incrimination . . . silence in the face of accusation is [in proper circumstances] a relevant fact not barred from evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 319, 96 S. Ct. 1551, 47 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1976). These remarks reflect the long-standing principle that the trier of fact \u201cis entitled to draw all fair and reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances [that] it finds established by the evidence,\u201d which consist both of what was said, and what naturally would have been. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>129 Conn. 483, 486, 29 A.2d 582 (1942). This is perhaps best expressed in Justice Brand\u00e9is\u2019 pithy observation that \u201c[s]ilence is often evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>of the most persuasive character.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Bilokumsky </em>v. <em>Tod, </em>263 U.S. 149, 153-54, 44 S. Ct. 54, 68 L. Ed. 221 (1923), overruled in part, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Furthermore, a trier of fact generally may draw an adverse inference against a party for its failure to rebut evidence. For years, Connecticut recognized the \u201cmissing witness\u201d rule, which permitted a court to instruct the jury that it could draw an adverse inference against a party for its failure to call an available witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 722, 728-29, 737 A.2d 442 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1170, 120 S. Ct. 1195, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1099 (2000). That instruction, known as a <em>Secondino </em>charge,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is now, for various policy reasons, prohibited by statute in civil cases; General Statutes \u00a7 52-216c;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and by our precedent in criminal cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 739. Despite the statute and <em>Malave, </em>however, the substance of the \u201cmissing witness\u201d rule remains intact because, even without an instruction from the court, the jury may nevertheless draw an adverse inference in the same instances. Provided that the witness is shown to be \u201cavailable,\u201d \u00a7 52-216c expressly permits counsel to argue the point during closing arguments, and <em>Malave </em>allows \u201cappropriate comment\u201d regarding a witness\u2019 absence \u201c[s]o long as counsel does not directly exhort the jury to draw an adverse inference . . . .\u201d Id. Thus, although \u00a7 52-216c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and <em>Malave </em>restricted the means by which the trier of fact is apprised of its ability to draw an adverse inference, it is clear that it remains permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">An adverse inference, however, does not supply <em>proof </em>of any particular fact; rather, it may be used only to <em>weigh </em>facts already in evidence. C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 4.3.2, p. 206; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 129 Conn. 487; <em>Middletown Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bregman, </em>118 Conn. 651, 657, 174 A. 67 (1934). In that regard, an \u201cinference drawn from the failure to testify . . . does not shift the burden of proof so as to relieve the party upon whom it rests of the necessity of establishing a prima facie case, although it may turn the scale when the evidence is closely balanced.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 487; <em>Middletown Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bregman, </em>supra, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In sum, a synthesis of the previous discussion reveals this general rule: After aprima facie case is established, an adverse inference may be drawn against a party for his or her failure to testify, unless the party was entitled to rely upon one of the few exceptional privileges that carry with it a protection from adverse inferences. With this background in mind, we turn to the merits of the respondents\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The privilege on which the respondents rely is that set forth in Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which was silent with regard to adverse inferences. The present case, therefore, requires us to interpret the scope and meaning of \u00a7 31-4 (f). Accordingly, this issue presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary. <em>Commissioner of Social Services </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>265 Conn. 723, 734, 830 A.2d 228 (2003). We, therefore, examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the language of the rule, its relationship to the statutes that it was designed to implement, the official commentary to the rule, the policy behind the rule\u2019s adoption, and common-law and constitutional principles governing analogous situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In addition, we are mindful that, although \u201c[t]he Superior Court is empowered to adopt and promulgate rules regulating pleading, practice and procedure . . . [s]uch mies shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>187 Conn. 292, 297, 445 A.2d 901 (1982); see General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a). \u201cJust as the general assembly lacks the power to enact rules governing procedure that is exclusively within the power of the courts; Conn. Const., art. V, \u00a7 1 ... so do the courts lack the power to promulgate mies governing substantive rights and remedies.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pesino </em>v. <em>Atlantic Bank of New York, </em>244 Conn. 85, 85-86 n.l, 709 A.2d 540 (1998). Finally, \u201cthe court rules themselves are expressly limited in scope to practice and procedure in the Superior Court; Practice Book \u00a7 [1-1]; and do not purport to reach beyond such limits.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 297. Accordingly, although the branches of government \u201cfrequently overlap,\u201d and notwithstanding that \u201cthe doctrine of the separation of powers cannot be applied rigidly\u201d; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 676, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991); we are obliged to interpret Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 so as not to <em>create </em>a new right, but rather to <em>delineate </em>whatever rights may have existed, statutorily or otherwise, at the time of the proceedings underlying the present appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>We conclude that Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) did not preclude the trial court from drawing an adverse inference from the respondents\u2019 failure to testify. We base this conclusion on: (1) the language of \u00a7 34-1 (f); (2) the official commentary to the rule of practice that succeeded \u00a7 34-1 (f); and (3) the policies of the statutes that \u00a7 34-1 (f) was adopted to implement. More specifically, we conclude that \u00a7 34-1 (f) must be read in light of the statutes that it implemented, and that the policy of those statutes requires an interpretation of \u00a7 34-1 (f) that runs contrary to the respondents\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We next turn to a brief review of the relevant statutes and rules, many of which overlap, that govern termination of parental rights proceedings. For children already in the custody of the department, like Samantha in the present case, termination of parental rights petitions are filed in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters pursuant to \u00a7 17a-l 12. Other such petitions may be filed in the Probate Courts pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715. In either case, hearing procedures are governed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-716 and 45a-717. P. Chill, The Law of Child Abuse and Neglect in Connecticut (University of Connecticut Legal Clinic 1997) pp. 121, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In addition, juvenile matters are governed by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 et seq. These statutes provide parties to juvenile proceedings with, among other things, certain rights, such as the right to counsel and the \u201cright to refuse to make any statement . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (b); see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135 (right to counsel and cross-examination); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-136 (appointed counsel at judge\u2019s discretion); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (admissibility of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>fessions); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-138a (testimony of accused juvenile and parent in delinquency proceeding). Juvenile matters in the \u201ccivil session\u201d include proceedings concerning neglected, uncared-for or dependent children, as well as \u201ctermination of parental rights of children committed to a state agency,\u201d whereas juvenile matters in the \u201ccriminal session\u201d include all delinquency proceedings. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121 (a).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Finally, at the time of the proceedings underlying this appeal, chapter 34 of the Practice Book, most of which has been transferred to chapter 32a, outlined the rights of parties in juvenile matters. We turn first, therefore, to the language of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>which, like its statutory counterparts, provided parents in juvenile matters with a \u201cright to silence and to counsel\u201d in hearings concerning neglected, uncared-for or dependent children, termination of parental rights proceedings, as well as delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The present case turns on a careful reading of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1, specifically subsections (a) and (f), which grant and clarify, respectively, the \u201cright to silence\u201d on which the respondents rely. Subsection (a) provides: \u201cThe judicial authority shall advise and explain to the parents, child or youth their <em>right to silence </em>and to counsel prior to commencement of any proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a). Subsection (f) delineates the parent\u2019s or child\u2019s \u201cright to silence\u201d referred to in subsection (a), by providing that \u201c[a]ny child shall have the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>remain silent at any stage of the proceedings. No parent who is the subject of a petition shall be compelled to testify if the testimony might tend to incriminate in any criminal proceeding or to establish the validity of the facts alleged in the petition.\u201d Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f). Thus, as the petitioner concedes, \u00a7 34-1 (f) prohibited the petitioner from calling a parent to testify in a termination proceeding in an effort to prove the facts alleged in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">With respect to the drawing of an adverse inference, however, the language of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) may plausibly be read either in favor of the petitioner or the respondents. Thus, one could infer that the prohibition of subsection (f) against \u201ccompell[ing] [a parent] to testily ... to establish the validity of the facts alleged in the petition,\u201d did not prohibit an adverse inference from the parents\u2019 failure voluntarily to testily, because it suggested only a prohibition against the petitioner calling a parent to the stand, or arguably taking his or her deposition, in order to establish such facts. One could also infer, to the contrary, that the language was intended to prohibit, not only direct compulsion such as that described, but what may be regarded as its functional equivalent, by virtue of the court drawing an adverse inference from the failure to testify voluntarily. Although the balance is fairly close, we think the more plausible interpretation is the former. This initial conclusion is buttressed by reference to the extratextual sources of the meaning of the language of \u00a7 34-1 (f). We turn, next, to those sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">With regard to a parent\u2019s right to silence, Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 was adopted in order to implement \u00a7 46b-137,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which governs the admissibility of confessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>and other statements in juvenile proceedings. Section 46b-137, which was initially enacted in 1967; Public Acts 1967, No. 630, \u00a7\u00a7 7,10; and later amended in 1969; Public Acts, 1969, No. 794, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14; by its language and purpose was enacted to afford certain constitutional rights to parents and children in juvenile matters. The earliest version of Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) was adopted five years later in 1974.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Section 46b-137 (a) relates to delinquency proceedings, and spells out, among other things, an accused child\u2019s right to silence. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 46b-137 relates to proceedings in which a petition alleges neglect, and similarly provides parents with a right to silence. Specifically, \u00a7 46b-137 (b) provides, among other things, that any statement made by a parent, after the filing of a petition, shall be inadmissible against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>parent unless he or she had been advised of his or her right to counsel and \u201cright to refuse to make any statement . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 bestowed upon parents rights matching those outlined in \u00a7 46b-137 (b), although the rule defined those rights more precisely than does the statute. For instance, both the rule and statute specifically address a parent\u2019s right to counsel and right to silence in neglect proceedings. With respect to a parent\u2019s right to counsel, both the rule and the statute provide that parents must be advised of their right to counsel, and that, in the event that a parent is unable to afford counsel, counsel will be appointed, although the rule also defined by whom, in what manner, and in what situations counsel will be appointed. Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (b) through (e).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> With respect to a parent\u2019s right to silence, \u00a7 46b-137 (b) provides that a parent must be advised of his or her \u201cright to refuse to make any statement,\u201d while Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a) provided that a parent must be advised of his or her \u201cright to remain silent,\u201d <em>and </em>that \u201c[n]o parent . . . shall be compelled to testify . . . .\u201d Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f). These similarities provide ample support that Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 was drafted with \u00a7 46b-137 (b) in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Further, bolstering this conclusion is the official commentary to Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) contained in the 2003 Practice Book, explaining that \u00a7 34-1 (1) was repealed and was replaced by Practice Book \u00a7 32a-l (e),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which was effective January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>1,2003.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> According to the official commentary, Practice Book \u00a7 32a-l (e) is taken verbatim from \u00a7 46b-137 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The official commentary to Practice Book \u00a7 32a-l (e) states that \u201c[\u00a7 34-1 (f)] inappropriately narrow[ed] the right as set forth in [\u00a7 46b-137 (b)].\u201d Although the commentary did not define precisely how the rule \u201cinappropriately narrow[ed]\u201d the statute, one commentator has suggested that \u00a7 46b-137 (b) allows for broader rights than does Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) because, whereas \u00a7 46b-137 (b) provides the \u201cright to refuse to make any statement,\u201d the rule \u201csuggests that a parent may be compelled to testify in other respects\u2014such as with regard to deposition.\u201d P. Chill, supra, p. 81. In that regard, \u201cthe . . . rule here probably must yield to the statute.\u201d Id.; C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 1.15.2 (b), p. 49 (\u201c[although [\u00a7 34-1 (f)] might be viewed as limiting a parent\u2019s right not to testify in such proceedings, the rule is subsumed in [\u00a7 46b-137 (b)] that provides parents with a broad right not to make any statement\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Although these remarks make no mention of whether an adverse inference is permissible under either the rule or the statute, they support our conclusion that Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) was adopted with \u00a7 46b-137 (b) in mind. Considering the similarities between Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 and \u00a7 46b-137 (b), both its official and unofficial commentaries, and that it is the explicit predecessor to Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u00a7 32a-l, we conclude that Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 was drafted in order to implement \u00a7 46b-137 (b). Accordingly, it is appropriate to interpret Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) in accord with \u00a7 46b-137 (b) and the legislative policies that both the rule and the statute were designed to serve.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The legislative history to \u00a7 46b-137 (b) undermines the respondents\u2019 contention that Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) prohibits the drawing of an adverse inference against a parent for his or her failure to testify in a termination proceeding. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 46b-137 was enacted in 1969 by \u00a7 14 of No. 794 of the 1969 Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Juvenile Court.\u201d The proposed bill had been described as a \u201cpotpourri\u201d; 13 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1969 Sess., p. 4980, remarks of Representative James T. Healey; because it embodied several changes in our juvenile law, \u201cespecially with the recognition of <em>[In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 41, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967) (statements inadmissible in delinquency proceedings unless accused child is advised of right to silence and counsel), and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.

Proc., supra, p. 4986, remarks of Representative James F. Bingham. Referring to \u00a7 9 of Substitute House Bill No. 6665, which is now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 46b-134, Representative Healey stated that the bill was necessary in light of <em>In re Gault, </em>which required that juvenile court proceedings for delinquency matters be treated as \u201cquasi-criminal . . . .\u201d 13 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 4983. Representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Healey further noted that \u00a7 12 of the bill, which is now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135, \u201cspells out that, <em>in neglect-uncared for dependent child situation as opposed to delinquency,\u201d </em>a parent must be advised of his or her right to counsel, \u201cbut it is not mandatory that the child itself be informed <em>insofar as these are not quasi-criminal proceedings.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 4984. Next, referring to \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 14 of the bill, which are now codified at subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 46b-137, respectively, Representative Healey stated, \u201c[\u00a7 46b-137 (a)] spells out that a confession is [i]nadmissible <em>in delinquency proceedings </em>unless it is clearly established that the confession has been obtained after a warning as to the rights. This differs from the following section, <em>[\u00a7 46b-137 (b)], which has to do with neglect-uncared for type of proceedings, a truly administrative one rather than a quasi-criminal, in that a confession will not be admissible if made after the petition has been filed, unless the parent or the child or guardian [has] been advised of rights. . . . This is appropriate insofar as we are dealing essentially with a civil action, civil type proceedings, </em>and admission against interest is normally available in civil proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. In addition, Representative James J. Kennelly supported the bill because <em>\u201cchildren . . . </em>are entitled to . . . expect all constitutional safeguards\u201d as would be afforded any other citizen. (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 4985.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Although no mention of an adverse inference was made, these remarks weaken the respondents\u2019 claim. The remarks evince a legislative intent to provide constitutional safeguards to <em>children in delinquency proceedings, </em>not to parents in neglect and uncared-for proceedings. The proponents of the bill made it a point explicitly to label delinquency proceedings, but <em>not </em>neglect and uncared-for proceedings, as \u201cquasi-criminal.\u201d Id., p. 4984, remarks of Representative Healey. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>When describing neglect and uncared-for proceedings, however, such as the underlying proceedings in the present case, the proponents of the bill referred to them as \u201ctruly administrative . . . rather than quasi-criminal,\u201d and characterized them as essentially \u201ccivil type proceedings . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. These comments run contrary to the respondents\u2019 assertion that we ought to resist \u201cthe civil label of convenience\u201d in the present case. Indeed, these comments invite us to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The remarks indicate, moreover, that the central policy goal behind \u00a7 46b-137 (b) was to prohibit the admission of testimonial evidence unless the parent had been advised of certain rights; thus, it applied <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>exclusionary rule to neglect and uncared-for proceedings. C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 1.15.2 (d), pp. 49-50. The legislature\u2019s use of <em>Miranda-type </em>warnings in \u00a7 46b-137 (b) sought to prevent the petitioner from obtaining, and admitting into evidence, a parent\u2019s unwarned statement made after the filing of a petition. The legislature did not, however, intend to equate a parent\u2019s rights with those of a child in a delinquency proceeding or those of a criminal defendant in a criminal proceeding. A fair reading of the legislative history of \u00a7 46b-137, therefore, leads us to conclude that the legislature in 1969 sought to extend constitutional safeguards to children in delinquency proceedings, but not to parents in neglect and uncared-for proceedings. Those proceedings, like the proceedings in this case, are not quasi-criminal, and, therefore, do not warrant the same constitutional protections as do delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Five years after the enactment of \u00a7 46b-137, Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 was adopted to allow courts to implement the various statutes relating to juvenile matters, many of which were enacted along with \u00a7 46b-137.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 applied to all \u201cjuvenile matters,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>included neglect, termination <em>and </em>delinquency proceedings. What is confusing here is that Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 discussed a <em>child\u2019s </em>right to silence in delinquency matters, which was derived from \u00a7 46b-137 (a), contemporaneously with a <em>parent\u2019s </em>right to silence in neglect or termination proceedings, which was derived from \u00a7 46b-137 (b), although the two rights are distinct and do not apply uniformly to every situation. For example, Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (a) provides parents and children with a right to silence in <em>any </em>proceeding. Children, however, do not have the right to silence in neglect proceedings; they have that right only in delinquency proceedings.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This is highlighted by the eventual replacement of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a) with Practice Book \u00a7 32a-l (a), which now provides only parents with a right to silence; delinquency proceedings are not covered by \u00a7 32a-l, but are described elsewhere in the Practice Book. See Practice Book chs. 27, 29, 30, 30a and 31a. This is relevant because Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 confusingly commingled the rights set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 46b-137, when it arguably should have addressed each subsection separately, because, as previously discussed, a parent\u2019s right to silence in neglect proceedings is not equivalent to an accused child\u2019s right to silence in delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In 1979, \u00a7 46b-138a<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> was enacted, and further highlighted the difference between children in delinquency proceedings and parents in termination proceedings. See Public Acts 1979, No. 263. It explicitly provides that an accused child, as well as his parent or guardian, may refuse to testify in a delinquency proceeding, <em>and </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>no adverse inference may be drawn against the <em>accused child. </em>Id. No corresponding statutory provision was created for parents in neglect proceedings as was done in \u00a7 46b-137. Professor Tait has noted, therefore, that this omission suggests that an inference may be drawn from a parent\u2019s silence in delinquency proceedings. C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 5.5.2 (b), p. 304. This is another illustration of the legislature\u2019s intention to single out delinquency proceedings, but not termination proceedings, as quasi-criminal, because the accused child is akin to a criminal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In that regard, allegations in delinquency proceedings, like allegations in criminal proceedings, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., \u00a7 1.15.3 (a), p. 52; id., \u00a7 1.15.4 (c), pp. 54-55. Delinquency proceedings, moreover, resemble criminal trials in many ways, even directing the accused to file motions to dismiss and suppress under the rules of criminal procedure. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 31a-3, 31a-4. Given these similarities, it makes sense to provide children in delinquency proceedings with full constitutional safeguards usually available only to criminal defendants, including the right to be free from adverse inferences. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 46b-138a (prohibiting adverse inferences against accused child in delinquency proceedings) with General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (prohibiting adverse inference against criminal defendant in criminal proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Termination of parental rights proceedings, however, are remedial and \u201cessentially civil\u201d in nature; Practice Book \u00a7 32a-2 (a); and ought to be resolved with the \u201cbest interests of [the] child\u201d in mind. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-112 (p), 45a-706 and 46b-121; see <em>In re Baby Girl </em>B., 224 Conn. 263, 282, 618 A.2d 1 (1992). The legislature, therefore, has chosen not to provide parents with the full gamut of rights afforded to accused children in \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d proceedings. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the legislature did not intend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>to insulate parents from adverse inferences drawn from their failure to testify at termination proceedings. Accordingly, because Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) was designed to implement its statutory counteiparts,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> we conclude that it did not prohibit an adverse inference from being drawn against the respondents in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The respondents argue, nevertheless, that \u00a7 46b-137 (b) should not be used in interpreting the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f). Although the respondents acknowledge that \u00a7 46b-137 (b) is aimed, in part, at advising a parent of his or her \u201cright to refuse to make any statement,\u201d they argue that \u00a7 46b-137 \u201cprovides absolutely no useful guidance in interpreting the rule.\u201d Relying on the official commentary to Practice Book \u00a7 32a-l, which states, among other things, that \u201c[although no statute explicitly provides parents in termination of parental rights cases with the right to remain silent,\u201d the respondents argue \u201cthat the rule and statute provide <em>independent </em>sources of parents\u2019 right to silence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The respondents point out, moreover, that \u201c[presumably the rules committee [in adopting Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f)] believed that . . . \u00a7 46b-137 (b) itself does not create a right to silence <em>in termination cases </em>because the statute applies <em>only </em>in any proceeding held upon a neglect, uncared-for or dependency petition.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Thus, the respondents contend, Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) was meant to <em>extend </em>the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to <em>apply </em>beyond neglect, uncared-for or dependency proceedings, and to termination of parental rights proceedings as well.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">It is clear that \u00a7 46b-137 (b) applies to termination of parental rights proceedings when the petition alleges, as it does in the present case, that the child has been neglected or uncared-for. First, the language of \u00a7 46b-137 (b) indicates that statements made \u201cafter the filing of a petition alleging such child or youth to be neglected, uncared-for or dependent, shall be inadmissible in <em>any proceeding held upon such petition . . </em>. .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Section 17a-112 (j) sets forth the various bases for nonconsensual terminations of parental rights, one of which requires, among other things, that the child has been found to be \u201cneglected or uncared for . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i). Thus, the petition in this case, which alleged that Samantha had been found in a prior proceeding to be neglected or uncared-for pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i),<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> falls within the language of \u00a7 46b-137 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Second, in defining \u201c[j]uvenile matters,\u201d \u00a7 46b-121 (a),<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> which defines the scope of \u00a7 46b-137 (b), provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that \u201c[jjuvenile matters in the civil session include all proceedings concerning . . . termination of parental rights of children committed to a state agency . . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 46b-137 (b) applies to the proceedings in the present case because Samantha was committed to the care of the department when the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In addition, \u00a7 17a-112 (7)<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 35a-3<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> allow for the filing of a coterminous petition, whereby a petition to terminate parental rights may be accompanied by, or consolidated with, a petition to adjudicate a child neglected, uncared-for or dependent filed under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129. Allowing the petitioner to accompany or consolidate the termination petition with a neglect petition contemplates that the same rules governing the admissibility of testimonial evidence naturally would apply to both proceedings. One commentator has stated, in that regard, that \u201c[t]he rules of evidence as applied in termination cases are generally identical to those in neglect cases.\u201d P. Chill, supra, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>142. These evidentiary similarities provide further support to the conclusion that \u00a7 46b-137 (b) applies to termination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Finally, it is appropriate to read the statute broadly, given that termination proceedings are at least as deserving to receive additional evidentiary safeguards as are neglect, uncared-for or dependency proceedings. Considering that the respondents have failed to cite any authority that states that a parent in a termination proceeding may remain silent under the rule, but not under the statute, we see no reason why \u00a7 46b-137 (b) should not inform our interpretation of Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The respondents also argue that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cmissing witness\u201d rule was improper because the parents in this case were not \u201cavailable\u201d to testify as required by \u00a7 52-216c and <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 739. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Although it is true that a witness who is likely to assert a testimonial privilege, such as the fifth amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, is technically \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify in a strict evidentiary sense; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>258 Conn. 79, 91-94, 779 A.2d 112 (2001) (missing witness instruction not permissible because witness likely would have invoked privilege against self-incrimination); Fed. R. Evid. 804 (a) (1); that reasoning does not apply when the \u201cmissing witness\u201d is also a party to the case. The liberal definition of the word \u201cunavailable\u201d that is employed with regard to the \u201cmissing witness\u201d rule stems from the commonsense notion that, when a party is unable to call a witness through no fault of his own, an adverse inference is not warranted. That is exactly the reason why \u00a7 52-216c requires counsel in civil cases to make a threshold showing of unavailability before that point may be argued to the jury; <em>Raybeck </em>v. <em>Danbury Orthopedic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Associates, P.C., </em>72 Conn. App. 359, 370, 805 A.2d 130 (2002); and why <em>Malave </em>requires counsel in criminal cases to notify the court and opposing counsel in advance of closing arguments of the intention to comment on a witness\u2019 absence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 740. Such a notice requirement allows the party against whom the inference is sought to prepare for and to rebut opposing counsel's comments, while also ensuring that the inference is warranted because the missing witness is, in fact, unavailable. When the party against whom the inference is drawn, however, is also the \u201cmissing witness,\u201d those concerns evaporate because the witness\u2019 availability is dependent on his or her choice not to testify. That is the situation in the present case; the respondents could have testified, but they chose not to. Their availability was dependent on their decision not to testify, rather than on the decision of a third party witness over whom they had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The present case, moreover, involves neither an instruction nor comments to a jury; rather, it involves a trier of fact drawing the inference on its own accord. Thus, because there is no issue regarding the unavailability of the respondents, and there is no claim that counsel commented inappropriately, any limitations or concerns related to the <em>Secondino </em>rule are not implicated in this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We realize, of course, that the \u201cmissing witness\u201d rule provides a less than perfect analogue for the present case because it was intended to address the drawing of an adverse inference against a party for its failure to call an available witness, rather than for a party\u2019s assertion of a privilege not to testify. The rule, nonetheless, is persuasive inasmuch as it reveals a legislative and judicial intent to adhere to the commonsense approach that a party\u2019s failure to rebut evidence that the party naturally would be able to refute, through testimony or physical evidence, may warrant an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>ence that such evidence either does not exist or would be unfavorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The remainder of the respondents\u2019 arguments are premised on the notion that our interpretation of Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) should be guided by United States Supreme Court precedent interpreting the fifth amendment. Specifically, they contend that, because the language in Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f), providing that \u201c[n]o parent . . . shall be compelled to testily if the testimony might tend ... to establish the validity of the facts alleged in the petition,\u201d mirrored that of the privilege against self-incrimination contained in the fifth amendment to the United States constitution, the two provisions ought to be interpreted the same way. Thus, the respondents contend, because the fifth amendment forbids an adverse inference to be drawn against a criminal defendant for electing not to testify at trial, \u00a7 34-1 (f) similarly forbade an adverse inference to be drawn against the respondents in the present case. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The respondents\u2019 argument relies on a fusion of United States Supreme Court cases that have defined compulsion in the fifth amendment context, with cases that have discussed termination of parental rights. In the fifth amendment context, the respondents rely primarily on <em>McKune </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 44, 122 S. Ct. 2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2002), which held that, even in noncriminal proceedings, courts must look to the severity of the potential consequences that may follow from a party\u2019s refusal to testify in determining whether there has been compulsion to testify in the fifth amendment sense. Building upon that notion, the respondents rely <em>on M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 119-21, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996), which, in their view, \u201cequated the loss of parental rights with the loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>liberty that results from a criminal conviction.\u201d Thus, the respondents contend, a synthesis of <em>McKune </em>and <em>M.L.B. </em>reveals that termination of parental rights must be viewed as a consequence severe enough to constitute compulsion within the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f). A discussion of the cases upon which the respondents rely is necessary to resolve this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The United States Supreme Court repeatedly has stated, and we have agreed, that termination of parental rights implicates a parent\u2019s fundamental interest, which \u201cundeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 519 U.S. 118; <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 279. Termination of parental rights decrees, moreover, \u201c[w]ork a unique kind of deprivation,\u201d and \u201care among the most severe forms of state action . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 127-28. In <em>M.L.B., </em>the court held unconstitutional a Mississippi statutory scheme that conditioned a party\u2019s right to appeal from any civil judgment, including those terminating parental rights, on the prepayment of costly record preparation fees. Id., 123-24. The petitioner in <em>M.L.B. </em>sought to appeal from a judgment terminating her parental rights, but was unable to pay the required fee, and was denied the ability to proceed in forma pauperis. Id., 109. Relying on equal protection and due process grounds, the court held that, once a state provides a parent with the right to appeal from a termination decree, it cannot constitutionally cut off access to appellate review because of a parent\u2019s inability to pay for required filing costs. Id., 123-24. Before <em>M.L.B., </em>such a rule existed only for indigents in criminal cases; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 18-19, 76 S. Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891 (1956) (rule that conditioned appeals from criminal convictions on procurement of trial transcript held unconstitutional); and \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d matters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>404 U.S. 189, 196-97, 92 S. Ct. 410, 30 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1971) (extending <em>Griffin </em>rule to nonfelony charges carrying only maximum fine of $500 with no exposure to incarceration).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Although the court in <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 519 U.S. 124, analogized termination decrees with criminal and \u201c \u2018quasicriminaT \u201d matters for purposes of access to appellate rights, it did not label termination matters as \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d or noncivil; rather, the court, as it had done consistently in the past, reaffirmed that termination decrees belong in a special category \u201capart from mine run civil actions . . . .\u201d Id., 127. Indeed, termination decrees already required a heightened \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 769-70, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982); and the court previously had recognized that counsel, although not required in every case, may be required in some instances. <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 117; <em>see Lassiter </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 31-33, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981) (due process requires, in certain circumstances, that counsel be appointed to parents in termination proceedings). The court noted, moreover, that it would be \u201canomalous\u201d to recognize the right to a free transcript in an appeal from a misdemeanor conviction under <em>Mayer, </em>where counsel is not constitutionally required, but deny the same right in termination appeals, even though, under <em>Lassiter, </em>counsel may be required if the situation warrants it. <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 123. Thus, <em>M.L.B. </em>reaffirmed the special status that was <em>already </em>given to termination proceedings, and simply added termination decrees to \u201cthe categoiy of cases in which the State may not bolt the door to equal justice . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 124. It did not, as the respondents suggest, mandate that termination decrees be viewed as criminal or quasi-criminal matters for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>With regard to the concept of compulsion under the fifth amendment, <em>McKune </em>involved a Kansas rehabilitation program for convicted sex offenders, which required that participating inmates sign an \u201cAdmission of Responsibility\u201d form, and also disclose any uncharged sexual offenses.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>McKune </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>supra, 536 U.S. 29-30. Refusal to participate in the treatment program, however, resulted in a reduced \u201cprivilege status,\u201d which meant that nonparticipating inmates were transferred to a maximum security unit with less desirable living conditions. Id., 30-31. Kansas, moreover, did not offer inmates immunity for waiving their privilege against self-incrimination. Id., 34. Thus, sex offenders under this scheme were faced with a choice of whether to acknowledge guilt and risk another criminal conviction, or to remain silent and subject themselves to inferior prison conditions usually reserved for more dangerous offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The court held that Kansas\u2019 scheme did not violate the fifth amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination because, \u201c[although a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The court concluded that, in light of the state\u2019s important interest in administering its prison system, the consequence at issue in <em>McKune, </em>namely, a reduced privilege status for the respondent, was not severe enough to \u201camount to unconstitutional compulsion.\u201d Id., 43; see, e.g., <em>Ohio Adult Parole Authority </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. 272, 286-88, 118 S.

Ed. 2d 562 (1967) (police officers\u2019 statements were \u201ccompelled\u201d and, therefore, inadmissible against them because officers would have been terminated had they remained silent). These cases, also known as the \u201c \u2018penalty cases\u2019 \u201d; <em>McKune </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>supra, 536 U.S. 50 (O\u2019Con-nor, J., concurring); stand for the proposition that certain significant losses, even those financially oriented and noncriminal in nature, may nonetheless be severe enough to \u201ccompel\u201d one to speak within the meaning of the fifth amendment. Put another way, these cases stand for the proposition that certain severe penalties may not be imposed as the cost of asserting one\u2019s constitutional fifth amendment privilege to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Termination of parental rights decrees, however, do not fit neatly into either category of cases discussed in <em>McKune. </em>To be sure, the cases relied upon by the majority in <em>McKune </em>each involved additional punishments against petitioners who already had been convicted of a crime. The so-called \u201cpenalty cases,\u201d moreover, which found unconstitutional compulsion, are not dispositive because, although \u201c[f]ew consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties\u201d; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 787 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); termination of parental rights proceedings are not designed to <em>punish </em>parents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>but to <em>protect </em>children. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 352, 488 A.2d 790 (1985); <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 244, 258-59, 754 A.2d 169 (2000). Nonetheless, it goes without saying that the \u201cpenalty\u201d that necessarily comes with a termination decree is arguably as severe as the penalties at issue in the \u201cpenalty cases,\u201d for instance, the loss of one\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The interest in remaining the parent of one\u2019s children, moreover, is presumably as fundamental as the financial interest one has in his or her employment. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent, therefore, the respondents arguably might have had a right to be free from adverse inferences had they asserted their right not to testify <em>under the fifth amendment. </em>They, however, did not do so. See, e.g., <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 465 U.S. 427 (fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination must be affirmatively asserted); <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>199 Conn. 121, 129, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The respondents\u2019 claim, therefore, does not appropriately rest on the fifth amendment; instead, it rests on a rule of practice derived from our state\u2019s already prophylactic body of juvenile law. For instance, although it is not constitutionally required that counsel be appointed to indigent parents in termination proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ings; <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 452 U.S. 32; our law requires it. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-717 (b),<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> 46b-135 (b)<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and 46b-137 (b). By the same token, although termination proceedings repeatedly have been labeled civil in nature;<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121; Practice Book \u00a7 32a-2; <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 282; and ordinarily an adverse party may be called as a witness in any civil proceeding, our law provides parents with the right not to testify. We cannot conclude, however, that a parent\u2019s right not to testify, which exists only by virtue of a rule or statute, and is not constitutionally required, would, simply because of that enactment, also carry with it a protection that is generally reserved for the fifth amendment. The fact remains that the respondents in the present case asserted a nonconstitutional privilege, in a proceeding that is \u201cessentially civil,\u201d and is neither criminal nor quasicriminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Outside of the use of the word \u201ccompelled\u201d in Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f), which also is used in the fifth amendment, the respondents have not presented any arguments that lead us to believe that the rule also contemplated an implicit prohibition against adverse inferences. Put another way, considering the legislative history surrounding the relevant statutes regarding juvenile matters, the rule\u2019s use of the word \u201ccompelled\u201d does not, by itself, lead us to conclude that \u00a7 34-1 (f) was designed to prohibit adverse inferences in termination proceedings. Accordingly, despite the rule\u2019s structural similarity to the privilege against self-incrimination, we see no persuasive reason to depart from the general rule that adverse inferences are ordinarily permissible in noncriminal proceedings such as those in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Finally, the respondents argue that Practice Book \u00a7 34-1 (f) was meaningless if it allowed an adverse inference to be drawn against a parent at a termination proceeding. We disagree. Although the rule would have provided a parent with greater protections if it also barred adverse inferences, the rule nonetheless provided a parent with a privilege that is ordinarily not available in civil proceedings, namely, the right not to be called as a witness. This rule forced the petitioner to prove the allegations in the petition in ways other than through the parent\u2019s testimony. There is no doubt that a parent, faced with the choice of testifying or suffering an adverse inference, may feel compelled to testify in some sense of the word; but he or she still has a choice, albeit a difficult one, whether to testify in rebuttal to the allegations made by the petitioner, or to remain silent and require the petitioner to prove the allegation by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">As we previously have noted, an adverse inference cannot supply proof of a material fact; it merely allows the fact finder to weigh facts already in evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Although it is trae that the respondents faced a difficult choice in the present case, namely, choosing whether to expose themselves to cross-examination or risking that an adverse inference might tip the scales in the petitioner\u2019s favor, that choice was preferable to no choice at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">PRIOR NOTICE OF ADVERSE INFERENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">We now turn to the respondents\u2019 final claim, namely, that, even if an adverse inference may permissibly have been drawn against them in the present case, the trial court was required to have given prior notice of its intent to do so. We agree, and conclude that the language of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a), which stated that the judicial authority must \u201cadvise and explain\u201d to the parents their right to silence at the commencement of any proceeding, coupled with the trial court\u2019s repeated affirmation of that right throughout the various proceedings underlying this appeal, would have led a reasonable person to believe that such a right was, in fact, unqualified. Consequently, the respondents were entitled to be notified by the court of the prospect that an adverse inference might be drawn from their silence. Put another way, if a trial court is inclined to draw an adverse inference against a parent for his or her failure to testify in a termination proceeding, it is incumbent upon the court to advise the parent accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">We begin with the language of Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a), which provided: \u201cThe judicial authority shall <em>advise and explain </em>to the parents, child or youth their right to silence and to counsel prior to commencement of any proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this context, \u201cadvise\u201d means \u201cto . . . counsel . . . caution, [or] warn,\u201d as in to \u201cadvise of the consequences,\u201d and \u201cexplain\u201d means \u201cto make plain or understandable,\u201d as in to make \u201cintelligible what is not immediately obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>or entirely known . . . .\u201d Memam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Thus, \u00a7 34-1 (a) strongly suggests that is it incumbent upon the trial court, not only to state expressly that parents have a right to silence, but also to explain, to some extent, the parameters of that right. The question then becomes precisely how much explanation was required in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In part III D of this opinion, we concluded that a parent\u2019s right to silence, as it was discussed in chapter 34 of the Practice Book, was derived from \u00a7 46b-137 (b), which provides that a parent\u2019s statement is not admissible \u201cunless such person shall have been advised of his . . . right to refuse to make any statement and that any statements he makes may be introduced in evidence against him.\u201d We stated, moreover, that \u00a7 46b-137 (b) applied <em>Miranda's </em>exclusionary rule to juvenile proceedings. See part III D of this opinion; C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 1.15.2 (b), pp. 49-50. In this regard, parents in termination of parental rights proceedings are given similar procedural protections as are criminal defendants; both groups must be warned of their right to silence as a matter of course. For this reason, we find <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, 426 </em>U.S. 610, 617-18, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976) (impeachment of defendant\u2019s testimony through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process), to be an apt starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the prosecution attempted to impeach the defendants\u2019 exculpatory testimony at trial, asking why the defendants had not given such an explanation to the police immediately after they were arrested. Id., 613-14. The United States Supreme Court held that the use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence for impeachment purposes violates due process because, after advising a defendant that he has a right to remain silent and to appointed counsel, \u201c[sjilence in the wake of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d Id., 617. The court based its holding on two considerations. First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d and consequently of little probative value; id.; second, and especially relevant here, it observed that, \u201cwhile it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d Id., 618; see also <em>Wainwright </em>v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284, 291-92, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986) <em>(\u201cMiranda </em>warnings inform a person of his right to remain silent and assure him, at least implicitly, that his silence will not be used against him. . . . The point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity. In both situations, the State gives warnings to protect constitutional rights and implicitly promises that any exercise of those rights will not be penalized.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 467, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988) (custody not prerequisite to <em>Doyle </em>violation where <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989). The United States Supreme Court, therefore, interpreted the <em>Miranda </em>warnings so as to caution a criminal defendant, expressly, that anything said could be used against him, but implicitly that, should he remain silent, his silence would not be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>The present case implicates much of the same concerns highlighted in <em>Doyle. </em>First, the respondents were given notice of their right to silence at least seven times throughout the various proceedings underlying this appeal. They never were advised by the trial court, however, that such a right was qualified in any way. For instance, at the plea hearing that preceded the termination proceeding, the trial court stated: \u201c[Y]ou have a right to silence. It is your right not to talk about the situation, even if it won\u2019t get you into any trouble.\u201d Such an advisement, like the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, implied that silence would carry no penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In addition, just as in <em>Doyle, </em>the respondents\u2019 failure to testily was not necessarily reflective of their inability to rebut the petitioner\u2019s allegations regarding their tumultuous relationship; rather, it simply may have represented their assertion of the privilege. Such an interpretation is especially plausible in the present case. Indeed, after the petitioner had presented all but one of the department\u2019s witnesses, the trial court expressed doubt as to whether the petitioner had presented evidence that would tend to show a failure to achieve rehabilitation. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Furthermore, the petitioner\u2019s final witness, Meier, did not add any firsthand knowledge as to whether the respondents were continuing their tumultuous relationship; rather, his testimony involved mainly hypothetical situations and was based on reports prepared by others.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ering that Meier\u2019s testimony did not substantiate the petitioner\u2019s allegations regarding the respondents tumultuous relationship, it is not implausible to conclude that the respondents may have elected to remain silent, not because they were unable to rebut the petitioner\u2019s allegations, but because they did not think that the petitioner had proven the allegations by clear and convincing evidence. Thus, just as the defendants\u2019 silence was \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 617, so too was the respondents\u2019 election not to testify in the present case. Had the respondents been warned of the prospect that an adverse inference might be drawn, however, these concerns would evaporate because their election not to testify necessarily would have taken that consideration into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We are aware, as the petitioner suggests, that <em>Doyle </em>provides a less than perfect analogue for the present case because that case involved a defendant\u2019s <em>postarrest silence, </em>rather than an election not to testify at trial. In this regard, the respondents\u2019 silence did not occur \u201cin the wake\u201d of being told that they could remain silent, as it had in <em>Doyle. </em>Id. To the contrary, the respondents elected not to testify upon consulting with counsel, and after the petitioner had rested the case. Nonetheless, although <em>Doyle </em>was concerned with post-<em>Miranda </em>yet pretrial silence, the fact remains that the respondents were repeatedly given the functional equivalent of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The only difference, therefore, between the present case and <em>Doyle </em>is temporal, that is, the point at which the silence was induced. That distinction, however, does not negate the implicit assurance that the warnings carried, nor does it render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the reasoning of <em>Doyle </em>any less applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In addition we are mindful that, unlike in <em>Doyle, the petitioner </em>in the present case neither induced silence, nor attempted to use that silence at trial; rather, the trial court drew the inference on its own accord. Indeed, the Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently explained <em>Doyle </em>as a case where <em>the government </em>had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Portuondo </em>v. <em>Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 74, 120 S. Ct. 1119, 146 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2000). Nonetheless, irrespective of whether the admonition comes from a court or through law enforcement personnel, the impact to the respondents remained the same; they were told several times of their right to silence, which carried an implicit assurance that silence would carry no penalty. See, e.g., <em>Leecan </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>893 F.2d 1434, 1440 (2d Cir. 1990) (\u201c[t]he admonition [the petitioner] concededly received from the judge at arraignment in open court, addressing a group of arrestees, is not materially distinguishable for <em>Doyle </em>purposes from a warning delivered by police prior to a custodial interrogation\u201d). In this regard, there is no reason to believe that an admonition provided by a court is less reliable than warnings administered by law enforcement personnel. Finally, not only were the respondents given notice of their right to silence <em>by the court </em>several times, Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) expressly stated they may not be compelled to testify. The language contained in our rules of practice, coupled with the trial court\u2019s unconditional admonitions, would have led a reasonable person to assume that the right to silence would carry no penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We also note that our conclusion that the trial court was required to have given the respondents prior notice of its intent to draw an adverse inference is not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>on due process grounds,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> as was the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 618; rather, our conclusion represents what we perceive to be the most plausible reading of the procedures required in order to administer effectively chapter 34 of the Practice Book. As previously discussed in part III F of this opinion, our statutes pertaining to juvenile matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>already provide parents with greater protections than are constitutionally required. Bearing in mind that these rules of practice are designed to implement the statutes from which they were derived, chapter 34 of the Practice Book merely helped to delineate, as a matter of procedure, our prophylactic body of juvenile law. As previously discussed in part III A of this opinion, the trier of fact ordinarily may draw an adverse inference when a witness invokes a nonconstitutional privilege, and a party to a noncriminal proceeding ordinarily may be called as a witness; yet, although termination of parental rights proceedings are noncriminal in nature, parents in termination proceedings, like criminal defendants, cannot be called as witnesses. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (b) and Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f) with General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (a). This evinces an intent to provide parents with additional procedural safeguards in termination proceedings, although not quite to the same level as juveniles in delinquency proceedings. Moreover, an adverse inference cannot be drawn against a criminal defendant for an election not to testify; General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b); and, so far as we know, no trial court had, at the time of the proceedings underlying this appeal, expressly drawn an adverse inference against a parent in a termination proceeding. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the respondents to be taken aback by the trial court\u2019s decision to draw an adverse inference, nor can it be said that chapter 34 of the Practice Book clearly articulated to the parties the proper procedures to be employed in this area. Nevertheless, a central purpose behind chapter 34, especially Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (a), was to enable parents in termination proceedings to make informed choices in structuring their defense. With those principles in mind, we conclude that requiring the court to notify parents in the event that it may be inclined to draw an adverse inference is the most plausible procedural solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Moreover, we see no persuasive reasons against requiring a court, should it be inclined to draw an adverse inference, to notify a parent accordingly. First, because such notice will be required only if a court is inclined to draw such an inference, it will not unduly burden the court with excessive procedure. Second, considering that parental rights are \u201cfar more precious than any property right\u201d; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 758-59; an additional layer of prophylaxis is not inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Nonetheless, the petitioner argues that requiring notice in the present case is unnecessary because, even in criminal cases, a court has no duty to canvass a criminal defendant, beyond what the rules of practice require, regarding an election not to testify; rather, \u201cthe if and when of whether the accused will testify is primarily a matter of trial strategy to be decided between the defendant and his attorney.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 482, 625 A. 2d 791 (1993). This argument is without merit. Although choosing whether to testify is properly regarded as trial strategy, that is not the reason why notice of an adverse inference is not required in criminal proceedings. Criminal defendants are not warned about adverse inferences because the trier of fact may not draw such inferences. General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b); <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>supra, 450 U.S. 305. It suffices to say that notice is not required for a possibility that cannot occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Finally, the petitioner claims that, even if an adverse inference had been improperly drawn in the present case, any impropriety was harmless. Specifically, the petitioner contends that the inference drawn by the trial court was merely cumulative of the evidence that the petitioner already had presented and, therefore, did not influence the court\u2019s ultimate decision. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Although the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision that it found certain facts by clear and convincing evidence <em>before </em>it stated that it was drawing an adverse inference, the fact remains that the court\u2019s judgment rested, at least in part, on the adverse inference. We cannot say, with any certainty, whether the trial court would have ruled the way that it did in the absence of such an inference, nor can we conclude that it would have found the same facts by clear and convincing evidence. Indeed, the trial court concluded its analysis by stating: \u201cWeighing the evidence in light of the failure of the respondents to testify to the contrary, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondents have failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering Samantha\u2019s age and her needs, that they could assume a responsible position in her life.\u201d Lastly, the trial court devoted thirteen pages of its memorandum of decision to a discussion regarding the propriety of an adverse inference. It is unrealistic to assume that the court would have gone to such effort if it would have reached the same conclusion without the adverse inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-14\"> Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f), which was in effect at the time of the proceedings in the present case, provided: \u201cAny child shall have the right to remain silent at any stage of the proceedings.

No party may waive counsel unless the court has first explained the nature and meaning of a petition for the termination of parental rights. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135 (b) provides: \u201cAt the commencement of any proceeding on behalf of a neglected, uncared-for or dependent child or youth, the parent or parents or guardian of the child or youth shall have the right to counsel, and shall be so informed by the judge, and that if they are unable to afford counsel, counsel will be provided for them, and such counsel and such parent or guardian of the child or youth shall have the rights of confrontation and cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-2 (a), now \u00a7 32a-2 (a), which immediately followed Practice Book, 2001, \u00a7 34-1 (f), provided that \u201c[a]ll [termination of parental rights] hearings are <em>essentially civil proceedings except where otherwise provided by statute. </em>Testimony may be given in narrative form and the proceedings shall at all times be as informal as the requirements of due process and fairness permit.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, even the Practice Book, the very authority on which the respondents rely, explicitly has labeled termination of parental rights cases \u201cessentially civil\u201d in nature. See also C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 1.15.1, pp. 46-47. The respondents, moreover, have not cited to, nor have we been able to trace, a single statutory exception to this general rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\"> For instance, Meier testified: \u201cIf the treatment goal is a stable family for this child, I would say there\u2019s been a failure to rehabilitate because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s occurred. If rehabilitation is defined as no further physical violence, then I would have to say rehabilitation has occurred. From a psychological standpoint, I can\u2019t give a yes or no answer to that unfortunately. I wish I could. But my concern is if there\u2019s evidence\u2014and I don\u2019t have all the recent evidence. I didn\u2019t see the conflict myself. I\u2019m referring mostly to documents.\u201d Meier further stated: \u201cAs the hypothetical indicated, if that\u2019s trae that people are hiding in closets because they are afraid or if they\u2019re running out of the house or leaving because they\u2019re afraid, yeah. I think that\u2019s dysfunctional enough that it would have a negative impact on the child. ... So it leads me to question whether, in fact, there is this type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>of stability in the home or whether, in fact, the intensity of these, the violence and the conflict is at the point where it would be harmful to the child. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not there. So I don\u2019t know that and I can just base that on the suggestions from what other people have observed. . . . Well, the instability. It\u2019s not clear and this is what I don\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t observe it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\"> We note further that the respondents\u2019 claim that due process precludes an adverse inference is unavailing. The respondents\u2019 due process argument pales in comparison with those cases in which we have interpreted the principle of fair warning. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 231, 796 A.2d 502 (2002) (defendant had fair warning that conduct was proscribed because our construction of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 [a] was neither unexpected nor indefensible); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>260 Conn. 93, 106, 794 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 902, 123 S. Ct. 224, 154 L. Ed. 2d 175 (2002) (defendant had fair warning because criminal liability under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 [a] [3] was neither unexpected nor indefensible by reference to existing common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\u201cWhen determining what procedures are constitutionally required, we must bear in mind that [t]he essence of due process is the requirement that a person in jeopardy of a serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and [an] opportunity to meet it. . . . So long as the procedure afforded adequately protects the individual interests at stake, there is no reason to impose substantially greater burdens on the state under the guise of due process.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>235 Conn. 487, 493, 668 A.2d 360 (1995). In a situation analogous to the present case, in which a criminal defendant challenged his conviction on due process grounds because he did not receive fair warning that his conduct was unlawful, the United States Supreme Court has stated that the principle of fair warning is violated only where a result \u201cis unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>532 U.S. 451, 462, 121 S. Ct. 1693, 149 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 106. In addition, we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 105, that a \u201cstatute is not unconstitutional merely because a person must inquire further as to the precise reach of its prohibitions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) As previously discussed in part HI A of this opinion, the general rule is that the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference against a party in a noncriminal proceeding. Although the drawing of an adverse inference in a termination proceeding may have been unusual in a statistical sense, such an infrequency does not mean that the proceeding was so unfair as to amount to a violation of due process. Indeed, were we to hold otherwise, anytime the meaning of a rule is unclear, as it sometimes is, and a party claims to have been taken by surprise, a due process violation would occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
