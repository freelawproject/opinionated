We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the fall of 1996, the victim, Audrey Lover, resided at 201 West West Hill Road in Barkhamsted. Her daughter, Jennifer Cosseboom, was a college student living on campus at Central Connecticut State University (university) in New Britain. Cosseboom socialized with a group of teenagers and young adults, including the defendant and Michael Glanville, many of whom frequently gathered at the home of Lynn Ducharme,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a drug-addicted woman who lived in Winsted.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On the evening of October 16,1996, the victim visited her close friend and neighbor, Pamela Balsamo, until approximately 9 p.m. While the victim was there, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>defendant telephoned Balsamo\u2019s house looking for Cosseboom\u2019s telephone number. That same night, the university\u2019s police dispatch records logged an attempt by a person who identified himself as Tony Robledo, one of several aliases used by the defendant, to contact Cosseboom. Additionally, Ducharme\u2019s telephone records show that, in the evening hours on October 16, two telephone calls were made to the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Later that same evening, several youths, including the defendant, Glanville and John Rizzi, gathered at Ducharme\u2019s house for a party. At one point in the evening, Ducharme emerged from her bedroom yelling for everyone to keep the noise down. She argued with Glanville, in particular, concerning long-distance calls that he had made with her telephone, and then she returned to her bedroom. Soon thereafter, the defendant, Glanville and Rizzi departed in Rizzi\u2019s car, with Rizzi driving. According to Rizzi, he drove Glanville and the defendant to a house in Barkhamsted that, in Rizzi\u2019s description, was consistent in appearance and location to Balsamo\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Shortly before 7 a.m. the following morning, October 17, 1996, Theresa Blanchard and her son were passing by the victim\u2019s house when they noticed that it was on fire. They alerted the victim\u2019s neighbors, who called 911, and fire and rescue personnel arrived on the scene soon thereafter. Firefighters found that both the front and back doors to the victim\u2019s home were closed and unlocked. Once inside, they discovered the victim\u2019s naked body lying on the floor in the lower level of the house. A small fire was burning on the victim\u2019s body, which had been badly burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">An investigation revealed that the fire had been set deliberately. Flammable liquid and other combustible material had been poured onto the victim\u2019s body, which then had been ignited. Additionally, an oil lamp was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>found in several pieces on the lower level of the house; the wick assembly of the lamp was found between the victim\u2019s legs, and the base and chimney of the lamp were on top of a television. Subsequent forensic tests revealed that samples of carpeting and charred wood removed from the victim\u2019s house contained a liquid substance that was consistent with the oil from the oil lamp. On the basis of the results of an autopsy performed on the victim by Harold Wayne Carver, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner, he determined that the victim\u2019s cause of death was manual strangulation. Although Carver could not pinpoint the time of death, he determined that the victim had eaten not many hours before her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Some time in the late fall of 1996, several people overheard conversations of the defendant in which he made incriminating statements. Anaira Rodriguez, who was involved romantically with the defendant at the time, overheard him state that \u201che [had] killed a woman\u201d and had \u201cfucked her up because she got stupid.\u201d She also heard him make some mention of a fire. Leonard St. Denis, another friend of the defendant, related how the defendant had told him that he and Glanville had broken into the victim\u2019s home, that the defendant had choked the victim to death because he believed she could identify him and that the defendant and Glanville had started a fire \u201cto get rid of the evidence\u201d using, as an accelerant, an oil lamp located on the premises. St. Denis\u2019 description of the event, as told to him by the defendant, was consistent with the physical evidence found by the police. On another occasion, while watching a television news report about the victim\u2019s homicide, the defendant told St. Denis that \u201cthat\u2019s the woman I did.\u201d Finally, in June, 1997, in a conversation with Joan Longo, the defendant threatened that if he did not get money owed to him by a third person, he would \u201cjack that bitch like he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Audrey,\u201d and he engaged in a strangulation gesture. The medical examiner\u2019s findings of injuries to the victim\u2019s neck were consistent with strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Glanville also made incriminating statements. In March, 1997, he drove his nephew, Julio Caraballo, to a lake in Barkhamsted and confided in him that he and the defendant had broken into a woman\u2019s house looking for items to steal. Glanville stated that when he and the defendant were discovered by the woman, the defendant choked her and used an oil lamp to bum the house in an attempt to destroy any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant was arrested in May, 1998, pursuant to a fugitive warrant in an unrelated case, and subsequently was charged in connection with the offenses in the present case in August, 1998. After learning that Glanville had given the police a statement, the defendant gave a statement implicating Glanville. According to the defendant, Glanville had told him that he had broken the victim\u2019s neck and then burned the house in an attempt to destroy the evidence. The defendant explained that Glanville believed that Cosseboom, the victim\u2019s daughter, would collect $2 million in insurance proceeds and that Glanville would benefit because Cosseboom would be \u201chooking [him] up.\u201d The defendant, however, refused to swear to his statement, stating: \u201cI can\u2019t pay back with a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all the counts. Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of fifty-four years imprisonment. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly allowed Caraballo to testify concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ing Glanville\u2019s statement to him, and thus violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under the sixth amendment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the United States constitution, and his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In response, the state contends that the trial court properly admitted Glanville\u2019s statement under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest, and that the admission of that statement did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. After the defendant\u2019s trial had begun, Glanville\u2019s nephew, Caraballo, was arrested on a charge unrelated to the present case. While he was in custody, he told state police about the statement that Glanville had made to him at the lake in March, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">When he was first called to testify in the defendant\u2019s case, Caraballo answered some background questions but then expressed reluctance about testifying further. He ultimately refused to answer any further questions. The court, at the urging of the state, then held Caraballo in contempt. Before sending him to prison, the court afforded Caraballo the opportunity to confer with coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>sel. After speaking with his attorney, Caraballo returned to the courtroom and testified as to the nature of his conversation with Glanville in March, 1997. Caraballo testified that Glanville had told him: \u201c \u2018We broke into some lady\u2019s house . . . fucked up, shit happened.\u2019 \u201d According to Caraballo, Glanville explained that he and the defendant had broken into the victim\u2019s house in search of jewelry, and that Glanville had remained in the kitchen as a lookout as the defendant went through the house. The victim came into the kitchen, and noticed Glanville, who covered his face. The defendant then emerged from a bedroom and entered the kitchen where he started choking the victim, who fell to the floor. At that point, the defendant picked up a lamp and Glanville ran out of the house. After recounting this incident to Caraballo, Glanville admonished him: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Caraballo testified that the police had told him that his statement at the police station would \u201chelp\u201d his uncle. On cross-examination, the defendant explored the circumstances under which Caraballo had given the statement to the police, asking Caraballo about his conversation with John Pudlinski, a police inspector with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, division of criminal justice,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> who was aiding in the investigation. The following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and Caraballo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201cQ. And [Pudlinski] told you that if you told him the information that he wanted to hear, it would help your uncle, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">\u201cQ. And the information that you want\u2014that he wanted to hear, was that [the defendant] and your uncle were in that house, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Finally, Caraballo testified that nobody had forced or threatened him to make his statement to the police, nor had anyone promised him anything in exchange for his testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted Glanville\u2019s statement to Caraballo as a declaration against penal interest, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999). Specifically, the court determined that Glanville was unavailable to testify, by virtue of his having invoked the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and thereafter concluded that there were \u201cclearly corroborated circumstances that indicate the trustworthiness of this statement.\u201d The court stated: \u201cThis statement was made to [Glanville\u2019s nephew] in a milieu of trust. It was made within five months, I believe, of the incident. The declarant admitted to and incriminated himself to at least the crime of felony murder. If there\u2019s any minimizing here, it\u2019s one type of murder versus another type of murder. He incriminated himself in this matter, and I think that\u2019s what [Schiappa] seems to say. And so I\u2019m going to find that [Glanville is] unavailable, that there\u2019s corroboration, [and] that the circumstances under which the statement was made were trustworthy, particularly in view of the blood relationship between the declarant [Glanville] and the third party [Caraballo].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The law regarding out-of-court statements admitted for the truth therein is well settled. \u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay. ... As a general rule, such hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 633, 835 A.2d 895 (2003). Section 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence carves out an exception to the hearsay rule for an out-of-court statement made by an unavailable declarant if the statement was \u201ctrustworthy\u201d and, \u201cat the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true.\u201d Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 148-49 (construing rule 804 [b] [3] of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the federal analog to \u00a7 8-6 [4] of the Connecticut Code of Evidence). \u201cIn determining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the court shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person to whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-6 (4). In the present case, the state offered Glanville\u2019s statement to Caraballo as a dual inculpatory statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We evaluate such a statement using the same criteria. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 153. As with any statement against penal interest, \u201cthe trial court must carefully weigh all of the relevant factors in determining whether the statement bears sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its admission.\u201d Id., 154. As we previously have stated, when viewing this issue through an evidentiary lens, we examine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion. Id., 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u201cBeyond these general evidentiary principles, the state\u2019s use of hearsay evidence against an accused in a criminal trial is limited by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. In defining the specific limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of the confrontation clause, the United States Supreme Court consistently has held that the confrontation clause does not erect a per se bar to the admission of hearsay statements against criminal defendants. E.g., <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990); see also id., 814 ([w]hile a literal interpretation of the Confrontation Clause could bar the use of any out-of-court statements when the declarant is unavailable, [the] Court has rejected that view as unintended and too extreme . . .). At the same time, [although . . . hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values, [the court has] also been careful not to equate the Confrontation Clause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. . . . The Confrontation Clause, in other words, bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. . . . [Id.]\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 633-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Traditionally, for purposes of the confrontation clause, all hearsay statements were admissible if (1) the declarant was unavailable to testify, and (2) the statement bore \u201cadequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). After we heard oral argument in the present case, however, the United States Supreme Court overruled <em>Roberts </em>to the extent that it applied to \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay statements. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). In <em>Crawford, </em>the court concluded that the \u201creliability\u201d standard set forth in the second prong of the <em>Roberts </em>test is too amorphous to' prevent adequately the improper admission of \u201ccore testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.\u201d Id., 63. The court held, therefore, that such <em>testimonial </em>hearsay statements may be admitted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>evidence against an accused at a criminal trial only when (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify, and (2) the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Id., 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In so concluding, the court drew a distinction between testimonial hearsay statements and those deemed nontestimonial. \u201cWhere <em>nontestimonial </em>hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law\u2014as does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. In other words, nontestimonial hearsay statements may still be admitted as evidence against an accused in a criminal trial if it satisfies both prongs of the <em>Roberts </em>test, irrespective of whether the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Although the court declined to define the terms \u201ctestimonial\u201d and \u201cnontestimonial,\u201d it considered three \u201cformulations of th[e] core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements . . . .\u201d Id., 51. The first formulation consists of \u201cex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The second formulation consists of \u201cextrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 51-52, quoting <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S. Ct. 736, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring). Finally, the third formulation consists of \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S 52. The court did not adopt any one particular formulation, noting that, \u201c[tjhese formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the Clause\u2019s coverage at various levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements qualify under any definition\u2014 for example, ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing.\u201d Id. Similarly, \u201c[statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.\u201d Id. Therefore, \u201c[whatever else the term [\u2018testimonial\u2019] covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations. These are the modem practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\u201d Id., 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The statement at issue in the present case, however, does not fall within any of the formulations of the core class of testimonial statements discussed by the court in <em>Crawford.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The statement was not ex parte in-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>testimony or its functional equivalent; it was not contained in any formalized testimonial materials such as affidavits, depositions or prior testimony. Moreover, the statement was not a confession resulting from custodial examination, and unlike a statement to the police, the circumstances under which the statement was made would not lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. Specifically, Glanville made the statement in confidence and on his own initiative to a close family member, almost eighteen months before the defendant was arrested and more than four years before his own arrest. In light of these circumstances, Glanville\u2019s communication to Caraballo, his nephew, clearly does not fall within the core category of ex parte testimonial statements that the court was concerned with in <em>Crawford. </em>See id., 51 (\u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not\u201d). Accordingly, because this statement was nontestimonial in nature, application of the <em>Roberts </em>test remains appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Under the second prong of <em>Roberts, </em>a statement is presumptively reliable if it falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66. The United States Supreme Court recently has addressed the constitutional framework in which hearsay statements against penal interest may be admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>into evidence under the second prong of <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 127, 119 S. Ct. 1887, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117 (1999), the court recognized that, \u201cdue to the sweeping scope of the label, the simple categorization of a statement as a declaration against penal interest .. . defines too large a class for meaningful Confrontation Clause analysis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Hence, the court divided statements against penal interest, offered into evidence in criminal trials, into three principal categories: \u201c(1) as voluntary admissions against the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered by a defendant who claims that the declarant committed, or was involved in, the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by the prosecution to establish the guilt of an alleged accomplice of the declarant.\u201d Id. The third category of statements against penal interest was at issue in <em>Lilly, </em>id., 130; as it is in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In <em>Lilly, </em>a plurality of the court determined that \u201cthis third category of hearsay encompasses statements that are inherently unreliable.\u201d Id., 131. Specifically, \u201cth[e] truthfinding function of the Confrontation Clause is uniquely threatened when an accomplice\u2019s confession is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendant without the benefit of cross-examination. . . . Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 132, quoting <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 541, 106 S. Ct. 2056, 90 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1986). Accordingly, the plurality concluded that \u201caccomplices\u2019 confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule . . . .\u201d <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">A majority of the court reaffirmed, however, that statements against penal interest nonetheless may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>admitted, consistent with the confrontation clause, under the second prong of <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66, provided that they possess \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 135; see also id., 146 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring). The plurality further concluded: \u201c[W]hen deciding whether the admission of a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements violates the Confrontation Clause, [appellate] courts should <em>independently review </em>whether the government\u2019s proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the demands of the Clause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 137. Accordingly, our review of whether Glanville\u2019s statement was sufficiently trustworthy under the confrontation clause is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The defendant claims that Caraballo\u2019s testimony concerning Glanville\u2019s statement to him is not sufficiently trustworthy because the statement was not truly against Glanville\u2019s penal interest. The defendant further contends that the admission of the statement violated the confrontation clause because the statement itself was presumptively unreliable, and that the state failed to establish that the statement contained particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. In response, the state contends that Glanville\u2019s statement was against his penal interest because it implicated him in the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of felony murder and three other serious felonies, and that the statement possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to satisfy the confrontation clause. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Our independent review of the circumstances under which Glanville made the statement to Caraballo persuades us that the statement was sufficiently reliable to withstand scrutiny under the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, the statement was squarely against Glanville\u2019s penal interest. Glanville admitted his participation in a burglary that had given rise to a homicide, and thus exposed himself to the possibility of a charge of felony murder.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As the trial court correctly noted, even if Glanville\u2019s statement had attempted to minimize his participation in the homicide, the minimization would have been limited to \u201cone type of murder versus another type of murder.\u201d The statement further implicated Glanville as a principal in the crime of burglary, and an accomplice in the crimes of arson and tampering with evidence. Therefore, Glanville\u2019s statement exposed him to potential liability for the same types of crimes with which the defendant has been charged and, accordingly, the statement fully and equally implicated both Glanville and the defendant. <em>See State v. Hallum, </em>585 N.W.2d 249, 255 (Iowa 1998) (\u201c[a]lthough declarations such as \u2018we killed [him]\u2019 could be viewed as an attempt to <em>share </em>blame, they could not reasonably be seen as an attempt to <em>shift </em>blame away from [the declarant] because [such] assertions [implicate the declarant] fully and equally in the [crime]\u201d [emphasis in original]). Moreover, the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that Glanville drove Caraballo to a remote location before making the statement, told Caraballo that he and the defendant had done something wrong and admonished Caraballo not to repeat the statement to anyone clearly establishes that Glanville reasonably could have foreseen that the statement was against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Second, and more important, the blood relationship between Glanville and Caraballo is strongly indicative of the statement\u2019s reliability. Caraballo testified at trial that he had known his uncle for a long time, and that their relationship was close. It therefore is significant that Glanville had made his statement, upon his own initiative, to a close family member, and not \u201cin the coercive atmosphere of official interrogation . . . .\u201d <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 87, 91 S. Ct. 210, 27 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1970); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>York, </em>933 F.2d 1343, 1362-63 (7th Cir.) (speaking to acquaintances unconnected to law enforcement makes statements eminently trustworthy), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 916, 112 S. Ct. 321, 116 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1991); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Magana-Olvera, </em>917 F.2d 401, 407-408 (9th Cir. 1990) (declarant\u2019s statement inculpating defendant in drug trafficking, made after declarant discovered that he sold drugs to undercover police officer, held unreliable). As several courts have recognized, <em>\u201cLilly </em>does not change the fact that statements to close family members have particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>240 F.3d 618, 628 (7th Cir. 2001); id., 627-28; (statements to son trustworthy); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tocco, </em>200 F.3d 401, 416 (6th Cir. 2000) (confidential statement to son survives <em>Lilly </em>analysis); <em>State </em>v. <em>Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St. 3d 227, 235, 767 N.E.2d 216 (spontaneous statement trustworthy when made to wife, in declarant\u2019s own home, with no state involvement), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>denied, 537 U.S. 1023, 123 S. Ct. 533, 154 L. Ed. 2d 433 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Third, in addition to making the statement to a close family member, Glanville made the statement in confidence and on his own initiative. Such statements are significantly more trustworthy than statements obtained by government agents \u201cfor the purpose of creating evidence that would be useful at a future trial.\u201d <em>Lilly </em>v. Virginia, supra, 527 U.S. 125. <em>\u201cLilly's </em>main concern was with statements in which, as is common in police station confessions, the declarant admits only what the authorities are already capable of proving against him and seeks to shift the principal blame to another (against whom the prosecutor then offers the statement at trial) . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>211 F.3d 658, 669 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1154, 121 S. Ct. 1101, 148 L. Ed. 2d 973 (2001). Neither facing arrest, nor being under arrest, Glanville lacked \u201c[t]he obvious incentive that the captured accomplice in <em>Lilly </em>had to shift blame [and curry favor] . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Papajohn, </em>212 F.3d 1112, 1119 (8th Cir. 2000); see also <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 541 (arrest statements of codefendant strongly suspicious because of strong motivation to implicate defendant and exonerate oneself).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Finally, the timing of Glanville\u2019s statement further bolsters its reliability. \u201cIn general, declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time where a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>254 Conn. 309, 317, 757 A.2d 542 (2000). In the present case, Glanville\u2019s statement occurred within five months of the homicide, and preceded the defendant\u2019s arrest by almost eighteen months and Glanville\u2019s arrest by more than four years. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 634, 431 A.2d 501 (confession made within three months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>of murders trustworthy), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980) with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>572 F.2d 687, 693 (9th Cir.) (statement made two years after crime lacking in trustworthiness), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 840, 99 S. Ct. 128, 58 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1978). Therefore, in light of all the circumstances, we conclude that the state met its burden of establishing that Glanville\u2019s dual inculpatory statement was admissible under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, and that it bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the confrontation clause.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The defendant contends, nonetheless, that the statement is rendered untrustworthy by \u201cthe circumstances under which [Caraballo] provided the information to the authorities.\u201d Specifically, the defendant points out that Caraballo had not revealed Glanville\u2019s statements to the authorities until he himself had been arrested, after the start of the defendant\u2019s trial. In addition, Caraballo testified at trial that Inspector Pudlinski had stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that Caraballo could \u201chelp\u201d his uncle by giving Pudlinksi the information he wanted to hear. We previously have concluded, however, that a trial court may not consider the credibility of the testifying witness in determining the trustworthiness of a declaration against penal interest. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 391, 528 A.2d 794 (1987). The determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is within the province of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 381, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Katsougrakis, </em>715 F.2d 769, 777 (2d Cir. 1983) (\u201cto require a preliminary assessment of the in-court witness\u2019 credibility would ... be a usurpation of the jury function\u201d), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1040, 104 S. Ct. 704, 79 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1984). Moreover, in <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 400 U.S. 88, a plurality of the United States Supreme Court noted: \u201cFrom the viewpoint of the Confrontation Clause, a witness under oath, subject to cross-examination, and whose demeanor can be observed by the trier of fact, is a reliable informant not only as to what he has seen but what he has heard.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court properly did not consider the credibility of Caraballo, the in-court witness, before admitting into evidence his testimony concerning Glanville\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by improperly refusing to grant a one day continuance to allow him to rehabilitate his alibi witness, Georgianna Cech. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Cech and the defendant were platonic friends in the fall of 1996, when Cech was living in Ducharme\u2019s house. At trial, the defendant called Cech as an alibi witness. Although Cech could not remember the specific date of the victim\u2019s murder, she testified that she had been with the defendant on the night that he had made telephone calls from Ducharme\u2019s house. According to Cech, she and the defendant had been alone together in Ducharme\u2019s house that night, they had cooked dinner together and the defendant was still in the house when she went to bed late. Cech saw the defendant sleeping on a couch the following morning. Cech recalled that the night in question had been \u201cvery quiet\u201d in comparison to other evenings at Ducharme\u2019s house. She further contradicted the testimony of Rizzi and Ducharme by her testimony that the party, and the argument between Ducharme and Glanville, had occurred on the following night.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">On cross-examination, Cech acknowledged that she could not remember the specific dates of the events that she had recounted in her direct testimony. In addition, the state presented her with a sworn, written statement that she had given to the state police in January, 2001, in connection with the present case. According to that statement, Ducharme\u2019s party and the argument between Ducharme and Glanville, had occurred on the same night that the defendant had telephoned the university from Ducharme\u2019s house. In addition, Cech told the state police that, on that same night, the defendant had left Ducharme\u2019s house with Rizzi and Glanville. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>also had stated, consistent with Ducharme\u2019s testimony, that, on the following morning, Ducharme had yelled at the defendant for having telephoned the house so early. Under cross-examination, Cech acknowledged that she had given the statement under oath and had agreed to it by signing it. She testified, however, that the statement was false, claiming that she had lied when she had made the statement, that the police had provided her with some of the information contained therein and that she had agreed to the statement because she had wanted the police to leave her house.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Shortly thereafter, the trial court excused the jury so that the parties could present arguments concerning the admissibility of specific portions of Cech\u2019s sworn, written statement. Outside the presence of the jury, Cech attempted to explain why she had signed that statement. Specifically, Cech stated: \u201cI\u2019m having a problem saying yes or no to this statement, because they\u2019re not truth. It\u2019s not how I remember things. It\u2019s just I signed this statement to get Inspector Pudlinski out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>my house, because it was a trick, sir.\u201d Upon further questioning by the state, Cech stated that she had been coerced into making the statement. The court subsequently adjourned the proceedings until the following Tuesday, which was five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">When the proceedings resumed on March 27, 2001, the court required the state to establish that Cech\u2019s prior statement was reliable and had not been coerced. Outside the presence of the jury, the state presented Pudlinski and Steven Looby, a police inspector with the Hartford state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, both of whom were present when Cech gave her statement to the police and both of whom testified that the statement had not been coerced. Pudlinski and Looby were subjected to full cross-examination by the defendant. The court thereafter concluded that Cech\u2019s statement had been made \u201cvoluntarily without any undue pressure</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">At this point, Cech\u2019s attorney, Christopher Wall, appeared and informed the court that Cech, who was not in the courtroom, \u201cwas under such stress and strain and of such mental state that she didn\u2019t feel that she could testify . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, Wall requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the trial court vacate the capias<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that it had issued for Cech earlier that day for her failure to return to court and allow him the opportunity to speak with her and \u201ccalm her down\u201d so that she might continue her testimony, voluntarily, on the following day. The court denied this request. The court subsequently released Cech from the capias and instructed Wall to bring her to the courtroom to testify. Shortly thereafter, Wall returned and informed the court that Cech was \u201cdownstairs on the first floor and . . . crouched in the comer and . . . unable to come upstairs to testify.\u201d The court reissued the capias and, before recessing for lunch, suggested that Wall contact a mental health \u201coutreach team\u201d at Chariotte-Hungerford Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">After lunch, Wall informed the court that a mental health professional was en route to the courthouse. The court subsequently informed the parties that \u201c[a]fter the care professional is through speaking with her, I\u2019m going to order, through her attorney, that she return here tomorrow morning .... And you will have an opportunity to speak to the mental health worker[s] and we\u2019ll assess her tomorrow morning as well. If it is\u2014if she is being made unavailable intentionally, or because she\u2019s ill, we\u2019ll make that determination tomorrow morning and see what we should do about her.\u201d Later that same day, the court informed the parties that it had \u201cspoken to the crisis intervention team who interviewed . . . Cech downstairs, and they\u2019ve indicated that she would be unable to testify today, unable to testify tomorrow, in their view. That she\u2019s\u2014has some serious problems that have to be looked at from the healthcare point of view. ... So I will have to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tomorrow morning as to how I\u2019m going to react to that with regard to the testimony that she did proffer.\u201d The court again released Cech from the capias and allowed her to leave the courthouse with Wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The following morning, Cech still was unable to testify. Accordingly, the court presented the parties with two options: either strike Cech\u2019s entire testimony, or admit that testimony along with a redacted copy of her prior written statement. The defendant requested a continuance of one day so that he could obtain \u201ca status report\u201d regarding Cech\u2019s condition. The court denied the request, and explained: \u201cThis case is going to the jury today. And I had two mental health professionals in front of me yesterday who interviewed [Cech] .... They said that this woman could not testify today, yesterday she was gasping for air, she couldn\u2019t speak, she\u2019s under three medications. They think she has to be\u2014she has to see a psychiatrist and get more intensive treatment and that she has to take perhaps more\u2014alter or increase her medications. I said when will she be ready. They said they had no idea, it\u2019s a process. I said what about tomorrow, being today. No way. No way. They said this is not a short-term, quick fix situation for this witness.\u201d Defense counsel remarked that he had not been present at that meeting, and requested an opportunity to question the mental health professionals. In response, the court asked him why he had not made this request the previous day, \u201cso you could have done it last night.\u201d The court further stated: \u201cI said it on the record yesterday, essentially the same thing. I just embellished a little more.\u201d The court then denied the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance. The defendant thereafter moved for a mistrial, and reiterated his request for \u201ca delay of a few days to determine . . . whether [Cech] can complete [her testimony] so the jury has a full picture of her testimony, and the reasons she\u2019s not here, to complete it.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>court again refused to continue the case, and denied the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial. Thereafter, the court instructed the jury that Cech would no longer be testifying due to reasons beyond the control of the court and the parties,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and it admitted portions of Cech\u2019s prior written statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Our discussion of the defendant\u2019s second claim begins with our well settled law that \u201c[t]he determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. . . . A reviewing court is bound by the principle that [e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made. ... To prove an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance was arbitrary. . . . There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Berube, </em>256 Conn. 742, 759, 775 A.2d 966 (2001). In addition, we consistently have acknowledged that [o]ur role as an appellate court is not to substitute our judgment for that of a trial court that has chosen one of many reasonable alternatives.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 801, 835 A.2d 977 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The defendant contends that the trial court arbitrarily refused to grant a continuance in order to allow Cech possibly to continue her testimony, and that this refusal substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to put on a defense at trial.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cWe have articulated a number of factors that appropriately may enter into an appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in denying a motion for a continuance. Although resistant to precise cataloguing, such factors revolve around the circumstances before the trial court at the time it rendered its decision, including: the timeliness of the request for continuance; the likely length of the delay; the age and complexity of the case; the granting of other continuances in the past; the impact of delay on the litigants, witnesses, opposing counsel and the court; the perceived legitimacy of the reasons proffered in support of the request; [and] the defendant\u2019s personal responsibility for the timing of the request . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 801-802.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In the present case, the defendant requested a continuance of one day in order to obtain a status report of Cech\u2019s mental health and her ability to testify. As we previously have noted, the trial court met with two mental health professionals, outside the presence of the parties, who told the court that, in their assessment, Cech\u2019s condition was \u201cnot a short-term, quick fix situation,\u201d and that \u201cthey had no idea\u201d when she might be able to testify. Although we do not approve of the court\u2019s ex parte meeting with the mental health professionals, we note that the court stated the substance of that meeting for the record shortly after that meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>had occurred, and nothing precluded either party from contacting those individuals. Therefore, in the absence of a claim that the trial court somehow misrepresented the substance of that ex parte meeting, we cannot say that the court\u2019s denial of the requested continuance constituted an abuse of discretion. The court based its decision upon a professional medical opinion that Cech would not have been able to testify within the next day, and that her participation in the trial beyond that date was also in question. Without any evidence to the contrary, the defendant\u2019s contention that a continuance of \u201cone day\u201d or \u201ca few days\u201d would have allowed Cech to finish her testimony was merely speculative. As we previously have stated, \u201ca trial court does not act arbitrarily or unreasonably when it denies a motion for a continuance that is supported by mere speculation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>261 Conn. 708, 714-15, 805 A.2d 705 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Moreover, the defendant failed to establish that any further testimony provided by Cech upon redirect examination would have been anything other than cumulative of her previous testimony. Cech already had testified that the defendant had been with her on the night of the murder, and her direct testimony contradicted the testimony of witnesses for the state. Furthermore, although Cech did not have the opportunity, upon redirect examination, to explain the inconsistencies between her trial testimony and her prior written statement, she had explained that the police had provided her with the information in that prior statement and that she had signed the statement solely because she had wanted Inspector Pudlinski to leave her house. The defendant did not present the court with any indication that Cech, upon redirect examination, would have provided any further explanations for the inconsistency other than those that already had been heard by the jury. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s final claim, namely, that the trial court improperly denied his request for a mistrial. \u201cThe standard for review of an action upon a motion for a mistrial is well established. While the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. ... On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. . . . The trial court is better positioned than we are to evaluate in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. . . . The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 75-76, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the mistrial, and that he was prejudiced substantially as a result because Cech was his sole alibi witness. As we previously have stated, however, Cech completed her entire direct examination, affording the defendant the opportunity to present his defense, and, on cross-examination by the state, Cech explained the reasons for her prior inconsistent statement to the police.

In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted: \u201c[W]e have never drawn a distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements. And for that matter, neither has any other court of which I am aware.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 72. Moreover, Chief Justice Rehnquist was particularly concerned that the court\u2019s failure in <em>Crawford </em>to define expressly the term \u201ctestimonial\u201d would create uncertainty \u201cas to what beyond the specific kinds of \u2018testimony\u2019 the Court lists ... is covered by the new rule.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 75. Rather than expressly define the term \u201cnontestimonial,\u201d the majority remarked only that business records and statements in furtherance of a conspiracy were hearsay statements \u201cthat by their nature were not testimonial\u201d; id., 56; and noted, with approval, that it previously had \u201cconsidered reliability factors beyond prior opportunity for cross-examination when the hearsay statement at issue was <em>not testimonial. </em>See <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>[400 U.S. 74, 87-89, 91 S.

Because the United States Supreme Court has characterized such a statement as nontestimonial, even though the declarant was in custody when he made the statement, it would follow that the statement in the present case is also nontestimonial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> \u201cSuch \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 hearsay exceptions include, for example, the spontaneous utterance exception, the dying declaration exception and the exception for statements made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.

Specifically, the defendant contends that \u201cseveral portions of the statement [that] were designed to minimize Glanville\u2019s participation in the crime . . . including the segments where Glanville \u2018covered his lace\u2019 and \u2018ran out\u2019 of the house, and where Glanville allegedly said the defendant came out of the house and said to him, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s straight, it\u2019s straight,\u2019 should not have been allowed into evidence.\u201d We previously have stated that, under our evidentiary law, \u201cwhere the disserving pads of a statement are intertwined with self-serving parts, it is more prudential to admit the entire statement and let the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 696-97, 523 A.2d 451 (1987); but see <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 600-601, 114 S.

Ed. 2d 476 (1994) (rule 804 [b] [3] of Federal Rules of Evidence \u201cdoes not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory\u201d). Because we conclude that Glanville\u2019s entire statement was self-inculpatory, exposing him to prosecution for the crimes of felony murder, burglary, arson and tampering with evidence, we also conclude that the trial coud properly admitted the statement into evidence in its entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> We are aware that some courts have determined that the credibility of a testifying witness is relevant to the trustworthiness of the statement. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>537 F.2d 162, 167-68 (5th Cir. 1976). As we previously have indicated, however, we follow the approach taken by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which has \u201crejected the position that the credibility of the in-court witness must be evaluated <em>before </em>the jury is permitted to hear testimony that inculpates both the out-of-court declarant and the accused.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 391 n.7; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Katsougrakis, </em>supra, 715 F.2d 777.
