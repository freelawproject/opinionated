The state appeals from the judgment of dismissal rendered by the trial court after it granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the state\u2019s petition for an order of continued commitment of the defendant, Calvin Long. We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the state constitution and his equal protection rights under the state and federal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>stitutions, and, therefore, improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. In March, 1986, the defendant was charged by information with assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 53a-60,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a class D felony, after striking a person in the head several times with a hammer. After a trial to the court, the defendant was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court then committed the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>dant to the jurisdiction of the commissioner of mental health and addiction services (commissioner) for initial confinement and examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the defendant submitted to a mandatory psychiatric examination, and the commissioner issued a report concerning the defendant\u2019s mental health, the court held a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to \u201cmake a finding as to the mental condition of the [defendant] . . . .\u201d Thereafter, the trial court found that the defendant \u201cis a person who should be confined\u201d and ordered the defendant committed to the jurisdiction of the psychiatric security review board (board) for five years, the maximum period to which the defendant could have been sentenced had he been convicted of the underlying offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Prior to the expiration of the defendant\u2019s five year commitment, the state\u2019s attorney, in accordance with \u00a7 17a-593 (c), petitioned the Superior Court to extend the defendant\u2019s commitment beyond the five year maximum term on the ground that the defendant remained mentally ill to the extent that his discharge would constitute a danger to himself or others. After a hearing, the trial court granted the state\u2019s petition and recommitted the defendant for an additional three years. After this initial recommitment, the state successfully petitioned the Superior Court for recommitment of the defendant on three additional occasions. As a result, at the time of filing this appeal, the defendant had been in the custody of the board for more than sixteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In March, 2001, the state filed its most recent petition to recommit the defendant. In response, the board filed a report with the court recommending continued commitment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant then moved to strike the board\u2019s report and to dismiss the state\u2019s petition for recommitment, claiming, among other things, that \u201c[o]nce an acquittee reaches his/her maximum term of recommitment, the reasoning of <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>173 Conn. 473 [378 A.2d 553] (1977), <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400 [645 A.2d 965] (1994), and related cases, by extension, renders a state\u2019s petition for recommitment pursuant to . . . [\u00a7] 17a-593 (c) unconstitutional in both procedure and effect.\u201d Following a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions and granted the state\u2019s petition, thereby extending the commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of the defendant pending the filing of a memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Thereafter, the trial court, sua sponte, reconsidered its earlier rulings, vacated its order of commitment, and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the state\u2019s petition for recommitment based on its conclusion that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) is unconstitutional. Specifically, the court concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because the statute failed to provide an acquittee with mandatory periodic judicial review of confinement as required by <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 479. The court also determined that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because it treats acquittees, like the defendant, differently from convicted prisoners who subsequently are civilly committed to a mental hospital at some point after they have been incarcerated (civilly committed inmates). The trial court interpreted this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 400, to preclude differential treatment between the two classes, and it therefore found \u00a7 17a-593 (c) to be unconstitutional. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Lastly, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights under article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the trial court determined that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>under article first, \u00a7 20, a statute that discriminates on the basis of mental disability, such as \u00a7 17a-593 (c), is subject to strict scrutiny review, and because \u00a7 17a-593 (c) fails under rational basis review under the federal constitution, it necessarily fails under the more stringent strict scrutiny standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Although the trial court declared \u00a7 17a-593 (c) unconstitutional, it nevertheless expressly found that the state had proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant \u201chas a mental illness and would be a danger to others were he discharged from confinement.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court found that \u201cthe [defendant] suffers from a form of mental illness diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder, is currently unstable (even with medication), has intermittent paranoia, significant mood swings, is easily provoked, frequently threatening, and threatens serious violence.\u201d The court dismissed the state\u2019s petition for recommitment, but ordered that the defendant \u201cbe held for a period of sixty days from the date of the filing of [its] memorandum to allow the state, if it so elects, to pursue a petition for civil commitment before the Probate Court.\u201d The trial court then rendered judgment dismissing the state\u2019s petition for recommitment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Rather than pursue a civil commitment in the Probate Court, the state appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of dismissal to the Appellate Court. We thereafter granted the state\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In this appeal, the state challenges all three grounds on which the trial court found \u00a7 17a-593 (c) unconstitutional. The state first claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because \u00a7 17a-593 (c), as applied to the defendant, provided him with periodic judicial review sufficient to satisfy his state procedural due process rights. The state also claims that the defendant lacked standing to bring either a state or federal equal protection claim because he was not aggrieved by the alleged differences in recommitment procedures between acquittees and civilly committed inmates. The state further argues that, if this court were to conclude that the defendant had standing to bring his equal protection challenges, \u00a7 17a-593 (c) does not violate the defendant\u2019s federal equal protection rights because there is a rational basis for the disparate treatment in periodic review accorded acquittees and civilly committed inmates. Similarly, the state argues that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) does not violate the defendant\u2019s state equal protection rights because the statute discriminates among psychiatrically disabled individuals on the basis of their proven criminal acts, not their mental disability, thereby requiring rational basis review rather than strict scrutiny examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">We conclude that \u00a7 17a-593 (c), as applied to the defendant, provided him with periodic judicial review sufficient to satisfy his state procedural due process rights. We also conclude that the defendant had standing to bring both equal protection challenges, and that his federal equal protection rights were not violated because a rational basis exists for the disparate treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> accorded an acquittee and a civilly committed inmate. Finally, we conclude that, because \u00a7 17a-593 (c) discriminates among, rather than between, the protected class of psychiatrically disabled individuals, our prior decisions require us to review the statute under a rational basis standard, rather than apply strict scrutiny review. Thus, because we conclude that a rational basis exists for the disparate treatment under the federal equal protection clause, the defendant\u2019s state equal protection guarantees also are necessarily satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The state\u2019s first claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution because the statute, as applied to the defendant, provided him with periodic judicial review sufficient to satisfy his state procedural due process rights. Specifically, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s analysis of the defendant\u2019s procedural due process claim was flawed because \u201c[r]ather than determining whether the [defendant], in fact, received periodic judicial review, the trial court concluded that the recommitment statute, <em>on Us face, </em>violated the [defendant\u2019s] due process rights . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>added.) We agree.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. In October, 1991, as the defendant neared completion of his initial five year commitment period, the state\u2019s attorney petitioned the Superior Court, in accordance with \u00a7 17a-593 (c), to extend the defendant\u2019s commitment beyond the initial five year term on the ground that the defendant remained mentally disabled and would constitute a danger to himself or others if he were discharged. After holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits, the trial court, <em>Fasano, </em>J., found that the state had proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant was still mentally ill and dangerous, and subsequently recommitted the defendant for three years. In October, 1994, the state\u2019s attorney petitioned the Superior Court again for recommitment of the defendant and, following the same procedures, the trial court, <em>Schimelman, J., </em>found that the state had met its burden of proof and recommitted the defendant for an additional two years. In October, 1996, after a hearing on the state\u2019s petition, the trial court, <em>Ward, J., </em>recommitted the defendant for an additional eighteen months. In February, 1998, after a hearing, the trial court, <em>Clif</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>ford, J., </em>recommitted the defendant for an additional eighteen months. In September, 1999, Judge Clifford again recommitted the defendant for a period not to exceed two years. Finally, in these underlying proceedings in 2002, the trial court, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J., </em>held an evidentiary hearing on the state\u2019s petition for recommitment before ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. After the presentation of extensive evidence, which included expert testimony from both sides, the court concluded that the state had proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant was still mentally ill and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Prior to beginning our due process analysis, we briefly review the statutory commitment scheme for acquittees, as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-580 through 17a-603. Under Connecticut law, a defendant charged with a crime may plead as an affirmative defense that at the time he committed the offense, he lacked the requisite mental capacity to commit the charged offense due to a mental disease or defect. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. If the trier of fact finds that the defendant has proven this defense by a preponderance of the evidence,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the trial court then commits the defendant to the jurisdiction of the board for a maximum term of commitment \u201cnot to exceed the maximum sentence that could have been imposed if the acquittee had been convicted of the offense . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The board is \u201can autonomous body within the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services for administrative purposes only.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-581 (a). It is an administrative body consisting of six members: a psychiatrist; a psychologist; a probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>expert; a layperson; an attorney who is a member of the state bar; and a layperson with experience in victim advocacy. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-581 (b). The purpose of the board is to manage, monitor and review the status of each acquittee to ensure the protection of the general public. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-584; see also 28 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1985 Sess., pp. 4912-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Once committed to the jurisdiction of the board, an acquittee may apply to the Superior Court for release every six months, or the board itself may recommend to the court that the acquittee be discharged from custody.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (a). The board also must hold a hearing at least once every two years to determine whether the acquittee should remain committed. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-585.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">As the acquittee reaches the end of his maximum term of commitment, the state may file a petition with the Superior Court for an order of continued commitment if \u201creasonable cause exists to believe that the acquittee remains a person with psychiatric disabilities ... to the extent that his discharge at the expiration of his maximum term of commitment would constitute a danger to himself or others . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (c). The acquittee remains under the jurisdiction of the board until the expiration of the acquittee\u2019s most recent commitment term, or until the Superior Court determines the acquittee should be released. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-582 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The question of whether the trial court properly concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violates the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights under the Connecticut constitution is a question of law. Accordingly, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>review is plenary. See <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 318, 803 A.2d 287 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Our analysis of the trial court\u2019s ruling begins with the premise that \u201ca validly enacted statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, [and that] those who challenge its constitutionality must sustain the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 291, 833 A.2d 363 (2003); see also <em>Thalheim </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>256 Conn. 628, 647-48, 775 A.2d 947 (2001); <em>State v. Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 176, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993). \u201cThe court will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra, 176. Therefore, \u201c[w]hen a question of constitutionality is raised, courts must approach it with caution, examine it with care, and sustain the legislation unless its invalidity is clear.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCahill, </em>261 Conn. 492, 504, 811 A.2d 667 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In the present case, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution because it allows the state to extend the commitment of an acquittee beyond the initial period authorized by \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A) without providing for mandatory periodic judicial review of the extended commitment. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court analyzed \u00a7 17a-593 (c) on its face, construing the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>dant\u2019s claim as a facial challenge to the statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court reasoned that \u201c [t]he problem with the current procedures [under \u00a7 17a-593 (c)] is that they fail to adequately protect the right of [a] recommittee to be released when the reasons for confinement no longer exist,\u201d as required by <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 476.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> phe court stated that, although the acquittee statutory scheme \u201cdoes provide all acquittees with ongoing periodic review <em>by the board . . . </em>[r]eview of [a] recommittee\u2019s commitment status <em>by the board </em>is not \u2018periodic judicial review\u2019 [as required by <em>Fasulo] </em>and is no substitute for periodic judicial review.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We conclude that the trial court incorrectly analyzed \u00a7 17a-593 as it specifically pertained to the defendant, and, further, that when analyzed on an \u201cas applied\u201d basis, the statute withstands scrutiny under the procedural due process requirements of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We repeatedly have stated that, \u201c[a] procedural due process challenge to the validity of [a statute] cannot proceed in the abstract.\u201d <em>Thalheim v. Greenwich, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 648; see also <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 307, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997); <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 779, 629 A.2d 357 (1993). \u201cIt is a settled rule of constitutional adjudication that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>court will decide the constitutionality of a statute only as it applies to the particular facts at hand. ... A party who challenges the constitutionality of a statute must prove that the statute has adversely affected a protected interest under the facts of his particular case and not merely under some possible or hypothetical set of facts not proven to exist.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>City Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>247 Conn. 751, 758, 725 A.2d 937 (1999). Therefore, \u201c[a] claim that a statute fails, on its face, to comport with the constitutional requirements of procedural due process reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the law of due process. Due process is inherently fact-bound because due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. . . . The constitutional requirement of procedural due process thus invokes a balancing process that cannot take place in a factual vacuum.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thalheim </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>supra, 648; see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 476, 457 A.2d 290 (noting that due process \u201cis not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983). Consequently, the issue in the present case, as properly framed, is whether \u00a7 17a-593 (c), <em>as applied to the defendant, </em>\u201cdeprived [him] of [his right] to procedural due process in the particular circumstances of [this] case, and not merely under some possible or hypothetical set of facts not proven to exist.\u201d <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>supra, 779; see <em>DiBerardino </em>v. <em>DiBerardino, </em>213 Conn. 373, 383, 568 A.2d 431 (1990). We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court [has] set forth three factors [which this court has followed] to consider when analyzing whether an individual is constitutionally entitled to a particular judicial or administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>procedure: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). ... Due process analysis requires balancing the government\u2019s interest in existing procedures against the risk of erroneous deprivation of a private interest inherent in those procedures.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 511-12, 778 A.2d 33 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Applying this analysis to the facts of the present case, it is undisputed that Connecticut\u2019s statutory procedures for the recommitment of acquittees, as set forth in \u00a7 17a-593 (c), implicate the defendant\u2019s liberty interest. See <em>Fasulo </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 476 (\u201c[t]here can be no doubt that involuntary commitment to a mental hospital, like involuntary confinement of an individual for any reason, is a deprivation of liberty\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71, 80, 112 S. Ct. 1780, 118 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1992) (\u201c[i]t is clear that commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). It is also undisputed that the state has an interest in confining individuals who, as a result of mental illness, pose a potential danger to themselves or others. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 354, 361, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 77 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1983). Thus, the only factor that we must address is whether, based upon the judicial review that the defendant did in fact receive, the defendant\u2019s liberty interest was subject to an unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>risk of erroneous deprivation, and the probable value of any additional procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThe fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard . . . [which] must be at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. . . . [T]hese principles require that a [party] have timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for [the proposed action], and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goldberg </em>v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 267-68, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1970); see <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 512. In this case, following his initial commitment, the defendant was the subject of five petitions for continued commitment filed by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and heard by the Superior Court. In each instance, the defendant (1) was given a copy of the petition; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (a);<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (2) was afforded the right to be present at the hearing and the right to be represented by counsel; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-598 (a);<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (3) had the right to a separate and independent review of his mental health by an independent psychiatrist or psychologist of his choice; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(e);<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and (4) had the right to examine all documents and reports considered by the court in preparation of his defense. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-598 (b).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In each instance, the defendant was in fact represented by counsel, supplied by the state. Furthermore, prior to each hearing, the board filed a report with the court, and gave copies to the defendant and the state, as to whether the defendant should be discharged. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (d). In each instance, the trial court ordered the defendant recommitted for periods ranging from eighteen months to three years. During the term of recommitment, the defendant had the right to apply directly to the court for his discharge every six months; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (a);<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> however, he never exercised that right. Had the defendant submitted such an application at any point during his commitment, the court would have been required to hold a judicial hearing on whether the defendant should be discharged. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-593 (f).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ing his term of recommitment, the board received a report every six months from the hospital where he was confined. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-586.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Furthermore, the board was required to hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s mental status once every two years; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-585; and the board had the option to recommend to the court that the defendant be discharged pursuant to \u00a7 17a-593 (a). The board never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We conclude that these existing statutory procedures, as applied to the defendant, did not expose him to an unreasonable risk of erroneous deprivation of his liberty. We further conclude that there would be little value in the imposition of additional procedural safeguards, such as mandatory judicial review without a petition being filed during the term of recommitment. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 17a-593 (c), as applied to the defendant, did not violate the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The state next claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in concluding that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violates the defendant\u2019s right to equal protection under both the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended. The state claims first that \u201cthe [defendant] has no standing to bring . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>[either] equal protection claim because he was not aggrieved by the alleged differences in treatment; hence, his equal protection claim is not justiciable.\u201d The state also argues that, even if we conclude that the defendant did have standing to bring his equal protection claims, the trial court nonetheless improperly concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violates the defendant\u2019s federal equal protection rights because a rational basis exists for the disparate treatment between acquittees and civilly committed inmates. Additionally, the state contends that \u00a7 17a-593 does not violate the defendant\u2019s state equal protection rights because the statute discriminates among insane individuals on the basis of their proven criminal acts, rather than their mental disability, thereby requiring rational basis review, as opposed to the strict scrutiny standard employed by the trial court. Thus, the state argues, since a rational basis exists for the disparate treatment under the federal equal protection clause, the defendant\u2019s state equal protection guarantees also are necessarily satisfied. We disagree with the state\u2019s claim with regard to standing, but agree with both of its substantive arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In part I of this opinion, we reviewed the basic structure of the statutory commitment scheme regarding acquittees. In order fully to address the state\u2019s claims, we must also consider the relationship between the statutory commitment scheme for acquittees and the statutory commitment scheme for civil committees, as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-495 through 17a-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">As we previously have noted herein, Connecticut law allows a defendant charged with a crime to <em>raise </em>the affirmative defense of lack of capacity due to mental disease or defect. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. In contrast, civil commitment generally is an involuntary process, initiated by someone other than the committee. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-497 (a). Thus, while an acquittee may acquire that status of his own volition, i.e., by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>raising his diminished mental capacity as an affirmative defense, any person may file an application for the civil commitment of an individual with the Probate Court for the district in which the potential committee resides. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-497 (a).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">After civil commitment proceedings are commenced, the individual who is the subject of the proceedings, whether a private citizen or a current inmate in the prison system, has a right to a hearing on the merits before the Probate Court. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-498 (a).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> If the Probate Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the potential committee has \u201cpsychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled,\u201d it issues an order for his or her commitment. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-498 (c).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The committed individual then remains under the jurisdiction of the Probate Court until his or her release from commitment. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-497 (a).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The hospital in which the individual is committed annually must notify the committee that he has a right to an additional hearing regarding his continued commitment. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-498 (g).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> That statute also provides that if the committee does not request such a hearing, or the hearing does not result in his release, the Probate Court must hold a hearing at least once every two years to revisit the issue of continued commitment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It is this required biennial judicial review, which is not applicable to acquittees, that is the principal distinction in the recommitment processes for civil committees and acquittees.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Prior to beginning our analysis, we set forth the applicable standard of review. The question of whether the trial court properly concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violates the defendant\u2019s state and federal equal protection rights presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary. See <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">We begin with the state\u2019s claim that the defendant lacked standing to bring either a state or federal equal protection challenge to \u00a7 17a-593 (c). The state argues that the defendant was not aggrieved by any potential disparity in the frequency of periodic judicial review afforded by the statutory recommitment procedures for an acquittee as compared to those provided for a civilly committed inmate because he in fact received more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>judicial review than a civil committee is entitled to receive. Therefore, the state claims, the defendant lacked standing to bring either of his equal protection challenges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u201cThe issue of standing implicates this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Fish Unlimited </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities Service Co., </em>254 Conn. 21, 31, 755 A.2d 860 (2000), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 545, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002); see also <em>Steeneck </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>235 Conn. 572, 580, 668 A.2d 688 (1995) (\u201c[w]here a plaintiff lacks standing to sue, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction\u201d). \u201c[0]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised . . . the court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dow &amp; Condon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brookfield Development Corp., </em>266 Conn. 572, 579, 833 A.2d 908 (2003). \u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy. . . . When standing is put in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of the issue</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u201cStanding is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring suit or is classically aggrieved. . . . The fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: [F]irst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in [the subject matter of the challenged action], as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the [challenged action]. . . . Aggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 567-68, 775 A.2d 284 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In the present case, it is uncontested that the defendant has a specific, personal and legal liberty interest in any recommitment proceedings instituted by the state in accordance with \u00a7 17a-593 (c). The state contends, however, that the defendant\u2019s liberty interest is not \u201cspecially and injuriously affected\u201d; id., 568; because the defendant, as an acquittee, received more judicial review than a civil committee is entitled to receive. To substantiate this claim, the state cites to the defendant\u2019s numerous appearances before the Superior Court \u201cvia his multiple [recommitment hearings] in 1991, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2002,\u201d as well as his statutory right to judicial review every six months under \u00a7 17a-593 (a), and his right to review by the board every two years in accordance with \u00a7 17a-585. We acknowledge that the judicial review afforded the defendant in the past may have exceeded what he would have received if he had been civilly committed. The state\u2019s argument nevertheless must fail because it neglects to recognize that classical aggrievement may rest on the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s future recommitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We previously have concluded that \u201ca genuine likelihood of criminal liability or civil incarceration is sufficient to confer standing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 809, 761 A.2d 705 (2000); see also <em>Kuser </em>v. <em>Orkis, </em>169 Conn. 66, 73-74, 362 A.2d 943 (1975) (court stated, in dictum, that genuine likelihood of civil incarceration would confer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>standing). In <em>Ramos, </em>one of the issues before this court was whether the plaintiff had standing to challenge a juvenile curfew ordinance that potentially could apply to him in the future. <em>Ramos </em>v. Vernon, supra, 808-11. We concluded that, because \u201cthe litigant\u2019s alleged activity is proscribed by the ordinance as \u2018unlawful\u2019 . . . and [the ordinance sets forth procedures] in which the litigant may be referred to Juvenile Court for violation of its terms,\u201d he therefore was classically aggrieved and had standing to challenge the ordinance. (Citations omitted.) Id., 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Similarly, in the present case, the defendant challenges the acquittee recommitment statute, \u00a7 17a-593 (c), which, if applied to him in the future, could subject him to further recommitment that adversely would affect his liberty interest. Moreover, the trial court specifically found at the most recent recommitment hearing that the defendant still suffered from a \u201cmental illness\u201d and posed \u201ca danger to others were he discharged from confinement.\u201d These factual findings demonstrate a genuine likelihood that the defendant is susceptible to the deprivation of his liberty interest in the future via recommitment in accordance with \u00a7 17a-593 (c). Consequently, because the defendant risks actual prospective deprivation of his liberty interest under the challenged statute, we conclude that he is classically aggrieved, and has standing to challenge the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We next address the state\u2019s substantive claim that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) does not violate the defendant\u2019s federal equal protection rights because there is a rational basis for the disparate treatment between acquittees and civilly committed inmates. Specifically, the state contends that the state legislature reasonably could have determined that disparate treatment of the classes of individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>uals was warranted because: (1) the board has general and specific familiarity with the acquittees and therefore is better equipped to regulate their commitment; and (2) the risk of erroneous commitment based on idiosyncratic behavior is far less for an acquittee and therefore the additional mandatory judicial review procedures provided for civilly committed inmates are unnecessary for acquittees.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u201cIn order to analyze [the defendant\u2019s claim], we first must detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. . . . First, in general, as in any constitutional challenge to the validity of a statutory scheme, the [statutory scheme] is presumed constitutional . . . and [t]he burden is on the [party] attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it ... . <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1993). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201cMoreover, [t]o implicate the equal protection [clause] under the . . . federal [constitution] ... it is necessary that the state statute [or statutory scheme] in question, either on its face or in practice, treat persons standing in the same relation to it differently. . . . Thus, the analytical predicate [of consideration of an equal protection claim] is a determination of who are the persons similarly situated.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>264 Conn. 593, 606, 825 A.2d 111 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u201cThe equal protection clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages. . . . Rather, a state may make classifications when enacting or carrying out legislation, but in order to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>equal protection clause the classifications made must be based on some reasonable ground. ... To determine whether a particular classification violates the guarantees of equal protection, the court must consider the character of the classification; the individual interests affected by the classification; and the governmental interests asserted in support of the classification. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 595, 560 A.2d 444 (1989). \u201cWhere . . . the classification at issue neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor affects a suspect group it will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis. . . . Rational basis review is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification .... [I]t is irrelevant whether the conceivable basis for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">It is undisputed that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) neither affects a suspect group nor implicates a fundamental right for the purposes of the federal equal protection clause, and therefore must be analyzed under rational basis review. See, e.g., <em>Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 366-67, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001) (holding statutes that discriminate on basis of physical or mental disability are subject to rational basis review).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Furthermore, we assume arguendo, without deciding, that acquittees are similarly situated to civilly committed inmates. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>246 Conn. 132, 143, 716 A.2d 870 (1998) (this court frequently has assumed arguendo that categories of defendants are similarly situated with respect to chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>lenged statute). Thus, we next turn to whether \u201cthere is a plausible policy reason for the classification . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 607. In the present case, we have no difficulty in ascertaining two rational reasons for the disparate treatment in statutory recommitment procedures for acquittees as compared to civilly committed inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">First, under the acquittee statutory scheme, the board has general and specific familiarity with all acquittees beginning with their initial commitment and, therefore, is better equipped than courts to monitor their commitment. By placing oversight of these individuals in a single administrative agency, such as the board, which is comprised of laypersons and experts in relevant areas, including psychiatry, psychology, probation, and victim advocacy, the legislature reasonably could have believed that the board, with its expertise and familiarity with the mental status of each acquittee, would be better equipped than a court to monitor the individuals\u2019 recommitment. This furthers the legislature\u2019s legitimate interest in efficiently managing the recommitment of acquittees. See <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>259 Conn. 783, 798, 792 A.2d 76 (2002) (concluding that efficient management of administrative system is legitimate reason for disparate treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Second, the state clearly has an interest in ensuring that its citizens are not erroneously committed based on harmless, idiosyncratic behavior. See <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 426-27, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). The legislature, however, reasonably could have concluded that the risk of erroneous commitment is far less for an acquittee and, therefore, additional mandatory judicial review during the recommitment is unnecessary. Specifically, the legislature could have determined that the likelihood of an erroneous commitment is reduced in the case of an acquittee because an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>acquittee initiates the commitment process himself by pleading and proving the mental illness that led to his commission of a crime. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Jones: </em>\u201c[S]ince [commitment as an acquittee] follows only if the <em>acquittee himself </em>advances insanity as a defense and proves that his criminal act was a product of his mental illness, there is good reason for diminished concern as to the risk of error. More important, the proof that he committed a criminal act as a result of mental illness eliminates the risk that he is being committed for mere idiosyncratic behavior . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that a rational basis exists for the legislature\u2019s differential treatment of acquittees and civilly committed inmates, and, therefore, \u00a7 17a-593 (c) does not violate the defendant\u2019s federal equal protection guarantees.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The state\u2019s final claim is that the trial court, in concluding that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violated the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights under the Connecticut constitution, incorrectly applied a strict scrutiny standard to the defendant\u2019s state equal protection claim. Specifically, the state argues that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) does not violate the defendant\u2019s state equal protection rights because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>statute discriminates <em>among </em>psychiatrically disabled individuals on the basis of a proven criminal act, rather than mental disability, thereby requiring rational basis review rather than strict scrutiny. Therefore, the state contends, since a rational basis exists for the disparate treatment under the federal equal protection clause, the defendant\u2019s state equal protection guarantees are also necessarily satisfied. We agree.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments, provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or <em>mental disability.''' </em>(Emphasis added.) In <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 515, 624 A.2d 876 (1993), this court concluded that the \u201cprotection [under article twenty-one of the amendments] for those possessing physical and mental disabilities identifies the members of this class as a group especially subject to discrimination . . . .\u201d Therefore, the amendment\u2019s prohibition of discrimination against that class of individuals requires \u201cencroachments on these rights to pass a strict scrutiny test.\u201d Id., 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u201cWe previously have noted that strict scrutiny is required only when a state action invidiously discriminates against a suspect class or affects a fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>right .... The United States Supreme Court has explained, with respect to those presumptively invidious classifications; <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982); such as alienage and race, that [t]hese factors are so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy\u2014a view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or deserving as others. . . . <em>Barannikova </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>229 Conn. 664, 676, 643 A.2d 251 (1994). Accordingly, when the state discriminates against the disabled, or a class of the disabled, in favor of the able-bodied, invidious discrimination is presumed and strict scrutiny is applied. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, when the state discriminates <em>amongst </em>members of the protected class, invidious discrimination cannot necessarily be presumed. . . . [I]n order for strict scrutiny to apply to a . . . statute that discriminates amongst the disabled, there must be evidence, either on the face of the statute or from its legislative history, that the legislature intended to discriminate invidiously on the basis of disability. See <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>234 Conn. 455, 479, 662 A.2d 1226 (1995) (plaintiffs . . . carry the burden of demonstrating invidious discrimination and of rebutting the presumption of constitutionality).\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 343-45, 819 A.2d 803 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In the present case, acquittees and civilly committed inmates are both members of the same class, namely the psychiatrically disabled. What differentiates these two groups for the purposes of recommitment procedures is the acquittee\u2019s proven criminal offense, which has been adjudicated to be the product of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>A verdict of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect establishes two facts: (1) the person committed an act that constitutes a criminal offense; and (2) he committed the act because of mental illness. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 363. Thus, unlike a civilly committed inmate, an acquittee has proven to the fact finder that his mental disease or defect caused him to commit a crime, thereby establishing a legal nexus between the acquittee\u2019s mental illness and the criminal act. Because criminality is inextricably intertwined with mental illness under the acquittee recommitment statutory scheme, but not under the analogous scheme for civil committees, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature, when enacting \u00a7 17a-593 (c), did not intend to discriminate invidiously on the basis of mental disability, but, rather, upon the fact that the acquittee committed a crime that was the result of his mental disability. See <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 344-45; cf. <em>Foti </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>30 Conn. App. 463, 468-69, 620 A.2d 840 (1993) (disparate treatment of plaintiff with autism predicated on absence of mental retardation as basis for ineligibility for services by department of mental retardation; rational basis, rather than strict scrutiny, applied). Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) is subject to rational basis review under the equal protection clause of the state constitution. <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>supra, 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Because we have concluded that the defendant\u2019s federal equal protection claim satisfies rational basis review, it is axiomatic that the same conclusion satisfies state equal protection analysis.

Consequently, evidence was presented and findings were made concerning the defendant\u2019s mental status, and, after the hearing on the state\u2019s petition, the trial court ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b533-10\"> The trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the board\u2019s report recommending his continued commitment.

Because we conclude that \u00a7 17a-593 (c), as applied to the defendant, provided him with sufficient periodic judicial review to satisfy his state procedural due process rights, we need not address the state\u2019s alternative argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> The defendant makes two related arguments on appeal for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment. The defendant\u2019s primary claim is that the trial court correctly concluded that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violates the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights under the Connecticut constitution because it allows the state to extend the commitment of an acquittee beyond the initial period authorized by \u00a7 17a-582 (e) (1) (A) without providing for mandatory periodic judicial review of the extended commitment. We address this claim fully herein. The defendant also argues that \u00a7 17a-593 (c) violates his state due process rights on its face because, unlike the statutory recommitment procedures for civil committees, an acquittee is not entitled to obtain a mental examination by two impartial physicians selected by the court in connection with a petition for recommitment. Because we conclude that, \u00a7 17a-593 (c), as applied to the defendant, provided him with sufficient periodic judicial review, we need not address the defendant\u2019s second facial claim. As we explain herein, the defendant\u2019s claim of a violation of his due process rights necessarily requires an \u201cas applied\u201d analysis, and facial claims are simply inapt in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b) provides: \u201cWhen a defense declared to be an affirmative defense is raised at a trial, the defendant shall have the burden of establishing such defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> The hospital at which the acquittee is confined must submit to the board a written report of the acquittee\u2019s mental condition every six months.
