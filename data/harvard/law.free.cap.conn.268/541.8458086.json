In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that the action had not been brought within two years of the date of the accident, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-584,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the accidental failure of suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>statute (savings statute), General Statutes \u00a7 52-592,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not operate to save the plaintiffs\u2019 action. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 52-592 did not save the action. We agree with the plaintiffs and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On July 18,1998, the parties were involved in a motor vehicle collision. On July 6, 2000, the plaintiffs initiated an action against the defendant, a Pennsylvania resident, by filing a complaint with the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging injuries sustained as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that, while Joseph Rocco was driving north on Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>state 95 in Connecticut with Anna Rocco as his passenger, the defendant crashed into the rear of their vehicle, causing the plaintiffs to suffer serious injuries and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">After the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the clerk of the District Court signed and sealed the summons prepared by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and returned it to counsel for service upon the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then followed the procedure established by rule 4 (d) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> entitled \u201cWaiver of Service; Duty to Save Costs of Service; Request to Waive.\u201d Rule 4 (d) (2) is intended to encourage parties to save the cost of formal service of a summons and complaint by providing that an individual who is subject to service and who receives notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>an action in the prescribed manner has a \u201cduty\u201d to avoid the unnecessary costs of service of the summons by complying with a request to waive formal service. Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sent to the defendant\u2019s home address, by certified mail, each of the items required under rule 4 (d) (2), including the summons and complaint, two copies of a notice and request for waiver of formal service and an envelope with sufficient postage for return of the signed waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"ApnB\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel received a return receipt from the United States Postal Service indicating that the items had been delivered to the defendant at her Pennsylvania home on July 14, 2000, four days before the expiration of the two year statute of limitations. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-584. The defendant, however, did not sign and return the waiver of service form as requested, and the statute of limitations lapsed before the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel could effect formal service of process. On September 28, 2000, counsel for the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in the District Court alleging that the plaintiffs had not commenced their action prior to the expiration of the two year statute of limitations because formal service of process was not made upon the defendant until September 13, 2000. The District Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and rendered judgment thereon on November 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In March, 2001, the plaintiffs commenced this second action in the Connecticut Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 52-592, the savings statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs served the defendant with a writ, summons and complaint through the commissioner of motor vehicles as authorized under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Connecticut law. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-62.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 federal action had not been commenced within the meaning of the savings statute due to a lack of proper service and that that statute, therefore, was inapplicable and could not save the plaintiffs\u2019 second action. The defendant thus argued that the plaintiffs\u2019 second action was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. The trial court stated that, although the savings statute \u201cmust be given a liberal and broad interpretation and application ... it [was] impossible to conclude that the initial action was commenced . . . within the meaning of Connecticut statutes. Consequently, the plaintiffs have filed this action too late. The statute of limitation^] has expired and the [savings statute] does not save the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of [action] against the defendant.\u201d The trial court thereupon rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that their original action was commenced in a timely manner for purposes of the savings statute when the defendant received clear and unmistakable notice of that action upon delivery of the summons, complaint and related materials pursuant to rule 4 (d) (2). The defendant disagrees, arguing that the commencement of an action under Connecticut law occurs when the writ is served upon the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and that an action is not commenced if the defendant is not served <em>properly. </em>The defendant thus argues that, in order for the savings statute to apply in this case, the complaint in the original action must have been served pursuant to the provisions of rule 4 (e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> within the time frame prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations. According to the defendant, the federal court\u2019s decision to dismiss the original action on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to serve the summons and complaint properly prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations is conclusive of the issue. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Mellick &amp; Sexton, </em>263 Conn. 140, 146, 819 A.2d 216 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We begin our analysis by noting that there is no substantive distinction between the terms \u201cbringing\u201d an action and \u201ccommencing\u201d an action. See <em>Lacasse </em>v. Burns, 214 Conn. 464, 475-76, 572 A.2d 357 (1990) (for almost one half centuiy, terms \u201ccommence\u201d and \u201cbrought\u201d have been used interchangeably to describe initiation of action). We further note that, under the law of our state,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201can action is commenced not when the writ is returned but when it is served upon the defendant.\u201d <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>167 Conn. 96, 99, 355 A.2d 234 (1974); see also <em>Rana </em>v. <em>Ritacco, </em>236 Conn. 330, 337, 672 A.2d 946 (1996) (\u201c[t]his court has long held that an action is brought once the writ, summons and complaint have been served upon a defendant\u201d); <em>Consolidated Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>M &amp; M Transportation Co., </em>128 Conn. 107, 109, 20 A.2d 621 (1941) (\u201cthe time when the action is regarded as having been brought is the date of service of the writ upon the defendant\u201d). Nevertheless, the savings statute provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed . . . <em>because of insufficient service or return of the writ </em>due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed . . . the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action . . . for the same cause at any time within one year after the determination of the original action or after the reversal of the judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The proper interpretation of \u00a7 52-592 (a) is a \u201cquestion of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. . . . That review is guided by well established principles of statutory interpretation .... As with all issues of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ledbetter, 263 Conn. 1, 12, 818 A.2d 1 (2003). \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>217 Conn. 361, 370-71, 585 A.2d 1210 (1991). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 536-37, 829 A.2d 818 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 52-592 would render a key portion of that statute meaningless. If the savings statute requires effective commencement of the original action, and commencement requires valid service of process, as the defendant argues, then any failure of service of process would require us to conclude that no action had been commenced and that the statute does not apply. This would render superfluous one of the principal purposes of the savings statute, namely, to save those actions that have failed due to insufficient service of process. Moreover, the language of \u00a7 52-592 distinguishes between the commencement of an action and insufficient service of process by providing that the action may <em>failfollowing </em>its commencement <em>because of </em>insufficient service. To accept the view that improper or insufficient service defeats such an action would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>undermine the statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous meaning and preclude the filing of a second action. We therefore conclude that the term \u201ccommenced,\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-592 to describe an initial action that \u201chas failed ... to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a); cannot be construed to mean good, complete and sufficient service of process, as the defendant contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Although, in the present case, service of process in the original action was insufficient to meet the requirements of the applicable statute of limitations, namely, \u00a7 52-584, our decision today does not offend the general purpose of statutes of limitations because we agree with the plaintiffs that the original action was \u201ccommenced\u201d within the meaning of the savings statute when the defendant received effective notice of that action within the time period prescribed by \u00a7 52-584. In the original action, service was attempted pursuant to rule 4 (d) (2), but was insufficient because of the defendant\u2019s failure to return the waiver of formal service in accordance with her \u201cduty\u201d to avoid the unnecessary costs of the service of a summons. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (d) (2). Rule 4 (d) (2) provides that, in a federal action based on diversity of jurisdiction, any defendant who is \u201csubject to service\u201d and who \u201creceives notice of an action in the manner provided in [the rule] has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of serving the summons.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (d) (2). Under the rule, notice shall be in writing and addressed directly to the defendant, dispatched through first-class mail, or other reliable means, and accompanied by a copy of the complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (d) (2) (A) through (C). The notice shall identify the court in which it has been filed, inform the defendant of the consequences of compliance and noncompliance with the request for waiver of formal service, set forth the date on which the request is made and allow the defendant a reasonable time to return the waiver. Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>R. Civ. P. 4 (d) (2) (C) through (F). The rule further requires that the plaintiff provide the defendant with an extra copy of the notice and request for waiver and a prepaid means of compliance. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (d) (2) (G).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant does not dispute that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sent her a written request to waive the required service of process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the record contains evidence, and the defendant does not dispute, that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sent by certified mail each of the other items required under rule 4 (d) (2) to effect service of process, including the summons and complaint, two copies of the notice regarding the waiver of formal service and an envelope with sufficient postage for return of the signed waiver. Finally, the record reveals that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel received a return receipt from the United States Postal Service indicating that the items had been delivered to the defendant at her Pennsylvania home four days before the two year statute of limitations had expired. A review of the record thus discloses that, although the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not serve a formal summons upon the defendant within the time period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations, all of the requirements of rule 4 (d) (2) were satisfied and all of the necessary papers to obtain a waiver of formal service were delivered to the defendant. That the defendant failed to sign and return the waiver does not detract from the fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 original action was \u201ccommenced,\u201d for purposes of the savings statute, when the defendant received actual notice of the action within the time period prescribed by the statute of limitations. Thus, in our view, although the original action was not commenced in a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>manner under the applicable statute of limitations due to insufficient service of process, it nevertheless was commenced for purposes of the savings statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">By following the procedure set forth in rule 4 (d) (2) to obtain a waiver of formal service from the defendant, the plaintiffs, for all practical purposes, also satisfied the requirements of state law pertaining to formal service of process. In Connecticut, an action is commenced when the writ, summons and complaint have been served upon the defendant. E.g., <em>Rana </em>v. <em>Ritacco, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 337. In the present case, the summons, a copy of the complaint and a notice of the action were delivered to the defendant by certified mail four days before the expiration of the statute of limitations. Moreover, the plaintiffs filed the complaint in the District Court, as required under the federal rules, prior to the issuance of the signed and sealed summons. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (b). Accordingly, there is ample support for our conclusion that the original action was commenced in a timely manner within the meaning of the savings statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We note that, in her motion for summary judgment, the defendant did not challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the original action was dismissed because of insufficient service of process \u201cdue to unavoidable accident . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-592 (a). The defendant merely argued that her motion for summary judgment should be granted because the plaintiffs had not commenced the original action within the applicable two year- statute of limitations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In light of the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>defendant did not challenge the underlying reason for the insufficient service, the trial court did not address that issue in its memorandum of decision, but determined only that it was \u201cimpossible to conclude that the initial action was commenced . . . within the meaning of Connecticut statutes\u201d because \u201c[t]he plaintiffs never formally served the complaint on the defendant.\u201d Moreover, that issue has not been briefed on appeal to this court. Consequently, in the absence of a claim by the defendant and a trial court ruling on whether the alleged cause of the insufficient service had been proven by the plaintiffs, and in the absence of such briefing, we decline to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Relying on the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata, the defendant also argues that the plaintiffs are not entitled to \u201crelitigate\u201d the issue of whether the original action in federal court was commenced in a timely manner under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because the federal court decided that issue against them in the prior action. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u201cClaim preclusion (res judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) have been described as related ideas on a continuum. [C]laim preclusion prevents a litigant from reasserting a claim that has already been decided on the merits. . . . [I]ssue preclusion . . . prevents a party from relitigating an issue that has been determined in a prior suit. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\u201cBoth doctrines protect the finality of judicial determinations, conserve the time of the court, and prevent wasteful relitigation . . . and express no more than the fundamental principle that once a matter has been fully and fairly litigated, and finally decided, it comes to rest. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">\u201cRes judicata, or claim preclusion, is [however] distinguishable from collateral estoppel, or issue preclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>sion. Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment, when rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action . . . between the same parties or those in privity with them, upon the same claim. ... In contrast, collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating issues and facts actually and necessarily determined in an earlier proceeding between the same parties or those in privity with them upon a different claim. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u201cAn issue is actually litigated if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined. ... If an issue has been determined, but the judgment is not dependent upon the determination of the issue, the parties may relitigate the issue in a subsequent action. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\u201cTo assert successfully the doctrine of issue preclusion, therefore, a party must establish that the issue sought to be foreclosed actually was litigated and determined in the prior action between the parties or their privies, and that the determination was essential to the decision in the prior case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 364, 373-74, 727 A.2d 1245 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The defendant argues that the issues decided in the original action and the present action are the same, namely, \u201cwhether the plaintiffs commenced their initial action [in federal court] . . . before the statute of limitations expired . . . .\u201d The defendant fails to recognize, however, that the issues in the two actions are different. As we previously noted, the issue in the federal action was whether there had been effective service of process under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of bringing that action prior to the expiration of the two year statute of limitations. In contrast, the issue in the present action is whether the federal action can be deemed to have been commenced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>despite </em>insufficient service of process, for the purpose of bringing a second action for the same cause under the savings statute. The defendant thus mischaracterizes the issue in the plaintiffs\u2019 second action and, therefore, cannot prevail under the doctrine of res judicata. The defendant\u2019s claim under the doctrine of collateral estoppel also must fail because only the present action implicates the savings statute and, thus, any issue regarding the application of that statute could not have been determined in the original action. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The defendant finally argues that because the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in the present action expressly relied upon General Statutes \u00a7 52-593<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> rather than \u00a7 52-592 in seeking relief for the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries, the plaintiffs are not entitled to bring their claim under \u00a7 52-592. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The plaintiffs alleged in their present complaint that their original action \u201cwas dismissed without being tried on its merits due to insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident and the action was avoided or defeated for a matter of form. Th[e] [present] action is accordingly timely under [\u00a7] 52-593 . . . .\u201d Section 52-593 is not the accidental failure of suit statute, but contains a similar savings provision for the commencement of actions against an incorrect party. The defendant contends that, although she informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of this error when she filed her answer and special defense, the plaintiffs did not file an amended complaint to correct the mistake. The defendant concedes, however, that she acknowledged during the hearing on the summary judgment motion that she had assumed that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had intended to plead the savings statute, as \u00a7 52-593 did not apply to the facts of the case. Furthermore, there is no indication that the defendant was misled by the plaintiffs\u2019 incorrect citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The defendant nonetheless contends that the Practice Book plainly states that any statute relied upon by the plaintiffs must be specifically identified by number, and that the plaintiffs relied upon a completely different statute. Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) provides: \u201cWhen any claim made in a complaint, cross complaint, special defense, or other pleading is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number.\u201d As we previously noted, however, the defendant acknowledged at the hearing on her motion for summary judgment that she had assumed that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had intended to plead the savings statute. \u201cAs long as the defendant is sufficiently apprised of the nature of the action . . . the failure to comply with the directive of Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) will not bar recovery.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>66 Conn. App. 669, 676, 785 A.2d 1181 (2001), aff'd, 263 Conn. 22, 818 A.2d 37 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 52-123 provides that \u201c[n]o writ, pleading, judgment or any kind of proceeding in court or course of justice shall be abated, suspended, set aside or reversed for any kind of circumstantial errors, mistakes or defects, if the person and the cause may be rightly understood and intended by the court.\u201d The purpose of \u00a7 52-123 is to afford relief from defects found in the text of the writ itself. <em>Rogozinski </em>v. <em>American Food Service Equipment Corp., </em>211 Conn. 431, 434, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>559 A.2d 1110 (1989). \u201cIt is not the policy of our courts to interpret rules and statutes in so strict a manner as to deny a litigant the pursuit of its complaint for mere circumstantial defects. . . . Indeed, \u00a7 52-123 . . . protects against just such consequences, by providing that no proceeding shall be abated for circumstantial errors so long as there is sufficient notice to the parties. \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>178 Conn. 472, 477-78, 423 A.2d 141 (1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 904, 100 S. Ct. 1079, 63 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1980). The accepted policy is \u201cto bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his day in court. . . . The design of the rules of practice is both to facilitate business and to advance justice; they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice. . . . Our practice does not favor the termination of proceedings without a determination of the merits of the controversy where that can be brought about with due regard to necessary rules of procedure.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>243 Conn. 657, 665, 707 A.2d 281 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The defendant concedes that she knew of the error when she filed her answer and special defense and even informed the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of the mistake. She also concedes that her counsel acknowledged during the healing on her summary judgment motion that the plaintiffs had intended to invoke the savings statute. Moreover, the language utilized in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint follows the language of the savings statute almost verbatim. Accordingly, the record contains no evidence that the defendant lacked a proper understanding of the complaint and, consequently, could not have participated fully in the litigation for that reason.
