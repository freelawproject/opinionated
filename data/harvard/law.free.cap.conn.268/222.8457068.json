The trial court determined that, because 100 percent of the seller corporation and 55 percent of the purchaser corporation were owned by the same individual, the exemption properly had been denied. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts. On August 19, 1996, Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, whose stock was owned entirely by Frank Scoleri, sold its manufacturing machinery and equipment located in New Britain, Connecticut, to the plaintiff, Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli Kitchen, Inc., whose stock was owned by Frank Scoleri (55 percent), Carmine Scoleri (5 percent), Rosemary Scoleri (5 percent) and John Moreschi, Fred Moreschi and Glenn Moreschi (35 percent). Following that transaction, the plaintiff filed with the New Britain assessor claims for exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) from the payment of personal property taxes on the newly acquired machinery and equipment for the years 1997 and 1998. In February of 2000, the plaintiff was notified that its claims for exemptions for the 1997 and 1998 assessment years had been modified by the defendants, Marc S. Ryan, the secretary of the office of policy and management, and the office of policy and management itself,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in June of that year, the plaintiff was informed that the machinery and equipment did not qualify for the exemption for those years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>because there was a common ownership of the New Jersey and Connecticut corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 12-94b (b) (2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff challenged the denial of the exemption claim for the 1997 assessment year and requested a hearing concerning the exemption. Following a hearing before Michael J. Cicchetti, the under secretary of the intergovernmental policy division of the office of policy and management, the decision denying the exemption was upheld on the ground that the plaintiffs machinery and equipment were not newly acquired because the property had been \u201ctransfer[red] to a business organization related to or affiliated with the seller\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B). Cicchetti also upheld the denial of the plaintiffs claim for exemption for the 1998 assessment year. The plaintiff appealed both decisions to the Superior Court claiming that the defendant had not promulgated any regulations, as required by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., defining what is meant by a \u201cbusiness organization related to or affiliated with the seller,\u201d and that, by not providing a legal standard by which a business organization would be considered a \u201crelated\u201d or an \u201caffiliated\u201d entity, the plaintiff could not know what level of common stock ownership would permit a corporation to qualify for the exemption upon acquisition of machinery and equipment from another company. According to the plaintiff, the defendant relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>on guidelines issued by the defendant, effective for the October 1, 1999 grand list, which had not been adopted in accordance with the UAPA, and the defendant\u2019s failure to adopt a standard for determining whether two business entities are affiliated resulted in an arbitrary and unlawful application of \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The defendant thereafter moved for summary judgment, claiming that, because the plaintiff was related to or affiliated with Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli, Inc., it therefore was not entitled to the exemption under \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B). The plaintiff argued in response that, by not providing a legal standard by which a business organization would be considered a related or affiliated entity, the defendant\u2019s denials of the exemptions for 1997 and 1998 were improper. Additionally, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant was estopped from denying the exemptions because it had not opposed the plaintiffs exemption for the 1996 assessment year and the plaintiff was thereby led to believe that the property would qualify for the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The trial court first determined that, because \u00a7 12-94b (a) authorizes the defendant to review the property tax exemptions claimed under \u00a7 12-81 (72) annually and to exclude such property that does not qualify,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>plaintiffs claim that its exemption in 1996<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> estopped the defendant from fulfilling its statutory mandate in 1997 and 1998 must fail because it would prevent the defendant from fulfilling its function. The trial court then determined that the defendant properly applied a common understanding of the terms \u201crelated to\u201d and \u201caffiliated with\u201d to conclude that, because Frank Scoleri was a majority shareholder of both the seller and the buyer of the machinery and equipment, the corporations were affiliated and related to one another and therefore the plaintiff was disqualified from receiving the tax exemption under \u00a7 12-81 (72).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Finally, the trial court examined an amendment to \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) that was enacted while the plaintiffs appeals were pending, which amendment changed the reference to a transfer from a \u201cbusiness organization related to or affiliated with the seller\u201d to a transfer from \u201ca seller to a related business\u201d and defined \u201crelated business\u201d as a \u201ccorporation . . . that is in control of the taxpayer,\u201d with control meaning \u201cownership, directly or indirectly, of stock possessing fifty per cent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the stock . . . .\u201d Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-6, \u00a7 83.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court rejected the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tiffs claim that the amendment was new legislation that should have no retroactive effect on its 1997 and 1998 claims for exemption. Rather, the trial court considered the amendment to be a clarification, consistent with this court\u2019s determination in <em>Yanow </em>v. <em>Teal Industries, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 262, 283, 422 A.2d 311 (1979), that \u201ccontrol of a corporation exists when one holds a majority of the shares of the corporation\u201d and, therefore, the court determined that the amendment was supportive of the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B). Accordingly, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment and dismissed both appeals. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) was correct. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the defendant improperly relied on a set of guidelines that had not been adopted in accordance with the statutory procedure for the adoption of regulations. According to the plaintiff, the defendant adopted a substantive rule or regulation without following the statutory procedure for adoption of regulations pursuant to the UAPA. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-168. The plaintiff also claims that the defendant improperly failed to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>vide a standard by which a business organization could know what level of common stock ownership would permit it to qualify for an exemption upon its acquisition of machinery and equipment from another company. Finally, the plaintiff claims that the amendment to \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B), providing a definition of \u201crelated business\u201d that would include the transaction at issue in the present case, was a substantive change that could not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In response, the defendant asserts that the trial court properly interpreted \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) and that Frank Scoleri\u2019s ownership of 100 percent of the seller corporation and 55 percent of the purchasing corporation made the organizations \u201crelated to or affiliated with\u201d each other under the statute. The defendant relies on the trial court\u2019s determinations that \u201c[t]he plaintiff does not qualify for the exemption under \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) as it was worded at the time of the transfer or after it was amended by Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-6, \u00a7 83.\u201d We agree with the defendant that the trial court correctly rejected the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had violated the UAPA when it properly interpreted the term \u201crelated to or affiliated with\u201d as used in \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Our determination is guided by several well settled principles. \u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>265 Conn. 579, 588, 830 A.2d 164 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>258 Conn. 733, 741, 785 A.2d 197 (2001). We note that our legislature recently has enacted the method of interpretation by which this court is to interpret statutes when the text is plain and unambiguous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the parties in the present case do not claim that the relevant statutory text, along with the relationship of that text to other statutes, is plain and unambiguous, our analysis is not limited by this new legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We also note that, because we are dealing with an issue of tax exemption, we are guided by additional specific standards. \u201cThe general rule of construction in taxation cases is that provisions granting a tax exemption are to be construed strictly against the party claiming the exemption. . . . Exemptions, no matter how meritorious, are of grace, and must be strictly construed. They embrace only what is strictly within their terms. . . . [Moreover] [w]e strictly construe such statutory exemptions because [exemption from taxation is the equivalent of an appropriation of public funds, because the burden of the tax is lifted from the back of the potential taxpayer who is exempted and shifted to the backs of [other taxpayers]. . . . The owners of tax-exempt property in the community derive the same benefits from government as other property owners but pay no property taxes for those benefits.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fanny J. Crosby Memorial, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>262 Conn. 213, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>220, 811 A.2d 1277 (2002). With these principles in mind, we turn to the merits of the plaintiffs claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As with any issue of statutory construction, we begin with the pertinent language of the statute. At the time of the plaintiffs applications, the statutory language provided in relevant part that \u201c[m]achinery or equipment that was exempt under this subdivision for a five-year term or a portion thereof shall not be eligible for exemption upon transfer to a business organization related to or affiliated with the seller . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 12-81 (72) (b); see footnote 2 of this opinion. In the absence of a statutory definition of the meaning of \u201crelated to\u201d or \u201caffiliated with,\u201d we look to the common understanding of these words and their dictionary definitions. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 33, 699 A.2d 101 (1997); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981); <em>Ziperstein </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 493, 500, 423 A.2d 129 (1979); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2000) \u00a7 47.07, p. 235; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The most apt dictionary definitions of the relevant words, as used in the context of this statute, are as follows. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201caffiliate\u201d as \u201ca company effectively controlled by another or associated with others under common ownership or control . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) defines \u201caffiliate\u201d as \u201c[a] corporation that is related to another corporation by shareholdings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>or other means of control; a subsidiary, parent, or sibling corporation.\u201d \u201cControl\u201d as a noun is defined as \u201c [t]he direct or indirect power to direct the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise; the power or authority to manage, direct, or oversee . . . .\u201d Id. As a verb, control is defined as \u201c[t]o have a controlling interest in . . . .\u201d Id. These definitions are consistent with how this court has construed corporate control. See <em>Yanow </em>v. <em>Teal Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 178 Conn. 283 (corporate majority shareholder of corporation has right to control). Finally, \u201crelated\u201d is defined as \u201chaving relationship: connected by reason of an established or discoverable relation . . . Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The common meaning of these terms clearly falls within the meaning applied by the defendant and construed by the trial court. Frank Scoleri owned 100 percent of the selling corporation and 55 percent of the purchasing corporation. Therefore, he had control over both companies. As a matter of common sense and common meaning, this common ownership of the majority of stock in both companies made the sale of the machinery ineligible for the exemption as a \u201ctransfer to a business organization related to or affiliated with the seller\u201d under \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B). Therefore, the trial court properly concluded that in deciding this case, the defendant merely was fulfilling its statutory obligation under \u00a7 12-94b (a) to review property tax exemption claims under \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) annually and to interpret and apply \u00a7 12-81 (72) (B) to the plaintiffs situation. See <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission., </em>249 Conn. 296, 317, 732 A.2d 144 (1999) (\u201cadministrative agencies must necessarily interpret statutes which are made for their guidance and they may do so without reference to regulations\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cTo rule otherwise would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>be to ignore the subtle and intricate interaction of law and fact. It is inherent in our judicial system of dispute resolution that the interpretation of statutes, like the development of the common law, grows out of the filtering of a set of facts through the law, as seen by the administrator or judge. The result of this application is a hybrid, composed in part of fact, in part of law, which by its existence contributes to the interpretation of a statute.\u201d <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 356-57, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the defendant should be estopped from denying the property tax exemption for 1997 and 1998 because the plaintiff had received the exemption provided for in \u00a7 12-81 (72) in 1996. The following additional facts are pertinent to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In its administrative appeal, the plaintiff alleged that on August 19, 1996, it had \u201cacquired the property and equipment [that] are the subject of this appeal from Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli, Inc., a New Jersey corporation,\u201d and had \u201creceived the exemption provided for in . . . \u00a7 12-81 (72) for the 1996 assessment year.\u201d In connection with its motions for summary judgment, the defendant submitted an affidavit of Sandra M. Huber, a planning specialist employed by the defendant who was responsible for administering the program charged with reviewing the claims for tax exemption for new or newly-acquired manufacturing machinery and equipment. Pursuant to a request by the defendant, Huber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>examined the defendant\u2019s records pertaining to its 1996 filings and found that no claims for a property tax exemption had been made by the plaintiff for the year' 1996 and that, in the absence of a claim, the plaintiff did not qualify for a tax exemption. Additionally, Huber stated in her affidavit that her responsibilities included reviewing and responding to all written correspondence as well as all verbal, telephone and e-mail inquiries regarding the applicability of the property tax exemption for manufacturing machinery and equipment, and that she had conducted a review of all such communication relating to the applicability of the exemption and found no inquiries from any persons in connection with the machinery at issue in the present case prior to 1999. The plaintiff presented no affidavits stating that it had claimed a property tax exemption for 1996, that the New Britain assessor had granted the exemption or that the plaintiff had received the exemption for 1996. Therefore, the only facts before the trial court were that the defendant had no record of receipt of any claim for a property tax exemption or any inquiry regarding such an exemption for any year prior to 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We recently had the opportunity to discuss the doctrine of equitable estoppel and the associated burdens of proof. \u201cThe party claiming estoppel . . . has the burden of proof. . . . Whether that burden has been met is a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. ... A court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous only in cases in which the record contains no evidence to support it, or in cases in which there <em>is </em>evidence, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . The legal conclusions of the trial court will stand, however, only if they are legally and logically correct and are consistent with the facts of the case. . . . Accordingly, we will reverse the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding estoppel only if they involve an erroneous application of the law. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u201cStrong public policies have long formed the basis of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The office of an equitable estoppel is to show what equity and good conscience require, under the particular circumstances of the case, irrespective of what might otherwise be the legal rights of the parties. ... No one is ever estopped from asserting what would otherwise be his right, unless to allow its assertion would enable him to do a wrong. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u201cThere are two essential elements to an estoppel: the party must do or say something which is intended or calculated to induce another to believe in the existence of certain facts and to act upon that belief; and the other party, influenced thereby, must actually change his position or do something to his injury which he otherwise would not have done. Estoppel rests on the misleading conduct of one party to the prejudice of the other. In the absence of prejudice, estoppel does not exist.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>W. </em>v. <em>W., </em>256 Conn. 657, 660-62, 779 A.2d 716 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In the present case, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment, rejecting the plaintiffs claim of estoppel based upon its conclusion that, when it denied the plaintiffs application for an exemption, the defendant was acting as a public agency in the performance of its governmental function. <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 146, 527 A.2d 679 (1987) (\u201cas a general rule, estoppel may not be invoked against a public agency in the exercise of its governmental functions\u201d). The trial court did not make any findings regarding reliance by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>only pertinent factual statement in connection to the estoppel claim is the trial court\u2019s improper finding that \u201c[w]hen the plaintiff purchased the machinery and equipment at issue from Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli, Inc., the New Jersey corporation, on August 19, 1996, the plaintiff claimed an exemption from the payment of personal property taxes for newly acquired equipment. The New Britain assessor granted, and the plaintiff received, an exemption from personal property taxes for the 1996 assessment year.\u201d See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Our standards governing our review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well settled. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 384 [now \u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995). In deciding amotion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . Id., 745. The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law; <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Practice Book \u00a7 381 [now \u00a7 17-46]. . . . <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>229 Conn. 99, 105, 639 A.2d 507 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 374, 380-81, 713 A.2d 820 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The plaintiffs reliance on equitable estoppel as a basis for challenging the trial court\u2019s grant of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>judgment is misplaced.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> First, as the defendant points out, there was no support for the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had applied for, had qualified for, or had been granted or denied a property tax exemption for 1996. Although we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the plaintiffs failure to oppose the Huber affidavit, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-45,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is fatal. Second, equitable estoppel is concerned with actions by one party that induce a faulty reliance by the other party. <em>Celentano </em>v. <em>Oaks Condominium Assn., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 614-15. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant misled the plaintiff or behaved in a manner that would have encouraged the plaintiff to rely to its detriment on the defendant\u2019s actions or words.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor is there any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>evidence that the plaintiff changed its position in reliance on any action by the taxing authority or the defendant. As we have stated, Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly rejected the plaintiffs theory of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\"> These cases were tried together before <em>Hon.

The plaintiff filed a separate appeal from those judgments to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court, sua sponte, ordered that the two appeals be consolidated for purposes of argument and preparation of the record only. Thereafter, we transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 12-81 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following-described property shall be exempt from taxation . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201c(72) . . .

If title to such equipment is held by a person other than the person claiming the exemption, the claimant shall include on his application information as to the portion of the total acquisition cost incurred by him, and on or before the first day of November in such year, the person holding title to such machinery and equipment shall file a list of such machinery with the assessor of the municipality in which the manufacturing facility of the claimant is located. Such person shall include on the list information as to the portion of the total acquisition cost incurred by him. Commercial or financial information in any application or list filed under this section shall not be open for public inspection, provided such information is given in confidence and is not available to the public from any other source. The provisions of this subdivision regarding the filing of lists and information shall not supersede the requirements to file tax lists under sections 12-42, 12-43, 12-57a and 12-59. In substantiation of such claim, the claimant and the person holding title to machinery and equipment for which exemption is claimed shall present to the assessor or board of assessors such supporting documentation as said secretary may require, including, but not limited to, invoices, bills of sale, contracts for lease and bills of lading. Failure to file such application in this manner and form within the time limit prescribed shall constitute a waiver of the right to such exemption for such assessment year, unless an extension of time is allowed by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management as set forth in section 12-81k and upon payment of the required fee for late filing. If title to exempt machinery is conveyed subsequent to October first in any assessment year, entitlement to such exemption shall terminate for the next assessment year and there shall be no pro rata application of the exemption unless such machinery or equipment continues to be leased by the manufacturer who claimed and was approved for the exemption in the previous assessment year. Machinery or equipment that was exempt under this subdivision for a five-year term or a portion thereof shall not be eligible for exemption upon transfer to a business organization related to or affiliated with the seller . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>All references herein to \u00a7 12-81 (72) are to the 1997 revision.

The New Britain assessor granted, and the plaintiff received, an exemption from personal property taxes for the 1996 assessment year.\u201d According to the defendant, this finding is unsupported in the record. We agree and therefore reject the plaintiffs claim of estoppel. See part II of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> The amendment provides in relevant part: \u201cFor the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018related business\u2019 means: (i) A corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or trust controlled by the taxpayer; (ii) an individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or trust that is in control of the taxpayer; (iii) a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or trust controlled by an individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or trust that is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>control of the taxpayer; or (iv) a member of the same controlled group as the taxpayer.

Our resolution of the plaintiffs claim on the alternate grounds for affirmance raised by the defendant is not a repudiation of the trial court\u2019s determination. Rather than engage in a lengthy discussion of the law involving governmental agencies and discretionary activities, we affirm the trial court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs estoppel claim based on the lack of any supporting evidence necessary as a factual predicate. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeLoreto, </em>265 Conn. 145, 153, 827 A.2d 671 (2003) (\u201c[w]here the trial court reaches a correct decision but on [mistaken] grounds, this court has repeatedly sustained the trial court\u2019s action if proper grounds exist to support it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 17-45 provides in relevant part: \u201cA motion for summary judgment shall be supported by such documents as may be appropriate, including but not limited to affidavits, certified transcripts of testimony under oath, disclosures, written admissions and the like. . . .

Our review of \u00a7 12-412 (62), however, reveals that its subject matter\u2014sales and use tax liability for services rendered between parent companies and wholly owned subsidiaries\u2014is wholly irrelevant to the issue of whether the plaintiff would qualify for an exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>on newly acquired manufacturing machinery and equipment it purchased from Lombardo\u2019s Ravioli, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
