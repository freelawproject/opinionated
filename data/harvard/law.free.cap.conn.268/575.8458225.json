On April 12, 2000, the sheriffs office of Shelby County, Tennessee notified the Stamford police department that it had intercepted a Federal Express parcel containing approximately twenty-seven pounds of marijuana, and that the parcel was addressed to a \u201cSylvia Sloan\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at 16 Lipton Place in Stamford. On the basis of this information, the Stamford police surveilled the designated residence and observed that it appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>be a multifamily house.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Police department records revealed that in February, 2000, officers had responded to a call at that address concerning a domestic disturbance involving the defendant and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The following morning, the police took possession of the parcel from the Stamford Federal Express office, and a field test revealed that its contents were, in fact, marijuana. They then replaced approximately five pounds of the marijuana in the box and resealed it for delivery. Later that morning, working with the statewide narcotics task force, the police conducted a \u201ccontrolled delivery\u201d of the parcel to 16 Lipton Place. Police officers surveilled the residence from vantage points approximately fifty to sixty feet away while a task force member, Detective Frederick Caruso, delivered the parcel. Caruso, dressed in a Federal Express coat and carrying the parcel and a pad of delivery invoices, rang the doorbell for the first floor apartment and knocked on the front door. The defendant opened the door. In response to Caruso\u2019s questions, the defendant verified the address and told him that his name was Michael Spencer and that he lived on the second floor. When Caruso told him that the delivery was for \u201cSylvia Sloan\u201d the defendant repeated the name to himself, and then told Caruso that he would accept the package. The defendant signed the delivery invoice, took possession of the parcel and went inside and closed the front door. As Caruso walked away, the defendant came back outside, without the parcel, and looked up and down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">At this point, police sergeant Eugene Dohmann, and police officers Larry Eisenstein, Douglas Robinson and Wayne Scutari, approached the residence and encoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tered the defendant in the front doorway. They identified themselves as police officers and brought the defendant into the first floor common hallway, where they observed that the Federal Express parcel had been placed on a shelf. The officers then read the defendant his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights and placed him under arrest. The defendant denied knowledge of the contents of the parcel or of anybody named Sylvia Sloan, and he claimed that he innocently had accepted the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">From the bottom of a stairway of approximately twelve to fourteen steps leading up to the second floor, the officers could see that the door to the defendant\u2019s apartment was ajar. Eisenstein asked the defendant if anybody else was inside the apartment, and received no response. Eisenstein and Robinson subsequently ascended the stairs and entered the defendant\u2019s apartment. In the defendant\u2019s bedroom, they observed, in plain view on top of the defendant\u2019s bed, a homemade \u201ccrack\u201d pipe and a dinner plate containing crack cocaine residue, as well as a rolled up $1 bill containing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The defendant subsequently was charged with possession of one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and possession of narcotics in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>violation of \u00a7 21a-279 (a). See footnote 2 of this opinion. At trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence of crack cocaine seized from his apartment on the ground that the evidence had been obtained illegally as the result of an unconstitutional warrantless search.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court conducted a full evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress, during which Dohmann, Eisenstein, Robinson and Scutari testified for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Dohmann testified that the defendant was \u201ckind of reluctant\u201d to tell the officers whether anybody else was in his apartment. According to Dohmann, the defendant \u201cwas a bit nervous,\u201d and the officers feared that he may have been \u201chiding something\u201d from them. Therefore, the officers decided to enter the apartment \u201cto make sure no further evidence was being destroyed or possibly other people involved that may [be] escaping.\u201d They also were concerned for their safety. Dohmann explained that weapons often are involved \u201cin that type of business ... to prevent being detained or being arrested,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not unusual for narcotics and weapons to be found in the same building and we wanted to make sure there [were] no weapons and more importantly nobody up there to use those weapons.\u201d He further testified: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was just a coincidence that this package was being delivered there. So, it was our belief that there was somebody in that apartment and we didn\u2019t really expect the package to come back to the name on the package [because] it\u2019s not typically done that way for obvious reasons. So, we expected somebody was in that apartment that was expecting a large amount of marijuana and with that we\u2019re feeling there\u2019s a drug dealer in that apartment. And, if there\u2019s a drug dealer in that apartment, we don\u2019t know who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>he is and he could very well be armed.\u201d In addition, Dohmann testified that he had, in \u201cmany\u201d situations involving arrests outside of apartments, entered those apartments without warrants to search for weapons or to prevent destruction of evidence. According to Dohmann, this practice was \u201cstandard procedure\u201d because \u201c[t]he safety of the officers is paramount and there\u2019s times when you just can\u2019t wait. You have to do what you have to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On cross-examination, Dohmann acknowledged that the investigation prior to the controlled delivery had not revealed that anybody named Sloan was living at 16 Lipton Place. He also acknowledged that his investigation had not revealed any indication that any individual living at that address might be armed or involved in the drug trade. Finally, defense counsel questioned Dohmann concerning the officers\u2019 decision to enter the defendant\u2019s apartment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cQ. There came a time when you went up the stairs to go into [the defendant\u2019s] home\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cA. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cQ. \u2014and again, you had a suspicion that there were\u2014you had a suspicion that there could be somebody armed upstairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">\u201cA. A suspicion? I wouldn\u2019t say a suspicion but we had to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">\u201cQ. A hunch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">\u201cA. Our suspic\u2014not a hunch. Just, you don\u2019t even think about it. You just have to eliminate\u2014we have to eliminate the possibility so we went up there with the possibility of that being there and we didn\u2019t want to be surprised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">Eisenstein testified that he had observed that the defendant\u2019s door was approximately six inches ajar. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>asked the defendant \u201cseveral times\u201d whether anybody was in the apartment, and received no response. Therefore, he and Robinson performed a \u201cprotective search\u201d of the defendant\u2019s apartment. According to Eisenstein, they did not look in any drawers, and their search was limited to places \u201cwhere you might find people, human beings.\u201d Finally, he testified that he had performed protective sweeps \u201con numerous occasions under similar circumstances.\u201d On cross-examination, Eisenstein acknowledged that the investigation leading up to the controlled delivery of the package had not indicated that there were any armed and dangerous people living at 16 Lipton Place. He also stated that, at that time, he had not been aware of anybody in the \u201cimmediate area\u201d of that residence who might have been \u201cthat magnitude of a marijuana dealer.\u201d In addition, Eisenstein stated: \u201cI felt that . . . the only apartment under question here was the second floor apartment belonging to [the defendant] and that the other apartments didn\u2019t really come into play in the investigation. And, it appeared from . . . the house, there was no other noise. Nobody came out of their doors to see what was going on or anything else. So, my assumption was that he was the only one at home at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Finally, Robinson testified for the state that he personally had conducted \u201chundreds\u201d of protective sweeps, and \u201cnumerous\u201d protective sweeps in situations wherein an individual had been arrested outside of an apartment. Scutari testified that the area surrounding 16 Lipton Place was known for a high level of drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In oral argument before the trial court on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the state argued that the warrantless search was justified because the defendant had accepted a substantial amount of marijuana, the door to his apartment was ajar and he would not answer the officers\u2019 questions concerning whether anybody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>else was in his apartment. According to the state, \u201cthe law allows for [a protective sweep] . . . where you have a quick sequence of events and the officers are concerned for their safety and they want to prevent [the destruction of] evidence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The defendant argued, in response, that the evidence should be suppressed because it had been obtained via a warrantless search without exigent circumstances, in violation of both the federal and state constitutions. The defendant recognized <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 327, 110 S. Ct. 1093, 108 L. Ed. 2d 276 (1990), wherein the United States Supreme Court held that a protective sweep of an arrestee\u2019s home may be constitutional in some situations, but he argued that <em>Buie </em>was distinguishable because the officers in that case had been armed with an arrest warrant, and they had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that an armed accomplice may have been hiding in the arrestee\u2019s house. The defendant indicated that neither of these elements was fulfilled in the present case and, therefore, <em>Buie </em>did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The trial court, relying on <em>Buie, </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. In a written articulation, the court stated the factual grounds underlying its decision: \u201c[Sergeant] Dohmann of the Stamford police [department] said that the defendant . . . was questioned and asked, who was in there and didn\u2019t answer. Police officers decided to go in for the purpose to search for weapons or people in the attic\u2014the apartment, safety of officers paramount. . . . Officer Eisenstein said that he participated in a protective search of the property, which was a limited search, which he had done many times before. He and Officer Robinson did a protective sweep. Officer Robinson stated that he had participated in protective sweeps hundreds of times before.\u201d The trial court thereafter admitted into evidence the narcotics and drug paraphernalia seized from the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>apartment. The jury returned a verdict finding the defendant not guilty of possession with intent to sell of one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance, and guilty of possession of narcotics. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [Wjhere the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Betances, </em>265 Conn. 493, 500, 828 A. 2d 1248 (2003). In the present case, the trial court, citing <em>Buie, </em>determined, as a matter of law, that the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s apartment was supported by \u201ca reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d Therefore, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of constitutional law that searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions. . . . The fourth amendment\u2019s requirement that a warrant issue from a neutral and detached judicial officer rests upon the desirability of having magistrates rather than police officers determine when searches and seizures are permissible and what limitations should be placed upon such activities. . . . [H]owever, the fourth amendment proscribes only unreasonable searches and seizures, and there will be occasions when, given probable cause to search, resort to the judicial process will not be required of law enforcement officers. Thus, where exigent circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>stances exist that make the procurement of a search warrant unreasonable in light of the dangers involved ... a warrant will not be required. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 151-52, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981); see <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969) (possible harm to police officer constitutes reasonable cause for warrantless search).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cOur past cases indicate . . . that protection of police and others can justify protective searches when police have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses a danger . . . and that danger may arise from the possible presence of weapons in the area surrounding a suspect. These principles compel our conclusion that [a warrantless search], limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons. See <em>Terry </em>[v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968)]. [T]he issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger. Id., [27]. ... If, while conducting a legitimate <em>Terry </em>search . . . the officer should, as here, discover . . . weapons, he clearly cannot be required to ignore the [weapons], and the Fourth Amendment does not require [their] suppression in such circumstances. . . . <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1049-50, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>259 Conn. 374, 400-401, 788 A.2d 1221, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 836, 123 S. Ct. 152, 154 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>In <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 327, the United States Supreme Court addressed the \u201clevel of justification . . . required by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments before police officers, while effecting the arrest of a suspect in his home pursuant to an arrest warrant, may conduct a warrantless protective sweep of all orpart of the premises.\u201d In <em>Buie, </em>an arrest warrant had been issued for the defendant and his suspected accomplice following an armed robbery that had been committed by two men. Id., 328. When the police went to the defendant\u2019s house to execute the warrant, the defendant was in the basement. He emerged from the basement peacefully, and the police arrested him. Id. One of the officers then entered the basement to determine whether anybody else was there and he observed certain incriminating evidence in plain view. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and he was convicted of the crimes charged. The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of conviction, concluding that a protective sweep must be supported by \u201cprobable cause to believe that a serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger exists.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buie </em>v. <em>State, </em>314 Md. 151, 159-60, 550 A.2d 79 (1988). The Court of Appeals further concluded that the state had not satisfied that probable cause requirement. Id., 165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Following its grant of the state\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari; <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>490 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 2447, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1001 (1989); the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment, concluding that the probable cause requirement imposed by the Maryland Court of Appeals was \u201can unnecessarily strict Fourth Amendment standard,\u201d and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 337. Drawing upon its earlier decisions in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Long, </em>which had authorized limited frisks for weapons in the interest of officer safety, the court recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201can analogous interest of the officers in taking steps to assure themselves that the house in which a suspect is being, or has just been, arrested is not harboring other persons who are dangerous and who could unexpectedly launch an attack.\u201d Id., 333. The court further explained: \u201cThe risk of danger in the context of an arrest in the home is as great as, if not greater than, it is in an on-the-street or roadside investigatory encounter. A <em>Terry ox Long </em>frisk occurs before a police-citizen confrontation has escalated to the point of arrest. A protective sweep, in contrast, occurs as an adjunct to the serious step of taking a person into custody for the purpose of prosecuting him for a crime. Moreover, unlike an encounter on the street or along a highway, an in-home arrest puts the officer at the disadvantage of being on his adversary\u2019s \u2018turf.\u2019 An ambush in a confined setting of unknown configuration is more to be feared than it is in open, more familiar surroundings.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Recognizing the often competing interests of the individual\u2019s expectation of privacy and the officers\u2019 safety, the court therefore determined that there were two levels of protective sweeps. Concerning the first tier of protective sweeps, the court concluded that \u201cas an incident to the arrest the officers could, as a precautionary matter and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the place of arrest from which an attack could be immediately launched.\u201d Id., 334. Concerning the second tier of protective sweeps, the court concluded: \u201cBeyond that ... we hold that there must be articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d Id. The court further emphasized that a protective sweep \u201cmay extend only to a cursory inspection of those spaces where a person may be found\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>id., 335; and \u201clasts no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger and in any event no longer than it takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises.\u201d Id., 335-36. Guided by the principles enunciated in <em>Buie, </em>we now turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The defendant first contends that <em>Buie </em>is inapplicable to the present case because the rule of <em>Buie </em>was \u201cintended\u201d for circumstances wherein a person has been arrested inside his home, pursuant to an arrest warrant. Essentially, the defendant urges us to adopt a per se rule that protective sweeps are unreasonable when, as here, they are incident to a <em>warrantless </em>arrest conducted <em>outside </em>of the arrestee\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Although the United States Supreme Court never has ruled on the constitutionality of a protective sweep of a home, incident to an arrest occurring just outside that home, the federal courts that have addressed the issue uniformly have held that the reasoning of <em>Buie </em>applies to that situation. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cavely, </em>318 F.3d 987, 995 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 960, 123 S. Ct. 2653, 156 L. Ed. 2d 659 (2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>306 F.3d 231, 238 (5th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1240, 123 S. Ct. 1371, 155 L. Ed. 2d 211 (2003); <em>Sharrar </em>v. <em>Felsing, </em>128 F.3d 810, 823-24 (3d Cir. 1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>76 F.3d 773, 776-77 (6th Cir. 1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>48 F.3d 1282, 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1995); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 446-47 (2d Cir. 1990); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kimmons, </em>965 F.2d 1001, 1004, 1009-10 (11th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1086, 113 S. Ct. 1065, 122 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1993), cert. granted and judgment vacated on other grounds, <em>Small </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 U.S. 902, 113 S. Ct. 2326, 124 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1993), judgment reinstated, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kimmons, </em>1 F.3d 1144 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 48 F.3d 1284, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>bia Circuit explained: \u201cAlthough <em>Buie </em>concerned an arrest made in the home, the principles enunciated by the [United States] Supreme Court are fully applicable where, as here, the arrest takes place just outside the residence. . . . That the police arrested the defendant outside rather than inside his dwelling is relevant to the question of whether they could reasonably fear an attack by someone within it. The officers\u2019 exact location, however, does not change the nature of the appropriate inquiry: Did articulable facts exist that would lead a reasonably prudent officer to believe a sweep was required to protect the safety of those on the arrest scene?\u201d (Citations omitted.) Furthermore, we recognize that <em>Buie </em>was grounded in the principle that arresting officers have an immediate interest \u201cin taking steps to assure themselves that the house in which a suspect is being, or has just been, arrested is not harboring other persons who are dangerous and who could unexpectedly launch an attack.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 333. This important safety interest is not diminished simply because the arrest has occurred just outside of the home. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>supra, 76 F.3d 776 (\u201cin some circumstances, an arrest taking place just outside a home may pose an equally serious threat to the arresting officers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Moreover, although the arrest in <em>Buie </em>was effectuated pursuant to an arrest warrant, the United States Supreme Court did not base its decision upon this fact. Indeed, the interest of police officers in protecting their own safety, and the safety of others, is certainly no less when they arrest a suspect without an arrest warrant. We are aware of no court that has concluded that a protective sweep was unreasonable simply because the accompanying arrest had been effectuated without an arrest warrant. Indeed, some courts expressly have upheld a protective sweep as reasonable under such circumstances. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>948, 949-50 (8th Cir. 1999) (police chased fleeing defendant into apartment building and arrested him without arrest warrant; protective sweep of building reasonable); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kimmons, </em>supra, 965 F.2d 1008-1009 (protective sweep of arrestee\u2019s home reasonable after warrantless arrest just outside of home). We do not believe that <em>Buie </em>was intended to preclude the police from conducting an otherwise reasonable protective search of a home simply because an arrest has occurred just outside the home or without an arrest warrant. Therefore, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the boundaries of <em>Buie </em>are so narrowly defined and, accordingly, we decline to adopt such a limited bright-line rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The defendant next claims that the warrantless search of his apartment cannot be justified as either a first tier or second tier protective sweep under <em>Buie. </em>The state contends, in response, that the search constituted a permissible protective sweep under either prong of the <em>Buie </em>analysis. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Within the first tier of protective sweeps, arresting officers can, \u201cas a precautionary matter and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces <em>immediately adjoining </em>the place of arrest from which an attack could be immediately launched.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 334. In the present case, the defendant was arrested in a first floor common hallway at the bottom of a stairway of approximately twelve to fourteen steps leading up to his second floor apartment. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s apartment cannot be characterized as a space \u201cimmediately adjoining\u201d the place of the arrest. The state nevertheless contends that the search was justifiable as a first tier protective sweep because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s apartment was at the top of a short stairway, probably only eight to ten feet away and clearly analogous to the stairway leading down into the base<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ment in <em>Buie.\u201d </em>This comparison to <em>Buie </em>is of little moment, however, because the search in that case was not upheld as a valid first tier protective sweep. Rather, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the Maryland Court of Appeals for a determination of whether the search could be justified as a second tier protective sweep\u2014that is, whether \u201cthe searching officer possesse[d] a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbor[ed] an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 337; see also id. (Stevens, J., concurring) (on remand, \u201cit is the State\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the officers had a reasonable basis for believing\u201d that third party in basement might attack them or otherwise interfere with arrest).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore must determine whether the search in the present case was justifiable as a second tier protective sweep.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Sharrar </em>v. <em>Felsing, </em>supra, 128 F.3d 824 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>(\u201ca sweep incident to an arrest occurring just outside the home must be analyzed under the second prong of the <em>Buie </em>analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The second tier of protective sweeps under <em>Buie </em>encompasses searches of areas beyond those spaces immediately adjoining the place of arrest. To satisfy the fourth amendment, a second tier protective sweep must be supported by \u201carticulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 334. In this case, because the defendant was in custody, the focus of our inquiry is \u201cwhether the arresting officers reasonably believed that <em>someone else inside the [home] </em>might pose a danger to them.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>supra, 76 F.3d 777; see also <em>Sharrar </em>v. <em>Felsing, </em>supra, 128 F.3d 825 (possible presence of third party in arrestee\u2019s home is \u201ctouchstone\u201d of protective sweep analysis). In other words, we examine whether there were \u201cspecific and articulable facts showing that another individual, who posed a danger to the officers or others,\u201d was inside the apartment at the time of the arrest. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chaves, </em>169 F.3d 687, 692 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1048, 120 S. Ct. 585, 145 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1999); see also <em>Sharrar </em>v. <em>Felsing, </em>supra, 824 (\u201c[i]f the search goes beyond the immediate adjoining areas, there must be \u2018articulable facts\u2019 which would warrant a reasonably prudent officer to believe that there are individuals who pose a danger in other areas of the house\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cLack of information [concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>presence of a third party] cannot provide an articulable basis upon which to justify a protective sweep.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>supra, 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The trial court in the present case determined that a warrantless search was justified because the defendant had not responded to the officers\u2019 questions concerning whether anybody else was in his apartment, and also because the officers had conducted \u201cnumerous\u201d or \u201chundreds\u201d of protective sweeps on prior occasions. Neither of these facts is sufficiently specific and articulable to support a reasonable belief that the defendant\u2019s apartment harbored a third party posing a danger to those on the arrest scene. The defendant\u2019s failure to respond to the officers\u2019 questions may have stemmed from a desire to invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights. \u201cThe <em>Miranda </em>tenets \u2018require that a person taken into custody be advised immediately that he has the right to remain silent, [and] that anything he says may be used against him .... Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 710, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992), quoting <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976). Therefore, the defendant\u2019s silence, standing alone, is of minimal value to our inquiry. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>937 F.2d 1287, 1291 (7th Cir. 1991) (arrestee had been seen in presence of murder suspect, opened door with gun <em>and </em>failed to answer officers\u2019 questions concerning other people in house; \u201cin our opinion, the officers would have been entitled to sweep the house even if [the arrestee] said that no one else was home\u201d). Furthermore, the fact that the officers had conducted numerous protective sweeps on prior occasions as a matter of \u201cstandard procedure\u201d provides no basis to support a reasonable belief that a protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sweep was necessary on <em>this </em>particular occasion. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>69 F. Sup. 2d 925, 931 (E.D. Mich. 1999) (protective sweep conducted \u201cas a matter of course\u201d unreasonable under <em>Buie); State </em>v. <em>Estep, </em>753 N.E.2d 22, 28 (Ind. App. 2001) (warrantless search following arrest inside home unreasonable when conducted pursuant to \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">At the suppression hearing, the officers testified that they had been unfamiliar with the defendant prior to their surveillance of his residence. They were unaware of whether he had any accomplices, and their investigation revealed no persons living at that address who may have been armed or involved in the drug trade.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 306 F.3d 239 (arrestee suspected of armed assault had unknown accomplice who also had been armed); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>70 F.3d 913, 916 (6th Cir. 1995) (officers had received information that another person would be meeting defendant at motel room and officers knew arrestee had been arrested on two previous occasions in presence of someone possessing firearm), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1139, 116 S. Ct. 971, 133 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 48 F.3d 1284 (informant had advised police that arrestee\u2019s \u201c \u2018boys\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018counterparts\u2019 \u201d might be with him); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kimmons, </em>supra, 965 F.2d 1009 (arresting agents had knowledge of conspirator whose identity and whereabouts were unknown); <em>Buie </em>v. <em>State, </em>320 Md. 696, 705, 580 A.2d 167 (1990) (arrestee had suspected accomplice who also had been armed), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1106, 111 S. Ct. 1011, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1094 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Furthermore, the officers\u2019 testimony reveals that they had no information that any person who posed a threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>to the officers or to others might have been in the apartment at that time. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cavely, </em>supra, 318 F.3d 996 (entiy and visual search of house was reasonable when arrestee had told officers \u201c \u2018a friend\u2019 \u201d was inside his house, but friend did not appear or answer when officers knocked on front door, and prior search of residence had discovered firearms); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>supra, 70 F.3d 916 (protective sweep of motel room reasonable when officers had received information that another person would be meeting arrestee there). Dohmann testified that he had expected that an armed drug dealer would be in the apartment because he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was just a coincidence that this package was being delivered there.\u201d On cross-examination, Dohmann acknowledged that this expectation was not a \u201csuspicion\u201d\u2014rather, the officers entered the apartment because \u201cwe have to eliminate the possibility ... of that being there and we didn\u2019t want to be surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The generalized <em>possibility </em>that an unknown, armed person may be lurking is not, however, an articulable fact sufficient to justify a protective sweep. Indeed, nearly every arrest involving a large quantity of drugs, in or just outside of ahorne, carries the same possibility. To allow the police to justify a warrantless search based solely upon that possibility would threaten to swallow the general rule requiring search warrants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201callowing the police to conduct protective sweeps whenever they do not know whether anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>else is inside a home creates an incentive for the police to stay ignorant as to whether or not anyone else is inside a house in order to conduct a protective sweep.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>supra, 76 F.3d 778. The officers\u2019 lack of information \u201ccannot be an articulable basis for a sweep that requires information to justify it in the first place.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we conclude that, based on the totality of all the facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s apartment was not a justifiable protective sweep under <em>Buie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We disagree with the state\u2019s contention that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oguns, </em>supra, 921 F.2d 446-47, compels us to reach a different conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Oguns, </em>an informant told customs agents that a woman had instructed him to deliver a quantity of heroin from Nigeria to the defendant or to the defendant\u2019s brother in New York. Id., 444. The agents had the informant telephone the defendant, in their presence, and arrange a delivery. The two men spoke in a Nigerian dialect, which the agents did not understand. The informant then told the agents that the defendant had instructed him to bring the \u201c \u2018stuff \u201d to his address, and that the defendant\u2019s brother might have money when he returned to the apartment on the following day. Id. The agents thereafter conducted a controlled delivery, which resulted in their arrest of the defendant just outside of his apartment. The agents noticed that the door to the defendant\u2019s apartment was open, and they conducted a warrantless search of the apartment. Id., 445. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the search as a justifiable protective sweep under <em>Buie. </em>Id., 446. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>court stated: \u201cThe agents arrested [the defendant] at twilight just outside of a two family house. When the agents entered the lobby of the building, they noticed that the door to the [defendant\u2019s] apartment [abutting the hallway] was open. Even though the agents had been told that [the defendant\u2019s] brother was not in the apartment, they still could have reasonably believed that others were in the apartment. The agents also could have reasonably believed that people in the apartment saw or heard them arrest [the defendant] and might jeopardize the agents\u2019 safety or destroy relevant evidence.\u201d Id., 446-47. Although we agree with the state\u2019s contention that <em>Oguns </em>is factually similar to the present case, it is sufficiently distinguishable to preclude its application. First, the customs agents knew that the defendant was expecting the delivery of heroin. They also knew that he was working in the drug trade with at least three individuals\u2014his brother, the informant and a woman in Nigeria. Although the informant had told the agents that the defendant\u2019s brother would not be home, the agents nonetheless reasonably could have believed that an accomplice was in the apartment at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest. See <em>United States </em>v. Henry, supra, 48 F.3d 1284-85 (when police have no way of knowing whether informant was truthful concerning whether third party would be in arrestee\u2019s home, it is \u201cunreasonable ... to expect them to forego the necessary precautions\u201d). In the absence of any such similar knowledge, we decline to apply the reasoning of <em>Oguns </em>to the present case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Having concluded that the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s apartment was unreasonable under the federal constitution, we now must determine whether the evidence seized should have been suppressed as a consequence of the illegal search. \u201cUnder the exclusionary rule, evidence must be suppressed if it is found to be the fruit of prior police illegality. <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[371 U.S. 471, 485, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L.

[E]vidence is not to be excluded if the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery and seizure of the evidence is so attenuated as to dissipate the taint .... <em>Segura </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 805, 104 S.

Rather, the more apt question in such a case is whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which [the] instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>262 Conn. 179, 190, 811 A.2d 223 (2002), quoting <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 488. \u201cThe initial determination is, therefore, whether the challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal government activity. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 471, 100 S.

This fact is of minimal value to our inquiry, however, in light of the fact that the defendant had just left his apartment, momentarily, to answer the front door in response to Caruso\u2019s knock. Moreover, the state\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>supra, 70 F.3d 913, is misplaced. In <em>Biggs, </em>the arresting officers had other particularized information, in addition to an open door, that supported their reasonable belief that a protective sweep was necessary. Id., 916. Specifically, the officers had received information that another person would be meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tlie arrestee in his motel room, and they were familiar with the arrestee and knew that he previously had been arrested in the presence of someone in possession of a firearm.

It was within the context of these facts that the court in <em>Biggs </em>noted that the arrestee \u201cleft the motel room door open so that anyone present in the room had a clear view of the officers, thereby threatening their safety from an unknown person present in the room.\u201d Id.; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 48 F.3d 1284 (informant 1 officers that arrestee might have his \u201c \u2018boys\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018counterparts\u2019 \u201d w.,n him, and \u201cthis information, coupled with the arrest just outside the open door, was sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent policeman to fear that he was vulnerable to attack\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oguns, </em>supra, 921 F.2d 446-47 (open door to defendant\u2019s apartment bordering arrest scene accompanied by other facts in case supported reasonable belief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b618-9\">BORDEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEe\">dissenting. I disagree with the conclusion of the majority that the facts of the present case do not come within the so-called second tier protective sweep permitted under <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>110 S.

This is no more and no less than was required in <em>Terry</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Long,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and as in those cases, we think this balance is the proper one.\u201d Id., 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">It is important to emphasize that, in the application of <em>Buie, </em>the applicable standard under the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>amendment is objective, not subjective. That is, the question is whether, as <em>Buie </em>itself states, the articulable facts and reasonable inferences <em>\u201cwould warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing </em>that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Thus, the standard does not focus on the subjective beliefs of the particular police officers, and how they might characterize them, such as a hunch, belief, suspicion, or other characterization. Furthermore, the application of an objective, rather than a subjective, standard requires that a reviewing court employ, not only the reasonable inferences that the police officers on the scene may have in fact drawn, but also those reasonable inferences that <em>a reasonably prudent police officer, </em>in the position of the police officers on the scene, <em>would be warranted in drawing, irrespective of whether those officers in fact drew or articulated them. </em>Put another way, as the Court of Appeals of Maryland concluded after the remand to it by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Buie </em>itself: \u201cThe experience and training of the particular police officers involved will form a part of the matrix of facts that define the circumstances which must be considered, but the test is whether a reasonably prudent police officer, under those circumstances, is justified in forming a reasonable suspicion that the house is harboring a person posing danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Buie </em>v. <em>State, </em>320 Md. 696, 703, 580 A.2d 167 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">This objective standard is clear both from the language of <em>Buie </em>itself, as indicated previously, and also from its reliance on <em>Terry </em>and <em>Long, </em>both of which impose an objective, rather than a subjective, standard. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968) (\u201cthe issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>danger\u201d); <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1050, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">This application of the objective standard has long been uniform in fourth amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 138, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990) (\u201c[E]venhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer. The fact that an officer is interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of a search should not invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in area and duration by ... a valid exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d); <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S. Ct. 2778, 86 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1985) (\u201c[w]hether a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred \u2018turns on an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time\u2019 . . . and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken\u201d [citation omitted]); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 138, 98 S.

Our own cases also recognize this fundamental principle of fourth amendment jurisprudence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>261 Conn. 395, 415, 802 A.2d 820 (2002) (\u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that a felony has been committed. . . .

Ct. 551, 145 L. Ed. 2d 428 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">With this legal background in mind, I turn to the facts of the present case, which I am compelled to repeat in some detail because there are several critical facts, and the inferences rationally drawn therefrom, that the majority simply ignores in its application of the <em>Buie </em>principle. First, the package originally destined for the defendant\u2019s address contained <em>twenty-seven pounds </em>of marijuana. This permitted the reasonable inference that a large-scale illegal drug selling operation was being conducted at that address. The large amount of illegal drugs involved justifies, indeed compels, the inference that this was a shipment made for the purposes of a large-scale commercial operation. One does not ordinarily have twenty-seven pounds of marijuana shipped to oneself through Federal Express for purely personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Second, the facts and circumstances, together with their rational inferences, permitted the reasonable belief that the defendant was in fact the intended recipient of the package. The defendant accepted the package despite the fact that it was not addressed either to him or to his wife. In fact, the investigation prior to the controlled delivery disclosed that no one with the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of the addressee lived at that address; yet, the defendant accepted delivery <em>of the </em>package.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the defendant was placed under arrest, the defendant denied knowledge of anyone named Sylvia Sloan, the addressee of the package. One ordinarily does not accept a package addressed to a person with whom one was not acquainted. Thus, it was reasonable to believe that the defendant was in fact the intended recipient, and knowingly accepted delivery, of a package addressed to a fictitious person, which the defendant believed would contain twenty-seven pounds of marijuana, and that the defendant was, therefore, part of a large-scale illegal drug selling operation located in his apartment at that address. This inference was buttressed by the defendant\u2019s furtive and suspicious conduct immediately after accepting the package, namely, reopening the door and looking up and down the street. In addition, the area around the defendant\u2019s address was known to the police as an area with a high level of drug activity. This further buttressed the reasonableness of the inference that drug selling was going on at that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Third, it was reasonable to believe that the defendant was not the only occupant of the apartment in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the illegal drag selling operation was being conducted. The police knew, from the domestic disturbance call just two months before, that the defendant\u2019s wife lived there, as well as the defendant. Moreover, it is certainly a rational, objective inference that one does not ordinarily conduct a large-scale illegal, commercial drag selling operation as a sole proprietor, without another participant or employee. This permitted the reasonable inference that someone in addition to the defendant, including his wife or the yet-to-be-identified Sylvia Sloan, was likely to be part of the illegal drug selling operation being conducted out of the defendant\u2019s apartment. In addition, the defendant did not respond to the police officers when they repeatedly asked him whether anyone else was in the apartment. Despite the majority\u2019s misplaced reliance on <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), which I discuss later in this opinion, this reinforced the inference that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, someone else was in fact in the apartment, who was also involved in the drag operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Fourth, it was reasonable for the police to believe that guns or other dangerous weapons would be located in the apartment and, therefore, posed a danger to them from use by a coparticipant with the defendant in the drag operation. We have often stated, as the police officers testified in the present case, that it is reasonable for police officers to suspect guns to be associated with illegal drug selling operations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>255 Conn. 268, 284, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001) (\u201cConnecticut courts repeatedly have noted that [t]here is a well established correlation between drag dealing and firearms\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>306 F.3d 231, 238 (5th Cir. 2002) (dealing in narcotics sufficient for reasonable belief in potential for violence and presence of weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Fifth, the door to the defendant\u2019s apartment was ajar, and was only fourteen or fifteen stairway steps away from the police officers and the defendant. This permitted the reasonable inference that the police officers were in a place where they would have a justified fear for their safety from any accomplice of the defendant in the apartment, who was likely to have been aware of the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Sixth, as the trial court, which is the sole arbiter of credibility in this case, specifically found, the police entered the apartment for the purpose of searching for weapons or other persons, the \u201csafety of officers [being] paramount.\u201d Thus, in effect, the court found that the police had a subjective fear that someone else located in the apartment was a likely source of danger to them, and acted to alleviate that fear. This finding is conclusive on the question of the purpose of the protective sweep involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In sum, the police officers had reasonable and articulable suspicion: that the defendant was the intended recipient of the package containing twenty-seven pounds of marijuana, and was therefore involved in a large-scale, commercial, illegal drug selling enterprise; that someone else, who may or may not have been his wife,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and who also was involved in the enterprise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>was in the apartment; that that person was likely to be armed; and that the door to the apartment, which was but fifteen steps from the site of the defendant\u2019s arrest, was ajar, and, therefore, the armed person was likely to be aware of the arrest. On the basis of these facts and inferences, the conclusion is inescapable that there were \u201carticulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably prudent police officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 334. That is what <em>Buie </em>requires, and it is all that <em>Buie </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has come to the same conclusion in a case almost identical to the present one. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 444 (2d Cir. 1990), federal customs agents apprehended Saka Adenrele, who had arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport from Nigeria carrying 1405 grams of heroin in his underwear. After Adenrele told the agents that the heroin was to be delivered to the defendant or his roommate, Timo, and Adenrele agreed to cooperate, the agents arranged a controlled delivery by Adenrele to the defendant at the defendant\u2019s apartment. Id., 444-45. In a telephone call to the defendant, the defendant told Adenrele that he did not have any money but that Timo would have the money when he returned the next day, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>defendant suggested that Adenrele come to his apartment and spend the night there. Id., 444. In a second telephone conversation one-half hour later, the defendant told Adenrele that he would be waiting for Adenrele outside his home wearing a pair of shorts. Id., 445. The agents prepared a sample of the heroin, and put it in a tote bag for Adenrele to carry. Id. Adenrele rode in a taxicab driven by an agent to the defendant\u2019s home, where the defendant was sitting on the front steps of a two-family house. Id., 444-45. The defendant approached the taxicab and paid the fare, and then he and Adenrele walked toward the building, with Adenrele canying the tote bag that contained the sample of heroin. Id., 445. At that point, the agents arrested the defendant. Id. One of the agents, seeing an open apartment door abutting the hallway inside the building, asked the defendant if that was the door to his apartment. The defendant responded that it was. Id. The agents then conducted a security sweep of the apartment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The defendant challenged the legality of the security sweep as a predicate for his challenge to a subsequent consensual search of the apartment. Id., 446. The Court of Appeals rejected the challenge, stating: \u201cApplying <em>[Buie] </em>to the agents\u2019 security sweep of the [defendant\u2019s] apartment, we conclude that the agents\u2019 actions did not violate [the defendant\u2019s] Fourth Amendment rights. The agents arrested [the defendant] at twilight just outside of a two family house. When the agents entered the lobby of the building, they noticed that the door to the [defendant\u2019s] apartment was open. Even though the agents had been told that [the defendant\u2019s] brother was not in the apartment, they still could have reasonably believed that others were in the apartment. The agents also could have reasonably believed that people in the apartment saw or heard them arrest [the defendant] and might jeopardize the agents\u2019 safety or destroy relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>evidence. Had third parties been in the apartment, they would likely have been able to hear through the open door the agents arresting [the defendant] and, with that knowledge, would have posed a threat to the police outside. In view of the circumstances confronting the officers and the fact that the [District [C]ourt\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous, we hold that the security sweep met the Fourth Amendment requirements specified in <em>Buie </em>. . . .\u201d Id., 446-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Despite the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish this case, I can find no distinguishing features. In both the present case and <em>Oguns: </em>(1) a large amount of illegal drugs were destined for the defendant at his address; (2) there was no certainty that anyone else was in the apartment\u2014indeed, in <em>Oguns, </em>unlike the present case, there was specific evidence that the only other known inhabitant was <em>not </em>therein; (3) there was no specific evidence that whoever might be in the apartment would be armed; and (4) the defendants were arrested outside the apartment, and the door to the apartment was ajar, indicating that anyone inside would know of the arrest. Nonetheless, in both cases the police officers reasonably could have believed that others were in the apartment who (1) would be likely to know of then-accomplice\u2019s arrest, and (2) would pose a danger to the arresting officers; and in both cases, therefore, the requirements of <em>Buie </em>were met. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cavely, </em>318 F.3d 987, 996 (10th Cir. 2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 306 F.3d 238-39; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>106 F.3d 70, 74\u201475 (5th Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Biggs, </em>70 F.3d 913, 916 (6th Cir. 1995). Although opinions of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit are not binding on this court, we have consistently held that they are persuasive and are entitled to significant deference. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Frowein, </em>253 Conn. 312, 340-41, 752 A.2d 955 (2000) (\u201cIn general, we look to the federal courts for guidance in resolving issues of federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>law. . . . Decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, although not binding on us, are particularly persuasive. \u2018In deciding to adopt the analysis of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, we recognize that the decisions of the federal circuit in which a state court is located are entitled to great weight ....\u2019\u201d [Citations omitted.]). <em>Oguns </em>is undeniably within that category, particularly because the present case is resolved on the basis of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The majority opinion is fundamentally flawed. First, as I indicated previously, it fails to apply the objective test required by established fourth amendment jurisprudence and, therefore, fails to account, not only for critical undisputed facts, but for critical reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts. In effect, it focuses, wrongly, on what was <em>not specifically established </em>by the evidence, rather than, correctly, on the reasonable inferences to be drawn from what <em>was undisputedly established </em>by the evidence. In this regard, rather than focus, collectively, on the facts and inferences established by the evidence, the majority selectively chooses particular facts, views each in isolation, and then states that each fact provided an insufficient basis on which to sweep the defendant\u2019s apartment. Such a piecemeal approach is inconsistent with accepted fourth amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Thus, in my view, the majority oversteps this court\u2019s proper bounds in its application of the <em>Buie </em>principle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>It is well established that a state court cannot apply federal constitutional standards more broadly than applied by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 719, 95 S. Ct. 1215, 43 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1975) (\u201cof course, a [s]tate may not impose . . . greater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional law when this [c]ourt specifically refrains from imposing them\u201d). The majority\u2019s application of <em>Buie </em>to the undisputed facts and reasonable inferences of the present case violates this precept. In doing so, moreover, the majority strips law-abiding police officers of the legitimate safely net that <em>Buie </em>provides, and tells them that, in a situation like this, in which an abundance of facts and inferences gives them the reasonable and articulable suspicion that their lives or those of the public are in danger, they must, if they are to obey the law, forgo their, and the public\u2019s, legitimate safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Second, the majority\u2019s reliance on the fact that the defendant had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he failed to answer the police officers\u2019 questions about whether anyone else was in the apartment is simply irrelevant to the fourth amendment analysis under <em>Buie. Miranda </em>is a prophylactic exclusionary rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of confessions at trial, based upon the federal constitution\u2019s fifth amendment proscription against compelled self-incrimination. See <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>538 U.S. 760, 123 S. Ct. 1994, 155 L. Ed. 2d 984 (2003). I know of no authority, nor do the cases cited by the majority establish, that <em>Miranda </em>informs the reasonableness of a security sweep under the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, it would be bizarre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to hold that it does, because it would then bar law enforcement officers, who are required to give a defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warning upon arresting and questioning him, from then asking him, for their own protection and the protection of the public, whether anyone else is in his apartment. Indeed, the majority\u2019s point that silence after such warnings is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d is also beside the point. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) A defendant\u2019s silence has been said to be \u201cambiguous\u201d as it relates to a jury\u2019s ability to draw an inference therefrom at trial; see <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-18, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); it does not play a role in determining the reasonableness of police conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact that it may be ambiguous\u2014 meaning that it is susceptible of more than one plausible meaning\u2014does not mean that the police cannot choose the more prudent meaning, and act on that choice for their own safety and the safety of others.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the fourth amendment context, the objective test requires the reviewing court to give deference to the reasonable inferences drawn or drawable by the police officer involved that support the legitimacy of the search and seizure, irrespective of whether other reasonable inferences could also have been drawn that would undermine that legitimacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>I conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and would affirm the judgment of the trial court. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> I agree with the majority that: (1) the facts of this case do not bring it within 1he so-called first tier protective sweep under <em>Buie; </em>and (2) the second tier protective sweep under <em>Buie </em>is not confined to a sweep following an arrest within the home, but also extends to a sweep inside the home following an arrest in an area close to but outside the home, as in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\"> I would also conclude that there are no persuasive reasons to conclude that our state constitution affords any more expansive protections against protective sweeps than those articulated in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 325. I would, therefore, also conclude that the seizure in the present case was permissible under our state constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\"> <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L.

Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983) (fourth amendment permits limited search of automobile passenger compartment on basis of specific facts and reasonable inferences that individual may gain access to weapons).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\"> The majority\u2019s reference to the fact that the arresting officers did not investigate the name of the addressee of the parcel; see footnote 14 of the majority opinion; both ignores the testimony of police sergeant Eugene Dohmann, and is legally irrelevant. Dohmann testified that the police officers did not expect the package to be traced back to the addressee because \u201cit\u2019s typically not done that way for obvious reasons,\u201d namely, that neither trained police officers nor even laypersons of common sense would ordinarily expect a drug seller to arrange for twenty-seven pounds of an illegal substance to be delivered to him under his given name. It is legally irrelevant because the fourth amendment focuses, not on what the facts and inferences do <em>not </em>establish, but on whether, under the objective test, those facts and circumstances <em>would </em>warrant a <em>reasonably prudent officer </em>in engaging in the protective sweep. Certainly, as indicated previously in this opinion, the fact that the defendant accepted the package, addressed <em>not </em>to him or his wife, permitted the reasonable inference that the package was being sent to the defendant under a fictitious name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> In my view, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Akrawi, </em>920 F.2d 418 (6th Cir. 1990); see footnote 13 of the majority opinion; for the proposition that the presence of the defendant\u2019s girlfriend and his accomplice\u2019s mother is insufficient to establish a reasonable belief that dangerous persons are on the premises, is unpersuasive. First, that was not the focus of the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Akrawi. </em>In that case, the agents already had entered the residence and identified the accomplice\u2019s mother as present before the protective sweep took place. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Akrawi, </em>supra, 419. Thus, she was a known entity, and I do not read <em>Akrawi </em>as indicating that the government\u2019s reliance on a known presence as a source of a reasonable suspicion is akin to 1he risk posed from an unknown potential accomplice, as in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Second, the majority\u2019s focus on the defendant\u2019s wife, coupled with its lack of focus on the police officers\u2019 knowledge that the defendant resided with his wife, simply ignores the reasonable inference that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>was not operating as a sole proprietor. Indeed, the potential existed that another person may have been participating in the defendant\u2019s large-scale drug selling operation, who may or may not have been his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Finally, the fifteen to eighteen agents that entered the defendant\u2019s apartment in <em>Akrawi </em>remained there for forty-five minutes after arresting the defendant and identifying the other occupants. Id., 420-21. That fact, in the court\u2019s view, belied the agents\u2019 contention that the sweep was purely conducted for safety purposes. Id. Thus, as a factual matter, the sweep in <em>Akrawi </em>did not resemble either the sweep in <em>Buie </em>or the sweep in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\"> Indeed, if anything, the present case is an a fortiori case compared to <em>Oguns. </em>In the present case, although the majority does not, I specifically refer to the well established notion that it is perfectly reasonable for the police to believe that persons involved in drug selling are likely to be armed. The court, in <em>Oguns </em>did not even mention that association in upholding the validity of the sweep under <em>Buie. </em>In addition, thepolice officers in the present case knew that the defendant was not the only tenant of the apartment, and he remained silent when asked if anyone else was on the premises. In <em>Oguns, </em>the agents were specifically told that the defendant\u2019s brother was not in the apartment, and the court nonetheless held that the police did not have to credit that representation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oguns, </em>supra, 921 F.2d 446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> To the extent that the concerns of <em>Miranda might </em>apply to the protective sweep in the present case, a lack of administering the warnings would likely come within the public safety exception to <em>Miranda, </em>which permits such interrogation for purposes of immediate protection of the officers and the surrounding public. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Betances, </em>265 Conn. 493, 502-503, 828 A.2d 1248 (2003); see also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 657, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984). This point is purely hypothetical, however, because the defendant in the present case was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> As the majority itself recognizes with its citation to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>937 F.2d 1287, 1291 (7th Cir. 1991), even if the defendant had responded \u201cno\u201d to the officers\u2019 questions about whether there were other persons in his apartment, the officers may nonetheless, in their specialized judgment, reasonably elect to sweep the premises. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oguns, </em>supra, 921 F.2d 446 (agents were told that defendant\u2019s roommate was not in apartment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\"> In the present case, the defendant accepted a package originally containing twenty-seven pounds of marijuana. Upon his arrest, the defendant denied that he knew the addressee of the package, and then refused to answer the police officers\u2019 questions regarding whether anyone else was in the apartment. It is contrary to common sense to suggest, as the majority does, that the arresting officers could not consider the defendant\u2019s silence in response to their questions as one of many factors in determining whether the protective sweep was reasonable to ensure their own safety and the safety of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
