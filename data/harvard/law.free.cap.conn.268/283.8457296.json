Services, Inc. (general contractor), and Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (ICSP), the general contractor\u2019s surety on the bond for a public works project. The commissioner brought an action against the defendants on behalf of the employees of a subcontractor, Big Bell Development Corporation (subcontractor), in order to recover the employees\u2019 unpaid prevailing and overtime wages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to strike all counts of the commissioner\u2019s amended and second amended complaints. The Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and affirmed it in part. <em>Commissioner of Labor </em>v. <em>C.J.M. Services, Inc., </em>73 Conn. App. 39, 66, 806 A.2d 1105 (2002). We reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment in part and affirm it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following procedural history. \u201cIn his amended complaint, the commissioner alleged, inter alia: (1) ICSP was liable, as surety on the payment bond, for the payment of labor performed on the project (count one); (2) the general contractor was liable, as a matter of statutory law, as an \u2018employer,\u2019 as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for payment of wages under Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-53<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (prevailing wage statute) and 31-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>76c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (overtime wage statute) (count two); and (3) the general contractor, as a matter of contract law, was liable for payment of wages pursuant to its contract for the project (count three). In each count, the commissioner relied on his authority to bring an action pursuant to the wage collection statute [General Statutes \u00a7 31-72].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 41-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u201c[T]he trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike each count of the amended complaint. The court did so on two grounds. First, the court concluded that the commissioner had no authority to bring suit, on behalf of a subcontractor\u2019s employees, against the general contractor or its bonding company. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>court concluded that the general contractor was not an \u2018employer\u2019 as statutorily defined and, therefore, was not liable as alleged by the commissioner. Because the general contractor was not liable, its surety, ICSP, also was not liable.\u201d Id., 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201c[Wjithout waiving his appellate rights to challenge the court\u2019s striking of the counts in the earlier complaint, the commissioner filed a second amended complaint. In that complaint, count one (amended count one) was brought against only the general contractor and alleged that, as was previously alleged against ICSP, the general contractor was hable pursuant to the payment bond. It also alleged that the general contractor was an \u2018employer\u2019 as statutorily defined. On January 31, 2000, the court granted the general contractor\u2019s motion to strike amended count one.\u201d Id., 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The commissioner then appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that \u201ceach of the stricken counts was legally sufficient to survive the defendants\u2019 motions to strike. Specifically, he arguefd] that: (1) he has authority under the wage cohection statute to cohect unpaid wages on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees; (2) ICSP, as a surety on the labor and materials bond, is hable for payment of wages to the subcontractor\u2019s employees; (3) the general contractor is hable for payment of wages to the subcontractor\u2019s employees; (4) there were disputed factual issues about the general contractor\u2019s alleged liability as a de facto direct employer of the subcontractor\u2019s employees; and (5).the amended prayer for rehef, which included a request for injunctive rehef, made ah the stricken counts legally sufficient to withstand a motion to strike.\u201d Id., 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The Appellate Court concluded that the commissioner had authority under \u00a7 31-72 to bring any legal action necessary to recover the lost wages on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees, including an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>against the general contractor and its surety on the payment bond pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-41<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 49-42.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 56. With respect to the first count of the amended complaint and the first count of the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>amended complaint, respectively, the Appellate Court concluded that: (1) the surety could be held hable for the unpaid wages on the payment bond; id., 58; and (2) the general contractor could be held liable for the unpaid wages on the payment bond. Id., 61. With respect to the second count of the amended complaint, the Appellate Court concluded that the prevailing wage statute, \u00a7 31-53, does not authorize the commissioner to bring an action seeking the recovery of unpaid wages and, therefore, that the second count was legally insufficient to withstand the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. Id., 61-64. With respect to the third count of the amended complaint, which alleged that the general contractor had breached the public works contract, the Appellate Court concluded that the commissioner had pleaded insufficient facts to withstand the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. Id., 64. Finally, the Appellate Court concluded that it need not address the commissioner\u2019s claim for additional relief in the form of an affirmative injunction to enforce the state wage laws as the court already had found the first count legally sufficient. Id., 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the [commissioner] has statutory authority under General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 to bring suit for unpaid wages on behalf of a subcontractor\u2019s employees against a general contractor and its bonding company pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42?\u201d and (2) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the [commissioner] has statutory authority for imposing liability on the defendant surety under a payment bond where it is argued that the general contractor is not the employer of the subcontractor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>employees?\u201d <em>Commissioner of Labor </em>v. <em>C.J.M. Services, Inc., </em>262 Conn. 921, 812 A.2d 862 (2002). The commissioner presents one alternate ground for affirmance and two adverse rulings for our consideration pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to both certified questions; accordingly, we do not reach the alternate ground for affirmance. We reverse the first adverse ruling and affirm the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the Appellate Court concerning both certified questions should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the Appellate Court\u2019s concise and well reasoned opinion. <em>Commissioner of Labor </em>v. <em>C.J.M. Services, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 39. Because that opinion fully addresses all arguments raised with respect to those issues in this appeal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we adopt it as a proper statement of the applicable law concerning those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>259 Conn. 45, 55-56, 787 A.2d 530 (2002). We, therefore, do not reach the commissioner\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance that General Statutes \u00a7 31-2 (d) provides the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>with authority to seek injunctive relief against a general contractor and its surety to recover wages due to a subcontractor\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We next consider the first adverse ruling made by the trial court and affirmed by the Appellate Court, review of which the commissioner seeks pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11. Specifically, the commissioner claims that the trial court and the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the commissioner\u2019s third count was pleaded insufficiently to withstand a motion to strike. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cWe begin by setting out the well established standard of review in an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike. Because a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling on the [defendants\u2019 motion] is plenary. See <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 232-33, 680 A.2d 127 (1996) [cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997)]. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>236 Conn. 670, 674, 674 A.2d 839 (1996); see also <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108-109, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Autuori, </em>236 Conn. 820, 826, 676 A.2d 357 (1996). Moreover, we note that [w]hat is necessarily implied [in an allegation] need not be expressly alleged. <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 33 n.4, 675 A.2d 852 (1996). ... It is fundamental that in determining the sufficiency of a complaint challenged by a defendant\u2019s motion to strike, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted. . . . <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>80, 83, 438 A.2d 6 (1980). Indeed, pleadings must be construed broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically. . . . <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Tardif, </em>240 Conn. 610, 620, 692 A.2d 1266 (1997) <em>.... Doe v. Yale University, </em>252 Conn. 641, 667, 748 A.2d 834 (2000).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gazo </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>255 Conn. 245, 260-61, 765 A.2d 505 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cWhere the legal grounds for such a motion are dependent upon underlying facts not alleged in the plaintiffs pleadings, the defendant must await the evidence which may be adduced at trial, and the motion should be denied. <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>Henninger, </em>[173 Conn. 52, 61, 376 A.2d 406 (1977)].\u201d <em>Liljedahl Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Grigsby, </em>215 Conn. 345, 348, 576 A.2d 149 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We agree with the commissioner\u2019s claim that his allegation of contractual liability was sufficient to withstand the defendants\u2019 motions to strike. Although we agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[a] bald assertion that the defendant has a contractual obligation, without more, is insufficient to survive a motion to strike\u201d; <em>Commissioner of Labor </em>v. <em>C.J.M. Services, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 64; upon reviewing the contents of the commissioner\u2019s amended complaint, we disagree with that court\u2019s characterization of the allegations found therein as a \u201cbald assertion.\u201d Id. The commissioner alleged in count three that \u201c[the general contractor] was required to pay prevailing wages to all mechanics, laborers, and workmen on said project pursuant to the contract for said public works project . . . .\u201d The commissioner set forth a specific contractual obligation and alleged that it had not been met. Whether the terms of the contract support that allegation is a factual question to be determined by the fact finder and, therefore, is not at issue when the trial court considers a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendants claim that the Appellate Court correctly found that the third count lacked sufficient facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>to support a cause of action pursuant to <em>Donar </em>v. <em>King Associates, Inc., </em>67 Conn. App. 346, 786 A.2d 1256 (2001). We conclude that the defendants\u2019 and the Appellate Court\u2019s reliance on the <em>Donar </em>case is misplaced. That case concerned a subcontractor\u2019s motion to strike portions of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion to strike because the specific terms of the subcontract, which actually were set forth in the counterclaim, failed on their face to support the claim for indemnification. Id., 347-50. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 350. We conclude that <em>Donar </em>does not stand for the broad proposition that the specific terms of a contract must be alleged in order for a claim sounding in contract law to survive a motion to strike. Rather, the Appellate Court concluded in <em>Donar </em>that when specific contract terms are alleged and they do not support the claim presented, the claim cannot withstand a motion to strike. Id., 349-50. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The defendants also argue that this claim is insufficient because the commissioner lacks authority to bring a contract action on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees. This argument merely restates the defendants\u2019 arguments with respect to the commissioner\u2019s authority under \u00a7 31-72 and is equally unavailing. We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner\u2019s third count was sufficient to withstand the defendants\u2019 motion to strike and reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The second adverse ruling presented by the commissioner concerns the Appellate Court\u2019s determination with respect to count two of the amended complaint that \u00a7 31-53 does not permit recovery of unpaid wages. Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the Appellate Court concerning this issue should be affirmed. The issues were resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>properly in the Appellate Court\u2019s concise and well reasoned opinion. <em>Commissioner of Labor </em>v. <em>C.J.M. Services, Inc., </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 39. Because that opinion fully addresses all arguments raised with respect to this issue, we adopt it as a proper statement of the applicable law concerning this issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed only as to count three of the amended complaint; the judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed as to counts one and two of the amended complaint and as to count one of the second amended complaint, and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to reverse the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to strike count three of the amended complaint and for further proceedings on counts one and three of the amended complaint and on count one of the second amended complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-5\"> The commissioner also named the subcontractor as a defendant in this action and the trial court rendered judgment against the subcontractor in the amount of $161,052.92.
