Thereafter, the defendant was charged with violating two conditions of his probation. After a hearing, the trial court found that the defendant had violated both conditions of his probation as charged. Accordingly, the trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation, and ordered him to serve the twelve years imprisonment sentence originally imposed. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the defendant had not violated either of the conditions of his probation. <em>State v. Faraday, </em>69 Conn. App. 421, 437, 794 A.2d 1098 (2002). This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The following facts, as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court, are not in dispute. \u201cOn July 31, 1998, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine ... to sexual assault in the third degree in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-72a and risk of injury to a child in violation of ... \u00a7 53-21. The charges related to events that occurred in 1991 and 1992. Prior to the plea bargain, there had been a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The [trial] court, <em>Clifford, J., </em>accepted the <em>Alford </em>plea, and the defendant was sentenced to a total of twelve years imprisonment, exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>cution suspended, and five years probation. The court imposed various conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201cAt the time of the sentencing, the defendant was living with a woman, Eileen Kennedy, and her son. The son was not involved in the criminal events for which the defendant was charged and was two and one-half years old at the time the defendant was sentenced. By the time of the revocation hearing, the defendant had married Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cIn October, 1999, the defendant was charged with violating two of the conditions of his probation. The application for the arrest warrant stated that he had violated the \u2018following conditions of his probation: 1. Sex offender treatment as deemed appropriate by [the office of] adult probation; 2. No unsupervised contact with any child under the age of [sixteen]. The supervisor cannot be someone [the] defendant is romantically involved with. The exception is a situation the defendant is presently in.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u201cAfter the probation revocation hearing, conducted on February 3 and 4, 2000, the court, <em>Wollenberg, J., </em>found that the defendant had violated the two conditions of probation, as charged. The court interpreted one condition of probation as prohibiting the defendant from contact with his stepson, even in the presence of his wife, unless she had been approved by the department of children and families (department) as a supervisor, and found that such unsupervised contact had occurred during the summer of 1999. The court did not specifically cite [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-32a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that the defendant also had violated the condition of probation requiring \u2018 [s] ex offender treatment as deemed appropriate by probation . . . .\u2019 [Specifically, the trial court found that the defendant was discharged from such treatment because of his failure to admit guilt of the underlying charges.] The court then concluded that the rehabilitative purposes of probation had been thwarted by the defendant\u2019s attitude and conduct, and revoked his probation, sentencing him to the twelve years imprisonment originally imposed.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 422-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the defendant had not violated either of the conditions of his probation. Id., 437. With regard to the condition prohibiting unsupervised contact with a child less than sixteen years of age, the Appellate Court concluded that the plain language of this condition, as stated by the trial court, excepted the defendant\u2019s then present situation involving his girlfriend and her son. Id., 428-30. Thus, the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s alleged contact with his girlfriend\u2019s son did not violate that condition of his probation. Id., 429. With regard to the condition requiring the defendant to undergo sex offender treatment, the Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 53a-32a, which makes certain defendants ineligible for sex offender treatment unless they acknowledge guilt of their underlying crimes, could not be applied \u201cretroactively\u201d to the defendant because the statute became effective after he had committed the underlying crimes for which he was charged. Id., 432-33. In addition, the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant could not have been found to have violated the condition of his probation requiring sex offender treatment because, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the time he entered his guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, the defendant did not have \u201cprior fair warning\u201d that he may be required to admit guilt as a component of such treatment. Id., 437. Additional facts will be presented as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">On appeal to this court, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant had not violated either of the conditions of his probation. We agree, and we conclude that the defendant violated both conditions of his probation as charged. In addition, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and ordered him to serve the twelve years imprisonment sentence originally imposed. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We first turn to a brief review of the principles relating to probation. \u201c [Probation is, first and foremost, a penal alternative to incarceration .... [Its] purpose . . . is to provide a period of grace in order to aid the rehabilitation of a penitent offender; to take advantage of an opportunity for reformation which actual service of the suspended sentence might make less probable. . . . [Probationers ... do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only . . . conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions. . . . These restrictions are meant to assure that the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s being at large. \u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Misiorski, </em>250 Conn. 280, 287-88, 738 A.2d 595 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u201cThe success of probation as a correctional tool is in large part tied to the flexibility within which it is permitted to operate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 287. In this regard, \u201cmodifications of probation routinely are left to the office of adult probation. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the court imposes probation, a defendant thereby accepts the possibility that the terms of probation may be modified or enlarged in the future pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-30.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>255 Conn. 830, 841,769 A.2d 698 (2001). To this end, \u201cprobation officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>shall use all suitable methods to aid and encourage [a probationer] and to bring about improvement in his [or her] conduct and condition.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Misiorski, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u201cThe due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires that certain minimum procedural safeguards be observed in the process of revoking the conditional liberty created by probation. . . . Among other things, due process entitles a probationer to a final revocation hearing . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 294, 641 A.2d 370 (1994). \u201cA revocation proceeding is held to determine whether the goals of rehabilitation thought to be served by probation have faltered, requiring an end to the conditional freedom obtained by a defendant at a sentencing that allowed him or her to serve less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a full sentence. . . . [T]he ultimate question [in the probation process is] whether the probationer is still a good risk .... This determination involves the consideration of the goals of probation, including whether the probationer\u2019s behavior is inimical to his own rehabilitation, as well as to the safety of the public.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>256 Conn. 412, 427, 773 A.2d 931 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201cOn the other hand ... a [probation] revocation proceeding ... is not a criminal proceeding. . . . It therefore does not require all of the procedural components associated with an adversary criminal proceeding.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 295. Accordingly, the state must prove each alleged violation of probation by a preponderance of the evidence at a revocation proceeding, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tice Book \u00a7 43-29.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We now turn to the standard that governs our review of a revocation of probation proceeding. \u201cA revocation of probation hearing has two distinct components and two purposes. A factual determination by a trial court as to whether a probationer has violated a condition of probation must first be made. If a violation is found, a court must next determine whether probation should be revoked because the beneficial aspects of probation are no longer being served. . . . Since there are two distinct components of the revocation hearing, our standard of review differs depending on which part of the hearing we are reviewing. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cA trial court initially makes a factual determination of whether a condition of probation has been violated. In making its factual determination, the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence. . . . Our review is limited to whether such a finding was clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cThe standard of review of the trial court\u2019s decision at the sentencing phase of the revocation of probation hearing is whether the trial court exercised its discretion properly by reinstating the original sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ordering incarceration. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 425-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In the present case, the trial revoked the defendant\u2019s probation on the basis of its determination that the defendant had violated two conditions of his probation. Accordingly, we will first address whether the trial court findings, as to each alleged violation, were clearly erroneous. Next, we will address whether the trial court abused its discretion when it revoked the defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">THE CONDITION PROHIBITING UNSUPERVISED CONTACT</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant had not violated the condition of his probation prohibiting unsupervised contact with any child less than sixteen years of age. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">The record reveals the following additional facts, which are necessary to resolve this issue. As previously discussed, at the time of the defendant\u2019s plea hearing, he was living with Kennedy and her son. At the beginning of the hearing, the state first recited the special conditions of probation to the trial court, stating, in relevant part: \u201c[N]o unsupervised contact with any minor under the age of sixteen, and the supervisor cannot be someone [with] whom the defendant has a romantic interest in, and sex offender counseling as deemed appropriate by [the office of adult probation].\u201d After a short recess, the state repeated the special conditions to the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>stating, in relevant part: \u201c[N]o unsupervised contact with children under the age of sixteen and the supervisor cannot be someone with whom he has a romantic relationship with the exception of the child that he\u2019s currently living with, that if [the department] finds that that\u2019s appropriate the state will not object to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The following colloquy then ensued between the trial court and the assistant state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cThe Court: So it\u2019s no unsupervised contact with a child under the age of sixteen. The supervisor cannot be somebody who he is romantically involved with, but his present situation is an exception to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: As long as the [department . . . finds that that\u2019s an appropriate level of contact that he has with that child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201cThe Court: So he can stay with that relationship unless [the department] says otherwise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">After the trial court canvassed the defendant regarding his plea, the court stated the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation as follows: \u201cThe conditions on the probation, besides any usual conditions, [are] no contact, obviously directly or indirectly, with the victim or the victim\u2019s family; sex offender treatment as deemed appropriate by [probation; no unsupervised contact with any child under the age of sixteen; the supervisor cannot be somebody that you are romantically involved with; the only exception to that condition is your current situation right now with a woman and a child. Obviously, however, though, if [the department] gets involved and does not feel that is appropriate that you\u2019re going to be there, then that\u2019s going to be the end of that. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The written conditions of probation given to the defendant and signed by him on July 31, 1998, were as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>follows: \u201cNo contact directly [or] indirectly [with the] victim or victim\u2019s family. Sex offender treatment deemed appropriate by [probation]. No unsupervised contact [with] any child under the age of [sixteen]. The supervisor <em>cannot </em>be someone [that the defendant] is romantically involved with. Exception is the situation [the defendant] is presently in (girlfriend with child) unless [the department] is not satisfied [with the] arrangement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The defendant first met with his probation officer, Timothy Kane, on October 27,1998, whereupon the two reviewed the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation. At this meeting, Kane explained to the defendant that Kennedy was not yet an approved supervisor, and that Kennedy may act as a supervisor only if the department finds that it would be appropriate for the defendant to have contact with her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On October 29, 1998, the defendant was referred to The Connection, Inc. (Special Services), a center for the treatment of sexual offenders, where he was to receive counseling. On December 1, 1998, the department notified Kane that it would be investigating Kennedy\u2019s relationship with the defendant. On December 14, 1998, the defendant signed his treatment contract with Special Services. The contract indicated that, if the defendant were to have supervised contact with any minor, the supervisor must be someone first approved by Special Services and his probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">On December 23, 1998, Kane advised Maria Armstrong, a caseworker for the department, that, in order for Kennedy to become an approved supervisor for the defendant, she had to attend a class offered by Special Services, as well as meet with a therapist and a probation officer. Kane later advised the defendant of these requirements. On January 28, 1999, Kennedy entered into a treatment plan with the department, which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>vided that she would become involved with the program offered by Special Services in order to become an approved supervisor. In this regard, Special Services made arrangements with Kennedy to attend two meetings, but Kennedy did not attend either meeting. Kennedy never took the class required in order to become a supervisor for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On May 7, 1999, Brenda Colon, a caseworker for the department, was assigned to monitor and make certain that the defendant was not having contact with Kennedy\u2019s son. On July 13, 1999, Kennedy entered into and signed a service agreement with the department. The agreement provided, among other things, that Kennedy: (1) would \u201cnot allow any unsupervised contact with [the defendant] and [her son]\u201d; and (2) would \u201cenroll in a training group that will focus on the supervision of visitation with sexual offenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On September 7,1999, Kane and Colon visited Kennedy\u2019s home. The two met privately with Kennedy\u2019s son in his bedroom. Kennedy\u2019s son was bom on January 13, 1996, and was thus between the ages of three and four at that time. During the visit, Kane noticed a photograph of the defendant with Kennedy\u2019s son at the beach. Kennedy\u2019s son indicated that the photograph had been taken during the summer, after the defendant and Kennedy had married. In addition, Kane indicated that, on the basis of the appearance of Kennedy\u2019s son in the photograph, it appeared that the photograph had been taken during the previous summer. On October 13,1999, the defendant was charged with violating his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In the revocation proceeding, the trial court heard testimony from Kane, Colon, and an employee from Special Services. Consistent with the witnesses\u2019 testimony, the trial court found that it had been explained to the defendant and Kennedy that the defendant was not to have unsupervised contact with Kennedy\u2019s son. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The trial court also found that Kennedy could not properly be a supervisor for the defendant unless she first completed classes and was approved by the department. The trial court also found that the department never had approved Kennedy as a supervisor for the defendant. Accordingly, the trial court found that the defendant had violated his probation because he had unsupervised contact with a child less than sixteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Appellate Court disagreed with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the condition prohibiting unsupervised contact with a minor. Specifically, the Appellate Court determined that the plain language of the condition indicated that Kennedy could properly supervise the defendant <em>unless </em>there was some reason for the department to become involved. <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 429. In other words, according to the Appellate Court, Kennedy could properly supervise the defendant, without obtaining special training, until some \u201cwrongdoing\u201d occurred that would trigger the department\u2019s involvement. Id., 430. Thus, the Appellate Court concluded that the condition, as enforced by the office of adult probation, was inconsistent with the condition as imposed by the trial court, and accordingly, the defendant had not violated that condition. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly interpreted the condition of the defendant\u2019s probation prohibiting unsupervised contact with a child less than sixteen years of age. Specifically, the state argues, the language of the condition, as recited by the trial court, indicates that the defendant\u2019s contact with Kennedy\u2019s son was contingent upon the department first approving of the arrangement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">At the outset, we note that, although our review of the trial court\u2019s finding that a particular condition of probation had been violated concerns whether that find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ing was clearly erroneous; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 425; interpreting the meaning of a particular condition presents a question of law, over which our review is de novo. <em>State </em>v. Reilly, 60 Conn. App. 716, 727-28, 760 A.2d 1001 (2000) (\u201c[T]he interpretation of a probation condition and whether it affords a probationer fair warning of the conduct proscribed thereby are essentially matters of law and, therefore, give rise to de novo review on appeal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>20 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1994).\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The special conditions of probation, as stated by the trial court, were as follows: \u201cThe conditions on the probation, besides any usual conditions, [are] ... no unsupervised contact with any child under the age of sixteen; the supervisor cannot be somebody that you are romantically involved with; the only exception to that condition is your current situation right now with a woman and a child. Obviously, however, though, <em>if </em>[the department] gets involved and does not feel that is appropriate that you\u2019re going to be there, then that\u2019s going to be the end of that.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the trial court created an exception to the condition prohibiting unsupervised contact, namely, that the defendant could, for the time being, remain living with Kennedy and her son, that exception expressly was conditioned on the department\u2019s approval of the situation. Specifically, the language \u201cif [the department] gets involved\u201d indicated that the department was not yet involved, but that if it did become involved, it could alter the arrangement at its discretion. In the present case, the department <em>did </em>become involved because it was concerned that Kennedy was living with a convicted sex offender. Colon testified that the department had not felt that Kennedy was an appropriate supervisor for the defendant, not only because she had not attended the required classes, but also because she had refused to acknowledge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>defendant\u2019s involvement in the crimes for which he had been convicted. Accordingly, when the department became involved and specifically disapproved of the defendant having contact with Kennedy\u2019s son without <em>an approved </em>supervisor, the defendant was not permitted to have such contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Furthermore, the record reflects that that is how the defendant and Kennedy understood the arrangement. Kane indicated that he had told the defendant several times that Kennedy was not yet an approved supervisor. In this regard, on December 14, 1998, the defendant signed an agreement with Special Services indicating that, if he were to have contact with minors, the supervisor must first be approved by Special Services and the office of adult probation. In addition, the fact that Kennedy was set to enroll in classes to become a supervisor belies the defendant\u2019s contention that it was not necessary for Kennedy to be approved in order to be a supervisor. Indeed, on January 28, 1999, Kennedy entered into a treatment plan with the department, whereby she agreed to become involved with the sex offender supervisor\u2019s program. After she failed to attend her scheduled meetings, Kennedy entered into another treatment plan on July 13, 1999, in which she agreed not to allow unsupervised contact with her son and the defendant, and also that she would enroll in classes related to the supervision of the defendant. If the defendant\u2019s living with Kennedy and her son was unconditionally excepted from the condition prohibiting unsupervised contact, as the defendant maintains, then it would not have been necessary for Kennedy to enroll in classes to become a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Finally, even interpreting the condition, as the Appellate Court did, so as to require an event to trigger the department\u2019s involvement, the mere fact that the defendant was a convicted sex offender provided such a basis for the department\u2019s involvement. The Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>concluded that the condition could not be modified to preclude Kennedy as an approved supervisor unless some \u201cwrongdoing\u201d necessitated the department\u2019s involvement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 430. This interpretation, however, added a term that was not present in the condition as imposed by the trial court, namely, that some sort of wrongdoing must occur in order for the department to become involved. The condition merely required that, \u201cif the department gets involved,\u201d it could terminate the defendant\u2019s living situation. Indeed, Colon testified that she would not have allowed a convicted sex offender, who had not yet completed sex offender treatment, to have contact with a preschool child. Thus, the fact that Kennedy was living with a convicted sex offender, in the department\u2019s view, necessitated its involvement, which is consistent with the plain language of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the condition prohibiting unsupervised contact, as imposed by the trial court, excepted the defendant\u2019s current living situation with Kennedy <em>to the extent that </em>the department approved of the situation. With that conclusion in mind, we now turn to whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant violated that condition was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Colon testified that Kennedy was not an approved supervisor for the defendant. In addition, both Kane and Colon testified that the defendant had had contact with Kennedy\u2019s son, who was under the age of sixteen, sometime during the summer of 1999. Thus, there was evidence on which the trial court reasonably could have inferred that the defendant had had unsupervised contact with a child less than sixteen years of age. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant had had unsupervised contact with a child less than sixteen years of age was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">THE CONDITION REQUIRING SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The state also claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that: (1) \u00a7 53a-32a could not have been applied \u201cretroactively\u201d to the defendant; and (2) the trial court was required to notify the defendant, upon entering his guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, that not acknowledging that he had committed the acts for which he was charged could result in a violation of his probation. We agree with both contentions, and we address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The following additional facts, as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court, are necessary to resolve this issue. \u201cThe second condition of probation that the [trial] court . . . found to have been violated was that the defendant receive sex offender treatment. The defendant was discharged from such treatment because of his failure to admit guilt to the underlying charges. Section 53a-32a is expressly applicable to the charges for which the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine and provides that failure to complete the sex offender treatment program by refusing to admit guilt is deemed to be a violation of a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u201cNothing in the record indicates that the defendant at anytime was aware of, or was told of, the existence of the statute. The defendant was told, however, on July 28, 1999, one year after sentencing and the imposition of the condition, and approximately six months after treatment began by [Special Services], that if he continued to deny his guilt, he would be terminated from the treatment program and that his unsuccessful discharge from counseling would result in a violation of his probation. In addition, and specifically, the defendant was told that he must admit guilt or submit to a physiological detection test. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201c[Section] 53a-32a became effective on October 1, 1997. [See Public Acts 1997, No. 97-151, \u00a7 2.] Ten months later, July 31, 1998, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine to crimes allegedly committed in 1991 and 1992.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>supra, 69 Conn.

Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted. For that reason, the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal human appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>supra, 316. \u201cThe inquiry into whether a statute operates retroactively demands a commonsense, functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment. ... A statute has retroactive effect when it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past .... [T]he judgment whether a particular statute acts retroactively should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Accordingly, retroactive application of a law occurs only if the new or revised law was not yet in effect on the date that the relevant events underlying its application occurred. In the present case, because the conduct for which the defendant was charged, namely, violating the condition of his probation requiring him to undergo sex offender treatment, occurred after \u00a7 53a-32a became effective, and because \u00a7 53a-32a was in effect when the defendant entered his plea for the charges that gave rise to his probation, we conclude that \u00a7 53a-32a was not applied retroactively to the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">A brief reiteration of the relevant dates underlying this appeal is helpful to explicate this conclusion. The defendant was charged with sexual assault in the third degree and risk of injury to a child for events that allegedly had occurred in 1991 and 1992. The defendant eventually pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine to those charges on July 31, 1998. Section 53a-32a, however, became effective on October 1, 1997. Thus, the statute was in effect at the time the defendant entered his plea and agreed to undergo sex offender treatment as a condition of his probation. The defendant was discharged from sex offender treatment on August 6, 1999, for his continued refusal to acknowledge his culpability for the charges for which he was originally sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The crux of the defendant\u2019s claim is that, when he entered his guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, he did not have fair warning that a failure to admit guilt could result in a violation of his probation. Even if we were to assume that the defendant was entitled to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>a warning; see part II B of this opinion; \u00a7 53a-32a had been effective for approximately ten months prior to the date on which the defendant entered his plea. Thus, \u00a7 53a-32a cannot be said to have been applied retroactively to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Nevertheless, the defendant argues that the triggering date to determine whether \u00a7 53a-32a was applied retrospectively should be the date on which he committed the alleged sexual offenses, namely, sometime in 1991 and 1992. Specifically, the defendant relies on <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 377, 678 A.2d 462 (1996), in which we stated: \u201cIn criminal cases, to determine whether a change in the law applies to a defendant, we generally have applied the law in existence on the date of the offense, regardless of its procedural or substantive nature.\u201d Thus, the defendant contends, because \u00a7 53a-32a became effective well after he allegedly had committed the offenses for which he was charged, applying the statute to him constitutes an improper retrospective application of the law. This contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The defendant\u2019s assertion rests on a misunderstanding of the offense with which he was charged in the present case. For the purposes of this issue, the defendant was not charged with the sexual offenses that he allegedly committed in 1991 and 1992; rather, the defendant was charged with violating his probation. Thus, the proper triggering date under our language in <em>In re Daniel H., </em>supra, 237 Conn. 377, would be the date on which the defendant committed the acts that led to his discharge from sex offender treatment, not the alleged sexual misconduct that led to his pleading guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Moreover, the present case does not present an appropriate situation in which to apply a traditional ex post facto analysis, because that analysis simply does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>not apply to a condition of probation enacted or modified subsequent to the date of the underlying substantive criminal conduct. As previously discussed, the ex post facto prohibition forbids the application of any law that either: (1) imposes a punishment for an act that was not punishable at the time it was committed; or (2) imposes additional punishment for an act that was already committed. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 450 U.S. 28; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 88. In the present case, \u00a7 53a-32a played no part in \u201cimpos[ing] a punishment\u201d to the defendant. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 28. \u201cRevocation hearings are not concerned with punishment or retribution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 177, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). \u201cA revocation proceeding is held to determine whether the goals of rehabilitation thought to be served by probation have faltered, requiring an end to the conditional freedom obtained by a defendant at a sentencing that allowed him or her to serve less than a full sentence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 427. \u201cThe ends of probation revocation are thus distinct from the punitive functions of the criminal law and a number of considerations relevant to revocation include factors that are irrelevant to a criminal prosecution. . . . The element of \u2018punishment\u2019 in probation revocation of [the] defendant is attributable to the crime for which he was originally convicted and sentenced. Thus, any sentence [the] defendant had to serve as the result of the violation of the special condition was \u2018punishment\u2019 for the crime of which he had originally been convicted. Revocation is a continuing consequence of the original conviction from which probation was granted.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 177-78; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Furthermore, conditions of probation are necessarily flexible, and may be amended by the office of adult probation or the court to meet the current situation, as it presents itself. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 841; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30. Thus, it stretches the ex post facto prohibition beyond its proper boundaries to suggest, as the defendant\u2019s argument does, that only those conditions of probation specifically mentioned in the statutes at the time of the underlying conduct may ever be imposed. The ex post facto clause does not freeze all conditions of probation at the time of the underlying crime. Insofar as the defendant\u2019s argument relates to the ex post facto prohibition, it suffices to say that it is absurd to think that prospective criminals would shape their criminal conduct based on the expectation that their eventual plea bargains might result in desirous conditions of probation. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 165 (\u201cthere is no right to be granted probation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The state also claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court was required to notify the defendant, upon entering his guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, that a failure to acknowledge that he committed the acts with which he was charged could result in a violation of his probation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">We first reiterate the law governing guilty pleas. \u201cIt is axiomatic that unless a plea of guilty is made knowingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable. ... A plea of guilty is, in effect, a conviction, the equivalent of a guilty verdict by a jury. . . . In choosing to plead guilty, the defendant is waiving several constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>253 Conn. 497, 502-503, 752 A.2d 49 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cThe Boykin<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> constitutional essentials for the acceptance of a plea of guilty are included in our rules and are reflected in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 [39-19 and 39-20],<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> . . . Those rules provide that the trial court must not accept a guilty plea without first addressing the defendant personally in open court and determining that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in \u00a7 39-19, and that the plea is made voluntarily pursuant to \u00a7 39-20. There is no requirement, however, that the defendant be advised of every possible consequence of such a plea. . . . Although a defendant must be aware of the direct consequences of a plea, the scope of direct consequences is very narrow. ... In Connecticut, the direct consequences of a defendant\u2019s plea include only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the mandatory minimum and maximum possible sentences; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (2) and (4)]; the maximum possible consecutive sentence; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)]; the possibility of additional punishment imposed because of previous conviction(s); Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)]; and the fact that the particular offense does not permit a sentence to be suspended.

In this regard, the Appellate Court has stated: \u201cWhere noncriminal activity forms the basis for the revocation of probation . . . due process mandates that the [probationer] cannot be subjected] to a forfeiture of his liberty for those acts unless he is given prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>fair warning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">With those principles in mind, we conclude that the trial court was not required to notify the defendant, upon entering his plea, that a failure to acknowledge guilt could result in a violation of the condition of his probation requiring sex offender treatment. First, the conduct proscribed by a particular condition of probation is not a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of the plea. <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 504. In the present case, the defendant does not dispute that the trial court stated to him, upon entering his plea, that he was to undergo sex offender treatment as a condition of his probation. At that point, it was not incumbent upon the trial court also to list all the potential conduct that could result in a discharge from that program. Furthermore, because the office of adult probation is free to modify the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation at any time; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 841; it is unrealistic to expect the court to canvass a defendant regarding the conduct necessary to comply with those terms. Finally, \u00a7 53a-32a was in effect at the time the defendant entered his plea, which explicitly provided that a discharge from sex offender treatment for a failure to acknowledge guilt will automatically trigger a probation revocation proceeding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This belies the defendant\u2019s contention that he was without knowledge, when he entered his plea, that his failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>to acknowledge the commission of the charged crimes would result in a violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Nevertheless, the defendant argues that the trial court could not revoke his probation based on his failure to admit guilt because such a requirement was inconsistent with his guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The defendant\u2019s contention fails because he misconstrues the import of a guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. In support of his contention, the defendant cites cases from other jurisdictions that have concluded that a defendant, who enters a guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine, cannot be deemed to have violated his probation for a failure to admit guilt unless he specifically was informed during the plea canvass that such conduct was proscribed. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>164 Misc. 2d 986, 988-89, 627 N.Y.S.2d 289 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Birchler, </em>Ohio Court of Appeals, Docket No. 00AP-311 (October 5, 2000), 2000 Ohio App. Lexis 4622, *3. Those decisions, however, seem to be of the view that a guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine carries greater constitutional significance than a standard guilty plea. Without belaboring the point, it suffices to say that we agree with those decisions that have held otherwise; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Birdsong, </em>958 P.2d 1124, 1127 (Colo. 1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>129 Idaho 471, 474, 926 P.2d 1318 (App. 1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>139 N.C. App. 787, 793, 534 S.E.2d 666 (2000); and we conclude that a guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine does not carry any special significance in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201cUnder <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), a criminal defendant is not required to admit his guilt, but consents to being punished <em>as if he were guilty </em>to avoid the risk of proceeding to trial. ... A guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine is a judicial oxymoron in that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea nevertheless.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>248 Conn. 64, 66- 7 n.2, 726 A.2d 520 (1999). The entry of a guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine carries the same consequences as a standard plea of guilty. By entering such a plea, a defendant may be able to avoid formally admitting guilt at the time of sentencing, but he nonetheless consents to being treated as if he were guilty with no assurances to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Birdsong, </em>supra, 958 P.2d 1130 (\u201c[t]here is nothing inherent in <em>an Alford </em>plea that gives the defendant any rights, or promises any limitations, with respect to the punishment imposed after the conviction\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 139 N.C. App. 793 <em>(Alford </em>plea not infused with any special promises).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In the present case, the trial court stated to the defendant at the plea hearing: \u201cAnd you plead guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. That means you plead guilty but you don\u2019t agree necessarily with everything that the state claims that you did or what they claim they could prove at trial. But you would rather plead guilty rather than run the risk of having another trial. Is that correct?\u201d To which the defendant replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201d The trial court did not, in any way, indicate that the defendant could unconditionally maintain his innocence for any and all purposes. In addition, the defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>stated that the defendant was \u201ctrying to take advantage of a plea bargain in order [to] . . . get on with his life.\u201d Accordingly, we cannot say that the defendant did not understand his plea, nor can we say that the trial court\u2019s canvass was defective in that regard. The defendant is free to maintain the innocence associated with his plea; in order to maintain the \u201cconditional liberty created by probation\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 294; however, he was required to comply with its conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We now turn to whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant violated the condition of his probation requiring him to undergo sex offender treatment was clearly erroneous. In the present case, the defendant was required to undergo sex offender treatment as a condition of his probation. The defendant does not dispute, as a factual matter, that he refused to admit guilt in conjunction with his sex offender treatment; nor does he dispute that he was discharged from such treatment. Accordingly, having concluded that \u00a7 53a-32a was properly applied to the defendant, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant violated the condition of his probation requiring him to undergo sex offender treatment was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">REVOCATION OF PROBATION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Finally, we turn to whether the trial court abused its discretion by revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstating his original sentence. As previously discussed, the trial court found that the defendant violated both conditions of his probation as charged. On the basis of the evidence before it, the court found that the defendant expressed an unwillingness to comply with the terms of his probation, and as a result, the rehabilitative purposes of probation had been \u201cthwarted through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>[the defendant\u2019s] attitude and conduct.\u201d The court noted that the defendant, having had his entire sentence suspended, was given \u201ca real break\u201d and an opportunity that is not always given to defendants. In addition, the trial court heard testimony that the defendant\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his actions presented an obstacle to his effective treatment as a convicted sex offender. In this regard, the trial court found that the beneficial purposes of the defendant\u2019s probation were no longer being served. The court also noted the important state interest of protecting the public from sex offenders, and how that topic has taken on an increased importance in recent years.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, the court noted that it compared the defendant\u2019s liberty interest with the need to protect the public. On the basis of the foregoing, and in light of the fact that probation attempts to balance a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation with the public\u2019s safety, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and ordered him to serve the twelve years imprisonment sentence originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"><em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.
