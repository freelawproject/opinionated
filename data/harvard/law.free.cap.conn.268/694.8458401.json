We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the arbitration clause is enforceable under New York law and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>Hottle </em>v. <em>BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>74 Conn. App. 271, 811 A.2d 745 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cThese appeals arise out of a dispute over the payment of compensation between the plaintiff, Dean M. Hottle, a former partner, and the defendant partnership, BDO Seidman, LLP, an accounting firm. After his withdrawal from the firm, the plaintiff initiated judicial proceedings by filing an application for a prejudgment remedy. In response, the defendant filed a motion to stay the court proceedings and an independent action to compel arbitration<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the [Federal Arbitration Act (arbitration act)].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>plaintiff was obligated to arbitrate his claims pursuant to \u00a7 14.8 of the partnership agreement [the parties had executed].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court agreed and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant.\u201d Id., 273-74. The plaintiff thereafter filed two separate appeals to the Appellate Court, which consolidated the appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>On appeal to the Appellate Court, the plaintiff argued that the arbitration clause of the partnership agreement was unenforceable because it did not provide for a neutral third party decision maker. Specifically, the plaintiff contended that \u00a7 14.8 of the partnership agreement does not qualify as an agreement for \u201carbitration\u201d because it provides for an arbitral panel consisting entirely of five partners from the defendant accounting firm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant argued, in response, that the arbitration clause is not invalid simply because it authorizes adjudication by the defendant\u2019s partners, and further, that the plaintiff knowingly agreed to the terms of the arbitration clause and, therefore, cannot now seek to avoid enforcement of those terms. Id., 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The Appellate Court, noting that the partnership agreement contains a provision that the agreement \u201cshall be governed\u201d by New York law;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> id., 275 n.6; proceeded to construe that agreement under a plenary standard of review. Id., 275, citing <em>805 Third Avenue Co. </em>v. <em>M.W. Realty Associates, </em>58 N.Y.2d 447, 451, 448 N.E.2d 445, 461 N.Y.S.2d 778 (1983). The court first determined that the partnership agreement \u201c \u2018involves commerce\u2019 \u201d and is therefore governed by the arbitration act. <em>Hottle </em>v. <em>BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 276. Applying the arbitration act, the court determined that it was required to resolve two issues: \u201c(1) whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, and (2) whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the agreement was enforceable.\u201d Id., 277. The court answered both questions in the affirmative. Id., 278,283.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In concluding that the parties had agreed to arbitrate, the court first noted that the partnership agreement had been executed pursuant to New York law and, under the laws of that state, the parties properly had entered into an agreement to arbitrate. The court further noted that it was uncontroverted that the underlying dispute fell within the scope of \u00a7 14.8 of the partnership agreement. Id., 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Turning to the enforceability of the arbitration clause, the court noted that, \u201c[although the requirement of a neutral arbitrator has often been stated . . . the parties have not cited, and we have not found, an authoritative definition of the requisite neutrality.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 278. Accordingly, the court held, \u201c[a]s a matter of first impression . . . that neutrality requires an absence of structural bias that demonstrates probable partiality in favor of one of the parties to the dispute.\u201d Id. In arriving at the \u201cstructural bias\u201d standard, the court relied on federal cases that, within the context of claims brought under the arbitration act, had \u201cphrased the need for neutrality in terms of \u2018institutional bias\u2019 and \u2018evident partiality.\u2019 \u201d Id.; see id., 279, citing <em>Harter </em>v. <em>Iowa Grain Co., </em>220 F.3d 544, 553 (7th Cir. 2000); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Prudential Securities, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1007, 1015 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1068, 119 S. Ct. 798, 142 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1999); see also <em>Andersons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Horton Farms, Inc., </em>166 F.3d 308, 325 (6th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In specific, the Appellate Court relied on two federal cases discussing structural bias in a manner that it found informative. <em>Hottle </em>v. <em>BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 279, citing <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999), and <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Saturn Distribution Corp., </em>78 F.3d 424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>(9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 518 U.S. 1051, 117 S. Ct. 30, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1123 (1996). The Appellate Court read those cases, and the other federal cases cited, as holding \u201cthat a structural linkage of the arbitration panel to one side of the dispute does not prove a violation of \u00a7 10 (a) (2) [of the arbitration act]. Industry relationships may demonstrate an appearance of bias, but do not in and of themselves establish \u2018evident partiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hottle </em>v. <em>BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>supra, 281. Therefore, the court concluded: \u201cThe plaintiff has not demonstrated the likelihood of any significant financial incentive that would, in fact, influence present partners as potential arbitrators. Unsurprisingly, before the selection of the arbitral panel, it is difficult to present any such evidence. At this juncture, the plaintiffs claims demonstrate nothing more than an appearance of bias and that is not enough to demonstrate structural bias.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In so concluding, the court found distinguishable cases wherein courts had refused to enforce arbitration provisions on the ground of unconscionability in the form of \u201cunequal economic power and difference in sophistication between the contracting parties.\u201d Id., 282, citing <em>Murray v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union, </em>289 F.3d 297, 302-303 (4th Cir. 2002); <em>Hooters of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>173 F.3d 933, 938-40 (4th Cir. 1999). Finally, the court acknowledged that a partnership and its partners generally share the same legal identity under New York law, but declined to apply that general rule to the present case to view the defendant as the arbitrator of its own disputes. <em>Hottle </em>v. <em>BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>supra, 74 Conn. App. 282-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that \u00a7 14.8 of the partnership agreement is an enforceable arbitration clause. Essentially, the plaintiff claims that New York law controls the validity and construction of the part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>nership agreement, and that, under New York law, the arbitration clause is: (1) illusory and contrary to public policy because it, in effect, authorizes the defendant to arbitrate its own dispute; and (2) \u201cso grossly unfair and one-sided\u201d that it is substantively unconscionable. Although we agree that New York law controls the validity and construction of the partnership agreement, we reject the plaintiffs claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, albeit on somewhat different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">First, because the plaintiffs claim that the arbitration clause is unenforceable rests upon principles applicable to all contracts generally, we conclude that our determination of that claim is controlled by state contract law, rather than by federal case law construing the arbitration act. Next, we conclude, in accordance with the partnership agreement, that New York law controls, and therefore we apply New York law to resolve the plaintiffs claims. Specifically, we conclude that the arbitration clause is neither illusory under New York law nor contrary to the public policy of that state because the defendant\u2019s partners are neither legally equivalent to the defendant nor so identified with the defendant that the law should presume, in advance, that they are incapable of conducting a fair and impartial adjudication of the underlying dispute. In addition, we conclude that the arbitration clause is not so skewed in the defendant\u2019s favor as to be unconscionable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">At the outset, we must first determine whether federal law or state law applies to determine the enforceability of the arbitration clause in the present case. \u201c \u2018Arbitration is essentially a creature of contract, a contract in which the parties themselves charter a private tribunal for the resolution of their disputes.\u2019 <em>[In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>the Matter of Astoria Medical Group], </em>11 N.Y.2d 128, 132-33, 182 N.E.2d 85, 227 N.Y.S.2d 401 (1962) (Citations omitted.) <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Advest, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 732, 744-45, 714 A.2d 649 (1998). \u201cArbitration agreements are contracts and their meaning is to be determined . . . under accepted rules of [state] contract law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Ct. 1169, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1204 (2004). \u201cAs aresult, prior to compelling arbitration, the [trial] court must first determine two threshold issues that are governed by state rather than federal law: (1) Did the parties enter into a contractually valid arbitration agreement? and (2) If so, does the parties\u2019 dispute fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement?\u201d <em>Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, U.S., LLC v.

See <em>Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, U.S., LLC v. Nackel, </em>supra, 346 F.3d 365. Therefore, the focus of our inquiry is solely on the first prong, that is, whether the parties have entered into a contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tually valid arbitration agreement. See id. The plaintiff claims that the arbitration clause is not contractually valid because it fails to provide for a \u201cneutral third party arbitrator\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, essentially, enables the defendant \u201cto be the arbitrator of [its] own cause,\u201d in violation of New York public policy. The plaintiff also contends that the clause is invalid because it vests the defendant with \u201csole control\u201d over the arbitration process. We view this second contention as a claim of substantive unconscionability. See <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 89, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992) (\u201c[t]he basic test is whether . . . the clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Gillman </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>73 N.Y.2d 1, 10, 534 N.E.2d 824, 537 N.Y.S.2d 787 (1988) (contract is unconscionable when there is \u201can absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, we turn to the relevant state law of contracts to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement. Because the parties have agreed that New York law controls the partnership agreement; see footnote 7 of this opinion; we apply the law of that state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Having concluded that New York law must govern our analysis of whether the parties entered into a contractually valid arbitration agreement, we turn now to the plaintiffs claims. The plaintiff first claims, essentially, that the arbitration clause is illusory under New York law, and violates the public policy of that state, because it authorizes an arbitration panel consisting entirely of partners and directors of the defendant and, therefore, allows the defendant to act as the judge of its own case. The plaintiffs second claim is that the terms of \u00a7 14.8 are \u201cgrossly unfair and one-sided\u201d because they give the defendant exclusive control over the selection of arbitrators and the arbitral process.

Unless we close our eyes to realities, the agreement here becomes, not a contract to arbitrate, but an engagement to capitulate.\u201d Id. Therefore, the court concluded that \u201cno party to a contract, <em>or someone so identified with the party as to be in fact, even though not in name, the party, </em>can be designated as an arbitrator to decide disputes under it. Apart from outraging public policy, such an agreement is illusory; for while in form it provides for arbitration, in substance it yields the power to an adverse party to decide disputes under the contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Since 1957, however, the New York Court of Appeals repeatedly has stated that, \u201ceven in cases where the contract expressly designated a <em>single </em>arbitrator who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>was employed by one of the parties or intimately connected with him, the courts have refused to disqualify the arbitrator on the ground of either interest or partiality .. . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>supra, 82 N.Y.2d 54; see also <em>In the Matter of Siegel, </em>supra, 40 N.Y.2d 690; <em>In the Matter of Astoria Medical Group, </em>supra, 11 N.Y.2d 136. Therefore, although the New York Court of Appeals never has addressed <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co. </em>directly, it is clear that that case establishes only a limited exception to the general rule that consenting parties to a contract are free to agree upon an arbitrator of their choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In <em>In the Matter of Siegel, </em>supra, 40 N.Y.2d 691, the New York Court of Appeals upheld the enforceability of a commercial arbitration clause that named an attorney and an accountant of one of the parties as the sole arbitrators. In concluding that there was no basis upon which to disqualify the arbitrators in advance of arbitration, the court noted that both arbitrators had rendered professional services to the party for approximately fifteen years. Id., 688. In addition, the court noted that the attorney was \u201cthe chief draftsman\u201d of the underlying stock purchase agreement, and that the accountant was named as escrowee by that agreement. Id., 691. Nevertheless, because these facts were fully known to both parties at the time that they entered into the agreement, the court refused to intervene. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>supra, 82 N.Y.2d 50, the New York Court of Appeals held that New York public policy does not prohibit \u201can alternative dispute resolution . . . provision that authorizes an employee of a party . . . to a contract dispute, where such employee is personally involved in the dispute, to make conclusive, final, and binding decisions on all questions arising under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>contract . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>concerned a public works construction contract between a general contractor and a municipal transit authority. The contract contained an alternative dispute resolution provision requiring that all disputes arising from the contract be submitted for binding resolution by the superintendent of the transit authority. Id., 51. In this case, the superintendent was also the transit authority\u2019s chief electrical officer. Id. The underlying dispute arose when the superintendent, acting in his capacity as chief electrical officer, ordered the contractor to discontinue its work under the contract and recommended to the transit authority that it hold the contractor in default on that contract. Id., 51-52. On the basis of that recommendation, the transit authority held the contractor in default. The contractor thereafter challenged that decision through the channels provided by the alternative dispute resolution clause. The superintendent, acting in his capacity as the sole adjudicator under that clause, rejected the contractor\u2019s claims. Id., 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The contractor thereafter brought a diversity action in federal District Court for breach and rescission of the contract, claiming that the alternative dispute resolution clause was void and unenforceable because it violated New York public policy. Id. The District Court disagreed, and upheld the enforceability of the clause. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>794 F. Sup. 79, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), aff'd, 14 F.3d 818 (2d Cir. 1994). The contractor then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and, relying on <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co., </em>argued that the alternative dispute resolution clause contravened New York public policy by authorizing an adjudication by a functionary indistinguishable from one of the parties. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>990 F.2d 76, 79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>(2d Cir. 1993). The Second Circuit subsequently certified the issue to the New York Court of Appeals for an articulation of the law and public policy of New York. Id., 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The New York Court of Appeals concluded that the alternative dispute resolution clause was enforceable. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit </em>Authority, supra, 82 N.Y.2d 54-55. Significantly, the court made no mention of <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co. </em>in reaching its conclusion. Rather, the court stated, based upon its earlier decisions in <em>In the Matter of Siegel </em>and <em>In the Matter of Astoria Medical Group, </em>that the public policy of New York favors and encourages arbitration and other forms of alternative dispute resolution; id., 53; and, therefore, courts must \u201cinterfere as little as possible with the freedom of consenting parties to achieve that objective . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 54. Applying these principles, the court noted that the contractor had \u201cchose [n], with its business eyes open, to accept the terms, specifications and risk of the bid contract, including the [alternative dispute resolution] clause.\u201d Id. Therefore, the court declined to interfere with the operation of the clause because the contractor had chosen to accept the risk \u201cthat having an employee of the [transit authority] alone decide the ongoing disputes during the performance of the contract [would lead] ultimately to decisions unfavorable to it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Since 1993, when <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>was decided by the New York Court of Appeals, the New York appellate courts repeatedly have upheld the enforceability of alternative dispute resolution clauses that authorize adjudication by employees and other representatives of a party to the underlying dispute. See, e.g., <em>Yonkers Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., 87 </em>N.Y.2d 927, 930, 663 N.E.2d 907, 640 N.Y.S.2d 866 (1996) (chief engineer of transit authority); <em>In the Matter of Weeks Marine, Inc., </em>291 App. Div. 2d 277, 278, 737 N.Y.S.2d 92 (2002) (agency head and comptroller), appeal denied, 99 N.Y.2d 505, 785 N.E.2d 733, 755 N.Y.S.2d 711 (2003); <em>Laquila Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>282 App. Div. 2d 331, 332, 723 N.Y.S.2d 464 (2001) (chief engineer of transit authority), appeal denied, 96 N.Y.2d 721, 759 N.E.2d 372, 733 N.Y.S.2d 373 (2001). In <em>Laquila Construction, Inc., </em>the only recent New York case to reference <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co., </em>the Appellate Division reversed the judgment of the trial court invalidating an alternative dispute resolution clause similar' to the one at issue in <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>The court expressly noted the impact of the <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>decision: \u201cWhile the [trial] court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>decade-old decision ... is understandable in terms of the then-controlling precedent, it has been clear since at least 1993 that the contract clause providing for dispute resolution by [a party\u2019s] Chief Engineer is not against public policy, [and] is enforceable . . . compare <em>[In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co., </em>supra, 4 App. Div. 2d 503] [party to contract cannot be arbitrator to resolve contract disputes] with <em>Westinghouse [Electric] Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City [Transit Authority], </em>[supra, 82 N.Y.2d 54] [engineer review of contract disputes with circumscribed judicial review consistent with public policy] . . . .\u201d <em>Laquila Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>supra, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Even considering the concerns raised by the Appellate Division in <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co., </em>we nevertheless conclude that the arbitration clause in the present case is neither illusory nor contrary to New York public policy. As we previously have stated, the court in that case prohibited contractual provisions that name, as an arbitrator, either a party to the underlying contract or \u201csomeone so identified with the party as to be in fact, even though not in name, the party . . . .\u201d <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co., </em>supra, 4 App. Div. 2d 503. First, it is clear that the panel provided for by the arbitration clause in the present case is not a \u201cparty\u201d to the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant. Although we recognize that each <em>individual </em>partner is a party to the partnership agreement,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it is clear that, in the present case, the plaintiff is asserting claims against <em>the partnership, </em>and not against its partners in their individual capacities. In other words, there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>only two parties to the underlying dispute in this case: the plaintiff and the defendant. Therefore, our focus is on whether the five partners selected to serve on the arbitration panel, acting in their <em>individual </em>capacities, are equivalent to the partnership with regard to the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Under the terms of the partnership agreement, none of the directors or other partners, <em>acting individually, </em>can take any action to assert the partnership\u2019s rights under that agreement. Specifically, \u00a7 2.6 of the partnership agreement vests the board of directors with the sole discretion concerning \u201c[a]ll matters of Partnership policy, administration, operation, action or inaction,\u201d including the admission of new partners, allocation of income to the partners and termination of a partner\u2019s interest. Section 2.8 of the partnership agreement makes clear, however, that the board of directors cannot take any such action without a vote, and further, that a vote cannot be had unless a quorum of three quarters of the total number of directors are present. Therefore, because \u00a7 2.1 of the partnership agreement requires a minimum of nine directors, the quorum requirement of \u00a7 2.8 mandates that at least seven directors must be present in order for a proposed action to even go to a vote. In other words, the two directors named to the arbitration panel could not, by themselves, exercise the partnership\u2019s rights under the partnership agreement. Significantly, the only member of the board of directors who <em>could </em>exercise the partnership\u2019s rights is the chairman and chief executive partner, who is precluded by the arbitration clause from serving on the arbitration panel. Moreover, the partners who are not members of the board of directors have no authority whatsoever, either individually or collectively, to exercise the partnership\u2019s rights under the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, because the arbitration panel will consist of <em>individual </em>partners who cannot, by themselves, exercise the partnership\u2019s rights under the partnership agreement, those arbitrators do not share the same legal identity as the partnership for the purposes of the partnership agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown </em>Co., supra, 4 App. Div. 2d 501 (arbitration clause authorized \u201carbitration to the Board of Directors\u201d of employer, in its entirety [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Second, we cannot say that the directors and other partners who actually will serve on the arbitration panel, and who have yet to be selected, are \u201cso identified with the [partnership] as to be in fact, even though not in name, the [partnership] . . . .\u201d Id., 503. The plaintiff first contends that the partners are \u201cinseparably tied\u201d to the partnership because they share in the income, profits and losses of the partnership, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4.1 and 5.1 of the partnership agreement, and therefore \u201cwill directly share in the gain (or loss) associated with the transaction on which they sit as judge . . . .\u201d The plaintiff asserts, as an example, that were he to prevail on his contractual claim for $300,000, each of the 250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>partners of the partnership would bear an average loss of $1200. Even if we were to assume that this is true, although we agree that $1200 is not an insignificant sum of money, we cannot say that it constitutes so substantial an interest that the law should presume, in advance of arbitration, that the partners acting as arbitrators \u201ccannot have [the] disinterestedness and impartiality necessary to act in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity regarding [the] controversy.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co., </em>supra, 4 App. Div. 2d 502. Moreover, \u201c[a]n interest in the dispute ... if known to the parties to the agreement when the arbitrator is chosen . . . will not disqualify the arbitrator from acting.\u201d Id. The plaintiffs next assertion, that each partner\u2019s judgment will be tainted by fear of reprisal from the board of directors, similarly lacks weight. Although it is conceivable that a partner serving on the arbitration panel might be concerned about how a decision that is adverse to the partnership could affect his or her future with the partnership, such concerns are no different than those held by an employee adjudicating a dispute in which the employer is a party. As we previously have stated, it is well settled under New York law that an employee is not precluded from arbitrating disputes when his or her employer is one of the parties. See <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>supra, 82 N.Y.2d 53; <em>In the Matter of Siegel, </em>supra, 40 N.Y.2d 690. We fail to see why the rule should be any different when a partner is named as arbitrator, particularly when, as here, the partnership agreement, in \u00a7 11.4, provides that a partner\u2019s interest maybe terminated only \u201cfor cause,\u201d and then only by a supermajority of 75 percent of the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the partners cannot serve as arbitrators because, under New York law, partners owe fiduciary duties to each other and, by extension, to the partnership. See <em>Graubard Mollen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Dannett &amp; Horowitz </em>v. <em>Moskovitz, </em>86 N.Y.2d 112, 118, 653 N.E.2d 1179, 629 N.Y.S.2d 1009 (1995). As we previously have stated, however, New York courts have permitted attorneys to serve as arbitrators over disputes in which one of their clients was a party, despite the fact that attorneys clearly owe fiduciary duties to their clients under New York law. See <em>In the Matter of Siegel, </em>supra, 40 N.Y.2d 691; <em>In the Matter of Sociedad Maritima San Nicolas, S.A., </em>21 App. Div. 2d 43, 44-45, 248 N.Y.S.2d 143, appeal denied, 14 N.Y.2d 485 (1964); see also <em>Graubard Mollen Dannett &amp; Horowitz </em>v. <em>Moskovitz, </em>supra, 118 (\u201can attorney stands in a fiduciary relation to the client\u201d). Moreover, we note that the arbitration clause in the present case mandates that none of the arbitrators has any involvement in the underlying dispute, even though such involvement did not disqualify the arbitrator in <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>Accordingly, because the arbitration clause does not name an arbitrator who is either a party to the underlying contract dispute, or someone so identified with the party as to effectively be that party, we conclude that the arbitration clause is neither illusory under New York law nor contrary to the public policy of that state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the terms of the arbitration clause are \u201cgrossly unfair and one-sided\u201d because they give the defendant exclusive control over selection of the arbitration panel and the arbitral process.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We view this contention as, essentially, a claim that the arbitration clause is substantively unconscionable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of unconscionability contains both substantive and procedural aspects, and whether a contract or clause is unconscionable is to be decided by the court against the background of the contract\u2019s commercial setting, purpose and effect . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Sablosky </em>v. <em>Edward S. Gordon Co., </em>73 N.Y.2d 133, 138, 535 N.E.2d 643, 538 N.Y.S.2d 513 (1989). \u201cA determination of unconscionability generally requires a showing that the contract was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable when made\u2014i.e., some showing of an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gill-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>man </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff makes no claim that the partnership agreement is a contract of adhesion or that it is the result of procedural unconscionability in the process of contract formation. See <em>Sablosky </em>v. <em>Edward S. Gordon Co., </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 139 (\u201cclaims [of procedural unconscionability] are judged by whether the party seeking to enforce the contract has used high pressure tactics or deceptive language in the contract and whether there is inequality of bargaining power between the parties\u201d). Specifically, the plaintiff does not claim that the contract language is in any way deceptive, or that the defendant used high pressure tactics in the formation of the contract. Moreover, as the plaintiff acknowledges in his brief to this court, he is not an unsophisticated party\u2014to the contrary, the plaintiff is a well educated accountant, a factor that weighs against him. Compare <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Snappy Car Rental, Inc., </em>84 N.Y.2d 21, 30, 637 N.E.2d 253, 614 N.Y.S.2d 362 (1994) (contract not procedurally unconscionable when party was high school graduate with some college education, and did not claim she was victim of deceptive or high pressure tactics) with <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Three Guys Pizzeria, Inc., </em>207 App. Div. 2d 578, 580, 615 N.Y.S.2d 494 (1994) (claim that party to contract was \u201cunsophisticated, minimally educated and had little experience in business matters\u201d raised genuine issue of whether contract was procedurally unconscionable). Accordingly, we conclude that the partnership agreement was neither adhesive nor procedurally unconscionable in its formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Nor is the arbitration clause so unreasonable as to render it unenforceable solely on the ground of substantive unconscionability. \u201cWhile determinations of unconscionability are ordinarily based on the court\u2019s conclusion that both the procedural and substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>components are present . . . there have been exceptional cases where a provision of the contract is so outrageous as to warrant holding it unenforceable on the ground of substantive unconscionability alone . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gillman </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>supra, 73 N.Y.2d 12; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolowitz, </em>96 App. Div. 2d 47, 68, 468 N.Y.S.2d 131 (1983) (\u201cprocedural and substantive unconscionability operate on a \u2018sliding scale\u2019; the more questionable the meaningfulness of choice, the less imbalance in a contract\u2019s terms should be tolerated and vice versa\u201d). In the present case, the terms of the arbitration clause are not so imbalanced as to require its invalidation. Specifically, the clause expressly requires that the arbitrators \u201cshall be mutually agreed to\u201d by the board of directors and the parties to the dispute. As an additional safeguard, the arbitration clause further provides that \u201cno member of the panel shall be from an office in which any complaining Partner was located at the time of the filing of the complaint, nor be otherwise involved in the controversy or dispute.\u201d Therefore, we cannot say that the arbitration clause is so imbalanced in the defendant\u2019s favor as to require its invalidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The plaintiff contends, nevertheless, that the arbitration clause is unenforceable because it vests the board of directors of the defendant with exclusive control over the arbitral procedures. Specifically, the plaintiff points to language in the arbitration clause providing that \u201c[t]he conduct of the arbitration shall be in accordance with such procedures as the Board of Directors adopts and communicates to the Partners.\u201d We do not believe that this express language of the arbitration clause, alone, is so imbalanced in the defendant\u2019s favor as to render the clause substantively unconscionable and to require this court to interfere with the freely made agreement of the parties. Cf. <em>Hooters of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>supra, 173 F.3d 939 (unfair arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>rules provided employer with exclusive right to modify rules \u201c \u2018in whole or in part,\u2019 whenever it wishe[d] and \u2018without notice\u2019 to the employee\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the arbitration clause is not unconscionable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In concluding that the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement executed by the plaintiff and the defendant is both valid and enforceable, we note, however, that our conclusion does not reheve the defendant of its contractual obligation to provide the plaintiff with an adequately fair and impartial arbitral forum. If, in practice, the requisite standard of impartiality proves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>not to have been met, the plaintiff is not without recourse. \u201cNeedless to say, if the arbitrators, in the actual execution of their office, prove to have been unfair or unfaithful to their obligations, their award is not impervious to judicial action . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In the Matter of Siegel, </em>supra, 40 N.Y.2d 691.

(1994). Because <em>\u201cRosenberg </em>was concerned only with compel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ling arbitration in the context of federal employment discrimination claims\u201d; <em>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Zang, </em>248 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2001); it does not apply to cases, such as the present case, involving \u201ca straightforward contract dispute that does not raise the public policy concerns addressed by statutory bars to employment discrimination.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\"><em>Woods </em>v. <em>Saturn Distribution </em>Corp., supra, 78 F.3d 426-29, similarly does not advance the analysis. That case concerned postarbitration review of an arbitrator\u2019s award under \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 of the arbitration act. Id., 425-26; see 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 (a) (2). The issue in the present case is whether the parties executed a valid and enforceable agreement to arbitrate, an issue to be resolved under general principles of state contract law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> In <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>the New York Court of Appeals also stated: \u201cMost importantly, we conclude only that public policy has not been transgressed in this case, particularly because of the provision for judicial review of the adjudicator\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>supra, 82 N.Y.2d 54. Specifically, the court noted that the alternative dispute resolution clause expressly provided for judicial review pursuant to article 78 of the New York Civil Rules and Practice Law, which \u201callows broader review than the usual and stricter standards of arbitration award review in article 75.\u201d Id., 55; see also N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7\u00a7 7511 and 7803 (McKinney 1992). Therefore, the plaintiff asserts that <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>is inapplicable because \u201cit involved an [alternative dispute resolution] clause that provided for broader judicial review than allowed for arbitration.\u201d We disagree with this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Although the court in that case noted that the alternative dispute resolution clause was \u201cparticularly\u2019 enforceable because it allowed broader judicial review than the standard generally applied to arbitration clauses, a close reading of that case shows that its holding was not predicated on judicial review. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>New York City Transit Authority, </em>supra, 82 N.Y.2d 54-55. Indeed, in <em>Yonkers Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., </em>87 N.Y.2d 927, 930, 663 N.E.2d 907, 640 N.Y.S.2d 866 (1996), the New York Court of Appeals, applying <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>upheld the enforceability of an alternative dispute resolution clause that failed to specify the standard of judicial review. Moreover, a review of decisions by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, applying <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. </em>to arbitration clauses, indicates that New York courts do not view judicial review as the determinative factor in that case. See, e.g., <em>886 Mid-Orange Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Lax, </em>288 App. Div. 2d 255, 732 N.Y.S.2d 590 (2001); <em>Wallkill Industrial Development Agency </em>v. <em>Assessor, </em>286 App. Div. 2d 338, 728 N.Y.S.2d 683 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\"> The initial paragraph of the partnership agreement provides in relevant part: \u201cThis Partnership Agreement is made as of the 1st day of November, 1997 . . . <em>among the Partners </em>of BDO Seidman, LLP, a limited liability partnership registered under the laws of the State of New York .... <em>Said Partners </em>hereby adopt the following Partnership Agreement applicable to periods from and after the effective date.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> It is noteworthy that, under \u00a7 14.10 of the partnership agreement, partners are limited in their ability to bind the partnership in dealings with persons outside the partnership, without authorization from the board of directors or the chairman and chief executive partner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> Our conclusion, that the individual partners are not \u201cparties\u201d to the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant, should not be construed, in any way, as limiting or commenting upon the well established principle of New York partnership law that \u201c [a] partnership is generally not a separate entity existing independently of the persons who <em>control </em>it. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Dembitzer </em>v. <em>Chera, </em>285 App. Div. 2d 525, 526, 728 N.Y.S.2d 78 (2001); see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hartshorn, </em>296 N.Y. 49, 51, 69 N.E.2d 557 (1946) (\u201cin the absence of . . . legislative treatment, a partnership is not to be regarded as a separate entity distinct from the persons who compose it\u201d). This general principle is inapplicable in the present case, however, in light of the partnership agreement executed by the parties, which clearly reflects their understanding that the individual partners and directors named to the arbitration panel do not <em>control </em>the partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> We note that the plaintiff has pointed us to a case from another jurisdiction, applying New York law, that invalidated a similar arbitration clause from one of the defendant\u2019s previous partnership agreements. See <em>BDO Seidman </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>949 S.W.2d 858, 861 (Tex. App. 1997) (invalidating arbitration clause under <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co. </em>because \u201c[t]he five arbitrators are in fact [the partnership] itself\u2019). The plaintiff also relies on an unpublished Massachusetts trial court decision, which also invalidated a similar arbitration clause under the authority of <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co. </em>Because we conclude that the arbitration clause in the present case is enforceable under New York law, we are not persuaded by those cases from other jurisdictions that have reached a contrary result. Moreover, we note that the defendant has pointed us to five unreported cases\u2014one from a New York state trial court\u2014that have upheld the enforceability of arbitration clauses from the defendant\u2019s partnership agreements that are similar to the one in this case. Finally, to the extent that other cases, cited by the plaintiff, from courts outside of New York, have interpreted New York law in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>present case, we find those cases unpersuasive. See, e.g., <em>Graham, v. Scissor-Tail, Inc., </em>28 Cal. 3d 807, 823-27, 623 P.2d 165, 171 Cal. Rptr. 604 (1981) (interpreting and applying <em>In the Matter of Cross &amp; Brown Co. </em>as statement of New York law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"> The plaintiff further asserts that, \u201cin order to continue to work and be paid for work he had done,\u201d he was required to sign a termination agreement \u201cthat made reference to an internal grievance procedure to which he was formerly subject as a partner.\u201d In other words, the plaintiff claims that he is <em>now </em>in the position of an \u201cemployee,\u201d forced to arbitrate under terms set forth in the partnership agreement. The plaintiff does not, however, dispute the trial court\u2019s determination that the arbitration clause of the partnership agreement had been incorporated by reference in the termination agreement. He also does not dispute that the arbitration clause expressly applies to \u201c[a]ny controversy or dispute relating to . . . the Partnership and its affairs . . . .\u201d Therefore, we are not persuaded that the plaintiffs status as a <em>former </em>partner somehow could reduce the enforceability of the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Hooters of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>supra, 173 F.3d 938-40 and <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Ryan\u2019s Steakhouses, Inc., </em>95 F. Sup. 2d 940 (N.D. Ind. 2000), aff'd, 269 F.3d 753 (7th Cir. 2001), is misplaced. First, both of those cases involved plaintiffs who were not financial professionals and, therefore, presumably less sophisticated in business matters than the plaintiff in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Second, and more important, neither of those cases concerned an arbitration clause that was as detailed as the one in this case. In <em>Hooters of America, Inc., the </em>clause provided for alternative dispute resolution pursuant to rules \u201cpromulgated by the company from time to time . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hooters of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>supra, 173 F.3d 936. Pursuant to this language, the employer promulgated rules that were biased toward itself. Consequently, the court concluded that the employer had materially breached its contractual obligation to promulgate arbitration rules, and thus defeated the object of the contracting parties. Id., 940. In the present case, by contrast, the plaintiff does not contend that the defendant materially has breached the arbitration clause. The plaintiff contends, instead, that the express terms of the arbitration clause, to which he knowingly agreed, are unenforceable. Similarly, the District Court in <em>Penn </em>concluded that the employer and a third party provider of arbitration services both had breached their contractual duties to provide an unbiased arbitral panel. <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Ryan\u2019s Family Steakhouses, Inc., </em>supra, 95 F. Sup. 2d 949. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court, albeit on narrower grounds. Specifically, the Seventh Circuit concluded, in light of the unique nature of the third party arbitration agreement in that case, that the agreement was unreasonably vague and void for want of mutuality of obligation. <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 753, 760-61 (7th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, the line of <em>Penn </em>cases and <em>Hooters of America, Inc., </em>are of minimal value to our inquiry in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
