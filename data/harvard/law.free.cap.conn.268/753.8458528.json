We conclude that HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers who, like the decedent, are members of the defendant\u2019s correctional emergency response unit, and that, therefore, the plaintiffs notice of claim was timely filed under \u00a7 31-294c. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The decedent was employed as a state correction officer at the Bridgeport correctional facility (facility) from 1986 until 1991. In that position, the decedent was required to maintain security and ensure the safety of the public, inmates and staff within the facility. His duties of employment also included responding to medical emergencies, altercations and other disturbances. In addition to his regular duties of employment, the decedent was also a member of the emergency response unit, a special team of correction officers that responded to major disturbances and riots. When responding to such incidents, the decedent could be exposed to blood and other bodily fluids of inmates through splash incidents and other incidents that would cause contact between HIV infected body fluids of inmates and the decedent\u2019s skin or mucous membranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In April, 1992, the decedent was diagnosed with HIV, and in March, 1993, he died as a result of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In March, 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the workers\u2019 compensation commission alleging that the decedent\u2019s contraction of HIV was caused by his contact with inmates at the facility. The plaintiffs claim was filed more than one year after the decedent\u2019s last date of employment, and was, therefore, untimely under the one year limitation period set forth in \u00a7 31-294c for accidental and repetitive trauma injuries. The plaintiff claimed, however, that the claim was timely under the three year limitation period set forth in \u00a7 31-294c for occupational disease claims. The defendant disagreed, and filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The commissioner bifurcated the proceedings in order to focus initially on the question of whether the plaintiff met the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 31-294c. After several hearings, the commissioner found that HIV was not an occupational disease for correction officers and, therefore, the three year limitation period for occupational diseases set forth in \u00a7 31-294c was inapplicable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commissioner denied the plaintiffs subsequent motion to correct the factual findings. The plaintiff appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board, which affirmed that decision. Subsequently, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the board to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The plaintiff contends that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s determination that HIV does not constitute an occupational disease for correction officers. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that HIV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>is an occupational disease for correction officers under General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (15) because it is both peculiar to the occupation and is due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such. The defendant contends, to the contrary, that the board\u2019s decision was proper because the plaintiff failed to prove a causal connection between the duties of a correction officer and the contraction of HIV. We agree with the plaintiff, and we conclude that HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers who, like the decedent, are members of the emergency response unit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. Filing \u201ca notice of claim or . . . satisfaction of one of the . . . exceptions [contained in \u00a7 31-294c (c)] is a prerequisite that conditions whether the commissioner] has subject matter jurisdiction under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] [A]ct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 534, 829 A.2d 818 (2003); <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 5-6, 675 A.2d 845 (1996). \u201c[B]ecause [a] determination regarding . . . subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>247 Conn. 407, 410, 722 A.2d 271 (1999); <em>Anastasio </em>v. <em>Mail Contractors of America, Inc., </em>69 Conn. App. 385, 392, 794 A.2d 1061, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 914, 915, 806 A.2d 1053 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Section 31-275 (15) defines occupational disease as \u201cany disease peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such, and includes any disease due to or attributable to exposure to or contact with any radioactive material by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>employee in the course of his employment.\u201d \u201cIn interpreting the phrase occupational disease, we have stated that the requirement that the disease be peculiar to the occupation and in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment, refers to those diseases in which there is a causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted by the employee. In other words, [the disease] need not be unique to the occupation of the employee or to the work place; it need merely be so distinctively associated with the employee\u2019s occupation that there is a direct causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Malchik </em>v. <em>Division of Criminal Justice, </em>266 Conn. 728, 734, 835 A.2d 940 (2003); <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 65, 72-73, 735 A.2d 321 (1999); <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 578-79, 698 A.2d 873 (1997); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 352, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993); <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 35, 602 A.2d 560 (1992). \u201cThus, an occupational disease does not include a disease which results from the peculiar conditions surrounding the employment of the claimant in a kind of work which would not from its nature be more likely to cause it than would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions. <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 664, 667, 186 A. 616 (1936).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In the present case, we agree with the plaintiff that HIV is \u201cpeculiar to\u201d and \u201cso distinctively associated with the [correction officers\u2019] occupation that there is a direct causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 35.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The following additional facts are relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>to our resolution of this claim. Edward Blanchette, the clinical director for the defendant, testified that the HIV infection rate among incarcerated individuals is 1 in 20, while the rate among nonincarcerated individuals is 1 in 1500. He also testified that correction officers were not advised which particular prisoners were infected with HIV. Instead, the officers were advised to treat all inmates as potentially infected and to take appropriate precautions. In 1989, the defendant issued administrative directive 8:11, which established procedures for mandatory training, education, prevention and tracking of possible exposure to HIV. Administrative directive 8:11 established procedures for providing correction officers with training and safety equipment that included protective rubber gloves and one-way respirators for performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In 1991, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a directive that made recommendations of occupational safety and health considerations for exposure to blood-borne pathogens.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">John Shanley, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Connecticut Health Center, and the chair of infectious diseases and HIV for the state of Connecticut, also testified before the commissioner. Shanley testified that exposure to HIV is normally through close physical contact with blood products, semen, cervical secretions and breast milk. He further testified that in order for HIV to be transmitted from an infected individual to a noninfected individual through blood, there must be a direct transfer of blood either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>across the skin or across a mucous membrane. Blanchette testified that the principal methods of transmitting HIV to another are through sexual contact, blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, and transmission from mother to child. In addition, Shanley testified that the statistical HIV infection rate for splash incidents involving HIV infected blood is 0.09 percent, while the infection rate for needle stick injuries is 0.3 percent. A splash incident occurs when the blood of an infected person comes into contact with the skin or mucus membranes of a noninfected individual, such as when a correction officer comes into contact with an infected inmate\u2019s blood while breaking up a fight. As demonstrated by the statistics testified to by Shanley, a splash incident is not as effective a means of transmission of HIV as sexual intercourse or direct injection of HIV through a needle or other sharp instrumentality. On the basis of this testimony, the commissioner found that \u201cmerely being in the presence of an HTV positive person does not expose one to the hazards of the disease, it requires a particular event to potentially contract the virus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">As concerns occupational infection rates, Blanchette testified that he was not aware of any other correction officers who had contracted HIV through work-related exposure. He further testified that he was only aware of one confirmed case of an employee of the defendant contracting HIV through workplace exposure, and that involved a health care provider who was struck with an infected syringe during the course of her employment. Shanley testified that there are fifty-five nationwide confirmed cases of occupationally transferred HIV, and 136 probable cases, documented by the National Center for Disease Control. These cases almost entirely consist of health care and research professionals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shanley testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>fied that the only documented case of occupational exposure outside of those two professions involved a police officer who was stabbed with an infected needle.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In the course of his employment, the decedent experienced numerous incidents when he could have come into contact with blood or other bodily secretions from inmates through splash incidents, or through other conduct by inmates that would bring the inmates\u2019 bodily fluids into contract with the decedent\u2019s skin or mucous membranes. Because the decedent was a member of the emergency response unit, one of his specific \u201cduties of employment\u201d was to break up altercations, riots, and other emergencies in which, through splash or other similar incidents, he could have come into contact with the blood and bodily secretions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of inmates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Breaking up altercations and riots in an inmate population with an HIV infection level of 1 in 20, more than seventy times greater than the infection rate of the nonincarcerated population, is \u201cpeculiar to\u201d the decedent\u2019s occupation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>as a correction officer in the emergency response unit. These \u201cduties of the employment\u201d are not common occurrences in most of the working world, and are \u201cso distinctively associated with the [decedent\u2019s] occupation that there is a direct causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In affirming the commissioner\u2019s determination, the board stated that \u201cthe fact that HIV is unusually prevalent in the average [United States] prison population does not lead inexorably to the notion that a correctional officer\u2019s risk of being exposed to HIV is so high that it constitutes an occupational disease for that particular group of workers.\u201d Although this statement by the board is correct, it ignores the fact that the specific duties of employment for correction officers who are members of the emergency response unit required them not just to be in the presence of inmates with a high HIV infection rate, but to interact with them in a manner that greatly increases their risk of contracting the disease\u2014including breaking up fights, dealing with homemade weapons, and responding to medical emergencies. Similar to the duties of the dental hygienist in <em>Hansen, </em>the duties of employment for members of the emergency response unit requires participation in employment activities that increase their risk of exposure to a blood borne disease. See also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 700, 699 A.2d 52 (1997) (\u201cFor purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, the injury suffered by the claimant is the exposure to potentially fatal contagious diseases. That injury is no less real or cognizable because it was not attended by puncture or abrasion. See <em>Arkansas Dept. of Correction v. Holybee, </em>46 Ark. App. 232, 235, 878 S.W.2d 420 [1994] [in case involving correction officer bitten by HIV positive inmate, claimant\u2019s injury was not merely bite wound but also risk of infection); <em>Jackson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>Township Volunteer Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Wallet) </em>[594 A.2d 826, 828 (Pa. Commw. 1991)] [in case involving ambulance attendant who came into contact with HIV contaminated blood, claimant\u2019s \u2018injury was the risk of infection\u2019].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Therefore, in the present case, the decedent\u2019s HIV infection constitutes an occupational disease because his employment as a correction officer in the emergency response unit was more likely to cause this disease \u201cthan would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.\u201d <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>supra, 121 Conn. 667; <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 73. Other occupations conducted within the facility may not have the same level of risk due to different duties of employment. A janitor, for example, although working with the correction officer in the same facility, does not face the same level or risk of infection because of differing duties of employment. Although both are surrounded by inmates with a high infection rate, the janitor\u2019s duties of employment presumably do not require intimate physical contact with the inmates. The correction officer\u2019s duties of employment, however, distinctly require intimate physical contact with the inmates, often in situations where blood and other bodily fluids that transmit HIV are present. This distinction is enhanced in the present case due to the decedent\u2019s involvement with the special response unit. Furthermore, at the time the decedent was working as a correction officer, there was not extensive knowledge of HIV and its causes, nor the necessary safety precautions that the defendant employs today.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Our conclusion in the present case is guided by, and consistent with, our prior decisions on occupational diseases. Compare <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 73 (post-traumatic stress disorder was occupational disease for police officer involved in gun battle, which is peculiar to that occupation) and <em>Hansen </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number><em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 37 (hepatitis type B virus [HBV] is occupational disease for dental hygienists because of daily exposure to blood, other bodily secretions, and sharp instruments) with <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 579 (painter could not claim heart attack as occupational disease because both mental and physical stresses of painting were no more likely to cause heart attack than other kinds of employment carried out under same conditions), <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 353 (music teacher could not claim mental injury as occupational injury based upon false charges of sexual misconduct because such allegations \u201ccould arise in numerous occupational settings\u201d) and <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>supra, 121 Conn. 667 (tuberculosis was not occupational disease because seamstress occupation was not any more likely to cause disease \u201cthan would other kinds of employment carried on under the same circumstances\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the commissioner improperly determined that HIV was not an occupational disease for correction officers who are members of the emergency response unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">As Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on workers\u2019 compensation law indicates: \u201cAll states now provide general compensation coverage for occupational diseases. For the purpose of defining the affirmative inclusion of disease within this term, the older definition distinguishing occupational disease from accident has been largely abandoned, with its stress on gradualness and on prevalence of the disease in the particular industry. Jurisdictions having general coverage of occupational disease now usually define the term to include any disease arising out of exposure to harmful conditions of the employment, when those conditions are present in a peculiar or increased degree by comparison with employment generally. Thus, even a disease which is rare and which is due to the claimant\u2019s individual allergy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>or weakness combining with employment conditions will usually be held to be an occupational disease if the increased exposure occasioned by employment in fact brought about the disease.\u201d 3 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1999) c. 52, scope, p. 52-1. The cases cited by this treatise indicate that the more inclusive definition of occupational disease that we effectively adopted in <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gorden, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 38, is consistent with the national trend.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The defendant claims, however, that the facts found by the commissioner indicate that of all of the prior cases of occupational infection, only one involved a profession outside the fields of health care or research. In essence, the defendant argues that the lack of previous HIV infections among correction officers demonstrates that the commissioner properly found that HIV is not an occupational disease for that profession. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>rejected this argument as early as 1942 in <em>LeLenko </em>v. <em>Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>128 Conn. 499, 24 A.2d 253 (1942). In that case, this court concluded that \u201c [occupational diseases result ordinarily in incapacity in a relatively small proportion of the number of employees subjected to the risk; indeed if this were not so, economic considerations would require an abandonment of the employment or a change in its conditions to obviate the risk.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is nothing in the terms of our statutory definition of an occupational disease which suggests that to fall within it a disease must be one which is a usual or generally recognized incident of the employment, and the considerations we have suggested preclude our finding that such a legislative intent is to be implied. . . . When we [refer] ... to disease as being a \u2018natural\u2019 incident of the employment, we [use] that word in the sense that we have used it in defining proximate causation ... it imports not a forward look to determine what risks should have been foreseen, but a tracing back from the results to the circumstances out of which the disease sprang. ... If, so traced, a disease is the natural result of the conditions which are inherent in the employment and which attach to that employment a risk of incurring it in excess of that attending employment in general, an award of compensation is not precluded because the risk is one which has not become generally recognized or because only employees unusually susceptible will suffer from the disease.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 504-505. In other words, the workers\u2019 compensation law \u201cdoes not require frequent or typical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>exposure [to the disease] but only that there be a direct causal connection between the occupation and the disease. It is sufficient . . . [to] show that [the claimant\u2019s] contracting the disease, <em>no matter how rare, </em>or unusual, was occasioned by conditions characteristic of and peculiar to [the claimant\u2019s] job.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Camden Community Hospital, </em>359 A.2d 607, 612 (Me. 1976) (applying Maine\u2019s occupational disease statute); see also <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 38 (approving of reasoning in <em>Russell).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In addition, the defendant claims that concluding that HIV is an occupational disease of correction officers would turn the workers\u2019 compensation system into a general health benefit and insurance program, in direct contravention of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 32, as well as the intent of our legislature. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In <em>Hansen, </em>this court stated that \u201cthe legislature did not intend to impose upon the employer liability for diseases contracted outside the work place, or to transform the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act into a general health and benefit insurance program that would compensate an employee for all contagious diseases.\u201d Id. In the present case, the commissioner bifurcated the proceedings, and addressed only the jurisdictional question posed by \u00a7 31-294c. Because the commissioner found that the plaintiff had not met the jurisdictional provisions of that section, he was without jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs claim, and causation was never addressed. See <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 577 (concluding that, for commissioner to have jurisdiction over claim, claim must fit within jurisdictional provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-294, which was later repealed, and its jurisdictional provisions were recodified at \u00a7 31-294c). Had the commissioner found, as a jurisdictional matter, that the decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>HIV was an occupational disease, the plaintiff still would have had the burden of proving compensability.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In <em>Kolomiets </em>v. <em>Syncor International Corp., </em>252 Conn. 261, 266, 746 A.2d 743 (2000), we reiterated \u201cthe general test for compensability under our workers\u2019 compensation system. It is an axiom of [workers\u2019] compensation law that awards are determined by a two-part test. The [claimant] has the burden of proving that the injury claimed arose out of the employment and occurred in the course of the employment. There must be a conjunction of [these] two requirements ... to permit compensation. . . . The former requirement relates to the origin and cause of the accident, while the latter requirement relates to the time, place and [circumstance] of the accident.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Accordingly, a holding recognizing that HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers like the decedent here would <em>not </em>confer an automatic award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits upon the plaintiff, or upon any correction officer who has contracted HIV. Rather, on remand to the commissioner, the plaintiff still would have to establish that the decedent\u2019s HIV infection arose both \u201cout of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment as a correction officer in the emergency response unit. In other words, the plaintiff would have to show that the decedent\u2019s HIV infection actually was caused by his employment as a correction officer in that unit, and not another source.

This approach is not only contrary to the national trend recognized in Professor Larson\u2019s treatise, but was rejected previously by this court in <em>LeLenko v. Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>supra, 128 Conn. 505, and <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 38. More specifically, in support of its conclusion the dissent cites language in <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>118 Conn. 29, 41, 170 A. 146 (1934), stating 1hat, \u201c[ejvidence that lead poisoning would not naturally result from that particular kind of employment and that the hazard from it in that employment was not beyond that incident to employment in general would be proper.

Implicit in the defendant\u2019s issuance of this directive is a recognition that correction officers face a heightened risk of HIV infection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b787-6\">SULLIVAN, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1D\">concurring. I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \u201cis an occupational disease for correction officers who, like the decedent, are members of the defendant\u2019s correctional emergency response unit, and that, therefore, the plaintiffs notice of claim was timely filed under \u00a7 31-294c.\u201d I write separately to express my disagreement with the majority\u2019s determination that it need not decide in this case whether HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers who are not members of the emergency response unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The majority agrees with the workers\u2019 compensation review board\u2019s determination that \u201cthe fact that HIV is unusually prevalent in the average [United States] prison population does not lead inexorably to the notion that a correction officer\u2019s risk of being exposed to HIV is so high that it constitutes an occupational disease for that particular group of workers.\u201d The majority concludes, however, that the board improperly ignored \u201cthe fact that the specific duties of employment for correction officers who are members of the emergency response unit [require] them not just to be in the presence of inmates with a high HIV infection rate, but to interact with them in a manner that greatly increases their risk of contracting the disease\u2014including breaking up fights, dealing with homemade weapons, and responding to medical emergencies.\u201d Because the record shows that <em>all </em>correction officers, not only those who also serve in the emergency response unit, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>responsible for breaking up fights, dealing with homemade weapons, and responding to medical emergencies, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to limit its holding that HIV is an occupational disease to those correction officers who are also members of the emergency response unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In a deposition subsequently entered as an exhibit in the workers\u2019 compensation commission hearing, the decedent testified that he worked as a correction officer in the maximum security prison area for approximately one year<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before he became an emergency response unit member. In this area, the decedent was responsible for, among other things, responding to disturbances. Although he became an emergency response unit member in 1987, the decedent\u2019s primary job duties as a correction officer did not change after he became a member of that unit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those duties had required and continued to require the decedent to have physical contact with inmates on a daily basis. In addition, the decedent explained that, as a correction officer, he had worked in all of the living areas in the prison, including maximum, medium, and minimum security. In each area, the decedent had been and continued to be responsible for, among other things, \u201cstepping between people\u201d and \u201cphysically removing [inmates who were] either assaulting an officer or another inmate . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The decedent stated that he had been exposed to inmates\u2019 blood on several occasions when he had intervened during fights. On one particular occasion in 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>during his first year as a correction officer and before he became an emergency response unit member, the decedent was exposed to a significant amount of blood when he was one of the first officers to respond when an inmate, who was a known male prostitute, assaulted a prison shift commander. The decedent also was exposed to inmates\u2019 blood when responding to medical emergencies. In one instance, the decedent held pressure on an inmate\u2019s open wound. In addition, the decedent had received a puncture wound when his hand struck a razor blade during a cell shakedown.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Further testimony before the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) at the hearing bolsters the decedent\u2019s claim that, as a correction officer, he was subject to a high risk of exposure to inmates\u2019 blood. Fred Poole, a captain with the department of correction, worked at the Bridgeport correctional center from 1981 through 1987. He stated that it was common for correction officers to come into contact with inmates\u2019 bodily fluids, especially blood, when they responded to fights. Not all of these officers were members of an emergency response unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Edward Blanchette, the clinical director for the defendant department of correction since 1990, testified that correction officers are frequently called upon to break up inmate fights, which occasionally expose the officers to blood. He estimated that, on average, he responds two or three times per week to incidents involving bodily fluids and blood contact from fights in the inmates\u2019 quarters. He stated that \u201cblood contact where an officer is involved [in] breaking up a fight and there\u2019s blood being spilled ... or the officer has been cut and blood is an issue\u201d is considered a \u201csignificant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>exposure\u201d warranting the administration of antiretroviral medications (ARV therapy) for prophylactic purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He explained that studies have indicated that ARV therapy administered immediately after a very significant exposure would, if the virus had in fact entered the body, attenuate the virus\u2019 activity to such a degree that infection would not take place. He estimated that during the year 2000, three correction officers were exposed significantly enough to merit ARV therapy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The commissioner\u2019s factual findings also bolster the proposition that the decedent, while serving as a correction officer, before he joined the emergency response unit, was at high risk of exposure to inmates\u2019 blood. The commissioner determined that the decedent\u2019s \u201cduties <em>as a correctional officer </em>required him to maintain [the] security and safety of the public, inmates, and staff and to respond to emergency codes and break up fights.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, the commissioner concluded that <em>\u201c[correctional officers </em>could be exposed to blood and bodily fluids of inmates during the course of their employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commissioner also concluded that, while serving as a correction officer, the decedent would \u201cbreak up fights between inmates\u201d and \u201ccould also get involved with inmates who were having medical emergencies\u201d and that therefore he \u201ccould be exposed to their blood. \u201d Although it found that the decedent \u201cwas a member of a special team of correctional officers that responded to major disturbances and riots,\u201d the commissioner did not conclude in his factual findings that the decedent was potentially exposed to inmates\u2019 bodily fluids only while responding to incidents as an emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>response unit member, but not while responding to incidents as a correction officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Finally, even the majority concedes that the decedent\u2019s employment duties as a correction officer required him to respond \u201cto medical emergencies, altercations and other disturbances\u201d and that a \u201ccorrection officer\u2019s duties of employment . . . distinctly require intimate physical contact with the inmates, often in situations where blood and other bodily fluids that transmit HIV are present.\u201d The majority also concludes, and I agree, that the decedent\u2019s risk of exposure to such situations was increased by his involvement with the special response unit. The fact that the risk was increased for special response unit members does not mean, however, that the risk was not sufficiently high to constitute an occupational disease for correction officers who were not part of a special response unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Given the evidence presented at the workers\u2019 compensation hearing that intimate interaction with inmates is an employment responsibility for all correction officers, coupled with the commissioner\u2019s factual findings regarding that evidence, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to limit its holding that HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers solely to those officers who are also members of the emergency response unit. I note that the parties in this case, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner and the workers\u2019 compensation review board, considered the issue as involving all correction officers, not only officers who ar e emergency response unit members. I do not believe that it is appropriate for this court to create a subclassification within the class of correction officers when no one has advocated that position and it is not compelled by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Assume, hypothetically, that two correction officers, only one of whom is also an emergency response unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>member, contract HIV after responding to an incident and file claims beyond the one-year limitation period set forth in \u00a7 31-294c for accidental injuries. Under the majority\u2019s opinion, the correction officer who is not an emergency response unit member may be required to litigate whether his HIV infection is an occupational disease, and therefore subject to a three-year limitation period. I believe that it is wrong to leave correction officers in a state of uncertainty and to create the need for additional future litigation, with its attendant anxiety, delay, and expense, to obtain the answer to a question that already has been fully addressed in the present case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\"> The decedent stated that he was employed as a \u201cline officer\u201d for his entire term of service with the department of correction.

I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) constitutes an occupational disease, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (15), for correction officers, such as the plaintiffs decedent, employed by the defendant, the department of correction (department), as members of the department\u2019s emergency response unit. After a careful review of our prior decisions, I conclude that the majority, by focusing on causation to the exclusion of an increased risk of contraction, interprets the statutory definition too narrowly. Because the undisputed evidence before the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fourth district (commissioner) was that only one department employee in Connecticut has contracted HIV through workplace exposure, and that exposure was the result of a needle stick, I must conclude that correction officers who are members of the emergency response unit are not at an increased risk of contracting HIV. Accordingly, I further conclude that HIV is not an occupational disease for these correction officers. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Section 31-275 (15) provides that an \u201c \u2018[occupational disease\u2019 includes any disease peculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such . . . .\u201d Unlike the majority, I construe \u00a7 31-275 (15), as interpreted by our prior decisions, to require consideration of two factors. Not only must there be, as the majority acknowledges, a direct causal connection between the employment and the disease contracted, but there must also be an increased risk of incurring the disease from that employment. See <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>118 Conn. 29, 40-41, 170 A. 146 (1934); <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 664, 667, 186 A. 616 (1936); <em>LeLenko </em>v. <em>Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>128 Conn. 499, 505, 24 A.2d 253 (1942). In other words, the occupation must be such that an individual in that position is more likely to contract the disease than he or she would be in another occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Prior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 602 A.2d 560 (1992), on which the majority relies, this court has had numerous opportunities to consider the statutory language at issue in this appeal. This court first analyzed the definition of an occupational disease<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>supra, 118 Conn. 31-32, in which the plaintiff, a factory worker, claimed that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that could have established that lead poisoning constituted an occupational disease. This court stated that, \u201c[t]o come within the [statutory] definition an occupational disease must be a disease which is a <em>natural incident </em>of a particular occupation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>must <em>attach to that occupation a hazard </em>which distinguishes it from the usual run of occupations and is in excess of that attending employment in general.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Two years later, then Chief Justice Maltbie, the author of the <em>Glodenis </em>majority opinion, again addressed the issue in <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>supra, 121 Conn. 664. In that case, the plaintiff, a dressmaker, unsuccessfully sought to characterize tuberculosis as an occupational disease. Referencing the <em>Glodenis court\u2019s </em>definition, this court stated that, \u201c[tjhis definition requires that, to constitute an occupational disease, the disease must be a natural incident of a particular kind of employment, one which is <em>likely to result from that employment because of its inherent nature. </em>It does not include a disease which results from the peculiar conditions surrounding the employment of the claimant in a kind of work which would not from its nature be more likely to cause it than would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">This court further explained its interpretation of the definition of an occupational disease in <em>LeLenko </em>v. <em>Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>supra, 128 Conn. 499-500, in which a linotype operator claimed that dermatitis constituted an occupational disease. In affirming the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, as it pertained to linotype operators, dermatitis constituted an occupational disease, this court stated that, \u201c[w]hen we referred in <em>[Glodenis </em>and Madeo] to disease as being a \u2018natural\u2019 incident of the employment, we used that word in the sense that we have used it in defining proximate causation . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">In <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 38, this court concluded that hepatitis type B virus (hepatitis B) constituted an occupational disease as to dental hygienists. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Again citing <em>Glodenis, </em>the court stated that \u201cthe requirement that the disease be \u2018peculiar to the occupation\u2019 and \u2018in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment,\u2019 refers to those diseases in which there is a causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted by the employee.\u201d Id., 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Most recently, in <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 65, 73, 735 A.2d 321 (1999), we concluded that \u201c[a] gun battle ... is not a common occurrence in most of the working world.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Thus, \u201cit can be said that the plaintiffs [post-traumatic stress disorder/combat fatigue syndrome] was an occupational disease because his job and experiences as a police officer were <em>more likely </em>to cause this stress disorder than would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">This brief survey of our case law reveals that since 1936, we have consistently stated that an occupational disease must be a \u201c \u2018natural\u2019 incident of the employment\u201d; <em>LeLenko </em>v. <em>Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>supra, 128 Conn. 505; and must create \u201ca hazard which distinguishes it from the usual run of occupations and is in excess of that attending employment in general.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>supra, 118 Conn. 40-41.1 construe this language as contemplating consideration of both causation <em>and </em>increased risk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>LeLenko, </em>the phrase \u201c \u2018natural\u2019 incident\u201d refers to causation. <em>LeLenko </em>v. <em>Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>supra, 505. Likewise, I interpret the phrase \u201ca hazard which distinguishes it from the usual run of occupations and is in excess of that attending employment in general\u201d; <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>supra, 40-41; to refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>specifically to an increased risk of contraction. I reach this conclusion based upon this court\u2019s previous consideration of whether contracting a specific disease is more likely to occur as a result of the relevant occupation. See <em>Madeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>supra, 121 Conn. 667 (\u201cdisease must be . . . likely to result from that employment\u201d); <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 73 (\u201cexperiences as a police officer were more likely to cause [post-traumatic stress disorder/combat fatigue syndrome] than would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The majority, by relying on <em>Hansen </em>and its progeny, concludes that HIV is \u201c \u2018peculiar to\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018so distinctly associated with the [correction officers\u2019] occupation that there is a direct causal connection between the duties of the employment and the disease contracted.\u2019 \u201d I believe that by focusing on our case law emphasizing causation, the majority collapses what has been a two part analysis into a single inquiry into causation and fails to explore adequately whether correction officers who are members of the emergency response unit are at an increased risk of contracting HIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The present case is factually distinguishable from <em>Hansen, </em>because, in <em>Hansen, \u201call </em>the expert testimony revealed that dental professionals are at <em>an increased risk of contracting [hepatitis B] </em>because of their exposure to bodily secretions on a daily basis, as well as their use of sharp instruments that can puncture their skin, thereby allowing [hepatitis B] entry into their bodies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 38. Given this undisputed expert testimony, the <em>Hansen </em>court did not <em>need </em>to address whether dental hygienists were more likely to contract hepatitis B due to their employment. Such is not the case here. The record reveals no expert consensus regarding a correction officer\u2019s risk of contracting HIV. Therefore, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>labeling HIV as an occupational disease, we must consider whether a correction officer\u2019s risk of contracting HIV is greater than the risk attending employment in general. See <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>supra, 118 Conn. 40-41. On the basis of the evidence adduced before the commissioner, I must conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The expert testimony cited by the majority simply does not support its conclusion that \u201cthe decedent\u2019s HIV infection constitutes an occupational disease because his employment as a correction officer in the emergency response unit was more likely to cause this disease than would other kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Specifically, I believe that the majority unduly discounts the highly probative fact that the only work-related HIV infection in the correction department involved a health care provider infected by a needle stick. It is undisputed that health care providers are at an increased risk of contracting HIV due to their routine collection of blood and bodily fluids for diagnostic purposes, as well as their systematic handling of syringes, needles, and other sharp instruments that could lead to potential blood-to-blood contact. By contrast, in the course of their duties, correction officers who are part of the emergency response unit may be exposed to blood and bodily fluids via splash incidents, which occur when the blood or bodily fluid of an infected person comes into contact with the skin or mucous membrane of a noninfected individual. As the majority notes, however, the statistical HIV infection rate for splash incidents involving HIV infected blood is 0.09 percent, while the infection rate for needle stick injuries is 0.3 percent. Thus, a splash incident is substantially less likely to result in transmission of HIV than a needle stick, and emergency response correction officers are much less likely to contract HIV than health care workers. I therefore agree with the compensation review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>board that the risk of HIV exposure from a splash incident is so minimal, fortunately, that it is not an increased hazard of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">My conclusion that, on the facts of the present case, correction officers who are members of emergency response units are not at an increased risk for HIV infection is buttressed by the facts of <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 73, in which a police officer contracted post-traumatic stress disorder/combat fatigue syndrome following a \u201cgun battle.\u201d <em>Biasetti, </em>I believe, is illustrative of the proper factual foundation for concluding that an occupation creates an increased risk of contracting a disease. A \u201cgun battle,\u201d in the employment context, is exclusive to those professions that utilize firearms in the regular course of their employment, namely, law enforcement officials and military personnel. In other words, the use of firearms, a necessary tool of law enforcement, makes post-traumatic stress disorder/combat fatigue syndrome more \u201clikely to result from that employment because of its inherent <em>nature.\u201dMadeo </em>v. <em>I. Dibner &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>supra, 121 Conn. 667. The present case is factually distinguishable from <em>Biasetti </em>because there is nothing inherent in the duties of correction officers who serve on emergency response units that makes them more likely to contract HIV than \u201cother kinds of employment carried on under the same conditions.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s summary dismissal of relevant statistics suggesting that these correction officers are not at an increased risk, specifically, the fact that there has been only one documented case of occupational HIV infection in the department. The majority maintains that the absence of known instances of employment-related HIV cannot preclude classification as an occupational disease. I disagree that this highly probative fact can be ignored. Indeed, in <em>Glodenis, </em>this court stated that \u201c[e]vidence that lead poi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>soning would not naturally result from that particular kind of employment and that the hazard from it in that employment was not beyond that incident to employment in general would be proper. The fact that there were no known cases of lead poisoning among [employees] in other factories of the defendant where the same kind of work was being carried on as in that [particular factory] would be <em>relevant and material.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Glodenis </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>supra, 118 Conn. 41. The same can be said of the absence of employment-related HIV infection among correction officers who are members of emergency response units; the lack of reported cases is indeed \u201crelevant and material.\u201d Therefore, in assessing whether an increased likelihood of contraction exists among said correction officers, the dearth of HIV infection among them must be taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-6\"> This court\u2019s early decisions regarding the definition of an occupational disease, including <em>Glodenis, Madeo </em>and <em>LeLenko, </em>construed the relevant workers\u2019 compensation statute in effect at the time, i.e., General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5223. We note that \u00a7 5223, which defined an occupational disease as a disease \u201cpeculiar to the occupation in which the employee was engaged and due to causes in excess of the ordinary hazards of employment as such\u201d is, in pertinent part, identical to its successor, \u00a7 31-275 (15).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> Hazard is defined as \u201c[a] <em>risk </em>or peril, assumed or involved ... in connection with . . . employment.....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Accordingly, I use the terms \u201chazard\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\"> I am mindful of our subsequent decision in <em>LeLenko </em>v. <em>Wilson H. Lee Co., </em>supra, 128 Conn. 504, in which this court rejected a claim that a disease must be one that is \u201cusual or generally recognized . . . .\u201d This conclusion, however, does not mean that relevant statistics concerning a disease\u2019s prevalence within a given occupation cannot be considered. Rather, <em>LeLenko </em>merely indicates that prevalence alone is not dispositive of the issue. Prevalence certainly is indicative of an increased likelihood of contraction and should be considered as evidence of such.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
