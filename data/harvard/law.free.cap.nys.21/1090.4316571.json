The work contracted for was in itself lawful, and not apt to require, if properly done, any act which would be likely to cause injury. The defendant cannot, therefore, be held liable for the negligence of the contractor. The surprise which the plaintiff intimates was caused by the .evidence offered in behalf of the defendant was probably due to the fact that the complaint, in alleging that the defendant \u201cblasted the rock in'so careless * * * a way,\u201d allowed a general denial to leave in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>doubt whether it referred to the blasting or the carelessness or both. The authorities referred to upon the respondent\u2019s brief are in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
