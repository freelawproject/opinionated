Statute of Frauds\u2014Contract for One Year. A contract of employment of plaintiff as an actress, the employment to endure for \u201cthirty-five or forty weeks, perhaps a year, \u201d creates no obligation to employ for a year, and is not within the statute of frauds.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1031-9\">2. Breach of Contract\u2014Evidence of Custom. It appeared on trial, by plaintiff\u2019s admission, that she was discharged on two weeks\u2019 notice. The complaint alleged that she was employed by defendant as an actress for a certain season, and that she was wrongfully discharged. The answer denied this, and defendant testified that when he engaged plaintiff he told her it was on \u201ctwo weeks' notice on either side,\u201d which phrase had a well-known meaning in the theatrical profession. <em>Held, </em>that defendant was not precluded from testifying to the meaning of \u201ctwo weeks\u2019 notice on either side, \u201d because he did not specially plead his right to discharge plaintiff on two weeks\u2019 notice; such evidence tending to disprove the alleged breach of contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1031-11\">3. Same. The error of excluding defendant\u2019s testimony as to the meaning of the phrase in question was not cured by his being permitted to testify subsequently to his own understanding of the phrase, since that did not show plaintiff\u2019s understanding of it, and there was no evidence what her understanding of it was; nor by a charge to the jury that \u201cdefendant testifies positively that he told plaintiff it [her employment] was on two weeks\u2019 notice. If you find that it be so, of course you find that that was the contract, not a custom.\"</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1031-13\">Appeal from city court, general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1031-14\">Action by Annie Haines against Denman Thompson and George W.

Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 3191; Wilmore v. Flack, 96 N. Y. 512; Smith v. Pryor, 16 Daly, 169, 9 N. Y. Supp. 636. The contract of employment was made in June, 1888; the services thereunder to commence on the 23d day of August following. It was oral, and, construing the evidence most favorably for defendants, was to the effect that the employment should endure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>\u201c thirty-five or forty weeks, perhaps a year.\u201d No obligation was thereby created to continue the employment for a year, and hence the contract was not within the statute of frauds, and was not required to be in writing. Blake v. Voigt, (N. Y. App. filed May 31, 1892,) 31 N. E. Rep. 256. But we are of the opinion that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence offered by defendants which tended to show that the words \u201c two weeks\u2019 notice on either side \u201d had a definite and well-understood meaning in the making of contracts for theatrical services, and that plaintiff so understood them. In Hannay v. Zerban, 16 Daly, 372, 11 N. Y. Supp. 577, we held that paroi evidence of the meaning of a somewhat similar phrase was inadmissible to add to the contract. But that was the case of a written contract, and so is inapplicable here. Nor was the error excluding the evidence in the present case cured because defendant Ryer was subsequently permitted to testify to his own understanding of the phrase, since that did not show plaintiff\u2019s understanding of it; or because the court charged the jury that \u201c defendant testifies positively that he told her [plaintiff] it was on two weeks\u2019' notice. If you find that to be so, of course you find that that was the-contract, not a custom.\u201d No evidence which tended to show that plaintiff understood the phrase in any particular sense was permitted to go to the jury. It appeared on the trial, from her own admission, that plaintiff was discharged upon a previous notice of two weeks. The complaint alleged that plaintiff was employed for the season commencing on or about August 23, 1888, and ending on or about June 1, 1889, and that\"she was wrongfully discharged. The answer denied this. Defendant- Ryer, with whom the contract was made, testified that at the time of making it he said to plaintiff: \u201cYou.must become engaged here like all the rest of the company; two weeks\u2019 notice either side.\u201d He further testified that the phrase -\u201ctwo weeks\u2019 notice either side\u201d had a well-known meaning in the theatrical profession, and the question, \u201c What does it mean? \u201d was excluded, on the ground that the right to terminate the employment upon two weeks\u2019 notice was not specifically pleaded by the answer. It is, however, a well-settled rule of pleading that under a denial the defendant will be permitted to give in evidence anything which disproves the allegations of the complaint, (O\u2019Brien v. McCann, 58 N. Y. 373,) and by showing what the contract really was, that it was not as alleged in the complaint-, (Marsh v. Dodge, 66 N. Y. 533; Bien v. Abbey, [Com. Pl. N. Y.] 13 N. Y. Supp. 286; Wheeler v. Billings, 38 N. Y. 263; Hier v. Grant, 47 N. Y. 281.) Evidence that \u201c two weeks\u2019 notice either side \u201d was part of the contract tended to disprove that the contract was as alleged in the complaint, and evidence that this phrase was understood by both parties to mean that either party was at liberty to terminate it upon two weeks\u2019, previous notice to the other certainly tended to disprove the alleged breach of contract on defendants\u2019 pari,\u2014the wrongful discharge- of the plaintiff. The attempted proof of the meaning of the phrase \u201c two weeks\u2019-notice either side \u201d was not to show that there was a custom in the theatrical profession whereby either of the parties could, upon two weeks\u2019 notice to the other, terminate any .contract, but that, if defendants\u2019 version of the contract be true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>a seemingly obscure part of it was understood by both contracting parties in a particular sense. The evidence offered and excluded thus tended to establish an integral part of the contract. The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide ,the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
