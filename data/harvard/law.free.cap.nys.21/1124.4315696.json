The contestants filed the usual objections to the will, but they were not pnly unsubstantiated, but they were disproven by the proponent of the will. The appeal is destitute of merit, and the decree should be affirmed, with costs of the appeal to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
