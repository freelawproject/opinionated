These causes of action, although embraced in one count, are distinct and separate, and one of them, certainly, is not referable. The one upon account stated does not involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the examination of a long account, and certainly the defendant is entitled to a trial by jury. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs- and disbursements of appeal, and the motion denied, with $10 costs..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
