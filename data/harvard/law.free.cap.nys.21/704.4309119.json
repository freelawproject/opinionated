If such assessment was levied against the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>unittee, then the case of People v. Tax Com\u2019rs, 100 N. Y. 215, 3 N. E. Rep. 85, is authority for the proposition that such assessment is void. But upon an examination of the record we are of opinion that the commissioners of taxes, in levying this assessment, intended to and did assess the lunatic, and not the committee. This view is sustained by the provisions of the New York consolidation act, (section 818,) which requires that the assessed valuation of all personal property shall be entered by said commissioners in books or records in alphabetical order of the names of persons and corporations subject to taxation; and in the record of assessment for personal taxes this assessment is found under the letter L, the proper place for the entry of such assessment, if it was the intention of the commissioners to assess the personal property of the lunatic, but not the proper place for such entry if they intended to assess the committee as representing the lunatic. Therefore, it being. \u2022clear as to the intention of the tax commissioners in levying the assessment, the question remains as to whether, by the addition of the words to the assessment \u201cby U. S. Trust Company, Committee,\u201d and attaching the place of business of the committee, and the ward in which such place of business \"was situated, such assessment has been invalidated. We cannot find any authority, either in principle or in adjudication, to \u25a0sustain such- a conclusion. These additions were mere surplusage. The assessment would have been perfectly good without any of them appearing upon the record; and, where the intention clearly appears, it \u25a0does not seem to us that the action of the tax commissioners should be invalidated, simply because they have done too much, by offering more facilities than they were required to do by law to the committee for ascertaining what tax has been levied against the lunatic. We are of \u2022opinion, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the petition dismissed, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
