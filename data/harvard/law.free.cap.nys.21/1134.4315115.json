The action seems to have been carefully tried. No exceptions were taken to the admission or rejection of evidence, and a fair preponderance of evidence sustains the findings of the court below, and justifies the judgment. It follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
