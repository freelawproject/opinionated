Plaintiff was engaged in oiling the machine, the engine having been stopped, and it was started without warning to him, and he was cut by the knives. \u2022 Plaintiff contended that defendant was negligent in not having a loose.pulley, so as to render the machine independent of the power, and controllable by those in charge of it, and also in not having the knives on the machine protected by a guard, as was usual with such machines. He also contended that there should have been a bell rope or some other means of communication between the engine room and the man at the machine; and that the engineer, who was not regularly employed in that capacity, was incompetent.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b217-16\">Argued before DYKMAN and PRATT, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-17\">Roger M.

The accident was caused by the action of the engineer, a coemploye, for which the employer is not liable to a fellow servant. We do not find that negligence of defendant was shown, and must affirm the nonsuit. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
