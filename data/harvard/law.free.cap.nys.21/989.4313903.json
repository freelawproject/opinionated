Appeal\u2014Review\u2014Sufficiency of Evidence. On appeal from the general term of the city court of New York, affirming a judgment entered on the verdict of a jury in plaintiff\u2019s favor, the general term of the court of common pleas is not permitted to search the evidence for its sufficiency to support the verdict, in the absence of a proper exception founded on the motion for dismissal of .the complaint, or the direction of a verdict for defendants.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1029-9\">2.

Witness\u2014Impeachment. In an action for the contract price of thermometers manufactured by plaintiffs, at defendants\u2019 instance, for use as an advertising medium in defendants\u2019 brewing'business, evidence that for a long time before the contract was entered into thermometers had been in general and notorious use as a medium of advertisement is admissible to impeach one of defendants\u2019 witnesses, who testified that he was induced to make the contract on the faith of plaintiffs\u2019 false representation that thermometers were a novel and original medium of advertising in the brewing business, and that plaintiffs had not theretofore supplied any brewers with them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1029-15\">Appeal from city court, general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1029-16\">Action by Allen R, Pharo and others against Beadleston &amp; Woerz for defendants\u2019 breach of contract to accept and pay for a quantity of thermometers manufactured by plaintiffs, at defendants\u2019 instance, for use as an advertising medium in the latter\u2019s brewing business. Defendants claimed, by way of defense, that they were induced to make the contract by alleged material misrepresentations of plaintiffs\u2019 agent. From a judgment of the general term of the city court (19 N. Y. Supp. 816) which affirmed a judgment entered on a verdict in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and which also affirmed an order denying defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial on the minutes, defendants appeal.

Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 3191; Wilmore v. Flack, 96 N. Y. 512; Smith v. Pryor, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 636. And without proper exception, founded upon a motion for dismissal of the complaint, or that a verdict be directed for defendants, we are not permitted to search the evidence for its sufficiency in support of the verdict. Barrett v. Railroad Co., 45 N. Y. 628; Schwinger v. Raymond, 105 N. Y. 648, 11 N. E. Rep. 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-21\">On plaintiff\u2019s direct examination he was asked: \u201cFor what purpose did you call upon defendants after they had refused the thermometers?\u201d This question was allowed, against objection by defendants\u2019 counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>but, in view of the fact that the witness had theretofore testified to the purport of his visit without objection, the answer was mere reiteration. No ground of defendants\u2019 objection was given, and so the exception is ineffectual. Cruikshank v. Gordon, 118 N. Y. 178, 23 N. E. Rep. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-3\">Alfred M. Beadleston, a witness for defendants, was asked on his direct examination: \u201cDid he [meaning plaintiffs\u2019 agent] say anything as\u2019 to whether any other brewer had such thermometers?\u201d This was clearly leading, and so properly excluded, but, assuming the exclusion of the question to have been error, it was waived, and the exception thereto rendered ineffectual, by the witness testifying, without objection, to the next two following questions of defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cGo oil and state anything else he said;\u201d and \u201cwas anything said as to other breweries having these thermometers; and, if so, what?\u201d Neil v. Thorn, 88 N. Y. 270, 277; Crosby v. Day, 81 N. Y. 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The remaining exceptions present but one question, and may therefore be considered collectively. The defense was that, at the time of entering into the contract for supply of the thermometers, Beadleston, representing the defendant corporation, stated to Bonnell, plaintiffs\u2019 agent, that defendants desired an advertising medium for the brewing business, of novel and original design in that line of business; that Bonnell represented that plaintiffs had not theretofore supplied any brewer with the thermometers; that, relying upon the truth of this representation, he (Beadleston) was induced to make the contract on defendant\u2019s behalf; and that it subsequently transpired that the representation was false and untrue. Beadleston\u2019s testimony tended to establish this defense, and to disprove it plaintiffs were permitted to introduce evidence from which it appeared that thermometers had for a considerable time before the making of the contract been extensively and notoriously used, in the city of New York and elsewhere, as an advertising medium in a variety of businesses other than that of a brewer.\u2019 To the introduction of this evidence, defendants objected on .the ground that the fact in issue was whether or not thermometers had been previously used as an \u2018 advertising medium in the brewing business, not whether or not they had theretofore been used for such purpose in any business. The objection was overruled, and due exception taken. We are of the opinion that the evidence was properly admitted. The credibility of a witness is always in issue, and evidence of any fact which tends to impeach it, or to demonstrate the improbability of the truth of .his assertions, is relevant to the issue, and admissible. Beadleston, having concluded the contract for defendants, was chargeable with its improvidence, and directly interested in its avoidance. His credibility was for that reason a main element for the consideration of the jury in reaching a conclusion concerning his alleged motive in making the contract,\" and his communication of that motive to plaintiffs\u2019 agent. Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 191, 25 N. E. Rep. 402. Evidence \u2022 tending to show that thermometers had for a long time before the contract with defendants been in general use as a medium of advertisement unquestionably affected the probability of the truth of Beadleston\u2019s assertion that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>induced to make the contract because he wanted a medium \u201cof novel and original design\u201d in the brewing business, and the jury were at liberty to infer therefrom that the claimed importance of the exclusion of thermometers, as a means of advertising, from other breweries, was a mere subterfuge resorted to by defendants to rid themselves of a contract improvidently made by their agent. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. \u00bbA11 concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
