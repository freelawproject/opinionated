In an action to recover for services rendered, plaintiff gave evidence of a custom to pay a certain sum for such services, but there was no other evidence as to the amount which plaintiff was entitled to recover. The court charged that the recovery must be restricted to the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the services. <em>Held, </em>that an objection that there was no evidence of such \u201creasonable value \u201d would not be considered, when raised for the first time on appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1149-18\">Appeal from circuit court, Kings count)1-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1149-19\">Action by Alfred B.

The only question as to which there can be any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>doubt is as to the amount of compensation to which plaintiff is entitled. In respect to that question defendant has no ground of complaint. After various witnesses had testified too custom by which plaintiff would be entitled to 5 -per cent, upon the loss, as adjusted, the court refused to hear further evidence on that subject, and charged the jury that the recovery must be restricted to the reasonable value of the services. Defendant now claims that no proof was given of the \u201creasonable value\u201d of the services, and that the verdict must' be set aside for that reason. Had that point been raised at the close of the testimony, it cannot be doubted that the omission to show, in express terms, the \u201creasonable value,\u201d would have been obviated. It is plain that both court and counsel considered that proof of a custom to pay 5 per cent, was evidence which the jury might consider upon the question of \u201creasonable value.\u201d In this \"we find no error, and the verdict must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
