In an action against a constable and an attaching creditor for conspiracy to ruin plaintiff\u2019s business by seizing and selling his property under the attachment, it is error to exclude evidence that plaintiff suffered judgment by default in the action wherein the attachment was granted, and that the property was sold under that judgment, as such evidence tends to negative the-conspiracy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b465-13\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Action by William W.

To establish such conspiracy, plaintiff \u2022was allowed -to show that such an attachment was granted, and that -defendants seized the property of Weinhandler, and caused it to be sold. The court, under objection and exception, would not allow the \u2022defendants to show that judgment was given against Weinhandler- by \u2022default'in the action in which the attachment was granted, and that ihe property was sold under such judgment. We think this evidence -would have tended, at least, to negative the alleged conspiracy, and \u25a0therefore should have been admitted. We deem it unnecessary to dis\u2022cuss the other questions raised \"on the appeal, as the judgment and order must be reversed for this error, and new trial granted, with costs .to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
