McAllester for goods sold and delivered. From an order striking out defendant\u2019s answer as sham, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b807-11\">The first paragraph of complaint alleges a sale of goods between January 17, 1891, and September 13, 1891, by the firm of Henry Huber &amp; Co. to defendant, of the value of $341.48, no part of which has been paid. The second para-, graph alleges an assignment of this claim by the seller to the plaintiff, a foreign corporation having a principal office in the city of New York. The third paragraph, for a separate cause of action, alleges that plaintiff is a foreign corporation having a principal office in the city of New York. The fourth paragraph alleges a sale of goods by plaintiff to defendant between February 3, 1893, and March 18,1893, of the.'reasonable value of $43.05, and admits payment of 94 cents. The answer, omitting formal parts, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b807-12\">\u201c First. He admits the allegation in the first and fourth paragraphs of the complaint that the firm of Henry Huber &amp; Company and the Henry Huber Company sold him certain goods, wares, and merchandise, but he denies each and every other allegation in said paragraphs contained. Second. Defendant has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the facts stated in the second and third paragraphs of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and therefore he denies' the same. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b807-13\">Argued before EHRLICH, C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO-\">The proofs on the part of the plaintiff clearly show that the defendant never supposed he had any defense to the action. He practically acknowledged the debt in a letter written after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>suit was threatened, and promised to make no trouble, but confess the debt. The defendant\u2019s affidavit in answer to the motion fails to point out any defense. He ought, under the circumstances, to have disclosed something meritorious in answer to the motion for judgment. Though courts seldom grant motions to strike out sham defenses, the power exists, (Code, \u00a7538,) and may be exercised where it is apparent that the object of the plea was merely to create delay, annoy the plaintiff', or trifle with the court, (Hadden v. Manufacturing Co., 1 Daly, 388.) While such power exists it must be sparingly exercised. It was not abused in this instance, and the order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
