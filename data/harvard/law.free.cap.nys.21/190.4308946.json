Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 873, provides, with respect to the examination of parties before trial, that \u201cthe judge to whom such an affidavit is presented must grant an order for the examination, if an action is pending. \u201d <em>Heid </em>that, where the evidence sought by such examination is material and necessary, the party applying is entitled to the same as of right; but the exercise of discretion in determining whether the evidence is material and necessary will not be disturbed on appeal, in the absence of a clear abuse thereof.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">Appeal from special term, St. Lawrence county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-10\">Action for personal injuries by Emma Kelly against the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad Company.

Watts v. Wilcox, (Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 647; affirmed in 133 N. Y. 672, 31 N. E. Rep. 626. A party litigant may, in the discretion \u25a0of the judge or justice to whom application is made, upon complying with the provision of sections 870, 872, and 873<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Code of Civil Procedure, have a general examination of his adversary as a witness in the case, as well before as at the trial; and such examination is not limited to an affirmative cause of action or an affirmative defense. Herbage v. City of Utica, 109 N. Y. 81, 16 N. E. Rep. 62. This case somewhat .modifies the law as held in some former cases, and is understood by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>many of the profession. That discretion is to be exercised on the line indicated in Watts v. Wilcox, supra; and while this court has aright to review such exercise of discretion by the justice, it will not reverse his decision unless it appears very clearly to the court that error has been \u2022committed. In this case I cannot see that any such error has been committed. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs, and printing and \u25a0other disbursements. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-15\"> Section 870 provides that \u201cthe deposition of a party to an action pending in a \u25a0court of record, or of a person who expects to be a party to an action about to be brought in such court, * * * may be taken at his own instance or at the instance of an adverse party, or of a coplain\u2019tifE or codefendant, at any time before trial, as prescribed in this article.\u201d Section 872 provides that \u201cthe person desiring to take a deposition, as prescribed in this article, may present to a judge of the court in which the action is pending * * * an affidavit, \u201d etc. Section \u2022'873 provides that \u201cthe judge to whom such an affidavit is presented must grant \u25a0an order for the examination, if an action is pending, \u201d etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
