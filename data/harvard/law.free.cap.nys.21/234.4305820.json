Plaintiff also introduced expert witnesses who testified as to the value of the apple trees, grapevines, and currant bushes destroyed, as they stood upon the land at the time of the fire. Defendant\u2019s evidence \"showed that the grass and weeds had been cut along the line of defendant\u2019s roadway, that the most approved' appliances for arresting sparks from the engine were used at the time, that the fire box of the engine was so constructed that no fire could escape without the aid of the engineer, and that the engine was in perfect condition.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b275-6\">Argued before MAYHAM, P.

Whether the defendant in this action was or was not guilty of negligence in permitting this fire to escape, or whether it did originate from fire from defendant\u2019s locomotive, was a question of fact which was properly submitted to the jury by the trial judge; and \"the same is true of the question whether the defendant negligently suffered or permitted dry and .combustible matter to accumulate upon its track or roadway. Nor do we think the court erred in receiving evidence upon the question of damages. -His ruling upon that question is fully sustained by the case of Argotsinger v. Vines, 82 N. Y. 313, 314.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was fairly and clearly submitted to the jury by the charge of the judge upon the disputed questions of fact, and we cannot say that the \u25a0evidence did not sustain their verdict. The motion, therefore, for a new trial upon the merits was properly denied, and we see no error committed by the trial judge for which this judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-15\"> In this case the court said: \u201cIn an action to recover damages for an injury \u2022done to the inheritance, it is held that it is competent for a witness to give his \u2022opinion as to the value of the farm with the timber on, and the value after it wot \u25a0\u2022taken off. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
