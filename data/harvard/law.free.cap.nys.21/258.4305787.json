By contract a mortgage was assumed, upon which, at the time, was some accrued interest. When the parties met to consummate the contract and pay the purchase money, plaintiff, who furnished the money, by mistake paid the interest item to defendant, who has ever since kept it, and thereafter plaintiff was obliged to pay the mortgagee the amount of said item. Alter the purchase was made, Enders transferred all his right and interest in the property to plaintiff. Thereafter the plaintiff demanded the <em>money </em>overpaid from defendant, and, upon refusal, brought this action, and was nonsuited below upon the ground that there was a defect of par- \u25a0 ties. I am unable to see how this result can be legally reached. If we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>assume that the money produced by plaintiff was partnership money, yet it was only so to the amount agreed upon as the purchase price; so that, when he made a mistake arid overpaid, it was his money and his mistake, and he alone had an interest in its recovery back; and, when recovered, it belonged entirely to him. The matter was independent of the real-estate transaction. That embraced the land, and its purchase price was a joint charge upon the plaintiff and Enders, but it w'as limited to that; and when plaintiff made his mistake, and paid more money than he should, he was-the only one that suffered, and the law should right him. It is immaterial to the question whether Enders was liable for a proportion of the money so paid to plaintiff', as that matter would necessarily turn upon other questions than the purchase of the land, like whether he w'as responsible for the mistake, etc.; but that question would be entirely independent of the joint venture, except as the circumstance furnished the occasion for the mistake. Since the mistake was made, Enders has part\u00e9d with all interest in the land to plaintiff, and now plaintiff seeks to make defendant repay him his money, and is driven out of court because he has not associated with him a person who has not the slightest interest in the money. The Code (section 449) commands that every action shall be brought in the name of the real party in interest. As the plaintiff is entitled, and he alone, to the money to be-recovered, and as it was his money when paid, he would seem to fall within the designation of a,\u201cparty in interest.\u201d The action was therefore properly brought, and the judgment dismissing his complaint should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
