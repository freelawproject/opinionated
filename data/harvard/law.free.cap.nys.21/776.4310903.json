We think the court properly submitted the case to the jury, who were fully justified in finding that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused, by the negligence of defendant, and without contributory, negligence of the former. Peil v. Reinhart, 127 N. Y. 381, 27 N. E. Rep. 1077;. Laws 1888, c. 583, tit. 14, \u00a7 26; Willy v. Mulledy, 78 N. Y. 310; McRickard v. Flint, 114 N. Y. 222, 21 N. E. Rep. 153. We see no reason to disturb the verdict on the suggestion that the weight of evidence-is against it, or that the damages are excessive, for the suggestion, in-both instances, is unfounded. Error cannot be predicated upon any of the' other exceptions called to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">Judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
