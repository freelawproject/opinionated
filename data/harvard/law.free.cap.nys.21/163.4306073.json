Jr., was appointed administrator of his goods, etc. At the time of the death of the intestate he owned three several mortgages, mentioned in the complaint. One of the mortgages was for $900, and another was for $1,000. Andrew Outterson, Jr., while acting as administrator, to wit, on the 4th of February', 1890. caused to be prepared discharges of each of the last, two mentioned mortgages, which were executed as administrator; and it is found as a fact \u201c that no consideration for either of said discharges passed or accrued to said estate in any manner\u201d however. They were placed upon record in the clerk\u2019s office of Lewis county immediately after having been executed. Subsequently, Andrew Outterson, Jr., was removed,, and the plaintiff appointed administrator of- the deceased\u2019s estate, and brings this action, among other things, for the purpose of having restored the two mortgages to record, and having the discharges thereof canceled. Such relief is awarded by the judgment in this \u2022case. The defense interposed by Frank Dilts is to the effect that he took the mortgage for $8,700 in January, 1891, covering the mortgaged premises, and placed the same upon record, and that it is a prior lien to the two mortgages of $900 and $1,000, respectively'. On the 6th of December, 1889, the defendant Frank Dilts entered into a written agreement with Andrew Outterson and Francis E. Outterson, \"whereby it was agreed that he should furnish for the said Outtersons machinery to the amount of $8,500, to be put into a paper mill situated \u2022on the premises known as the \u201cPaper Mill Lot, \u201d of about 25 acres, in Lyonsdale, Lewis county. \u201cSaid contract provided that the machinery should be paid for by annual payments of $1,00.) for seven years, and $1,500 the eighth year, from and after 30 days from the shipment of said property bv Dilts, With interest an-, nual\u2019iy; and also provided that said payments should be*secured by the personal bond of said Outtersons, with a real-estate mortgage, as collateral thereto, covering the land in question, which mortgage should be the first lien upon said premises; and said contract also provided that said bond and mortgage should be made, executed, and delivered to said Dilts, together with an official abstract of title, showing said mortgage to be a first lien, on the thirtieth day after said shipment of said property, as aforesaid. \u201d The said contract also provided that in the mean time the title of the property agreed to be furnished by' Dilts should be and remain in him. The machinery was furnished, the defendant completing the furnishing thereof in September, 1890. Defendant\u2019s right to receive the mortgage became consummate in October, 1890, but the same was not executed until January, 1891, when the parties assembled at Boonville, \u201c defendant Dilts taking a bond and mortgage of the Outtersons. covering the premises in question, for the sum of $8,700; which was the amount specified in the contract, with interest. \u201d That mortgage was recorded on the 14th day of January, 1891. It is found as a matter of fact \u201cthat said Dilts never had any actual notice or knowledge of either of said two mortgages of $900 and $1,000, respectively, until some time after the recording of his $8,700 mortgage in question. \u201d It is also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cthat said Frank Dilts was not a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration as to his mortgage of $8,700.\u201d Also, \u201cthat the. defendant Dilts was not such a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice of either of the two mortgages above mentioned, of $900 and $1,00Q,' respectively, at the time he took and recorded, his $8,700 mortgage. \u201d In the evidence given by Andrew Outterson, Jr., it appears that he told Dilts, prior to the execution of the contract for the purchase of machinery, that the real estate upon which it was proposed to place the machinery was mortgaged. The witness says: \u201cI told him the mortgages that were on the mill. There was. in the first place, what we call the 1 W.oolworth Mortgage,\u2019 of $3,000; then there was a $900 mortgage of mine and a $1,000 mortgage.of Frank\u2019s, given to my father, \u2014 call it in just square numbers, say nothing about interest, or anything of the kind,\u2014$5,000.\u201d' As conclusions of law the court found \u201cthat defendant Dilts is not a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice of either of said mortgages, executed to secure the payment of $900 and a $1,000, respectively, as to his $8,700 mortgage;\u201d also, \u201cthat the plaintiff is entitled to priority of payment of said mortgage executed by Andrew Outterson, Jr., to Andrew Outterson, Sr., to secure the sum of $900; * * * also for the payment of a mortgage executed by defendant Francis B. Outterson to said Andrew Outterson, Sr., * * * to secure the payment of the sum of $1,000 * * * over said $8,700-mortgage held by said Dilts. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b204-5\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqfa\">On. the 6th day of December, 1889, when the Outtersons entered into the contract with Dilts ior the purchase of the machinery, and placed the same upon the premises, they became obligated to pay therefor, and their liability or debt accrued'on the close of that contract. When the machinery was delivered and the contract fulfilled, in September, 1890,'their obligation to pay for the machinery, as purchasers thereof, became absolute. True, Andrew had agreed to give a first mortgage, and had also stipulated that the title to the property might remain in the vendor as security for the obligation or debt assumed in the purchase of the property; but, according to the finding, it was to remain in Dilts until the arrangement for a mortgage was consummated. Apparently, when the arrangement for a mortgage was consummated, the legal title to the machinery passed from the vendor, and to that extent it may be said that there was a surrender of the title by the vendor at the time of receiving the mortgage of $8,700; and to that extent he \u201cactually parted with some value or some right upon -the faith of the\u201d mortgage. Cary v. White, 52 N. Y. 141. And in taking the mortgage it may be said that he parted with a prior security, to wit, the legal title of the property furnished in pursuance of the contract. Weaver v. Barden, 49 N. Y. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">It is found' in the twenty-first finding of fact \u201cthat said Frank Diltswas not a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration as to his mortgage of $8,700;\u201d and in the third conclusion of law it is found \u201cthat defendant Dilts is not a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice of either of said mortgages, executed to secure the payment of $900 and $1,000, respectively, as to his $8,700 mortgage.\u201d Inasmuch as the trial- judge found that there was no actual notice, and based his decisi\u00f3n on the fact that there was no consideration parted with lor the $8,700 mortgage at the time it was taken, as to which we-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>think he was in error, a new trial should be ordered. Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
