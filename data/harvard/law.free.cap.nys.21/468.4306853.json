Action by August Marschall and others against the Eisen Vineyard Company to recover damages for breach of a contract to sell a car load of wine. From a judgment entered on a verdict for plaintiffs, and an order denying a motion for a new trial, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-11\">The contract was evidenced by_ telegrams which passed between plaintiffs, in New York city, and defendant, in California, and which were as follows: On June 27th plaintiffs sent to defendant a telegram. \u201cWill you ship us one or two cars sherry?\u201d and on June 27th defendant answered, \u201cCan furnish one, perhaps two, cars sherry, fifty-two and one-half cents, including cooperage, against thirty days\u2019 acceptance. \u201d On June 28th plaintiffs telegraphed defendant, \u201cAt prices quoted, former terms, you can ship two cars by Sunset route. \u201d On June 29th defendant sent a telegram, \u201cPrice net, fifty-two and one-half cents, without any rebate.

Taken together, the telegrams contain all the essential elements of a contract, viz. parties, considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tian, subject-matter, and assent. Therefore I say that they establish a legal contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The testimony further shows a violation by defendant of said contract and its refusal to carry out the same because the wine was sold to some other person. The plaintiff\u2019s damages because of such violation is clearly established, and the judgment rendered\u2014$475\u2014is fully justified by the testimony submitted, and is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
