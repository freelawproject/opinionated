On a motion by defendant for a change of venue, where there is evidence that plaintiff was not a resident of the state at the commencement of the action, a counter affidavit of plaintiff that he was domiciled in such state at that time is insufficient, since \u201cresidence,\u201d and not \u201cdomicile,\u201d is the criterion.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b682-11\">\u25a0 Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-12\">Action by Reuben I.

The fact that he was not a resident of this county is clearly established. The plaintiff, in answer to the affidavits of the defendant and of three witnesses, showing, his residence in New Jersey, seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>avoid the force of these affidavits by asserting that he is not a nonresident of the.state, and that he is a resident of Spring Valley, in Rock-land county; but he does not state that he was a resident of Rockland county at the time of the commencement of the action. He adds that he was domiciled in Rockland county prior to the commencement of the action, but residence, and not domicile, is the criterion. As the proof of the plaintiff\u2019s nonresidence at the time of the commencement of the action is not met by anything stated in the plaintiff\u2019s opposing affidavit, the motion should have been granted. The order should therefore be reversed, with the usual costs and disbursements, and the motion to change the place of trial to Cayuga county granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
