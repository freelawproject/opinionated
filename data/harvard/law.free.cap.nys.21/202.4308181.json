The fact that a sale was made on Sunday is no defense to an action by the purchaser, after he has rescinded the sale, to recover the price paid, since the invalidity of the contract of sale is no excuse for retaining the money.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-15\">Appeal from Kings county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-16\">Action by Theodore Maurer against Armand Wolff and Jules Wolff to recover for money paid by plaintiff to defendants \u25a0 for a horse which plaintiff bought from them and afterwards returned.

Within that time the horse was returned to the vendor, who received it without objection so far as appears. This action is brought to recover back the price paid for the horse on the original purchase. No defense is pleaded except that the original sale was made on Sunday, which is clearly frivolous. If the sale was invalid, that affords no reason why defendant should be allowed to keep money belonging to his neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
