It is quite clear that, the action does not involve the examination of a long account, within the \u25a0meaning of section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the plaintiff should succeed on the only real issue in the case, i. e., as to the agreement of the assignees of Clark &amp; Kline to pay said mortgage, on which issue defendants are entitled to a trial by jury, a reference might \u2022be afterwards ordered, if desired, to take proof as to the portion of plaintiff\u2019s recovery that each defendant should pay. Drexel v. Pease, (N. Y. App.) 29 N. E. Rep. 241; Thayer v. McNaughton, 117 N. Y. 111, 22 N. E. Rep. 562; Camp v. Ingersoll, 86 N. Y. 433. The order should be reversed, with costs and printing disbursements, and the motion for a reference denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
