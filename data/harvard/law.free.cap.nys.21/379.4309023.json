Lawrence, for life. The will disposed of the subsequent estate in these words: \u2018I give and devise the aforesaid several tracts of land, after the decease of my daughter, Phebe T. Lawrence, to the children which she now has or may hereafter have living at the time of her \u2022death, as tenants in common, to them, their heirs and assigns, forever.\u2019 At the time of the execution of the will and of the death of the testator, Phebe T. Lawrence had three children living. They all died before her, two of them leaving \u25a0descendants. She died on June 30, 1889. The question presented by this application is whether the descendants of her children take anything under the provisi\u00f3n which has been quoted from the will of Elias Smith. I think they do, both upon a grammatical construction of the language employed by the tes'tator, and upon the authority of the decision of the court of appeals in Re Estate of Brown, 93 N. Y. 295. According to a literal interpretation of the words used, the testator seems to have contemplated a gift over, in which two classes of his daughter\u2019s children should participate: First, those already in being at the time he made his will; and, secondly, those who should be born subsequently, and should survive their mother. The first class were to take in any event; that is to say, the remainder vested in them as soon as the life estate vested in the mother. The \u2022second class could not take unless they were living at the time the life estate terminated, by the mother\u2019s death. The will clearly separates by the disjunctive \u2018 or \u2019 the children which she has from those which she .may hereafter have, and the phrase \u2018 living at the. time of her death \u2019 is apparently designed to apply only to the latter class, thus having reference not to children in existence when the will was executed, but to such children, if any, as should come into existence afterwards. In further confirmation of-the correctness of this view, it should be noted that it was wholly unnecessary for the testator to speak of the children \u25a0which his daughter then had (at the time of the making of the will) if his purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>had been merely to make a devise o,ver to those who should be living when their mother died. It would have been enough to devise the remainder to the children of Phebe T. Lawrence, living at the time of her death. Now, under the rule laid down in Be Estate of Brown, supra, the right of the issue of the deceased children of Phebe T. Lawrence to take the remainder, limited upon the mother\u2019s life estate, must be maintained, if the testamentary provision in question is capable of a construction which will lead to that result. There the testator bequeathed and devised the remainder over 1 unto such child or children as my said daughter shall have or leave living at her decease.\u2019 The court of appeals, as was said in the later case of Patchen v. Patchen, 131 N. Y. 433, 435, 34 N. E. Bep. 695, solved this ambiguous expression by reference to other provisions of the will, and to the preference which the law gives to the participation of issue in a remainder. In the case at bar we have a similar ambiguity, which I think can well be solved by adopting the construction which has been suggested.

I give and devise to.my daughter, Phebe T. Lawrence, during her natural life, the eastern part of the farm where I now live,\u201d etc.; also three other tracts of land; also equal undivided one half of a tract of thatch land. \u201cIgiveand devise the aforesaid several tracts of land, after the decease, of my daughter, Phebe T. Lawrence, to the children which she now has or may hereafter have living at the time of her death, as tenants in common, to them, their heirs and assigns, forever.\u201d These are the lands in this action.' The said Elias Smith died April 20, 1839, made the will January 21, 1839, and' same was probated 25th of May, 1839, as a will'of real and personal property. At. the time of the death of testator, Phebe T. Lawrence was living, and then had three children. She died January 30, 1889, not having had any more children. She survived all of these three children, but she left grandchildren. \u25a0 The question is whether on the death of Elias Smith the fee of the part of the estate which was devised to Phebe for life vested in her children then living, and therefore now belongs, to the grandchildren of said Phebe and their representatives. This question was fully discussed by the learned judge at special term, and I see nothing that needs to be added to the argument contained in his opinion. Many arguments may be suggested upon either side, but it comes down to a question of intent, to be solved by reference to ambiguous expressions contained in the will. We think this case fairly falls under the role laid down in Re Estate of Brown, 93 N. Y. 295, and that calls for an affirmance of the judgment; Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
