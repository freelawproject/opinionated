The trial court found that the mortgage in question was not given in fraud of creditors; that it was for a valuable consideration, and was a bona fide transaction. The appellants cannot avail themselves of the neglect to file the mortgage, because during the time it was not on file they were not creditors, within the meaning of the statute. Laws 1833, c. 279.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The debt was not contracted during that time, and they were merely creditors at large. \u201cThe term 1 creditors of the mortgagor \u2019 has been defined by these decisions to be a creditor armed with some legal process which authorizes him to seize the property, such as an execution issued upon a judgment, or an attachment. A mere creditor at large, without some process for the collection or enforcement of his debt, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>in a position to question an unfiled mortgage, given by his debtor, which is otherwise valid.\u201d .

St. (8th Ed.) p. 2508, provide that \u201cevery mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a <em>mortgage of goods </em>and chattels hereafter made, which shall not be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and be followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged, shall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, unless the mortgage, or a true copy thereof, shall be filed as directed in the succeeding section of this act. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
