At the time of her death she was the owner of the premises known as \u201c57 Lansing Street.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint alleges that the deceased, for a valuable consideration, in her lifetime, \u201cbeing then the owner in fee and in full possession of the premises hereinafter described, executed, acknowledged, and delivered to him, and for his sole use and benefit and behoof, an instrument in writing, by which she duly granted and conveyed to him in fee simple, and to his heirs and assigns forever, he to have, take, and hold the same absolutely, although the interest or right to the possession thereof was postponed until the death of the said grantor, and by the terms thereof the said premises and real estate. \u201d etc. Plaintiff also alleges that after the death of his mother at the homestead \u201ca due and diligent search was made, and also a due inquiry, among the papers and effects of the said deceased, and in all places where the same would be likely to be found, but that he could find no trace nor information sufficient to ascertain as to what became of the said deed and instrument as above described, although the same (upon record) bears date February: 25, 1884; and after the due acknowledgment thereof, and the due recording thereof, was duly and by the said acting county clerk, A. H. Ballou, Esq., duly and in person handed over and delivered by the said clerk to the said Ellenor Perry, the said grantor therein named, and should have been found among her papers and effects and in and about her said residence, and which abstraction or destruction of the said deed and instrument was so accomplished in some manner unknown to this plaintiff, and cannot be accounted for unless it was mutilated or burned or destroyed by the two said defendants Mary Jane and Catherine Perry, or one of them. <em>\u201d </em>It alleges that the defendants mentioned \u201chad ample opportunity so to do;\u201d and it alleges that the said defendants have presented to the surrogate of Oneida a will made December, 1887, by the mother. The plaintiff asks that the instrument of 1884 \u201cbe declared and adjudged as valid and subsisting deed and grant of the premises, * * * whether as a lost or destroyed will or a lost or destroyed deed,\" and as provided by law, and so adjudged by the court and upon the proofs adduced. \u201d The defendants, in an answer, admitted the death of Ellenor Perry, and that the parties to this action are her sole heirs surviving at law, and denied the other allegations of the complaint; and they also, in their answer, allege that Ellenor Perry was the owner of lot 57, Lansing street, Utica; and they allege that on the 3d day of December, 1887, she then executed and published in proper form of law her last will and testament, and set out a copy of the same, and that it was by her delivered to the attorney who drew the same, and retained by him until after her death, when it was delivered to the surrogate of Oneida for probate. It is found that the will of the 25th of February, 1884, was made and executed, and that on the.29th of October Ellenor Perry delivered it to the clerk of Oneida county at his office; that the clerk made a memorandum of the receipt of the same, and recorded the same, and that the same was delivered to Ellenor Perry December 10, 1885, \u201cwhen she carried it away. \u201d It is found \u201cthat on or about December 3, 1887, but without the knowledge of the plaintiff, the said instrument above set forth was thrown into a stove and burned by the said E. J. Ball, at the direction of Ellenor Perry, which act he (said Ball) had previously and upon the same occasion advised her she had a right to do, and which act was done in her presence and in the presence of W.

Nothing appears in the instrument of February, 1884, indicating that it was intended as a deed of the premises mentioned therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">2. Nothing appears in the evidence adduced at the trial indicative that the deceased intended the instrument to operate as a deed or conveyance of the premises. On the contrary, the language of the instrument, and the evidence of the circumstances under which it was executed, unite in indicating that the instrument was intended as a last will and testament of the deceased, Ellenor Perry. She therefore had the right to revoke the same during her life. It is well settled that, where a will is not found, to be in existence at the time of the death of the testator, there is a presumption that it was revoked. It was said in Holland v. Ferris, 2 Bradf. Sur. 335:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">\u201cIf a will proved to have been executed, and to have been in the possession of the decedent, cannot be traced to the custody of another, or cannot be found, the presumption of law is that it has been destroyed anima revocandi. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">It was provided in section 67 of the Revised Statutes, as appears at page 153, vol. 3, (5th Ed.) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">\u201cNo will of any testator who shall die after this chapter shall take effect as a law shall be allowed to be proved as a lost or destroyed will unless the same shall be proved to have been in existence at the time of the death of the testator, or be shown to have been fraudulently destroyed in the lifetime of the testator. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">This section fell under the eye of Judge Mason for construction in Knapp v. Knapp, 10 N. Y. 278, and, after quoting the portion of the section above given, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">\u201cThis statute recognizes the former common-law rule by requiring proof either that the will was in existence at the time of the death of the testator, or that the legal presumption that the testator destroyed it anima revocandi be overcome by satisfactory proof that it was fraudulently destroyed in the lifetime of the testator. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">In that case it was held there was not sufficient evidence to authorize a submission to the jury of the question whether the will in controversy was in existence at the death of the testator, and, a fortiori, not sufficient to justify proof of its contents. In Re Nichols, 40 Hun, 387, it was held, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-17\">\u201cWhere a will, which was last seen in the possession of the testator, cannot be found after his death, the legal presumption is that he destroyed it for the purpose of revocation. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">It seems the plaintiff supposes this action may be maintained to establish the instrument of February, 1884, as a lost will, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the provisions of article 3, tit. 3, Code Civil Proc., containing sections-1861-1867, inclusive. It is provided in section 1865 of the Code as-follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cBut the plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment establishing a lost or destroyed, will, as prescribed in this article, unless the will was in existence at the time of the testator\u2019s death, or was fraudulently destroyed in his lifetime. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">It was therefore incumbent upon the plaintiff, in order to bring his-case within the provisions of the sections to which reference has been made, to establish that the will of 1884 was in existence in 1891, at the time of the death of Eilenor Perry, or that it was fAudulently destroyed in her lifetime. No satisfactory evidence of either fact was given upon the trial. On the contrary, it does appear by evidence-that the will was, by her act, destroyed on the 3d of December, 1887. There was not sufficient evidence given upon the hearing to warrant the court in giving the relief provided for by the sections of the Code relating to establishing a lost will. We are therefore of the opinion that the trial judge properly held that the instrument of February, 1884, was not a deed, and that, upon the evidence before him, it could not be established as a lost will. We think no error was committed upon the-trial calling for an interference with the conclusion reached, and that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
