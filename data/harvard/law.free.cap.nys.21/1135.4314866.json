We have carefully examined the record, and cannot find such a preponderance of evidence in support of the defendant\u2019^ contention as to warrant us in disturbing the order made by the learned judge below. The order appealed from must be affirmed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
