J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGV\">The action was for negligently running.into the plaintiff\u2019s cab, whereby he sustained damage, etc. Plaintiff\u2019s driver had temporarily stopped on defendant\u2019s track to receive directions, and, while receiving them, the defendant\u2019s car ran into the cab, and did 'the-damage. There were snow banks on each side of the street, and the plaintiff\u2019s driver had the right (notwithstanding defendant\u2019s right of way) to drive his cab over that portion of the highway covered by the defendant\u2019s tracks. He did not see the car, and had no warning of its approach. He was not unnecessarily obstructing the track, but receiving-orders in reference to his cab, which, on account of the snow, he could not receive nearer the sidewalk. The driver of the cab did not anticipate danger, and, as a rule, none was to be anticipated from a horse car, as there is always time for warning. At all events, the questions-whether (1) the defendant was guilty of negligence, and (2) the plaintiff free from it, were for the jury, being matters about which minds might differ. This case was one for the jury, the verdict satisfactorily sustained by the evidence, the damages not excessive, and no errors-committed which require a new trial. It follows that the judgment and order denying the motion for a new trial must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
