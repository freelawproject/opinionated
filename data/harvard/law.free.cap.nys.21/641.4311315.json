In an action on a certificate of insurance issued in the name of defendant, the Expressmen\u2019s'Aid Society, to plaintiff\u2019s husband, plaintiff sued defendant as a foreign corporation. The answer alleged that defendant was a voluntary association, and not a corporation. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the title of the summons so as to substitute as defendants the names of the persons constituting this voluntary association was properly granted, plaintiff having sued the right body of persons, but under the wrong name, being misled by the.conduct of the parties carrying on the business in the name of the \u201cExpressmen\u2019s Aid Society. \u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b681-8\">S.

Evoy. The allegation of the original complaint was that the defendant was a foreign corporation, organized under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Ohio. The answer alleged that the defendant was a voluntary association, and \u25a0not a corporation. A motion was accordingly made by the plaintiff to amend the title of the summons so as to substitute in the place of \u201cEx-pressmen\u2019s Aid Society\u201d the names of the persons constituting this voluntary association. The moving affidavits show that the defendant \u25a0had no president or secretary residing in the state of Hew York.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">We think the order in this case was properly made. The appeal is taken in the name of the \u201cExpressmen\u2019s Aid Society.\u201d The order, as \u25a0made and entered, required the respondent to serve all the defendants \u25a0named as constituting the persons forming the voluntary company. There is no doubt but that the plaintiff intended to sue the company doing business under the name of the \u201cExpressmen\u2019s Aid Society.\u201d She made a mistake in the name of the parties conducting the business in the name of that company. The person served was a member of the voluntary association. The action appears, therefore, to have been brought against the right body of persons, but under the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>name, and hence it was eminently proper for the court to make the amendment asked for in the notice of motion. There is no such corporation as the \u201cExpressmen\u2019s Aid Society,\u201d but there is a body of men doing business under that name, one of whom, it was shown, was served with the original process in the action against the \u201cExpress-men\u2019s Aid Society.\u201d The case is unlike those relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant, where a party had actually sued a real corporation for a cause of action existing against a copartnership. But there is no such complication in the papers on this appeal. Indeed, opposition to the motion seems to have been rather technical than substantial; for, even if the appeal had been taken by the parties who were brought in and substituted in the place of the defendant, they would hardly be expected to succeed, for the reason that their own conduct, by using the name of \u201cExpressmen\u2019s Aid Society\u201d in the transaction of their business, misled the plaintiff. Much less could the appeal be expected to be successful when taken in the name of a corpo- . ration that had no existence whatever. The special term, we think, properly refused to impose any terms of making the amendment. This manifestly was upon the ground that the plaintiff had been misled by the conduct of the parties carrying on the business in the name of the \u201cEx-pressmen\u2019s Aid Society.\u201d The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Order appealed from affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. \u2022 All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
