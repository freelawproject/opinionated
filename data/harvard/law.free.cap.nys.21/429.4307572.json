We see no reason to disturb this finding of the jury, that the goods were not delivered. The testimony that the goods were to be retained by defendant at his own risk till they were actually delivered upon plaintiff\u2019s orders was clearly admissible, under the pleadings, to show that it was the intention of the parties that nothing short of actual manual delivery, on plaintiff\u2019s orders,, should be deemed a delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
