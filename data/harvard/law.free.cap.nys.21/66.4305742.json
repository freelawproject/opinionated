Thereafter an order was granted at special term discontinuing the cause. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney opposed the .discontinuance, and asks to be allowed to amend the summons and complaint in important respects, and to continue the action, with the purpose of establishing and perfecting his lien upon the cause of action, and thereby enforcing the payment of his fees. Where a collusive settlement of an action has been made for the purpose of defrauding an attorney of his fees, the court will sedulously seek means to prevent the fraud and protect the attorney\u2019s rights; and it may well be that in such a case the court would grant needed amendments, and allow the action to be prosecuted to judgment. In the present case we find no evidence that the settlement was intended to be hostile to the claims of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney or that his rights are in fact imperiled. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff disputes or is unable to respond to the claims of her attorney. The plaintiff makes an affidavit in support of her attorney, and the apparent object of the opposition now made to the discontinuance is to require the payment by other parties to the action of the fees of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. We do not think a case is made justifying the continuance of the action for that purpose. Order affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
