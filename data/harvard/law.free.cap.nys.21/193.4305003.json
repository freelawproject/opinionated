Upon the trial the plaintiffs recovered a verdict of six cents damages. The judge who held the circuit refused to give a certificate that title to land came in question, but the clerk, notwithstanding such refusal, allowed and faxed a full bill of costs to the plaintiffs. Upon the motion of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fendant the court at special term vacated the taxation, and ordered the clerk to tax costs in favor of the defendant. From that order we have this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">There was no claim in the complaint in this action for an invasion of the possession of the plaintiffs, or for any injury to the freehold, and it- was therefore unnecessary for them either to allege or prove their title. It follows that no question of title arose either upon the plead-\" ing or upon the trial, and the plaintiffs can recover full costs upon no other ground. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
