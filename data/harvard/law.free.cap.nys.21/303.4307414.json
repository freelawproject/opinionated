The duty of plaintiff was to. help fill the buckets and attach them to the fall, after which he gave the signal, and the steam power was applied on deck, and the bucket hoisted to a point above the combings of the top hatch. At this point a Burton fall was attached to the bucket, with the intention of pulling it - sideways, so as to swing it over the side of the ship and dump it on the dock. One bucket stopped just below the combings of the hatch, and there the-Burton fall was hooked to it. Power was then applied to both the main fall and the B.urton fall, but the power applied to the main fall failed to move it, and that applied to the Burton fall pulled sideways on the load, and, dashing the bucket against the side of the hatchway, overturned it, and spilled its contents through the hatch.way into the hold. Plaintiff was standing under the wings of the ship, about 12 feet from the hatchway, in the hold, and some pieces of the iron bounded from the casing of the shaft and struck him on the foot, necessitating the amputation of two of his toes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the rope or main fall was not properly fastened to the hoisting machinery, but was left loose, so that it could not be-properly held in its place when the buckets were hoisted, and that a fellow servant, whose duty it was to attend the gangway and assist in discharging such buckets, was wholly incompetent for the performance of such work, all of which was well known to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s-evidence showed that he had worked as longshoreman for 12 years, and was fajniliar with the danger accompanying the loading and unloading of vessels: that six or seven buckets had been dumped into the hold on the same morning, and in the same way as the one which caused the injury; that the gangway man was competent, and that the method of hoisting the iron was the one-commonly used for such purposes.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b344-10\">Argued before BARNARD, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">There is no proof of neglect upon the part of the master. The plaintiff was an employe whose place was in the hold of a steamship. His duty was to fill the buckets with short bars of iron. The loaded bucket was raised by steam. When the bucket reached the top of the combings of the top hatch, it was, by another employe, pulled sideways and dumped on the dock. There is an entire absence of proof tending to show any defect in the appliance which was used. The bucket was strong, and the-rope sufficient. The only cause of the accident was' that the bucket was not raised sufficiently to clear the top of the' hatchway, and thereby the bucket was overturned. The method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of unloading vessels was a common one. \u201cIt was an ordinary and customary way to unload heavy freight,\u201d as was stated by the plaintiff upon the trial. The mode of using the hoistway apparatus was changed a little while before the accident. The bucket had, for some' reason, dumped its load. It was a common occurrence for the bucket to turn out its load if it hit anything. The cause of the accident- in question is not very clear to me from the evidence. The appliance was safe when it was properly used. The plaintiff was therefore properly nonsuited. Cregan v. Marston, 126 N. Y. 568, 27 N. E. Rep. 952. Exceptions overruled, and .judgment for defendant in the nonsuit, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
