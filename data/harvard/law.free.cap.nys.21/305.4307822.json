He went through the front gate, and walked to and past the house into the back yard, where the grass was, and where defendant\u2019s manager was waiting for him. While passing through the yard back of the house, a large dog owned by defendant, and kept by her in the yard, jumped on him, tore his coat and vest, and lacerated his right arm. Two witnesses testified that the dog was dangerous, and defendant admitted on the trial that he had bitten a person on her premises before, and that she gave such person five dollars in settlement of the matter. Plaintiff was unable to attend to his usual work of running a peddling wagon for six or seven weeks, being compelled to carry his arm in a sling for that length of time. He did not\" plead the loss of his daily earnings as an element of damage, but at the trial he introduced evidence to show what such earnings were. The case was tried before a jury, and a verdict rendered in favor of plaintiff for $100.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b345-14\">Argued before BARNARD, P.
