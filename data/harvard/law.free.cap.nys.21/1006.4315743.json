The defense interposed was infancy, and a counterclaim for the amount paid on the property. There was no dispute but that default had been made in the payment of the installments, but it was contended that the action was prematurely brought, because the defendant was an -infant, and no action could be maintained against her. This would be true if the action were founded \u2022upon a contract, but replevin never is. . The basis of this action is a tort, and it is stated in the affidavit for the immediate claim and delivery of the property that the defendant wrongfully detained the same. This is abundantly supported by the evidence in the case; for it appears that when the marshal, at the plaintiff\u2019s request, sought to obtain possession of the machine under the claim and delivery papers, the defendant-and her mother not only refused to give up the machine, but endeavored to secrete the same, and claimed that it had been sold. This, if true, would have been a conversion of the property, and a- wrong against the plaintiff. Infants are liable for their torts, and may even be indicted for the same. \u201cIf an infant is old and cunning enough,\u201d says Lord Chancellor Cowper, \u201cto contrive and carry out a fraud, he \u2022ought to make satisfaction for it.\u201d 2 Eq.

Where the infant pleads his minority to escape payment of the purchase price, the seller may rescind the sale, apd replevy the goods. Badger v. Phinney, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">Although an infant must be personally served with the summons, yet, before a valid judgment can be obtained against her, a guardian ad litem must be appointed. That was regularly done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">Appellant\u2019s counsel contends that, even if the action can be main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>tained, she ought to have been allowed the amount she paid upon the contract of purchase. But this, we think, is not sound, as it was expressly agreed it should be regarded, in case of default, as the value of the use of the property during the time she had it; and we cannot say that that was at all unreasonable, because it is manifest that the use of the machine must have greatly deteriorated its value. Besides, the conditioned bill of sale must be regarded as an executed contract, as far as the payments actually made were concerned, and infants cannot recover on such contracts. Crummey v. Mills, 40 Hun, 370. The case of Green v. Green, 69 N. Y. 556, was peculiar, and the court expressly states that it was to apply only to the facts in that case. Infants cannot return property without paying actual damage to it. The vendor must be put in statu quo. Bartholomew v. Finnemore, 17 Barb. 428; Gray v. Lessington, 2 Bosw. 257. In this case, however, the defendant did not attempt to return it, but, on the other hand, sought to prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
