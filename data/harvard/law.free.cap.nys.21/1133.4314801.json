We have carefully examined the record, and cannot find such a preponderance of evidence in support of the defendant\u2019s contention as to warrant us in disturbing the order made by the learned judge below. The order appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
