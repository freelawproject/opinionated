A ratification by the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u2022of Nugent\u2019s act, however, appeared from the testimony of one Deutsch, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, such testimony being to the -effect that subsequent to the sale and the delivery of the merchandise to Nugent, one of the defendants, Wehnke, with knowledge of all the circumstances, told Deutsch, with reference to the merchandise, that it was <em>\u201c </em>all right,\u201d and in his \u25a0presence instructed one Fausten, the defendant\u2019s representative, to pay the plaintiff the amount of its demand. The motion for dismissal of the complaint, made when the plaintiff rested its case, was, therefore, properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The motion for dismissal of the complaint was not renewed, nor was the direction of a verdict .for the defendants asked for when both sides had concluded their introduction of evidence and the cause was about to be submitted to the jury. Hence, we are precluded from all inquiry as to whether at that stage \u2022of the action there was sufficient evidence to support, a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Schwinger </em>v. Raymond, 105 N. Y. 648; <em>Paige </em>v. Chedsey, 4 Misc. Rep. 183; <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>Id. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In his charge to the jury the trial justice, commenting upon-the defendant Wehnke\u2019s promise to pay the plaintiff\u2019s demand, said : \u201c If you believe this testimony, such a promise would be sufficient consideration for the payment of this bill and would make the- defendants liable as original debtors,\u201d to which the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted as follows: <em>\u201c </em>I except to the proposition that if this promise was made it made the -defendants the original debtors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">It is beyond all controversy that the ratification by the alleged principal of a contract made by another who assumed in that-regard to act as the former\u2019s agent is an adoption of the contract by such alleged principal and subjects him to liability thereunder the same as if the contract was sanctioned by him at its inception. 1 Am. &amp; Eng.
