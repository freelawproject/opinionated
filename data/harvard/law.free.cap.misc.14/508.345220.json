'The intending lessee replied that if security for that period were insisted upon, the negotiation might as well be abandoned. Eventually it was agreed between the parties that the lessee might furnish sureties for two years only. Upon this condition the plaintiffs consented orally to become sureties for payment of the rent and performance of the covenants of the lease. Invited to execute the security agreement, plaintiffs objected that it did not contain the two years\u2019 -limitation; to which the lessor answered that insertion of the limitation was unnecessary that it was in the lease, and that the plaintiffs wer\u00e9 security for two years. Thereupon the plaintiffs executed this paper: \u201cIn consideration of the letting of the premises within described, and for the sum of one doll\u00e1r, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, we do hereby become security for the punctual payment of the rent and performance, of \"the covenants in the within agreement mentioned, to be paid and performed by Frederick Cook, and if default shall be made therein, we hereby promise and agree to pay unto Stephen V. R. Cruger, trustee,'as landlord, such sum or sums of money as will be sufficient to make up such deficiency and fully satisfy the conditions of the said agreement without requiring any notice of nonpayment, or proof of demand being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">\u201c Given under our hand and seal the '22d day of August,. 1891. \u201c Henry .H.

HcGbeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">1 It is conceded that for the first two years of the lease the rent was paid in part by plaintiffs, the sureties. The defendant lessor'claiming to hold' plaintiffs for rent' accruing \u25a0 after the lapse, of. those two years and for breach of covenants subsequent to that period, the action is brought for reformation \u25a0of the s'ecurity agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The relief prayed is a reformation of the agreement s.o that it shall bind the surety for a period of two' years only, instead of, as now read, for the full t\u00e9rro of ten years.' The complaint alleges that it was \u25a0 the intention of plaintiffs and defendant to limit the said security \u2014 on the lease \u2014 to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>years only, and that the defendant, with knowledge of such intention, represented that it was unnecessary to provide for the two years\u2019 limitation in the agreement, since the lease contained such provision. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Upon consideration of the lease and agreement in connection, the learned trial ijndge concluded that the plaintiffs are bound only for two years. If- this be so, then judgment for the defendant is the inevitable legal corollary. For, if by a just construction of the instrument its true meaning is already such as is sought to be imparted by the proposed reformation, no occasion exists for the interposition of equity. <em>Oakville Company </em>v. <em>Tack </em>Company, 1 Silv. Ct. App. 414; 105 N. Y. 658. The security agreement, .however, is silent as to the extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 liability, and even when read in conjunction with the lease, if permissible, its import is still so doubtful and obscure that its'reconstruction is proper, provided the necessary conditions of the relief be apparent upon the proofs. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The security agreement, we repeat, does not limit the plaintiffs\u2019 responsibility to a period of two years ; and yet that so to coniine it was the mutual intention of the parties is clear upon the evidence. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs executed the agreement with knowledge of its terms and of the fact that they fail to express the, common purpose. Without more, such execution of the instrument would oppose an insuperable bar to .its reformation. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>McLarty, </em>75 N. Y. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The proof, however, is clear and convincing that the plaintiffs would not have executed it in its incomplete condition but for the assurance of the defendant that the insertion of , the agreed term of limitation was unnecessary, and that already, by force of the provision in the lease, the plaintiffs were bound only for a period of two years. The mistake of the plaintiffs, then, was as to the legal effect of the instrument; but this mistake of law suffices for its reformation, . because induced by the act of the adverse party. <em>Haviland </em>v. <em>Willets, </em>141 N. Y. 35; <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>94 id. 243, 247. Supposing merely a mutual mistake as to\u2019 the legal effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the. .instrument, its1 execution, induced by the positive assurance of the defendant, entitled the plaintiffs to the relief of reformation. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Hibernia Ins. </em>Co., 67 N. Y. 283; Pom. Eq. Juris. \u00a7 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The defendant argues that even when corrected by insertion of the stipulated limitation, the agreement, in effect, still binds plaintiffs for the ten years\u2019 rent. Assuming th\u00e9 relevancy of the jioint to the question of reformation, the contention is untenable. The obvious and indisputable intention of the parties was that the plaintiffs should be bound only two years, whether for payment of rent or performance of other covenants; and they are not responsible for the lessee\u2019s failure, on the expiration of their liability, to furnish other security.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u25a0 But one of the defendant\u2019s exceptions to evidence is of sufficient plausibility to justify, comment, and that is to the proof of the conversation between the lessee and his surety. Defendant had agreed to. accept security for two years, and had authorized the lessee to procure it. Of course, \"on applying to a contemplated surety it was necessary to inform him of the terms of the lease; and .such is the sum and substance of the criticised colloquy. The testimony was neither offered nor admitted as evidence of the agreement between the' defendant \u25a0 and the surety, of which, indeed, the proof is otherwise abundant and unexceptionable. <em>Tenney </em>v. Berger,. 93 N. Y. 524, 531.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Our conclusion is for affirmance of the judgment, but with a modification. The agreement executed by the plaintiffs was as security for payment of the rent and performance of the covenants of .the lease; and the obvious inference from the .evidence- is that such was the intention of the parties. Indeed, the plaintiffs have never challenged tile guaranty of cove-' nants, neither before executing the agreement \u25a0 nor in their-prayer for judgment, The alteration of the instrument, therefore, by expunging - the guaranty of covenants, was. unauthorized, and the clause stricken out must be reinstated..</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">nevertheless, the court ruled rightly in refusing the redress, upon motion. In his decision the learned trial judge adjudged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the plaintiffs to be entitled to a reformation omitting the guaranty of performance of covenants \u2014 manifestly a judicial det\u00e9rmination of a substantial right. A modification of a judgment at Special Term may be made only to correct clerical errors or mistakes, or to conform the record to the decision. <em>Bohlen </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>121 N. Y. 546, 550 ; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>137 id. 550. A judicial mistake or error is remediable only by a rehearing or appeal from the judgment. <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>14 Hun, 472; <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>25 id. 529. Here the appeal is from each and every part of the judgment, and, as the court erred in its decision, the error is before us for correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The judgment must be modified so as to read: \u201cWe do hereby become surety for the punctual payment of the rent- and performance of the covenants in the within agreement-mentioned, to be paid and performed by Frederick Cook, for a period of two years from the beginning of the term of said lease, to wit, the first day of January, 1892,\u201d etc., and, as so-modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The order for an additional allowance is untenable <em>(Chris</em>topher, <em>etc., R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Twenty-third, etc., R. R. Co., </em>48 N. Y. St. Repr. 805; 20 N. Y. Supp. 556; <em>Conaughty </em>v. <em>Saratoga, etc., Bank, </em>92 N. Y. 401), and must be reversed. The order denying the motion for resettlement of the decision, and judgment is affirmed. No costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Halt, Oh. J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Judgment modified and as modified affirmed. Order for additional allowance reversed. Order denying motion for resettlement of the decision and judgment affirmed.
