The-jury found,'\u00f3n conflicting testimony, that the wife of the., plaintiff, just prior to her injury, was -a'strong, healthy woman,, about thirty-eight years of age, and that ever since the injury she has beep a confirmed invalid; that her \u2022 health will not. improve, and that during her future life she will be a Burden to her husband and not a comfort ;\u25a0 that she never can be a wife to hini again. The future damages to the plaintiff are, in a certain sense, speculative, and yet the law leaves it to a. -jiiry to decide the amount in actions of this kind, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>such damag\u00e9s are reasonably Certain. The preponderance of\u2019 evidence is with the plaintiff as to the good health of his wife-prior to her injury, and it appears that, at the date of trial, she was a physical wreck, and will always so continue. The-verdict, though large, does not seem to us, in view of the evidence, to be the result, of passion, prejudice or sympathy.
