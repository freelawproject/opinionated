Also, from the proof adduced as foundation for the offer, it appeared that access to this purported constitution was accorded the members of the society at its office, but that it did not exist in printed form.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The justice below refused to receive the document in evidence, under exception, and this ruling we must hold to have been erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Eelevant and material the evidence' certainly was. Even without intrinsic reference to the constitution made in the policy of insurance, such instrument, if shown to be in existence, controls, may supplement and is presumed to be understood as an integral part of the contract itself when made between a benevolent institution and its member. <em>Supreme Commandery </em>v. <em>Ainsworth, </em>46 Am.

Its existence being proven; as'we have said, the members are presumed to be cognizant of its terms. -By the record this presumption not' only is- unrequited, but is materially strengthened through proof that the .constitution was always accessible to defendant\u2019s members, and so to the-plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">For these reasons the judgment should be reversed and a .new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the . \u25a0event. / - -,.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u25a0 Bischoff,.
