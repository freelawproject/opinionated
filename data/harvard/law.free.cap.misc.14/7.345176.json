It was also shown that the defendants had refused the plaintiff\u2019s demand for payment under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Upon, the mere conflict of evidence presented by the defendants\u2019 denial of the.plaintiff\u2019s testimony the jury\u2019s verdict must conclude under the well-settled rule; and the record would not justify our holding that the defendants were prejudiced by the determination reached upon the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">By .stipulation of counsel we are advised that the justice, after having heard the evidence adduced, and within eight days following the termination of a former trial of the action,, order\u00e9d a trial before a jury, the record of which is the one submitted to us. Appellants\u2019 contention that -the justice\u2019s direction of the jury trial was unwarranted must be due to some oversight. Section 13J2 of th.e Consolidation Act (Chap. 410, Laws 1882, \u25a0 as amended by chap. 3t8j Laws \u25a0 1891). expressly authorizes the practice followed by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We are further advised -by the stipulation that the justice refused an application on the defendants\u2019 part for removal of the cause to the Court of Common Pleas for trial, and that the ground of such refusal was that the damage claimed did not exceed $100, the plaintiff's claim being for .$100, \u201c with interest.\u201d The stipulation and the record, however, are silent with reference to everything tending to show that the application was made after issue was joined, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7 3216), and section 128J of the Consolidation Act (Chap. 410, Laws 1882). Hence, assuming that the ground assigned for the justice\u2019s refusal was error, we are without facts from whiclj to conclude that the application for such removal should have been granted, and so that the error was prejudicial to the defendants, c Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">G\u00edegeri\u00f3h, J.,. concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
