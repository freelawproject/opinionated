And the issue which, according to the statement, is so sought to be determined is of the utmost gravity, namely, whether a statute of the state, passed with all the solemnities of regular leg-, islative procedure, be a constitutional enactment. <em>Demarest </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>147 N. Y. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Courts of judicature are organized only to decide real Controversies between actual litigants. When, therefore, it -appears, no matter how nor at what stage, that a pretended action is not a genuine litigation over a contested right .between \u25a0opposing parties, but is merely the proffer of a simulated issue by a person dominating both sides of the record, the court, from a sense of its own dignity as well as from regard to the public interests, will decline.a determination of the fabricated \u2022case so fraudulently imposed upon it. <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Veazie, </em>8 How.

According to the precedents we may. so ascertain either by the record, by affidavits or by a reference. The last-named expedient we adopt as the more effective method of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Present: Daly, Ch.
