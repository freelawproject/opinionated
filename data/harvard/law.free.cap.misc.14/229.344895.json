It seems to me that the legislature by the-act in question intended to, give additional compensation only in cases,where the referee actually received and was accountable for $10,000. or more-in cash. Inasmuch as the referee-\u2019herein did not receive, nor was he at any time accountable.for such sum, I think, under the circumstances, that he -is not entitled to a larger amount than fifty dollars as his compensation. I,, therefore, fix. it at that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Ordered accordingly. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
