The proper ground of objection was, however, not specified upon the trial. The objection made was to \u201c any conversation in respect to professional opinion,\u201d and, in view of the facts and the context, this cannot be understood, and could not have been understood by the justice or adverse counsel, as referring to professional communications between attorney and client, but rather to the general incompetency of opinions as evidence; and hence, under well-estahlished rules, it should he disregarded. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>92 N.
