The witness, however,, answered: \u201c There would be the objection of parties ydiO' applied to rent apartments; when I tell them I have certain property on the line of Sixth avenue, mentioning different-places, they would state, on an average, three probably out of every five at least, that they would not live along that\" line-with the nuisance of the road running there.\u201d The record as-printed reads: \u201c There would be the objection <em>to </em>parties,\u201d etc.,, but by oral stipulation of counsel in open court upon the argument of the appeal, the record was corrected as above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The motion of the defendants\u2019 counsel tp strike the last-mentioned answer out as hearsay should have been granted. <em>Mooney </em>v. N. <em>Y. El. R. R. Co., </em>16 Daly, 145; <em>Saxton </em>v. N. <em>Y. El. R. R. Co., </em>44 N. Y. St. Repr. 832. The statements-of the persons applying to rent apartments, more particularly in premises other than those in suit, were not admissible as-part of the <em>res gestae. </em>They were in no sense concomitant, with any fact in issue, which latter the statements would serve to illustrate. 1 Gfreenl.

Hence, it cannot be successfully urged that the motion of the defendants\u2019 counsel was properly denied because it comprehended the elimination of matter which was not open to the objection stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Again, the objectionable testimony bore upon a material point, the-agency of the defendants\u2019 elevated railroad in the lessening of the rental value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and from the record we are unable to say that the testimony found no lodgment in the mind of the referee, and that it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u25a0considered by him. prejudicially to the defendants in reaching the conclusions made and required in support of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Pbyob, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to appellants to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
