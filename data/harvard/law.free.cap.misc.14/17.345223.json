'</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">It is contended that the pump did not accord in quality with the agreement; as to this there is merely a fair conflict of evidence, with which we have not to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\">A point is made that plaintiff was bound by a certain admission that he had agreed to remove the pump should it be declared by \u201c an expert \u201d to be otherwise than as represented. The declarations of the \u201c expert \u201d relied upon are those of a witness, called at the trial by the defendants, by whose testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>mony the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to the quality ,of the pump was contradicted, such witness having been called upon by defendants to examine the pump for the first time within one or two days before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It is not at all clear that the justice was- bound to find this witness <em>\u201c </em>an expert,\u201d nor to credit his testimony as against the plaintiff\u2019s; moreover, it was but reasonable to infer that the plaintiff\u2019s statement above noted intended at least that the expert\u2019s identity and the time of the examination should have been disclosed to him in advance of the trial, and the expert\u2019s opinion made the basis of a demand that the pump be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Again, it is contended that the labor sued for was expended in installing the pump, which service was to have been rendered without payment. The express testimony of the plaintiff, however, appears in support of the finding that this work was done entirely apart from any connected with the pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">; The record is found to uphold the recovery with regard to the value of each item sued for, and, no other questions \u25a0appearing in the case, the judgment must be affirmed, with -costs. -</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Giegerich, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
