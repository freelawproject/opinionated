The defense was that under authority conferred by plaintiff defendants had purchased for the account of plaintiff the bonds, known as \u201c Reading thirds; \u201d that this purchase was acquiesced in by plaintiff, and that a sudden decline of the bonds resulted in a loss which more than absorbed the balance due plaintiff prior to the purchase. The plaintiff denied that the purchase was authorized by him, and claimed that he repudiated it promptly upon being notified.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-9\"><em>Paul P. </em>Ormath, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-10\"><em>Michael II.

Unless he did so he would .be. held to ratify it. <em>Gold Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Nat. Bank, </em>96 U. S. 640. Hesitation, to await the result of the market, would be enough to constitute ratification. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>4 Barb. 369. He was bound to disavow in a reasonable time. <em>Law </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>1 Black (U. S.), 533-539; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>19 N. Y. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">It is undisputed that on February eighteenth, in Philadelphia, plaintiff received by mail from defendants in Boston</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>. tile regular slip notifying him of the purchase. It was too late that day to communicate, but on Monday morning he had a conversation with Campbell, one of the defendants, by* telephone. What' that conversation was rests in the conflict of testimony of those two-witnesses, who were equally interested in the action. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony is: <em>\u201c1 </em>asked Mr. \u25a0Campbell what lie had been doing; if he had been buying ;Some Reading <em>% </em>He said, Why <em>% </em>I said he had no authority; we had never talked Reading, or anything else except Lam-\u00a1son Cash Carrier, which he told me would be guarded. I \u25a0said, I don\u2019t want anything to do with this; I want nothing to do with Reading; I want no speculation; you have no .authority- to do that; what are you going to do <em>% </em>He said, .Buy some more for you and hold it. I said, I want nothing whatever to do with Reading; I will have nothing to do with Reading or any other speculation. That was the absolute .sum of our conversation \u2022\u2014I will have nothing to do with it.\u201d The defendant\u2019s testimony as to the conversation over the telephone is: \u201c He discussed the situation or condition of the Reading Co. and the prospect, or the current rumors in Phila\u25a0delphia, and his disturbances over the' situation; his fear that the security, might go still lower, and finally he said he should want to rely upon me to look after the thing for him. He ' did not repudiate the transaction in any way. Q. Did he say -anything about repudiating the transaction ? A. He did not.\u201d In this state of the testimony it was merely oath against \u2022oath of two interested, witnesses, and as the affirmative of proving disaffirmance rested on plaintiff he failed to establish it. <em>Griffiths </em>v. Hardenbergh, 41 N. Y. 471; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Trask, </em>44 N. <em>Y. </em>St. Repr. 649; \u2022 Where the plaintiff and \u2022defendant, who were both men of fair character and stand -alike unimpeached and \u00e1re of equal credibility, are examined -as witnesses and contradict each other directly upon a question of fact, and their testimony is totally irreconcilable, in the .absence of other testimony, the case will stand evenly balanced .and the complaint will be dismissed. <em>Losee </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>57 Barb. 561. Where the plaintiff swears unqualifiedly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a warranty, and the defendant as unqualifiedly and explicitly swears -there was none, and there is no evidence -in the case corroborating the plaintiff, he fails to make out a case and the defendant is entitled to judgment. <em>Raines </em>v. <em>Tot</em>man, 64 How. 493. Where the burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff, he testifying to a state of facts constituting a cause of action against the defendant, and the defendant giving testimony which if true proves that an entirely different state of facts existed, showing the plaintiff has no cause of action, neither party being corroborated by circumstances, or by other witnesses, the plaintiff fails to establish his demand and' cannot recover. <em>Syms </em>v. <em>Vyse, </em>2 N. Y. St. Repr. 106. What corroboration of plaintiff\u2019s testimony is to be found' in the case to sustain this verdict ? On the evening of the day of the telephone communication he wrote to the defendant as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\u201cFbiend Campbell.\u2014 You can perhaps imagine my state of mind this p. m. I arrived home (in Phila.) Friday night. . Saturday' morning when I went into town I found the air literally alive with rumors of the Reading <em>\u2018 </em>fiasco.\u2019 It <em>was-absolutely </em>known here that they were in <em>trouble &amp; </em>probably <em>more serious </em>than they could pull out of. I did not rec. your letter until after banking hours Saturday, &amp; you can imagine my surprise when I found you had bought Reading 3ds., when, as I say, it was known that the \u2018 Drexels \u2019 had thrown them over, &amp; there seemed no probable way that they could escape bankruptcy. Nothing to borrow on. Nd money, debts that were known to be falling due <em>&amp; </em>they in the position of having antagonized their best friends. ' I got the telephone as soon as &gt; I could to' you this morning, &amp; although I told you of the \u00a3 receivership,\u2019 it was then too late for you to save anything. It seems to he the opinion here that the Lehigh Yalley pulled McLeod down, with debts falling due <em>&amp; </em>no money to pay, &amp; that he has placed the Reading voluntarily in the hands of a receiver to protect the property, <em>&amp; </em>that he will get help &amp; pull out. Philadelphians have bagged lots of money, for they have <em>all </em>sold <em>everything </em>in Reading right <em>&amp; </em>left, &amp;, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>fact, anything in Beading securities here have been considered the <em>wildest Jcind of a speculation </em>for the last six months. \u2022 Could you expect me to buy into \u00e1 \u2018law suit? \u2019 You know my position \u2014 absolutely no \u25a0 income <em>&amp; </em>my future income dependent on the small \u25a0 sum I may have to put into' some business. Please let me hear from you by return mail. \u2022 I\u2019ve got a fair amount of nerve, but I\u2019ll allow I have sensations to-night which I hope you may never experience. I am,' \u25a0. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\u201cVery truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\u00a3\u00a3 H. 0. Hopkius.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In this letter, there is no word of repudiation. In referring to the telephonic communication of the morning he does not state that it was a disapproval of the purchase. The whole letter, on the contrary, is merely an argument against the prm dence of buying Beading, and confirms the defendant\u2019s version of the telephone conversation, in which, as he says, plaintiff discussed the situation and condition of the company, the prospects and the current rumors and his disturbances over \u25a0 the situation; his fear that the security might go still lower. What need was there to ask defendants to let him hear from them by return mail if the transaction had been already repudiated ? ,</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">On the twenty-third, three (lays afterwards, the plaintiff telegraphs and writes to defendants that he positively declines to accept the purchases. \u2019 If this had been already done on the twentieth it was needless to do so again on the twenty-third; if it had been done on the twentieth why was not that fact referred to in the letter of the twenty-third ? ' On the other hand, that letter begins : \u00a3&lt; I wired you this morning-that I positively declined to accept purchase of Beading bonds.\u201d 'That letter is consistent only with defendants\u2019 testimony that there was no previous repudiation. <em>' .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">As the stock had declined steadily by the twenty-third, and the Beading road had passed into the hands of a receiver, this repudiation came too late. In the state of the market, disclosed in plaintiff\u2019s own letter of the twentieth, it was his duty at that time to disaffirm the purchase, and it will be seen that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the correspondence between the parties does not corroborate the testimony of the plaintiff-that it was then repudiated, but rather confirms that of the defendant, that there was no repudiation until the twenty-third. There being no preponderance of evidence, on plaintiff\u2019s part, and the weight of evidence being rather' that he did not disapprove the purchase, of which he received timely notice, he was not entitled to recover. Upon this state' of facts, it is our duty to reverse the judgment and order a new trial. On appeal from .the order denying the motion for a new trial, made upon the ground that the verdict is contrary to the evidence, the order may be reversed-if the verdict be against the weight of evidence. Code, \u00a7 999; <em>Beyer </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>8 Misc. Rep. 416. See, also, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Mech. Nat. </em>Bank, 8 Daly, 481; <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., </em>16 Hun, 415; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lecour, </em>9 Wkly. Dig. 6. On appeal from an order of our own court denying a motion for a new trial, the appellant need not show an exception to the denial of a motion for a nonsuit at the close of the case, or for a direction of a verdict. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Christopher &amp; Tenth St. R. R. Co., </em>10 Daly, 540. Though the evidence might have been sufficient to -require submission to. the jury, it is nevertheless the duty of the General Term to grant a \u25a0 new trial if the verdict be against the apparent weight of evidence (C<em>olt </em>v. <em>Sixth Ave. R. R. Co., </em>49 N. Y. 671); and, under more recent decisions, it is the duty of the trial judge to nonsuit or direct the verdict, as the case may require, not only where there is no evidence upon an issue, before the jury, but also where the weight of the evidence is so decidedly preponderating in favor of one side, that a verdict contrary to it would be set aside. <em>Linkauf </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>137 N. Y. 417, 426; <em>Hemmens v. </em>Nelson, 138 id. 517, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Judgment reversed, new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Bischoit and Pbyoe, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
