M. </em>Wainwright, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-9\"><em>Vilo, Ru\u00e9bsamen da Qoohran (Ernest E. </em>Baldwin, of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>Per Gwriam-.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ajo\">Upon the facts presented no sufficient reason exists for disturbing the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for want of prosecution and for judgment accordingly. Upon all the facts disclosed there clearly was no abuse of judicial discretion. That motion having been properly disposed of, the plaintiffs had the right to have the case restored to the calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 motion was, according to the, prayer contained in the affidavit upon which it was founded, <em>\u201c </em>that an order may be made herein restoring this action to the calendar for trial,\u201d but in the notice of motion accompanying the said affidavit plaintiffs\u2019 attorney asked \u201c for an order placing the above-entitled action on the clerk\u2019s calendar.\u201d The order-as entered provides \u201c that the case be placed upon the clerk\u2019s calendar of this court.\u201d As matter of fact the case had been noticed for trial at Special Term at a time at which there was no separate equity term in this court, and a note of issue had been duly filed, pursuant to which the cas\u00e9 had appeared upon the Special Term calendar, and the case liad been repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>called in its order upon said calendar, and after many adjournments had been marked off. Ro other notipe of trial had ever been given, nor any other note of issue filed,' except as stated. At the time of the motion the court, under its rules, had a separate equity term and the equity calendar had taken the place of the former Special Term calendar. Under these circumstances the case should have been ordered to be placed upon the equity calendar. On the other hand, an inspection of the complaint shows that it proceeds upon two causes of action, the first being one at - law apd the second being an equitable one. The - consequence is that if the defendant has not already waived his right to have the common-law action ti-ied by a jury, as to which the record is not clear, and at the proper time and in the proper manner should 'insist upon a jury trial of that part of the case, that branch of the litigation would have to be sent to a jury term, and in that event a direction to place the case upon the clerk\u2019s calendar for that purpose would be proper.' But that, question .is not now before ns, because so far the defendant has not raised the point, and on this appeal has contended that the case, as a whole, should have been ordered upon the equity calendar. Moreover, the whole controversy cannot be determined by a jury. \u2022 '' .</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Under all the circumstances, as they appear before us, the two appeals should be disposed of as follows, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The order denying defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for want of prosecution, etc., should he affirmed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The order made upon plaintiffs\u2019 motion directing the case to be placed upon the clerk\u2019s calendar should be modified so as to read' <em>\u201c </em>upon the equity calendar of this court,\u201d and, as thus modified, it should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Present: Freedman and Gildbrsleeve, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Order denying motion' to dismiss affirmed, with costs and disbursements, and order directing case to be placed on calendar, modified, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
