Hedges, as Receiver, Respondent, <em>v. </em>Horace G. Polhemus et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b351-5\">(New York Common Pleas</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"APV\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AZl\">November, 1895.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-6\">An objection to the correctness of the conclusion of the trial judge is not brought up on appeal from a judgment rendered by the court sitting - without a jury, unless an exception thereto has been taken and filed as prescribed by the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-7\">A note in the clerk's minutes of the trial that \u201c defendants\u2019 attorney excepts \u201d to a direction of judgment is not equivalent to the exception required by the statute and raises no question of law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-8\">The appellate court cannot consider the1 facts where the case does not contain a certificate that it contains all the evidence, or is not certified by the trial judge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-9\">In an action by a receiver appointed in supplementary proceedings to set aside a chattel mortgage as invalid as to creditors, where the defense is rested exclusively upon the validity of such mortgage, it is not error to refuse to allow the defendant, upon the cross-examination of one of th.e creditors, to show that such creditor subsequently took a chattel mortgage for the indebtedness due to him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b351-10\">Appeal from a judgment rendered by the court sitting without a jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-11\"><em>James Politer, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-12\"><em>Charles M. Earle, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b351-13\">Bischoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvV\">Unfortunately for the position assumed by the appellants, their appeal fails to bring before the General Term any question either of law or fact touching the merits of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">An inquiry as to whether the conclusion of the trial judge was correct, as matter of law,' could only have been called for by an exception taken and filed as prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7\u00a7 994,1022 [as amended 1894], 1346), which step the appellants omitted from their practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">The -result is that the only questions of law presented for our determination are those raised by exceptions taken to rulings upon the trial. <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Erben, </em>24 How. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The note in the extract from the clerk\u2019s minutespf jihe trial that \u201c defendants\u2019 attorney excepts \u201d to the court\u2019s direction of judgment for the plaintiff is not equivalent to the exception required by the statute, and in an action tried by-the court, without \u00e1 jury, at all events, no question of Jaw is thereby raised (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 994, 995, 996), even if such an exception were in. any case availing for the assignment of. error. See <em>Grier </em>v. <em>Hazard, </em>39 N. Y. St. Pepr. 74 ; <em>Dearing </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>8 Misc. Rep. 269; <em>Gundlin v. H. A. P. Co., </em>Id. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Further, the facts are not before \u00fas because of the omission ' from the case of a certificate that the evidence, as there-embodied, is complete, <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>107 N. Y. 531; <em>Aldridge v. Aldridge, </em>120 id. 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">There is a further defect in that the case does not appear to be certified by the trial judge in accordance with section 997 of the Code. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Roworth, </em>4 Misc. Rep. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The only exception urged by the appellants is that taken to-the exclusion of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The issue in the action was solely as to the validity of a, chattel' mortgage, tire suit being brought by a receiver-appointed in supplementary proceedings, in the interests of certain judgment creditors,of the mortgagor, to set aside the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Upon\" cross-examination of one of these creditors he was'asked by'appellants\u2019 counsel: \u201cDid you not subsequently, take a chattel mortgage yourself for this \u25a0 indebtedness ? \u201d and an exception wa,s taken to, the exclusion of the question for immateriality.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The claim in suit being based solely upon the judgments, obtained by the creditors, and the defendants\u2019 -position being rested exclusively upon the' validity of the mortgage before \u2022 the court, as .was admitted by counsel, the evidence was-certainly immaterial when offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">' Upon this, appeal it is urged that bad faith on the .part of-the creditors in taking a mortgage similar to that in suit could have been shown, but, be this as it may, there was no error in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the rejection of the evidence called for by the question as framed, regard being had to the attitude of counsel upon the trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Daly, Oh.
