Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 3063, 3213; <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>5 Daly, 283; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>1 Misc. Rep. 161; 20 N. Y. Supp. 634; 48 N. Y. St. Repr. 685; <em>Schumacher </em>v. <em>Waring, </em>7 Misc. Rep. 161; 57 N. Y. St. Repr. 539; 27 N. Y. Supp. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\"The action is conversion against the property clerk of the police department founded upon his failure to return, upon' demand, a sum of money taken from the person of one John O\u2019Connell at a time when the latter was arrested in this city, \"for extradition on a charge of robbery. His trial in a criminal court of the state of Pennsylvania resulted in his conviction. The identical money in suit was made use of- physically as evidence against him, and such money was, by the judgment of the court, declared to be the property of one David T. Slocum,- the. person robbed,'and directed to be paid over.to liim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">These facts are undisputed and the judgment of the foreign .court, duly authenticated, appears in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The respondent\u2019s counsel \"seeks to defend the recovery -below through reliance upon the proof that plaintiff, O\u2019Connell\u2019s attorney at the time of his arrest, became- the assignee of the sum in question, by assignment from O\u2019Connell, after .such sum had-been forcibly taken from the person of the lat\"ter when arrested. The argument appears to be that a <em>prima facie </em>case of trespass was made out against the arresting officer in favor of the prisoner O\u2019Connell, and that the question of title to the money was immaterial <em>(Kissam </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>6 Bosw. 154), but, waiving the questions raised by the fact that such officer was not the defendant, that the act was done in performance of official duty and that the trespass, if any, antedated the assignment of the cause of action to the plaintiff, it \u25a0 need only be said that the cause of action pleaded and sought to be proven was simply conversion as in the <em>detmet, </em>in which action proof of title in a third party may be given under the general issue. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Long Island R. R. Co., </em>101 N. Y. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>That there was no substitution oi causes of action by consent, through failure to obiect to the evidence, follows from the fact that such evidence was not objectionable under the pleadings, since possession by O\u2019Cbnnell when arrested bore upon the very material issue. o\u00b1 title; in fact, was all that was shown upon the question by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The inquiry resolves itself into a matter of factj whether or not the defendant established his defense under the denial of plaintiff\u2019s title, and that plaintiff\u2019s assignee had absolutely no title nor right of possession is beyond argument upon the evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In no way was the judgment of the foreign court sought to be attacked, and it was to be' accorded full faith and credit. <em>Dunstan </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>138 N. Y. <em>70; Taylor </em>v. <em>Bryden, </em>8 Johns. 133; Story Confl. of Laws,. \u00a7\u00a7 592, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The money taken from O\u2019Connell was proven to be that produced before the foreign court by the testimony of the witness-Nugent, the police officer who made the arrest and identified the money upon the criminal trial, and there was no ground upon which the ' uncontradicted testimony of that witness could reasonably have been disregarded by the justice below. The only conclusion to be reached was that plaintiff\u2019s assignee had no right or title to, or interest in the fund assigned, and we must hold that from an affirmance of this judgment a reckless perversion of justice would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">For these reasons the judgment should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Bisohoff, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Judgment reversed and complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
