'</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The following is the testimony and proceedings upon the trial: .</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\"><em>\u201c </em>Mr. Milliken appeared for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">\u201c Mr. Morris appeared for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">\u201cA jury to try the issues was duly impaneled and the case opened to the jury by a statement of the issues to be tried by Mr. Milliken. \u25a0 '</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">\u201c Whereupon Mr. Morris moved' the court to dismiss the complaint-on the pleadings, on the ground that the defendant in this action.is sued personally:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">\u201c \u2018 -The action is against Charles C. Smith, personally, and the' complaint alleges that'the moneys loaned were <em>so' </em>loaned to him as executor of the estate of Mrs. Gregg, deceased, and for the purpose of carrying out certain provisions of the will under which he was appointed executor by one of the parties in interest under the will.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">\u201c The Court.^ Can an executor borrow ?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">^.Defendant\u2019s Attorney.\u2014 He cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court.\u2014 Then why is he not individually liable ?

That has been held repeatedly, and it has been held repeatedly that when an executor, administrator or any person, acting under a trust creates a liability which he has no power to create ip his official capacity, then he is individually liabl\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u201c [Motion to dismiss denied.

Smith individually, on two notes made by him as executor\" of the estate of Adaline L. Gregg, for money advanced to him as such executor by one\" of the beneficiaries of the will, for the purpose of enabling him to carry out. the provisions of the' will, and that he is not individually liable, but, if liable at all, only as executor, and then only liable to an accounting as such executor. \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201c The Court.\u2014 Didn\u2019t I understand you to say a moment ago that he was not a beneficiary under the will; that he was simply the husband of a legatee ; that was the statement made on the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201c Witness.\u2014He is the husband of the legatee, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u201c The Court.\u2014 The motion is denied on the ground that the defendant admits that the plaintiff is the husband of a legatee, not a party in interest, and in no way interested in this estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u201c [Exception by defendant.]</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u201c At this point defendant\u2019s attorney has the four receipts, marked Exhibits 1 to 4, inclusive, marked for identification as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Exhibit 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u201c \u2018 Received, Brooklyn, N.

Y., at page 184: \u201c But it may be that it would have been admissible for the defendant to prove * * * that the purpose for which a written contract is made may rest in a collateral oral arrangement, which may be shown to the effect that the design of it is different from that which its terms alone may indicate.\u201d <em>Grierson </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>60 N. Y. 394; <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>78 id. 74. And again, at page 185,- he says, speaking of the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Schmittler </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>101 N. Y. 554, between the same parties: \u201cIt does.not appear what view the court may have taken of the <em>admissibility of \u25a0emidenoe of the fad, and of the fact itself, </em>if it had then appeared that the payee and the plaintiff when they received the draft had been advised that it was drawn and accepted to be paid out of the drawer\u2019s interest represented by the \u25a0defendant as executor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The fact that the defendant was in the receipts designated as executor, and that he in some of them signed and designated himself as executor of Mrs. Adaline L. Gregg, deceased, does not of itself import any other than a personal relation of the -defendant to the instrument, .as the word \u201c executor \u201d annexed to his name would presumptively be treated merely as descriptive of the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">But it might be given some substantial significance by other \u25a0 provisions, if those were-such as to require it in the instrument, and in a proper case this might be aided by extrinsic facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In such case it is open to explanation by evidence to show that the purpose, as understood by the parties to th\u00f3 transaction, was that the party so executing the contract intended to assume no personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The admission of this proposed evidence may not avail the defendant, but we think it admissible, for where the words, used in their application to an instrument of which they are a, part are not entirely intelligible,, oral evidence of the circumstances attending its execution and collateral agreements in regard thereto may, as between the\u2018parties, be admissible to aid. in the interpretation in its application of the .language so used..</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">For these reasons we think the rejected evidence referred to should have been received as bearing upon the understanding of the relation and the character of the liability the defendant assumed..</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Judgment is, therefore, reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Van Wyck, Ch. J., and Fitzsimons, J., concur,</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to-appellant to abide event. . '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
