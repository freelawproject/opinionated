Upon the trial, showever, the plaintiff disclaimed all contention, with regard to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The plaintiff claimed, and the trial court adjudged him, to be the owner in fee of the premises above alluded to, as well as of the land contiguous thereto and forming the bed of Greenwich street,' to the center thereof, upon which the defendants\u2019 railway Was constructed, subject\u2019 to the perpetual use of the land last alluded to for the purposes of a public street. Such being the facts, it was error for the trial court to conclude that the damage which resulted to the plaintiff from the defendants\u2019' appropriation of the land in Greenwich street was nominal only, and upon that ground to refuse him injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">At the time of the conveyance hereinafter next to be alluded to, the premises in question, including the soil of Greenwich street, were a part of the land under the waters of the Hjidson \u25a0 river, and were owned by the corporation of the city of New York, the upland contiguous to such land under water being at the time the property of the corporation of Trinity Church. Greenwich street, as such, does not appear, then to have existed in front of the premises involved. On November 18, 1773, the corporation of the city of New York conveyed to the corporation .of Trinity Church \u201c all the land, ground, soil and water lots extending two hundred feet beyond low-water mark,\u201d situate, lying-and being \u201cin fronf of\u201d and \u201ccontiguous to \u201d\u2022 the land of the grantee, with all the \u201cestate, right, title, possession, use, interest, property, claim and demand whatsoever of \u201d the grantor in and to the land under water and first above alluded to. By the deed of conveyance the grantee covenanted to \u201c leave a street of sixty-six feet, English measure, in breadth,\u201d to be known as' Greenwich or First street, and to extend along high-water mark of the land conveyed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the same \u201c to remain a public street of said city.\u201d The grantee furthermore covenanted to cause such street, with others, to be made and completed by the 25th day of September, 1780, to maintain the several streets at all times thereafter in good and sufficient repair, and that the same should continue forever \u201c for the free use- and common passage of, and public streets and ways for, the inhabitants of the city of New York, and all others passing or returning through or by the same, in such manner as the other public streets of the same city now are or lawfully ought to be.\u201d No part of the tract of land described in the. <em>premises </em>to be the subject-matter of the conveyance was excepted; and throughout the conveyance of the premises in suit, from the deed by the corporation of Trinity Church down to and including the one to the plaintiff, the same were described as bounded \u201c easterly in front by Greenwich street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We are convinced of the accuracy of the conclusion that the plaintiff is the.owner in fee of so much of the bed of Greenwich street as is contiguous to, and in front of, his remaining land, to the center thereof. As we construe the conveyance to the corporation of Trinity Church, it operated to vest the fee of the entire tract of land under water in- the grantee. Giving effect to the grantee\u2019s covenant to open and maintain Greenwich street as a reservation by the grantor, such reservation is fully satisfied if extended to an easement, a right of way only; and the reservation of the easement, because of obvious conflict, excludes intention to claim the continued ownership of the fee. Applying, next, familiar rules governing the construction of grants of land abutting upon streets or highways to the subsequent deeds, the plaintiff\u2019s succession to the fee -of the soil of Greenwich street is apparent. These rules are that if the grantor of land which is described as bounded by a street or highway is at the time of the conveyance also seized in fee of the land over which such street or-highway extends, he will be presumed to have included the last-mentioned land to the center <em>(Kings Co. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. Stevens, 87 N. Y. 287, 291); and that courses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>distances and dimensions must yield to boundaries, unless an intention that the former shall be controlling clearly appears. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Van, De </em>Bogert, 56 N. Y. 526; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>37 id. 251; 2 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">For so much of the property as is actually taken for a public use the measure of just compensation, provided for by the Constitution is its value without deduction for benefits to-the remainder. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>78 N. Y. 423, 433 ; <em>Bohm </em>v. <em>Met. El. R. R. Co., </em>129 id. 576 : <em>Mattlage </em>v. <em>N. Y. El. R. R. Co., </em>1 Misc. Rep. 339. Obviously, there-, fore, the case at bar is distinguishable in that regard from the . case of the taking only of the basements of light, air, and means of access appurtenant to abutting land, Those easements, being incapable of enjoyment except in connection with the land abutting upon the servient land, have no actual value apart therefrom. <em>Bohm </em>v. <em>Met. El. R. R. Co., supra. </em>Hence, when they constitute the only property taken, the inquiry with regard to the compensation, to be made is pointed to ascertain the effect of such taking ujDon the dominant, land, in which case resultant benefits are t\u00f3 be considered in arriving at the extent of the owner\u2019s loss. <em>Newman, </em>v. <em>Met. El. R. R. Co., </em>118 N. Y. 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">But the owner of land which is subject to use as a public street or highway has substantial rights therein. He may excavate the soil under the surface and use the space <em>(McCarthy </em>v. <em>City of Syracuse, </em>46 N. Y. 194), or authorize others so to do., He possesses absolute dominion over the land for all purposes not inconsistent with the public easement and the proper exercise of the police power of the state. If the street or highway is abandoned the land reverts to him. 24 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 122. His- rights can be taken from him. only in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and upon payment of just compensation <em>(Williams </em>v. N. <em>Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>16 N. Y. 97, 108), and just compensation in such a case implies that it should be of a substantial character. <em>City of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>39 N. Y. St. Repr. 270; 131 N. Y. 293. A further distinction is here, to be noted between the present case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>one involving the conversion of an existing right of way in favor of abutting owners into a public easement for the same uses, in which latter case no actual damage is held to result. <em>Matter of </em>Adams, 141 N. Y. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In determining for the purposes of just compensation the value of the property which is to be taken for a public use the inquiry is, what is the property \u201c worth in the market, viewed not merely with reference to the uses to which it is at the time applied, but with reference to the uses to which it is plainly adapted; that is to say, what is it worth :from its availability for valuable uses?\u201d <em>Boom Co. </em>v. Patterson, 98 U. S. 403 ; Lewis Em. Dom. \u00a7479; Suth. Dam. \u00a71074. Measured by this rule the testimony .of the plaintiff\u2019s expert's^ called to show a substantial value of the land in Greenwich street, is in part worthless because- of its extremely speculative' character (Lewis Em. Dom. \u00a7 480); but it sufficiently appears from' the testimony of Plass, one of such experts, which in that regard was competent and uncontradicted, that the land was available for particular uses and as to such uses was of substantial value.\" True, expert testimony, as mere opinion evidence, is not to be regarded as' conclusive. <em>Head </em>v. <em>Hargrave, </em>105 U. S. 45; <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Doolittle, </em>120 id. 73,77; Bogers Expert Testimony,- \u00a7 207, p. 486. Such testimony, however, is competent <em>ex necessitate. Clark </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>9 N. Y. 183, 196. It is, therefore, to be considered, and if corroborated by probability, and the circumstances of the particular\" case in which such testimony must needs be resorted to, it should be given due weight. Expert testimony regarding value when the property, as here, is in some respects, at least, <em>sui generis, </em>may not afford more than a vague and unsatisfactory basis for the award of adequate compensation; but, even so, relief is not. upon that account to be withheld if it clearly appears that substantial damage was inflicted by the taking of the property. It cannot avail the wrongdoer for the purposes of. immunity that the extent of his wrong is not capable of precise measurement in money. <em>Drucker </em>v. <em>Man. R. Co., </em>106 N. Y. 157,164.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>. If all the expert .testimony above alluded to be rejected it follows, notwithstanding,, that the 'plaintiff should have prevailed in the action. Injunctive relief is not to be extended \u25a0 except where the act sought to \u2022 be restrained inflicts substantial injury <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Man. R. Co., </em>128. N. Y. 499; <em>Brush </em>v. <em>Man. R. Co., </em>.26 Abb. N. C. 73, 80); but the rule obtains only when it appears- affirmatively that the injury is technical only,/ and trivial. Such were the cases last- above cited, and those referred to in the - opinions therein. Spelling Extr. Relief, \u00a7 286. Here, however,, the rights of the plaintiff as the owner' of the land- subject to an easement for street or highway uses <em>areprima, facie </em>of a substantial character. Hence, a wrong-' \u25a0 ful appropriation thereof, works .substantial injury to him. <em>City of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Pratt, supra. </em>In order to defeat th\u00e9' .plaintiff\u2019s: claim to injunctive relief it was incumbent, thereforeyupon the defendants to\u2019 show that the land taken was of no',- or only of nominal, value. Ho . such'-evidence was adduced. . - . \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">That the construction and operation of an elevated railway thereon imposes upon the land an additional burden, one not .'.within the contemplation of' ordinary street- or highway uses, and is to that extent an appropriation of the owner\u2019s rights of property :was definitely settled by the <em>Story, Lahr, Drucker, Abendroth </em>and <em>Kane </em>cases, 90 N. Y. 122; 104 id. 268;. 106 id. 157; 122 id. 1; 125 id. 164; and for the'continuing tres-, pass which results from the maintenance -.and operation of- the. railway the owner is entitled to injunctive relief <em>{-Williams- </em>and <em>Henderson </em>cases, <em>supra), </em>lest the wrong should ripen into-' a right by adverse possession or the owner be forced into a multiplicity'of. \u2022 actions to prevent such .a result.
