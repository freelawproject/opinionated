Upon the trial this objection might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>presented and properly sustained, but' it was not then presented. Had it been, proof of the assignment of the claim from the individual to the partnership might well have been forthcoming. The question is raised too late upon appeal. <em>Haines </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>145 N. Y. 235. The motion to dismiss: the counterclaim, without more particularity, certainly did not. raise, the, point now presented, nor did the motion to strike out, defendant McNeill\u2019s testimony upon the ground that \u201che had not shown that he was entitled- to recover or had any participation in this commission.\u201d' This objection merely called attention to the admissibility of the evidence and had no bearing upon the counterclaim itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The exception to the denial of this motion presents no error.. That McNeill had not been shown to be a party in interest: constituted no valid objection to him as a witness, and the evidence was competent and relevant upon the issue whether or not the contract for commissions had been made. Further, the motion was to strike out all the testimony, a large part of' which bore directly upon the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and it-would have been erroneous to grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A further point is made that authority in the agent or agents with whom this contract for commissions was made: was not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This agreement, according to the defendants\u2019 evidence, was \u25a0 made with plaintiff through one Lovejoy. Defendant Tucker testified that, upon inquiry at -the plaintiff\u2019s place of business for the manager, he was referred by one of the clerks to Love-joy, \u201c who from all appearances had . charge.\u201d Substantially to this effect was the testimony of the defendant McNeilL Tucker further testified that he had, previous to the transaction in suit, had other dealings with Lovejoy and had been allowed and paid a commission or discount of one 'dollar for each range sold; also, that \u201c Mr. Smith said lie was willing to stand up to any contract made by Lovejoy with us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Since Mr. Smith was conceded by the appellant to have been at that time its manager, the above might be taken either as evidence of a ratification, or as' further proof of Lovejoy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>authority. Other evidence appears, which, though somewhat equivocal, might have been properly understood by the jury as showing a ratification of Lovejoy\u2019s acts. We find no reason for disturbing the. result arrived at by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Bookstaver and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
