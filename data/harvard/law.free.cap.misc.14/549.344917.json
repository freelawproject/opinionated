The answer admitted plaintiffs\u2019 title and right to possession, but denied an allegation of the complaint that they were entitled to full possession. <em>Held, </em>that such denial was only of a conclusion of law and raised no issue; that the case presented no claim of title to real property, and that plaintiffs, having recovered less than fifty dollars, were not entitled to costs.</headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b591-8\"><em>Bloomingdale </em>v. <em>Steubing, </em>11 Misc.

Rep. 16 ; 68 N. Y. St. Repr. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">The action was for \u201c forcibly and wrongfully entering and taking possession on February 1st, 1892, of certain premises, 160-162 East Fifty-ninth street, in the city of New York, of which , plaintiffs were the lessees under a lease from the defendant, expiring May 1st, 1892,\u201d and resulted in a 'verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for six cents damages. It was conceded by the pleadings that \u201c by agreement, between the parties the \u2022 defendant was allowed to enter and tak\u00e9 possession-and to try / and find a tenant for the premises for the unexpire.d term of the plaintiffs\u2019 lease,\u201d and the only issn\u00e9 tried and submitted was \u201c Whether, having permission from the plaintiffs to enter \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>for one purpose,\u201d the defendant \u201c availed himself of such permission- for a totally different purpose, to wit, to put the premises in repair for the term commencing after the plaintiffs\u2019 lease expired.\u201d <em>Bloomingdale </em>v. <em>Steubing, </em>12 Misc. Rep. 429. Obviously, the allegation of the complaint that the plaintiffs as lessees were \u201c entitled to the full possession of \u201d the demised premises was a conclusion of law, immaterial and not traversable. <em>Scofield </em>v. <em>Whitelegge, </em>49 N. Y. 259. Hence, its denial' by the defendant created no issue. <em>People ex rel. Purdy v. Commissioners of Highways, </em>54 N. Y. 276. The answer expressly admitted the plaintiffs\u2019 title and right of possession as lessees of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The issue being wholly with regard to the terms and extent of the license from the plaintiffs to the defendant, therefore presented no <em>\u201c </em>claim of title to real property \u201d within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 3228 of the Code of Civil Procedure so as to entitle the plaintiffs\u2019 to the costs of the action notwithstanding the fact that the recovery was less than fifty dollars for damages ( <em>Utter </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>25 How. Pr. 289); and pursuant to the provisions of section 3229 the'defendant was entitled to such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The orders of the General, and Special Terms of the court below, by which the plaintiffs were awarded the costs of the action, are reversed, with costs and disbursements of the several appeals to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Daly, Oh.
