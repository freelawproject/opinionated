From one of them plaintiff\u2019-s intestate-received a kick which, it is alleged, killed him. ,The play was. produced by the \u201cAmerican Theatre Company,\u201d a cbrporaT tion \u2022; but defendant was its president and manager ; t as such supervised the production of the play, and particularly had power to employ and order off any horse. The intestate, an employee of the company, was hurt by the- horse while both were in the discharge of their duties. The horse\u2019was of vicious habit, but while of the habit defendant had no actual notice, it had been repeatedly exhibited' in the theatre and was known to several persons, one at least in the employ of the company and'subject to the control of defendant. Defend-' ant was \u201c about there most every night.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-6\"><em>Pwsons, Shepard &lt;&amp; Ogclen, </em>for appellant. . \u25a0</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-7\"><em>\u25a0 T.

Rut, by what authority may we pass upon these questions? As appellant states in his points, the motion is for a new trial upon exceptions ordered to be heard in the first instance at General Term. The issues were submitted to the jury, and no motion for a -new trial has been made either at Circuit or Special Term. Such.being'the record, we have no jurisdiction to determine whether the yerdict was without evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>or against the weight of evidence. <em>Price </em>v. Keyes, 1 Hun, 177, 182; reversed on another point, 62 N. Y. 378; <em>Hotchkins </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>38 Barh. 117, 121; <em>Martin </em>v. Platt, 4 N. Y. Supp. 359, 361; 21 N. Y. St. Repr. 330; <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>3 Hun, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Assuming that the exception to the denial of the motion to dismiss the complaint or direct for the defendant presents the point that a verdict 'without evidence is legal error, we cannot conclude that, upon either issue, the finding of the jury is destitute of proof adequate to its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">1. That the intestate died of the kick is an inference in which the jury were justified by plaintiffs proof. The testimony of the expert directly to the fact and of other witnesses to intestate\u2019s condition before and after the hurt was a sufficient basis for the verdict. That the kick was the cause of the death is concluded by the verdict. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Second Ave. R. R. Co., </em>89 Hun, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">2. That the horse was of a mischievous propensity appears by the preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">3. That the defendant knew, or, in the exercise of due care, would have kjiown of the vicious habit, is also a legitimate inference from the circumstances in evidence. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>63 N. Y. St. Repr. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">4. It is .an immaterial fact that the defendant was not owner of the the theatre or the business in the transaction of which the injury was sustained. , He was president and manager of the company, and so in control of its business that he had power to hire and discharge the horse. In the legal sense he kept or harbored the animal, and is responsible for its act. <em>Bundschuh </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>62 N. Y. St. Repr. 597; <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, etc., Co., </em>28 L. R. Ann. 439; <em>Chenango Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>83 N. Y. 178, 190; <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Wan Pelt, </em>1 Tex. Civ. App. 185; <em>Cahoone, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Rubber, etc., Co., </em>45 Fed. Rep. 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">5. Hpon the circumstances of the injury the intestate\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence was a valid conclusion. But it is urged that he hazarded the risk of injury by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>horse, which is true enough of an- injury from the use of a horse with a normal nature and disposition,- but surely danger from a horse of an abnormal evil propensity -is not; a peril incident to the business. A servant takes the risk of -injury from the use of his master\u2019s machinery if- it be in a safe condition, but not if, by the' master\u2019s fault, it be in an unsafe condition \u2014- unless, indeed, the servant know- of such com dition. Here is no evidence' that the' intestate w*as apprised - of the mischievous propensity of the horse. It is the duty of - the master, not of the servant, to be cognizant of the con-, dition of appliances. The analogy between the cases is per- - feet, and as \u00e1 servant may work with an implement on the presumption that, the master has performed his duty in regard to its security, so the intestate was not chargeable with notice of the horse\u2019s, vicious habit. , 1</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The defendant challenges the refusals to charge, but upon ' a critical examination we find them correct in every instance. The supposed error especially relied on is, the refusal of the court to charge as an absolute and imperative fact what rested only on the opinion of an expert. The opinion of an expert is not conclusive with the jury, and the court was right in submitting the testimony to their judgment. \u201c The judgment of a witness is not, as a matter of law, to be accepted by the jury \u25a0in place.of their own.\u201d <em>Head </em>v. <em>Hargrave, </em>105 U. S. 45. p If the charge of the very -careful and experienced judge who presided at the trial be open to any criticism, it is of excessive indulgence to the defendant. -</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Exceptions overruled and judgment on verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Bookstaveb, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b542-9\">Bischoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkD\">I concur.
