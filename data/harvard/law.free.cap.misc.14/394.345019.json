Plaintiff had a verdict of $3,200, and this appeal is taken from a judgment entered thereon and the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted for failure of proof of negligence on the part of defendant. We think there was ample proof on which to submit to the jury the question of defendant\u2019s negligence. The motor man of defendant\u2019s car admits that he saw the horse car slowing\" up gradually when it was about fifty feet ahead of him, but that he did not put on his brakes until his car was within twenty or twenty-five feet of the horse car, and that then he was unable to stop his car in time to avoid a collision in consequence of the rails being slippery. We think that it was clearly the duty of the inotorman, on seeing the horse car ahead of him, to have so managed and controlled the speed of his own car as to prevent a collision. Here was no sudden emergency presenting itself, for the motorman knew, or ought to have known, that the car in front of him was liable to stop at any time to permit passengers to get on' or off, and we think that if was his plain duty to maintain such a distance from the preceding car, or to so reduce the speed of his own car, that he could stop\" it in time to prevent a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The learned trial judge charged the jury that it might com- \u2019 pensate plaintiff, in case of a verdict in his favor, <em>\u201c </em>for the loss of the value of his time,\u201d to which exception was taken. The learned trial judge was also asked to charge that there Avas no eAddence upon which a jury could base an estimate as to the value of plaintiff\u2019s time, and also, that no verdict could be rendered on the basis of four or five dollars a day Avhile plaintiff was, aAvay from' his business, and exceptions Avere taken to the refusal so to charge. \u2019 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>No\u2019 one of those - exceptions is tenable. Plaintiff claiin\u00e9d.. in his complaint, as an element of damage, that he \u201c was prevented and will be prevented from attending to his business for- a long space of time.\u201d He testified that he had been in \u25a0the junk business for twenty-five years, and for sixteen or seventeen years of that time at the place where liis store was '.at the.time of the accident; that he bought* and sold goods, worked himself, kept books and everything; that his pur-, \u25a0chase\u00e9 and sales were from $300 to $400 daily; that he employed five persons in his business; that, for .two months -after the accident, he was oply able. to call at -his store\" and then return home, and some clays he was. unable to go at all; ' that he was not able to carry on his business himself, and that \u2022he was not able to do any active Work up to September of the following year ; that he attended to business until February, \u2022and then the business stopped; that \u201cbefore he was hurt,-he used to buy and sell, or. drive the -truck sometimes, and -go .and collect bills \u2014 drove the truck with .the goods sometimes, took part in the liftiiig and loading of .the goods, and. was not able to do anything in-that line'after the injury.\u201d A'witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, who had been in the business for oyer forty years, -testified that men were hired to manage -a'business as -extensive .as that\u2018of plaintiff,, and that a man Who had the -necessary capacity to conduct such a business as plaintiff\u2019s was worth four to five dollars -a day. \u25a0 ;</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In <em>Masterton </em>v. <em>Village of Mount </em>Vernon, 58 N. Y. 396, the \u2022court says : \u2018^The plaintiff had the right to prove the, business in which he was engaged, its extent- and the partictdar part .transacted by him, and, if he could, the compensation usually paid to persons, doing such business for -others. These are circumstances the jury have a right. to consider in fixing the valiie of his time.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">These are precisely the elements which the plaintiff proved, and we think that, from these, elements, the jury had a right to. estimate the value of plaintiff\u2019s loss of time,, and there being evidence that the value of such service as' this - plaintiff - ..rendered was worth from four to five dollars a day, the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>right in declining to charge the jury that no verdict could be-rendered on that basis. The cases cited by the learned counsel for the appellant go no further than to hold' that, in the-absence of evidence, the jury cannot be permitted to speculate as to, the value of loss of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Nor can we say that the verdict is excessive. The evidence of the plaintiff showed that, when thrown against the opposite side of the car by the shock of the collision, one of his ribs was broken; that he was compelled to go homo and go to bed; he started to go to his shop next day and was obliged to return; was confined, to his bed for two or three days, suffering all the time from pain in his side and limbs and feet, then went to the doctor\u2019s and was prescribed for, and for two-months after that he was only able to call at his store, and then had to return home again and go to bed. The fracture developed a bloody tumor about two and a half inches wide- and four or five inches long, and also pleurisy, and from the date of the injury, October 6, 1893, up - to September* 1894, he suffered pain and was not able to do anything; that he-cannot use his left side as well as he used to, and is unable to lift any heavy weight with his left \u25a0 hand. Plaintiff was corroborated as to his injuries by his physician, who also testified that it takes three or four weeks for a fracture of the rib to unite; that he had examined plaintiff a week or ten days previous to the trial (March 5, 1895) and that there was still a tumor visible over the place of fracture, and also some adhesion of the lung to the wall of the chest where the pleurisy had occurred, and that such adhesion interfered with the action of the lung in that particular spot, and that drawing long breaths or lifting heavy weights would cause pain, \u2022and that, in the doctor\u2019s opinion, there will always be some trouble at that spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Taking into consideration the sufferings of the plaintiff, their long duration, his incapacity for hard labor, and the present existence of the tumor and tlie adhesion, coupled with the loss of the value of the plaintiff\u2019s time, as hereinbefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>mentioned, we are of the opinion that we are not called upon to interfere with the verdict..</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment and order appealed' from must be affirmed, with costs. .</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Van \"\\]Vyok, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u25a0 Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
