Butler, </em>83 Hun, 286, are ,conclusive, of the proposition that the entire rent for the month of August was due on the( first day of the \u25a0 month. Hence, aside from any provision in the lease qualifying the legal rights of the parties, the termination of the tenancy on the twelfth of August would be no answer to an action for all the rent of the month. . But the parties have expressly stipulated that wheu, on the occurrence of a fire, the landlord elects to end the term, the \u201c <em>accrued </em>rent shall be paid <em>up to the time of the fire.\u201d </em>. The landlord, knew that the entire rent .for August would accrue and be due on the first day of the month-.; .what, then, did he mean by the pro- . vision that accrued rent should be paid up to' the time of the fire ? . He could intend but one thing, \"namely, that although \u25a0all the rent for August accrued on the first day of the month, yet the tenant should pay rent only to the twelfth, the time . of the fire. Upon any other construction the words <em>\u201c </em>up to the time of the. fire \u201d would be- utterly without' .operation and effect.- Of course, it was competent .for the parties, by express covenant, to apportion the rent <em>(Zule </em>v. <em>Zule, </em>24 Wend. 76; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Seeley, </em>110 N. Y. 457),. and this they have done by terms of which the meaning is. Unmistakable.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We, are content,, without further argument, to affirm the judgment on the opinion' of Conlah, J., in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Judgment- affirmed) with costs:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Halt, Oh.
