Plaintiff sued for damages -for injuries to himself and his horse, alleged to have been received while driving over a temporary switch, the rails of which were so laid, as he alleged in his complaint, that they <em>\u201c </em>were hazardous and dangerous to drive a horse across.\u201d As to the defendant, the Brooklyn City Railroad Company, it was plain that- it was simply the lessor to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad Company of the tracks in question,, and had nothing to do with the repairing and relaying thereof. It appeared that the Brooklyn' Heights Railroad Company were engaged in relaying the tracks on Flushing avenue, where the accident occurred; a temporary switch had been laid from the north to the south track, and granite blocks were \u201cthrown in loosely, on the flat, just to fill up 'the vacancy there.\u201d Plaintiff started in broad daylight to drive over this switch. A portion of his evidence was as follows: \u201c Q. Were you looking down on the ground as you were driving along there ? A. Well, I was looking out to see that my horse did not get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>catched. * * * Q. Were you looking ahead or down on the ground where your horse was stepping ? A. Well, I was watching; -1 was sitting <em>this </em>way and looking that <em>way </em>to see \u25a0 if I could get him over very careful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">It appears from the evidence that, notwithstanding, plaintiff\u2019s alleged care, his horse'\u201c stepped on a stone, and the stone turned up, and the /heel of his shoe caught in another one of the bars (of the switch) and he pitched headforemost in trying to pick up his feet, and I Went up against the upright that holds the top in the front, and struck my face,\u201d etc. - . '</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u2022 We'think \u2018the evidence clearly shows that plaintiff' deliber- ' ately attempted to drive over the track in- question,, with full knowledge of the danger. He voluntarily assumed the risk and is himself alone responsible for the consequences. Judgments appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">' Present: Clement, Ch.
