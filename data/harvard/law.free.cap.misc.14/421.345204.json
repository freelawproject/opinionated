And by reason of the acts of the defendant the-plaintiff claipis she has been deprived of the support, society ' ' and affection of her husband, to her damage $25,000. -</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">. At the time of the commencement of the action the plain- \u25a0 tiff .procured an -attachment under subdivision 3 of section 635-of the Code, as amended in 1895, which provides that an attachriient against property may be granted in ap action for <em>\u201c </em>an injury to person \u2022 or property, in- consequence of negligence, fraud or other wrongful act.\u201d The latter portion of this provision is comprehensive enough to embrace the-present case. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>McGregor, </em>34 N. Y. St. Repr. 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Prior to this, amendment resort to the process of attachment was allowed only to \u201c creditors,\u201d or for injuries to property,,. where the amount demanded was capable of accurate computation, the existence and restriction of the remedy being of course dependent upon the terms of the governing, statute. While it is easy to understand why a creditor proceeding; against a nonresident should be allowed to- impound property. found within the jurisdiction of-the court to answer as security for ariy claim existing or for the amount in dollars and cents of any specific injury done to property, it is not apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>on first view why the legislature should have included actions for injuries to the person, where the damages are unliquidated, and where the plaintiff in his declaration and affidavit generally places them at an unusually high figure. Neither the . complaint nor affidavit in such an action can furnish .any certain guide from which the judge granting'the attachment may determine what the actual damages are. The legislature certainly did not intend that the attachment should run for any amount a plaintiff might see fit to insert in the <em>ad, damnum </em>of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The plaintiff has in this instance fixed the damages at $25,000 ; she might have put them at $250,000, but it does not follow that property of the defendant is to be impounded to answer the demand thus made. The practice in this respect must, therefore, be assimilated to that followed in granting orders of arrest. Where such orders are made in actions for injuries to the person, the bail is fixed in such sum as the judge may judicially determine, in view of the nature and extent of the injuries complained of and the probable ultimate recovery. Doubtless the legislation was intended to reach a class of cases where injuries to the person were inflicted upon residents of this state, who, in consequence of the nonresidence of the wrongdoer, were practically remediless. No order of publication would lie because no property has been attached. To supply this omission in the law the new remedy was furnished, and it was designed more to coerce the appearance of the tort feasor than to impound his property. With this end in view the act may be wise legisla- \u2022 tion; but to go further and grant attachments against the property of nonresidents in ordinary tort actions for any sum the plaintiff sees fit to demand would lead to great abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It is evident, therefore, that the legislature intended that a judge, in issuing the attachment, should exercise judicial discretion as to the damages likely to be recovered in 'order to fix the amount for which the attachment should go, upon the principles which guide him in granting an order of arrest; the plaintiff may thus recover the sum impounded if the dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>age is. equal to that amount, and the defendant, by liis nonappearance;, prevents-a judgment <em>in personam </em>that might be enforcible by an action thereon in any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Where the action is between foreigners for torts committed in a foreign country, the courts of this state may .take juris-, \u25a0 diction, Or in their discretion decline it. <em>De Witt </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>54 Barb. 31; <em>Burdick </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>46 Hun, 138; 120 N. Y. 421. Whether the court, in its discretion, should have declined jurisdiction here is a question that need not be considered now, as that matter was determined in the plaintiff\u2019s favor upon the issuing of-the attachment.. Oode, \u00a7 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Upon the facts stated in the eqmplaint and affidavit it is not at all likely that the plaintiff would recover more than $5,000 ' 'damages, and there is no reason why the attachment should be held for a greater amount; and in analogy to' the practice of reducing bail on arrest, the attachment herein will be reduced to that sum. '</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The attachment not being a writ of right <em>(Sartwell </em>v. <em>Field, </em>68 N. Y. 341; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>73 id. 1), the court might, and perhaps, would, after a general appearance in the action vacate it, in the exercise of a wise discretion, particularly if it appeared that it \u25a0 was used oppressively. But that subject need not be seriously considered 'here&gt; for it is not now before the court, as the defendant has simply'interposed a special appearance for the purpose of .this motion only.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Th\u00e9 defendant claims that as the cause of action accrued . prior to the passage of the act the case does not fall within its provisions, and to hold that it did would be. to give the statute a retroactive effect, contrary to the canons of statutory con- \u2022 struction. But to these rules there are exceptions,, notably among which is, that Where the act affects the remedy it may have a retrospective effect; that is, may be applied to-eases pending or rights of action existing .at the time the remedy is invoked. : 1 Kent\u2019s Com. 455; <em>People ex rel. Collins </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>99 N. Y. <em>233; </em>Neass v. <em>Mercer, </em>15 Barb. <em>318 Southwick </em>v. <em>Southwick, </em>49 N. Y. 517; <em>People ex rel. Pells </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>65 id. 300; <em>Lazarus </em>v. <em>Met. El. R. R. Co., </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>id. 581. The principle was followed in <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>16 Barb. 509, where it was held that section 292 of the Code of 1849, authorizing the examination of a judgment\u2019 debtor upon the return of an execution issued against him unsatisfied, .applies to cases where the execution was issued before the Code took effect as well as to executions issued subsequent to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It follows that the motiqn to vacate the attachment must be denied, but the amount for which the property is seized or impounded will be reduced to $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Ordered accordingly..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
