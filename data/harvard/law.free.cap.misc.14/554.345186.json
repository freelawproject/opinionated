On the morning of the arrest Mr. Davidson asked him if he was going down town, and on his replying that he was, requested him to call at the <em>World </em>office and get an order cashed. It seems that a stranger had called upon Mr. Davidson that morning and had bought a horse, giving the following order in payment, written by him on Post <em>&amp; </em>Davidson\u2019s letter head:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">\u201cMew York, <em>June 19th, </em>1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">\u201c C. B. Shaw, World Bldg.:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">\u201cPay bearer for Cob bought by order of Mr. Carvalho (from above party) Two hundred and seventy-five, $275.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">, \u201c Yours, Geo. G. Pulitzer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">Mr. Davidson gave the plaintiff an envelope containing this order, a bill of sale and Post <em>&amp; </em>Davidson\u2019s business card.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">The plaintiff handed this, envelope with its contents to the cashier at the World building, who said : \u201c I will have t\u00f3 1</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">show this to Mr. Carvalho. Won\u2019t you come in and have a seat ? \u201d Plaintiff went into the cashier\u2019s office and waited ten or fifteen minutes, Mr. Carvalho being engaged conversing with other parties. Presently he turned to the plaintiff. Plaintiff gave, him his visiting card and said that Mr. Davidson gave him the papers and had requested him to call and collect the money at the World office, telling him that he had sold a horse and that was an order on the World people for the money for it; that Mr. Davidson had given him a bill and asked him to receipt it if the money was paid,, and to ask the use of their telephone to notify him that the order was all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\"right so, that he could deliver the horse. Mr. Carvalho, the defendant, went out for a few minutes and returned with Mr. George C.- Ledlie. Mr.. Carvalho said : \u201cYou know you are in possession of a forged paper ? \u201d Plaintiff answered that he did not know anything about it; that Mr. Davidson had given him the order and asked him to call- with it. Plaintiff had previously \"asked the cashier if - he might -use the telephone if the order was'all right. On being told \"that lie was in possession of a forged paper plaintiff was very much excited, and does not recall the exact words he used. He explained his instructions and that' he- was simply Mr. Davidson\u2019s agent. Defendant said to plaintiff, \u201c You will have to - go with Mr. \u25a0Ledlie; he will go around with you/\u2019 and said to Mr. Ledlie,. \u25a0 \u201c You go around to the- station house \u2014he will go around to the station with you.\u201d The door was then opened and - an officer touched plaintiff on the shoulder and said, \u201c You come with me.\u201d The defendant had previously sent Mr. Ledlie to the station house to state the circumstances to the sergeant, to get an officer and ask that the case be investigated.. Plaintiff \u2022 and Ledlie walked around to the station house, the officer following ten or fifteen-feet behind. They-testify1 that they stopped outside and the officer went into the-station house alone, returning and asking them to step inside. ' The officer and sergeant testify that they ah. three went in together, and \"that the officer did not first go in alone. Mr. Ledlie made the -charge that the plaintiff was found with a forged order in his possession, and the sergeant thereupon had him locked up. He sept, for Davidson and -a Mr. Butler, his brother-in-law, and on their arrival (the plaintiff having been\" locked up about an hour and a half) they were all sent around to the Tombs Police Court with an officer. Mr. Ledlie made the same statement to the justice that he had made at the station. The plaintiff was then discharged on Mr. Butler\u2019s promising to be responsible for his appearance in court the next morning. He attended at court the next iday and was finally discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">- - The- police officer testified that he went around to the World building with Mr\u00bf Ledlie; that the defendant told him,that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the plaintiff had a forged order, and thereupon he arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The police sergeant \u25a0 testified that Mr. Ledlie, when he-first went to the station house, showed him the order and. said it was a forgery. He wanted to have an-officer sent-around, and asked him to have the matter investigated. He then sent an officer to bring the plaintiff to the station house.,</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Mr. Butler testified that Mr. Ledlie told him in so many words that he represented Mr. Carvalho.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">, The defendant denied having told the officer to arrest the plaintiff, or that he had told the plaintiff that he would have to go around to the station house. Both the defendant and Mr. Ledlie testified to the effect that the defendant told the officer to go up to the stable and the plaintiff would point out the man who gave the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Mr. Ledlie says that they started for the elevated station,, and the policeman said he would have to go around to the station to tell the sergeant where they had gone. They went with him, were invited inside, and the plaintiff was. locked up.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The defendant denied that the plaintiff said anything about-telephoning to Mr. Davidson. This was the case, as presented, by both sides. The appellant\u2019s first contention is that the. .court erred in denying his motion to compel the plaintiff to-elect between the two causes' of action, false imprisonment- and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">. While the earlier cases seem to hold that these two causes-of action are essentially distinct, and cannot be united in the same complaint, this rule appears to have'been changed.. Code Civ, Prop. \u00a7 484, subd. 2; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>97 N. Y. 594; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>East River E. Lt. Co., </em>42 N. Y, St. Repr. 212; <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>88 N. Y. 270; 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 16. In order that a - plaintiff may maintain an action for malicious prosecution, three things must be-shown \u2014 malice, want of probable cause, and the termination, of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Malice may he actual or a mere wanton or careless disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>gard for the rights, of others, or the doing of the act complained of without that ordinary prudence and discretion which persons of sufficient age and sound mind are presumed to have. 14 Am. Eng. Ency. of Law, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Probable cause is the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable mind', acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted. 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">False imprisonment is the unlawful restraint of a person \u25a0contrary to his will, either with or without process of law. 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law,. 661. Two things are requisite,. detention1' of the person- and the unlawfulness of such detention. Malice need not be shown and is immaterial, except as it may affect the question of damages (Id. 662, 663), but in such case, as in the case of malicious prosecution, it is necessary to show want of probable cause. \u2022 Where there is no dis- ' pute as to the facts, the question of the existence of probable cause,- or the absence or want of probable cause, is for the \u25a0court. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>How, </em>116 N. Y. 336-338. The question is whether the prosecutor\u2019s belief was based upon reasonable grounds. Id. The defendant denies that he ordered the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. The-circumstances testified to by the plaintiff and police officers tend to establish the fact that he was responsible therefor. Did the circumstances justify the arrest <em>% </em>The plaintiff made no effort to escape; he explained how he came by the order, and that he was sent to ascertain if it Was good, as Davidson would not deliver the horse until he received the money on it. The defendant could have telephoned to Davidson and verified the plaintiff\u2019s story, or he \u25a0could have sent the parties up to the stable. His case rests upon the contention that he did not direct the arrest, nor \u2022authorize Mr. L\u00e9dlie to make the complaint. He, by inference; admits that the arrest was' unjustified., We think; upon this disputed, state of facts, the questions of malice and want ef probable cause were, therefore, properly left to the jury, \u25a0and the justice did not err in 'denying the motions to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and when the whole testimony was in, or to direct a verdict for the defendant. The verdict is sufficiently sustained by evidence which the jury were justified in believing, and we cannot say that it was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">We do not think that the verdict of $1,000 was excessive. While plaintiff was only locked up an hour and a half or thereabouts, in arriving at the amount of damage he has suffered we must consider the injury to his reputation, besides any actual injury he has sustained. It is difficult to measure the damage suffered by any one in his business and private reputation, but under the circumstances of this case we do not think that the verdict should be set aside as excessive, or that the jury were influenced by prejudice in awarding the amount they did. The evidence of what the plaintiff said to the cashier when he presented the order was competent 'as part of the <em>res gestee, </em>as it tended to show how the defendant was brought into the matter. In any event, the evidence being \u2022 merely that plaintiff presented the order and explained how he came by it, and that then the cashier asked him to step inside, could have had no influence with the jury, inasmuch as the plaintiff made the same explanation to the defendant in person. What took place at the station house and police court in the presence of Mr. Ledlie was competent. Mr. Ledlie was acting under defendant\u2019s directions, and the jury could find from the evidence that his acts were the defendant\u2019s acts. The justice had charged in substance the requests which were . submitted by the defendant, to the refusal to charge which he excepted, and this refusal was, therefore, not error. The charge as made was comprehensive of both the law and the facts. Ho exception was taken to any part of it, and we think the verdict of the jury is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bischoff, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
