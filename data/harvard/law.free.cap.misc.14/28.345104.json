Roe for one year from May 1, 1894, without provision of any kind for a renewal of the lease; that Frederick N. Roe thereupon sublet the premises to the respondent Mary R. Yost for the same period and covenanted to renew the lease for one year from the expiration of the first, and -that in September, 1894, the petitioners let the premises to Adeline Y. Rcc, the wife of Frederick N. Roe, for one year, commencing May 1, 1895-.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">' These proceedings for the removal o'f Frederick N. Roe, and all persons in possession of the premises claiming under him, were instituted by the petitioners on May 3, 1895, threg days after their lease to the said Frederick N, Roe had expired. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Only the sublessee, Yost, def\u00e9nded, denying the petitioners\u2019 right to possession and asserting that the lease to Mrs. Eoe was. in furtherance of a corrupt understanding between the petitioners, or their agent, and Mr. and Mrs. Eoe, to prevent, the enforcement of Mr. Eoe\u2019s covenant of renewal. An. attempt was made upon the trial to substantiate the fact of such a conspiracy, but the justice below directed a verdict for the sublessee and thereupon made a final order in her favor upon the specific ground that the petitioners had by their lease to Mrs. Eoe parted with the right to immediate possession of the premises upon the expiration of the lease to Mr. Eoe,, and that they could not, therefore, maintain the \u25a0 proceedings..</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Ho point was made upon, this appeal, for the respondent, with-regard to her attempted defense of a conspiracy; indeed,x we are at a loss to understand the theory underlying the defense, or the principle of law which it aimed to invoke. -The petitioners could not in any wise be affected by Frederick E. Eoe\u2019s covenant of renewal. Heither could their right to refuse his further tenancy, and to accept other tenants in his stead, be thereby impaired, even assuming that the design of the lease to Mrs. Eoe was as claimed by the respondent. Possibly, if it appears that the husband is the real party in interest under the lease to the wife, a court of equity- would grant relief as against them in the appropriate action. <em>Mitchell </em>v. Reed, 61 N. Y. 123; <em>Hackett </em>v. Patterson, 40 N. Y. St. Repr. 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">It is clear beyond controversy, however, that the justice\u2019s ruling that the\"proceedings were not maintainable by the petitioners was error. Their right to institute and maintain the proceedings, existed by force of the statute for such cases made and provided. Section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure in express terms authorizes the \u201c landlord or lessor of the demised premises \u201d to maintain proceedings for removal of the persons in possession after expiration of the term,- and in <em>Imbert </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>23 How. Pr. 456, it was specifically ruled by the General Term of this court that the landlord or lessor was not disabled from maintaining the proceedings because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>had given a lease to a third person to commence at once upon the expiration of the lease of the person in possession. The. \u25a0case relied upon by the justice below <em>(Mechanics &amp; Traders Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>2 Hilt. 550) clearly is not to the contrary. No more was there held than that the landlord does mot impliedly covenant to protect his tenant against the intrusion of third persons, and that he is not bound to secure their removal. So in <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>52 N. Y. 445, cited by the respondent\u2019s counsel, it is plain that the proceedings' were held to' have been improperly maintained because it. \u25a0appeared that the person proceeded against was in possession ;as tenant of the petitioner under an unexpired lease. Neither \u25a0does the <em>dictum </em>of Nelson, Ch. J., in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Keteltas, </em>3 Hill, 330, help the ruling made below in the case at bar. It is to the effect that the statute authorizes proceedings by a lessee against a former lessee in possession, as an <em>assignee </em>of the landlord, but it is not to be concluded therefrom that the learned judge meant to be understood, as entertaining the view that the landlord or lessor could not also maintain such proceedings. The remaining cases to which we are referred by counsel -for the respondent are to the same effect .as <em>Mechanics &amp; Traders' Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>and so are equally inapposite. <em>Trull </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>8 N. Y. 115, holds that the new lessee may maintain an action of ejectment \u2022against the lessee in possession whose term has expired ; but, \u2022obviously, this is not at variance with the ruling of the court in <em>Imbert </em>v. <em>Hallock, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Other errors are presented by the record, but for the -onex \u2022discussed the order appealed from must be reversed, and upon -\u25a0a new trial such other errors may not again appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Order appealed from reversed, and new trial ordered, with \u25a0costs of the appeal, and of the court below,\u2019 to the appellants, to abide the event. The date for such new trial may be fixed in the order to be entered hereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Giegerioh, J.., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Order reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
