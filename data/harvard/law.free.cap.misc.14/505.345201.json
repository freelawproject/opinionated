Coleman, Appellant.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b547-5\">(New York Common Pleas</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AmQ\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A5H\">December, 1895.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b547-6\">Whether to strike out illegal evidence admitted without objection is a question of judicial discretion, and a refusal to strike it out presents no error on appeal.

U. Snedeker, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-10\"><em>Myron II.

The escape of the water from premises of which she was in the exclusive occupancy and control of itself raised an inference of negligence against her. <em>Moore v. </em>Goedel, 34 N. Y. 527, 532; <em>Breen </em>v. R. R. <em>Co., </em>109 id. 297. But, indeed, the defendant frankly owned, immediately on discovery of the injury, that it was imputable to the fault of her employees, and the only fact she controverted was the extent of her liability. She now insists that her admission is ineffectual because opposed by a physical impossibility. But we discover no mechanical obstacle to the escape of the water from the washstand to the ceiling whence it dripped upon the defendant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The affirmance of the judgment in the City Court is conclusive, on this appeal, of all questions of fact upon conflicting-evidence. <em>Clark </em>v. Smith, 9 Misc. Rep. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>In proof of Ms damages, the plaintiff was asked, \u201cTo what extent were those-goods damaged? Was it a quarter or a \u25a0 h'alf as. to value ? \u201d The question being objected to-\u201con the ground that it was not. tlm proper -way of proving damages,\u201d \u25a0 no answer was returned. Thereupon the court .inquired, \u201cWhat was your loss in dollars and cents?\u201d The witness, responded, \u201c Five hundred dollars.\u201d Then, for the. first time, the defendant challenged the- evidence because giving merely the conclusion of the witness. The court replied, \u201c The question is answered, and I will allow it to stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The evidence was clearly incompetent. <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Mathews, 2 </em>N. Y. 514 ; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>128 id. 455, 464. But, to the question eliciting it no\u2019objection was interposed <em>; </em>what remedy then Was ojien to defendant ? Obviously, a motion to strike out. In terms this motion was not made.'; hut. assuming, as the court seems to have understood, that the objection was in effect such, motion', still whether to grant .it was a matter of judicial discretion ; and t\u00f3 jir\u00e9s\u00e9nt the, point of error in the evidence, the defendant should have requested a direction to the jury to disregard it. <em>Platner </em>v. <em>Platner, </em>78 N. Y. 90, 101; <em>Pontius </em>v. <em>People, 82 </em>id. 338, 347. No . such -instruction haying been asked, the jiresenee\" of the evidence is not available error.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">If the appellant is precluded from recourse to the error b,y a technicality,, it .is also true that the amount of&lt; damages awarded against her is abundantly supported by other'evidence which she in no way challenged and of which she\" now mak\u00e9s no comjilaint. . \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">' Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bisohof\u00ed1, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">1 Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
