Each had to cross the line of passage of the other to enable them to proceed on their journey. Each should have used reasonable care in the exercise of such right, so as not to have interfered with the right of the other/ Whether they did or did not use such reasonable care to avoid such interference Avitli or injury to one another was properly submitted to the jury, and we see no cause for disturbing the decision of the jury, that defendant was negligent and the plaintiff free therefrom. <em>Buhrens </em>v. <em>Dry Dock, </em>etc., <em>R.

For such injuries we think the jury was fully, justified in giving a verdict of :$4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Judgment and order must be affirmed, Avith costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Clement, Oh.
