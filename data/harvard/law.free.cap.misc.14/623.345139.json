Dahlgren demurs to the complaint for insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">It is plain that no cause of action is stated against her considered simply as the wife of the owner of the property against which the lien is sought to be foreclosed. That a wife\u2019s inchoate right of dower is not made subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien is obvious from the language of the act (Chap. 342, Laws of 1885). Section 1 provides for- a lien \u201c to the extent of the right,, title and interest at that time existing of such owner, whether owner in fee or of a less estate, or . whether a lessee for a term of years, or vendee in possession under a contract existing at the time of the filing of said notice of lien, or of the owner of any <em>right, title or interest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>in such estate <em>which men/ he sold tinder cm e&amp;ecution </em>under the general provisions of the statutes in force in this state relating to liens of judgment and enforcement thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">An inchoate right of dower is not, according to the settled theory of the law, an estate or interest in land at all ( <em>Witthaus </em>v. Schack, 105 N. Y. 332, 336), and obviously cannot be sold under an execution. Even a widow\u2019s right of dower before assignment is not subject to such sale. <em>Aikman </em>v. Harsell, 98 N. Y. 186, 191; <em>Lawrence </em>v. Miller, 2 id. 245, <em>254; Moore </em>v. Mayor, 8 id. 110, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">This intention of the legislature not to affect an inchoate dower right, so apparent in the first section, is. in some degree inferable from the fact that section <em>17 </em>requires only prior incumbrancers who are mechanics\u2019 lienors to be made parties to the foreclosure proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In other jurisdictions it has been specially held that a wife\u2019s dower is not subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Bishop </em>v. Boyle, 9 Ind. 169 ; 68 Am. Dec. 615 ; <em>Gove </em>v. Cather, 23 Ill. 634; 76 Am. Dec. 711; <em>Van Vronker </em>v. Eastman, 7 Metc. 162 ; <em>Mark </em>v. Murphy, 76 Ind. 547. The force of these cases as authorities depends chiefly, of course, upon the similarity of the statutes relating to dower and mechanics\u2019 liens in those states and in this-; but some of the opinions, notably that in <em>Bishop </em>v. Boyle, point out the reasons independent of statutes why dower should be paramount to mechanics\u2019 liens : <em>\u201c </em>A wife\u2019s dower is a favorite'of the law, not resting in contract, but resulting from the marriage relation. * * \u25a0 * Hers is the elder lien. The mechanic bestows his labor - with knowledge of her prior right in the real estate, and he knows the house he is building, as brick is added to brick, and nail after nail is driven, becomes real estate. He can protect himself by security or not venture. She is passive and can do nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">But, though no cause of action is stated against the demur-rant as wife simply and in virtue of her inchoate dower right, is there, nevertheless, a cause made out against her by reason of her alleged agreement to pay for the improvements.made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>upon the property ? In this aspect, too, I think the complaint is defective. Upon that alleged promise, which was, so far as-'appears, made without any mention of a lien, she has a right to a trial by jury and cannot be brought in as a defendant in an equitable action of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">From a p^nisal of the complaint, including the prayer for relief, it is fairly apparent'that the.theory of the pleader was to charge the demurrant only to the extent of cutting off her interest in the property kgainst which the lien was filed,, although it is -now urged in support of the complaint that a-cause of action is stated against her upon her independent promise to pay. There is an allegation of the <em>\u201c </em>special instance and request \u201d of the husband, but only of the \u201c knowledge and consent \u201d of the wife. The prayer for personal judgment for deficiency is against the husband only. It is also alleged that the notice of claim and lien specified the wife as well as the-, husband as owner, and the prayer for relief is that the defendants and all claiming under them be forever barred and foreclosed of all equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">I think, therefore, that so distinct an intention- to affect thedemurrant only to the extent of her interest in the property is shown that it cannot be held that the allegations that she-agreed to pay for the services and materials, coupled with the general prayer for other and' further relief, state a cause of action against her upon her promise to pay, and which would, result in a personal judgment against her for the full amount. Justice requires that the specific portions of the complaint be-regarded as controlling and giving character to the more general portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Had it appeared, by any fair inference, from the face of\u2019 the complaint that an attempt-was made to unite an equitable-action to foreclose a lien, affecting all the defendants, jvith an action at law upon a contract, affecting only one of them, thedemurrant would have been put upon her guard by a sufficient notice, and might have raised in her demurrer the question of' misjoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>. IT\u00e9ither do I: tt\u00f3nh that her* promise' in- her character of1 wife to-pay for the improvement c\u00e1ii be' regarded as creating1 a mechanic\u2019s-lien upon her dower right* To say \u2022 nothing-\" of '\u2022 the strict compliance Which \" the law exacts-with respect to' -statutory provisions for barring or extinguishing this right - and the fact that, such a promise1 is. not otte ' of these recognized ^-statutory methods, the intention of the act as evinced in section-above quoted, is too clear to allow any extension of1 thedien, by judicial construction, to-cover \u25a0 dower right.'' It\"' may be mor\u00e9 just that a mechanic should, have a lien- wher\u00e9 his material and labor have,1 at the wife\u2019s1 request -and upon \u2022 her- promise to- pay, gone- to enhance -the value of the- property <em>\u00a1 </em>;in- which she -h\u00e1s this contingent1 interest, and more in accord- ' \u00a1anee with the \u00a1present tendency to give a married'Woman full; \u2022control of-'whatever is hers; and mor\u00e91 logical as being in' .analogy with her recognized power to\u2019charge her dower interest by uniting With her husband in a mortgage1;' hut all these1 \u00a1are-considerations for the legislature :in -view1 of \" any amend! -.ments of the act.
