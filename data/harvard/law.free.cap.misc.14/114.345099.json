In that action the plaintiff obtained judgment, and after the return of execution unsatisfied, and due demand made upon this defendant, this suit was instituted.' Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ant having died pending the time for service of his answer, \u25a0 this motion is made and I am .constrained to. grant it. Unless the cause of action is one which abates by the death of the defendant the court is bound to make an order such as is here sought. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 757; <em>Coit </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>82 N. Y. 509. Under the state of facts disclosed by the complaint the sheriff is liable as bail (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 578, . 587); his jiosition is in all ways assimilated to that of bail (id. \u00a7 595), and his liability is to be enforced only by action. Id. \u00a7 596. No argument is required to demonstrate that the liability of bail is contractual, and that the personal representatives stand in the place of deceased bail was recognized in <em>Meddowscroft </em>v. Sutton, 1 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pull. 61. The fact that the action in which the order of arrest was obtained was of a personal nature does not affect the liability of this defendant, which is predicated upon the judgment entered in that action, the rights and remedies under which are not affected by the abatable nature of the cause of action itself. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Phil</em>lips, 11 Abb.
