Another ground is stated, but it will not be necessary to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The allegations of <em>th&amp; first </em>counterclaim are, substantially,, that on January 25 and February 1, 1893, Roldan, one of the. plaintiffs, was a <em>special </em>partner in the firm of De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co.,, who, at the former date, sold to the defendant Power their publication business, and the accounts and good will relating \u25a0thereto, <em>with certain exceptions </em>/ that both of the notes, in question were delivered to De Losada &amp; Co. while Roldan was a member of that firm, <em>pursuant to the agreement of sale </em>/ that after the delivery of the notes to De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201e and before the commencement of this action, that firm collected $495.56 due to said business so sold, which moneys they did not deliver or account .for to Power; and that the notes-in question, <em>if ever transferred to the plaintiffs by De Losada- (&amp; Go., </em>were transferred <em>without consideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The <em>second </em>counterclaim is pleaded as follows:' That after the making and delivery of the notes in suit to De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co., and while that firm had them, and before this action was-commenced, De Losada &amp; Co. were indebted to the ThurberWhyland Company, a corporation, for <em>money had and' received </em>from that company by De Losada &amp; Co., in a balance of $2,062.46, <em>ov,er and above the cost of certain ad/vertising</em>done for that company by De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co.; that this claim, \u201chas been assigned to and is now owned by the defendants,\u201d and that the notes, if <em>ever transferred to the plaintiffs by De Losada &lt;&amp; Go., </em>were transferred <em>without consideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The <em>third </em>counterclaim is pleaded as follows: That in aim. by the bill of sale made by De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co. to Power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201c said business and journal,\u201d that firm and each and all of the partners agreed that, as far as possible, they would transfer to Power the good will and connection of the \u00a3* said publication business; \u201d that after the \u2022 notes had been delivered to De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co., and while they still held them, they violated their contract with Power and interfered with such connection, business and good will to defendants\u2019 damage in $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">I think the demurrer is well taken and should be sustained on the grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>First. </em>That the counterclaims are all <em>insufficient'in la/w.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\"><em>Second. </em>They are not of the character specified in section .501 of the Code, not being causes of action against the plaintiffs, nor in favor of the defendants, or one of them, between whom and the plaintiffs a separate judgment thereon may be had in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Although these counterclaims are set tip in connection with \u25a0certain denials and averments designed to raise an issue of fact, yet, in disposing of the demurrer, the counterclaims must be isolated from all other parts of the answer and treated \u2022as if each counterclaim stood alone and constituted the whole -defense to the action, for good pleading requires that each of several counterclaims shall be complete in itself, unaided by the denials or allegations of' any other part .of the answer in which it is set up, unless suitable reference is made thereto. <em>Cragin v. </em>Lovell, 88 N. Y. 258; <em>McKenzie </em>v. Fox, 29 N. Y. St. Repr. 106 ; <em>Reiners </em>v. <em>Brandhorst, </em>59 How. 91; 2 Wait Pr. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Tested by this rule, the first counterclaim is insufficient for the following reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\"><em>First. </em>The sale of the business, accounts, etc., by De Losada <em>\u25a0&amp; </em>Co. to Power was subject to \u201c certain exceptions,\u201d and it does not appear but that the $495.56 collected by them was included in those \u201c exceptions.\u201d The pleader should have negatived, by proper averments, the inference that this might have been the fact. Without such averments, his assignment 'of a breach of the contract was fatally defective. The pleader should also have alleged that the collections in question were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>wrongfully made. A counterclaim must be pleaded as an independent cause of action. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Grange, </em>131 N. Y. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Second. </em>The notes are alleged to have been delivered to De Losada &amp; Co. \u201c pursuant to the agreement of sale,\u201d but it does not appear whether the contract, which embraced several items, was entire or separable. It is essential that this should appear, for if separable,- some of the property sold having been delivered to Power, the transfer of the notes was not wholly without consideration. There was, at most, a partial \u25a0 failure of consideration, and the notes would be good <em>pro tanto </em>in the hands of De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co. or any subsequent holder, even assuming that they were originally without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Third. </em>It is a very serious question whether such- a claim, if valid in other respects, could \"be enforced in this action against the plaintiff Roldan, as he was a <em>special </em>partner, presumably 'by a limited copartnership. The statute in such case provides that in an action against a limited copartnership the special partner is not a. <em>necessary </em>party, and probably he is \u25a0not liable in any form of action as <em>sole </em>defendant\u2019 except where he is pursued on the ground of his- strict statutory liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\"><em>Fov/rth. </em>But, if this counterclaim were well pleaded as to its substantive facts, it cannot be allowed, because it is not a cause of action against the plaintiffs, nor one upon which judgment could be rendered in' this action between Powell and Roldan; The latter and the plaintiff Van Siclcel sue as copartners, and are not liable jointly for an individual claim against one of them. <em>Spofford </em>v. <em>Rowan. </em>124 N. Y. 108; <em>McCulloch </em>v. Vibbard, 51 Hun, 227; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>29 N. Y. St. Repr. 156 ; <em>Richards </em>v. Reed, 6 Misc. Rep. 217; 26 N. Y. Supp. 540; <em>Harrison </em>v. Vanderbilt, 9 N. Y. St. Repr. 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The allegation of the copartnership of plaintiffs, not being denied in connection with this counterclaim, must be taken as true. -</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\"><em>Fifth. </em>Hypothetical pl\u00e9ading is bad <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>41 Hun, 605), but if the notes were transferred to plaintiffs, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>defendants aver, without consideration, that is wholly imma- \u25a0 terial, for two reasons : <em>{a) </em>The Code (\u00a7 502, subd. 2) provides for letting in a counterclaim in an action upon a promissory note where it is . transferred <em>after maturity </em>only; (b) the defendants have not shown, in setting up the counterclaim^\u2019 either that the no,tes in their inception were without consideration, or that they were transferred to De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co. without consideration. On the contrary, as above remarked, there does not appear to have been more than a <em>pa/rtial </em>failure of consideration. Besides, the allegations of the complaint being undenied in this connection, it must be assumed that the notes were valid in their inception, and that' the plaintiffs' now hold them. If so, the legal presumption, without, any special averment, is that they received them in good faith before maturity and for value. These last considerations are fatal to this counterclaim,' even if the preceding views should not be cor-: rect. The second counterclaim is stated in terms so obscure fhat it is difficult to determine what cause of action the pleader intended to set up. Certainly, there is a great paucity of facts in its statement. Doubtless, a party may, under our system, resort to the brief statement of a cause of action for money had and received peculiar to the common counts under the former practice, but then he must allege more than is stated in this case. He must aver that the money was received to the use of the defendant, and that defendant promised to pay. Here, even the meagre requirements of the common-law practice are not met, and there is no attempt to comply with the rule of the Code requiring a plain statement of the facts constituting the cause of action. The. only facts alleged are, that De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co. were indebted to the Tliurber-Whyland Co. in a balance of money had and received from it over and above the costs of certain advertising done for the company by De Losada &amp; Co. The ternls of the agreement, which may be supposed to have existed between the parties are not stated, and it is impossible for the court to say that the statement of the counterclaim imports any legal liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\"whatever on the part of De Losada <em>&amp; Go. </em>This counterclaim is also subject to most of the criticism passed upon the first. An equally radical and fatal defect in this counterclaim is the omission to allege that the deman\u00e1 in question was assigned to the defendants before the commencement of this action. Code, \u00a7 501, subd. 2; <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Davidge, </em>44 Hun, 342 ; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>52 id. 225 ; <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>3 N. Y. St. Repr. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In stating the third counterclaim the pleader evidently relied upon the aid of allegations contained in other parts of the answer to make out his cause of action. But, taking it by itself, as we must, it affords very slender information regarding the transaction therein referred to. Assuming, however, that the statement of the cause of action is good in all other respects, it fails to assign sufficiently a breach of the \u25a0contract in question. To allege merely that De Losada <em>&amp; </em>Co. broke and violated their contract \u201d by interfering with <em>\u201c </em>such connection\u201d (whatever that may mean), to' the damage of defendants in $2,000, does hot satisfy the very moderate demands \u2018 of our liberal system of pleading. The grounds Upon which special damages are claimed must be specifically pleaded. This is elemental in the law of pleading. (Berg<em>mann </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>94 N. Y. 51; <em>Havemeyer </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>60 How. Pr. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The statement of this cause of action is also liable to the objections already noted in the case of the other counterclaims. There is here no attempt whatever to impeach the validity of the notes in the hands of the plaintiffs, so that, if the pleading were faultless, it could \u2022 avail the defendants nothing by way of counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The demurrer to each of the counterclaims should be sustained, with costs. ' -</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Demurrer sustained, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
