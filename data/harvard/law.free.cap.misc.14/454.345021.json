The defendant\u2019s claim that the verdict is excessive and for that reason should be set aside is not justified-by .the evidence, I think, because it appears that for . several months plaintiff was under medical treatment; that he suffered from headaches, stomach and liver trouble; and several other things as . related by the attending physicians, and that \u201c probably he he may feel the trouble in his liver and spine all his life,\u201d to use the words- o,f Dr. Ahlstrom. If the- plaintiff was -so severely injured, and evidently the jury believed the testimony to be true, I thijik that it would be improper for us to declare the- verdict\" herein ($1,500) excessive. That question was one for the jury, and their finding -should be sustained unless'it appears to be the result of passion, prejudice, a disre-gard of the 'evidence pr some such consideration ; something which in our judgment did not occur herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u25a0 McCarthy, J.; concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
