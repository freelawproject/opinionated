' Laws of 1892, chap. 677, \u00a7 24. With regard to the transaction of business <em>\u201c </em>in public offices,\u201d such a day is assimilated in nature to Sunday (Laws of 1892, chap. 681, \u00a7 41); -but while the courts cannot sit for the purpose of hearing motions upon Sunday (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 6), and a notice returnable upon that day is void <em>(Arctic Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Hicks, </em>7 Abb. 204), yet it has been held that statutes similar to that above cited, as to \u201c public offices,\u201d do not have bearing (upon the courts. <em>People ex rel. Fulton </em>v. <em>Suprs. of Oswego, </em>50 Hun, 105; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kearney, </em>47 id. 129, reversed upon another point, 110 N. Y. 188; While it is the custom of the \u25a0court to adjourn upon the days enumerated in the act of 1892 \u00a1as holidays (Chap. 677, \u00a7 24), yet the legal effect of a public holiday is a matter resting entirely upon the statute, and I am constrained to hold that the first Monday of September is not a <em>\u2022dies non </em>with regard to the return of process, and that in the \u00a1absence of a judge at Chambers, a motion such as that before me stands over, as of course, until the next day. <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Vail, </em>10 How. 458.
