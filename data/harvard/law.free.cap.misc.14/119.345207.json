Obviously, therefore, the four months\u2019 limitation in section 2125 of the Code opposes an insuperable bar to the issuance of the writ. Hence, in their brief, counsel for the relator disclaim any purpose to challenge her dismissal, and propose only to review \u201cthe refusal of the board of trustees to grant \u2022 her a rehearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Whether a default shall be opened and a rehearing had is purely matter of discretion, and the determination of the question is not subject to revision and reversal by another tribunal. <em>People ex rel. Masterson </em>v. French, 110 N. Y. 494; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Clover, </em>83 id. 611; <em>Fleischmann </em>v. Stern, 90 id. 110; Code, \u00a7 2140. Certiorari to compel the concession of a favor would be an anomaly in jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">But upon the papers it is not apparent that the respondents abused their discretion in refusing the rehearing. The trial of the relator was upon due notice. She failed to appear and defend because, as she now alleges, she was prevented by ill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ness. But she did not communicate the fact of her disability to the board, nor request an adjournment until her recovery. In their brief her counsel say that she \u201c refrained from attending the meeting and allowed the trustees to proceed in her absence \u201d because it was manifest that the board \u201c had determined to get rid of her, . * * * . and she. believed she would not be given a fair and impartial trial,\u201d and yet she applied to the board for a rehearing and proposed to make defense before the same tribunal. She had notice, of her dismissal on the fourth of March, and not until the fourth of June did she solicit a rehearing.' Then, too, the fact of her illness, as the occasion of her absence from the trial, is challenged by the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Ole case is plainly and essentially distinguishable from <em>People ex rel. Devery v. </em>Martin, 13 Misc. Rep. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">My conclusion is that the reason given by the respondents for the denial of a rehearing, namely, <em>laches </em>and bad faith, is hot so destitute of foundation as to imply-a mere arbitrary \"exercise of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Supposing \"the application for the writ in due season, and the action of the board in the dismissal, of the relator open -to review, upon the authorities I should be constrained to uphold the determination. <em>People ex rel. Murphy </em>v. Board, 3 Hun, 177; <em>People ex rel. Gorlitz </em>v. <em>Board, </em>52 N. Y. Super. Ct. 520; <em>People ex rel. Fisk v. Board, </em>69 Hun, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">- In applying both for a writ of certiorari to review the trial and of mandamus to reinstate her, the relator would unite processes of essentially distinct and repugnant functions, namely,\"to revise a judicial determination, and to enforce a ministerial duty. But, disregarding the misjoinder and waiving, too, the objection of <em>laches (People ex rel. Miller </em>v. Justices, 78 Hun, 334),.the relator exhibits no case for the allowance of a writ of\" mandamus. Her right is not clear; she had another remedy, certiorari, which she lost'by culpable delpy ; another appointee occupies the place to which she would be restored, and her dismissal was the result of a trial which may not be reviewed upon mandamus. <em>People ex rel. Francis </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>mon Council, </em>78 N. Y. 33, 39; <em>People ex rel.
