These \\f acts,, by all authorities, suffice to .support -the action, and we should not be justified, on a mere conflict of evidence, in reversing the judgment. <em>Baird </em>v. Mayor, 96 N. Y. 567; <em>Westerlo </em>v. <em>De </em>Witt, 36 id. 340; <em>Krumm </em>v. Beach, 96 id. 399 ; <em>Hammond </em>v. Pennock, 61 id. 145 ; <em>Vail </em>v. Reynolds, 118 id. 297; <em>Griffing </em>v. Diller, 21 N. Y. Supp. 407; <em>Fairchild </em>v. McMahon, 139 N. Y. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">It is-objected that the plaintiff \"had- an adequate remedy at-law, but the defense was not pleaded <em>(Town of Mentz </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Cook, </em>108 N. Y. 504), and to cancel the contract the interposition of equity was requisite. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Cayuga, etc., Bank, </em>86 N. Y. 75 ; <em>Bosley </em>v. <em>N. M. Co., </em>123 id. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">It is also urged that the plaintiff made no effort to ascertain from tenants the actual rent, to which the answer is, that the \u2022defendant diverted her from such inquiry; that she had a right to rely on the mere statement of the broker <em>(Mead </em>v. <em>Bunn, </em>32 N. Y. 275; <em>Schwenk </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>1 Silv. Ct. App. 133), and that want of diligence in discovering the fraud is not. sufficient to deprive a party of his right to rescind a fraudulent contract. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lever, </em>67 N. Y. 304, 309. FTor, were the point before us, would an attempt by plaintiff <em>to </em>resell the property defeat her claim to a rescission. <em>Kountze </em>v. <em>Helmuth, </em>140 N. Y. 432,</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">It is said' again that an actual fraud on the part of the broker was not shown. The trial judge finds that he made- the misrepresentation with intent to deceive, and surely this is the legal equivalent of actual fraud. <em>Kley </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>127' H. Y. \u2022555, 561. Moreover, <em>\u201c </em>a mistake or innocent misrepresentation \u201d was enough for rescission of the contract. <em>Koimtze </em>v. Kennedy, 147 FT. Y. 124, 129; <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Lew-in, </em>95 id. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The objection that the defendant is not responsible for the misstatement of the broker is obviously untenable. Defend\u2022ant\u2019s ageht in the sale of the property, his misrepresentation was the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation. <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>139 N. Y. 290, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A further contention is that plaintiff did not rely solely on the broker\u2019s statement, but also upon the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation. If this be the fact, of what avail to the defendant ? Eeliance upon his own statement as well as his broker\u2019s \u2022only aggravates the deception practiced on plaintiff. It was .sufficient, however, that the misrepresentation of the broker was one, though not the sole, inducing cause. <em>Kley </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>127 N. Y. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Adverting to the alleged errors in evidence, to which due \u25a0objection and exception were taken, we find none; at all \u2022events^ none of prejudice to the defendant. The supposed \" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>errors specially indicated are either untenable or innocuous. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the misrepresentation was of the essence of the action, and she was peculiarly competent to prove it. <em>New York, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>118 N. Y. 288; <em>King </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>1 Keyes, 432, 449. Proof that plaintiff was instructed by her attorney to ascertain the amount of rent was probably immaterial, but it was- certainly harmless. Proof that the defendant n\u00e9ver employed the broker to sell the property was - rightly rejected, because contrary to an admission in the answer. Proof that the defendant never authorized his broker to make the misrepresentation was irrelevant, because, nevertheless, the defendant was responsible for the misrepresentation. <em>Krumm </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>96 N. Y. 398,404,405. Defendant insists that-the number of children borne by a witness, was a circumstance affecting her credibility; but we own an inability to apprehend the alleged relation between the two facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The cause was well tried and correctly determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bookstavee, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
