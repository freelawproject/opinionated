This action was brought to recover' the. sum of $176.12, alleged to he due Under a contract entered into' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>between plaintiff\u2019s assignor, Weinburg, and defendant, whereby the former agreed to advertise a certain article for the latter by affixing and maintaiiiing signs in certain street railway cars for a period of twelve and one-half months. The rate agreed upon was fifty dollars and' thirty-two cents per month. The signs to be placed in \u201cfull-time\u201d cars as follows: \u201cNew Haven, Conn., 45 cars; Worcester, Mass., 50 cars; Hartford, Conn., 53 cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendant duly made payment under the contract for nine months\u2019 advertising, but at the end of that period notified plaintiff\u2019s assignor that, he considered the contract to have been broken, claiming'that .the advertisement had not been made as called for by its terms. Defendant at that time stated that he would make no more payments and would hold such assignor, Weinburg, for the amount overpaid.*</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Weinburg continued performance of the contract after receiving this notification; according to his testimony he \u201c went on with the original contract; paid no attention to that (the defendant\u2019s letter) whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Two issues appear in the case, the first as to plaintiff\u2019s interest under the assignment of the cause of' action, the second as to performance of the contract upon Weinburg\u2019s part. j</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">With regard to the first question we must hold the plaintiff to be the real party in interest (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 449), notwithstanding the fact that the assignment was obviously color-,able under the evidence. This instrument worked a legal transfer as against the assignor, giving plaintiff title to the demand, and was not to be questioned by the defendant. <em>Sheridan </em>v. Mayor, 68 N. Y. 30; <em>Bedford </em>v. Sherman, 68 Hun, 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Upon the remaining issue, however, we take the weight of the evidence to be with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The contract was in its nature entire, the advertising in the three places noted being undertaken upon an agreed compensation in a sum certain per month for the complete service (see <em>Dauchy </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>19 Wkly. Dig. 490; <em>Hazzard </em>v. <em>Hoxsie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>53 Hun, 417); hence, proof of \u00a1performance, of the contract during the period in question, with regard to each of these localities, was essential in order.. that the plaintiff, 'might-recover. '</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s assignor did not in any way rely upon defendant\u2019s refusal to complete the contract for the purpose of justifying failure of further performance upon his part; his tesis that defendant\u2019s statements as to this were wholly disregarded. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u2019 Thus the fact of defendant\u2019s' refusal raises no question as to plaintiff\u2019s burden of\" showing performance. <em>Gray </em>v. Green, 9 Hun, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Hor can there be any question as to <em>\u201c </em>future.profits \u201d <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>43 N. Y. 237); plaintiffs \u00a1assignor not only\" was not prevented from' performing the contract, but' did undertake to perform it in full, \"and upon that performance is this action based. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Bearing, in mind the entirety of the contract, we cannot' \u00a1support the recovery upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">As to the advertisement in Hew Haven .and Worcester,' it' may perhaps be said that a Sufficient number of cars \u201c in daily ' use \u201d were fitted', with the signs 'as agreed. The proof with regard to the advertisement in Hartford, however, does not \u00a1show a. compliance with the contract in such a degree as to overcome defendant\u2019s positive evidence that not more than twenty-seven cars operated, in that city were so fitted. &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">For the plaintiff it was shown that signs had been ..placed in ninety-nine cars in such city, but the witness who .alone testified to this fact was unable to state that these cars were .actually in use. \u2019 \"</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">While the record is not clear as to what the term \u201c fulhtime ' cars\u2019\u201d might mean in every instance, it is but reasonable to \u00a1assume that the. parties intended something by the words used; at least that the cars in question should be actually \u2022operated by the railway company in order that the advertising \u00a1signs might be placed in some degree before -the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">\u25a0 We cannot say that the plaintiffs proof stifficiently-discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\"the fact of performance in this regard so far as to overbear the evidence adduced by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Giegebich, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Judgment reversed and new- trial ordered, with costs to \u2022appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
