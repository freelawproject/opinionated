Bnder these circumstances the question of negligence of defendant\u2019s motorman was properly submitted to the jury. We do not see how it can be seriously contended that a motorman is free from negligence, as a matter of law, who drives his car over street crossings in a large city at about the rate of fifteen miles per hour, or at such speed as renders it impossible to stop under seventy feet. We likewise think the question of plaintiff\u2019s freedom from negligence was correctly left to the jury. Before leaving the curb she looked to see if a car was coming from the east; she seeing none, and there being nothing to obstruct her view except the car which had passed her, then 141 feet away, continued on her journey. It was for the jury \u25a0 to decide whether she had the right to assume that no car was nearer than 141 feet and that she could safely cross over, or whether it was her duty to assume that a car was approaching at a dangerously high rate of speed which would make it \u25a0pnsafe for her to attempt to cross, though it was over 141 feet from her at the time she left the curb. We think the motion for a nonsuit was properly denied under the circumstances. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ave. R. R. Co., </em>10 Misc. Rep. 541; 31 N. Y.
