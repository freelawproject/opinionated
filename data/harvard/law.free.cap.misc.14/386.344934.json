Rice ag\u2019ainst the Cowles Engineering Co. upon the credit of the latter for $1,485.46 in the defendant bank. Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant, and from that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7 649, subd. 3) provides that property incapable of manual delivery may be attached \u201c by leaving a certified copy of the warrant, and a notice showing the property attached, with the person holding the same,\u201d and section 650 provides that such person must furnish the sheriff a certificate specifying the property'so held. On August 26, 1893, the sheriff left with \"the defendant a copy of such warrant of attachment, with the title of the action and the words \u201cA copy\u201d \u201cWarrant of attachment \u201d indorsed thereon, and also with the following indorsement thereon, duly signed, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u201c To Eighth Ward Bank : You are hereby notified that the deposit of the Cowles Engineering Co. in your bank and the indebtedness owing it by your bank is hereby attached by virtue of the annexed warrant. Dated Aug. 26, \u2019 93. John Courtney, Sheriff. Wm. J. Cunningham, Deputy^</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The defendant failing to furnish a certificate of indebtedness in accordance with section 650, the sheriff, by letter of September ninth, reminds the defendant that on August 26, 1893, he served on it this copy of attachment, and requests it to furnish such certificate, which the defendant does on September twelfth.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The referee herein decided that this levy on August 26, 1893, was fatally defective, in that the copy of the warrant of attachment left with the defendant was not a certified copy. If he was in error in this respect, then the judgment herein must be reversed. The original warrant of attachment is always delivered to the sheriff; therefore, it is a certification by him that is called for.
