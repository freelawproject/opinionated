People of the State of New York or in the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">It appears by the conceded facts that the premises in question lie within what was formerly the town of Harlem, and formed part of the lands and premises which were granted by the patents hereinafter referred to,. under which, through mesne conveyances, the defendants claim title; that Governor Nicolls by a patent dated May, 1666;, granted unto the freeholders and inhabitants of the town of Harlem, <em>\u201c </em>their heirs, \u25a0 successors and assigns, and to each and every of them, their particular lots-and estates in the said town or any .part thereof ; \u201d that Governor Nicolls, by a second patent, dated the 11th. day of October, 1667, ratified, confirmed and granted unto, the persons therein named, <em>\u201c </em>as patentees, for and in behalf of themselves and their associates, the freeholders and inhabitants, of the said town, their heirs, successors and assigns,\u201d the same premises granted by the last patent, \u201c together with all the. soils, creeks, quarries, woods, meadows, pastures, marshes,, waters, lakes * * * to ye said lands and premises within, the said bounds and limits set forth; \u201d 'and that these grants were further confirmed by Governor Dongan by patent dated the 7th day of March, 1686.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">It is .claimed by the. plaintiff that a portion of the premises in question was situated within the bounds of Harlem creek; that this creek at that point was navigable and that, the tide rose and fell in it; that, therefore, the land between high and low water did not pass to the freeholders of said town by virtue of Governor Nicolls\u2019 patents; but that by the terms, of the Dongan charter of April 27, 1686, the city of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>York acquired title to the land between the high and low-water mark on the whole circuit of \u2019Manhattan Island <em>(Mayor </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>95 N. Y, 443), which included the land covered by tide water in Harlem creek. This creek, it is conceded, has - long since been filled up. There is no evidence in this cas\u00e9 that the'said creek was navigable or subject to the action of the tides. Assuming, however, this to have been the' case, the lands nevertheless belong to the successors in interest of the freeholders, and not- to the city. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>46 Hun, 291; ll N. Y. St. Repr. 288. In the case' just cited, the Supreme Court, in the first, department, held that lands situated along a creek which ran into the Harlem river at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, which -were, covered by the waters of the river at high tide, passed to the freeholders- by Governor Nicolls\u2019 and Dongan\u2019s- patents, and not to the city, -'\u00a1In speaking for the court,. Mr.\" Justice Bartlett-says: <em>&lt;l </em>There would be no question .here, if this creek had been merely a tideless stream flowing into the Harlem. The difficulty arises. from the fact that it was a stream through which th\u00e9 tide from the Harlem river set back, so as to check the steady northerly flow of the creek,which, prevailed except when the tide was coming in, and broadened the -creek at-the place where these premises were situated from six feet in width at low tide to a breadth of 200 feet at high tide. Did this set back , of the tide, \u00a1iroducing these effects, make the creek an integral part of the Harlem river. We think not.. An inspection! of -the topographical map. between pag\u00e9s 39 and 40 of the printed case goes very far. toward satisfying us on this point. It would seem very inaccurate for any one, using language in its ordinary sense, to speak of these premises, as shown on that map, as-being situated on the Harlem river or \u00e1ny part of it. ; Naturally a person -endeavoring to describe their location in general terms would say t-hey^ were, partly in the bed and partly on the shore . between high and low- . water mark of a creek leading into the Harlem. There was nothing .eovelike about this creek, even when the tide in it was high. The shore contours,were those of a widened stream. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The land in dispute was 898 feet from the main body of the Harlem river at high tide. It is difficult to perceive how the creek at this point could be of any value or importance to the city of Kew York in a commercial sense. The city was to be the seaport, says the Court of Appeals in <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Hart, supra, </em>and for this purpose its water front was to girdle the whole island, while the village (of Harlem) was meant for a rustic hamlet, whose inhabitants should own \u25a0 cattle rather than ships. But it does not seem to us that the portion of this creek upon which these premises were located constituted any part of the water front thus spoken of in that case. The fact that the creek there has been filled up, and that a part of it is covered by the roadbed of Eighth avenue, is pretty conclusive evidence that it was valueless for any use connected with shipping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">These arguments apply directly to the case at bar. The premises appear, from the map before me, to have been situated upon the Harlem creek, some 1,200 feet from the main body of the river at high tide, and in fact their situation with relation to the creek, river and tide water appears to have been almost identical with that of the property described in <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Locke, supra. </em>This conclusion was arrived at by Mr. Pirsson in his able treatise on \u201c The Dutch Grants, Harlem Patents and Tidal Creeks \u201d (p. 75), and by Hon. Richard O\u2019Gorman and Hon. William C. Whitney in opinions submitted by them to the comptroller when they were counsel to the corporation, which will be found at pages 167 and 170 of the above treatise.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">This question does\" not seem to have been directly before the Court of Appeals in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Baumgarten, </em>110 N. Y. 380, cited by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, which was an action in ejectment, and the decision rested upon the rule that the plaintiff in such an action must recover upon the strength of his own title, and may not rely upon any supposed or actual weakness in that of his adversaries. Heither does it appear that the attention of the court was called to the language of the Hicolls and Dongan grants. .</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The second objection is that one' Charles Henry Hall, a \u25a0former owner of the premises in question, did, by deed bearing date the 8th day of November, 1839, and recorded the '22d day of November, 1839, convey the lot in question with \u2022other lands to Charles M. Hall and David P. Hall, in trust for the benefit of creditors, and that such trustees have not reconveyed the same to said Charles Henry Hall or to any of his ' subsequent grantors.. .</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">It appears by the conceded facts that the said Charles-Henry Hall executed a mortgage to Edward Sanford to secure the payment of $26,000, which bears date July 15, 1835, and was recorded on the 18th day of August, 1839; \u2018that the said Edward Sanford, by assignment bearing date the \u2022 17th day of August, 1839, and recorded the 14th day of. September, 1839, assigned the- said mortgage to Margaret McGown, who brought suit for the foreclosure of the same-in chancery before the vice-chancellor, first circuit, against \"Charles Henry Hall, Edward Sanford and others,-and that in , such suit the said David P. Hall and Charles II. Hall were not made parties defendant; that a decree of foreclosure and isale was thereafter granted and entered in said action, and in pursuance thereof the premises were sold to Andrew McGown, - \"from whom, through mesne conveyances, the defendants \u25a0derive title, and to whom the master in chancery conveyed the premises by deed dated November 18,1841, and recorded \u2022 December 29, 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Plaintiff claims that the title to the premises in question \u25a0still remains in David P. Hall and Charles M. Hall, their legal representatives and successors, subject to a sale thereof for the payment of the debts of the said Charles Henry Hall, and that the said lands \u201c could not be aliened or sold'without a \u25a0 \u2022discharge from the said creditors or without some satisfactory proof that their claims had been adjusted, satisfied and paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The deed of trust is silent as to the duration of the trust. ' 'There was no evidence adduced that the trustees ever entered upon the discharge of their duties or took possession, of the trust property. \u25a0 The only evidence presented upon the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>jeet under consideration was the deed in question. As more-than twenty-five years have elapsed since the creation of the trust, such trust must under the circumstances be deemed discharged and the estate reverted to the grantor (\u00a7 67 of art. 2, chap. 1, pt. 2, tit. 2, R. S.; 4 R. S. [Banks Biros. 8th ed.] p. 2440; <em>Kip </em>v. Hirsh, 103 N. Y. 565 ; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Husson, </em>140 id. 99), whose equity of redemption was cut off by the decree of foreclosure and sale in the above suit, to which he was made a party defendant, and by whicli his heirs and assigns are bound. Hence the defendants hold the title to the premises in question free and clear of any claim of title on the part of the trustees. Assuming, however, but without so holding, that the trust has not ceased, the trustees would at most have a right to bring an action to redeem the premises from the mortgage, and this right, in my opinion, has been barrdd. Code Civ. Broc. \u00a7 379 ; <em>Shriver </em>v. <em>Shriver, </em>86 N. Y. 575, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The third and last objection is that the premises in question were sold in the year 1886 for the taxes imposed thereon for the year 1882..</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">It appears from the evidence that such a sale had taken place; but that no certificate had been issued. The property, however, was not redeemed therefrom until after this action was brought. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney attended at the place fixed for the closing of the title and objected upon this ground, and demanded the return of the deposit and the payment o 1 $250 counsel fee, which was refused. The defendants did not then, nor at any time thereafter, offer to redeem or'clear the premises in question from incumbrances, or make an offer of any kind. Irrespective of the tax sale, the'unpaid taxes were a lien upon the property, and the defendant could not give a good and marketable title until they were discharged. The plaintiff was, therefore, justified in refusing to complete the purchase and is entitled to recover back his deposit and expenses in searching the title. <em>Morange </em>v. Morris, 3 Keyes, 48 ; <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>James, </em>50 N. Y. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
