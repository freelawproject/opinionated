Yet the contract was, without any sufficient evidence of its modification or abrogation, ignored, and tlie recovery allowed was -based upon'the sum of eighty-eight dollars and eighty cents, seemingly a <em>quantum </em>meruit, but without proof of the value:of the work done. The judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ment was for forty-five dollars and thirty cents and costs, apparently obtained by allowing plaintiff eighty-eight dollars and eighty cents and crediting the defendant with forty dollars paid on account, and three dollars and fifty cents, the amount of an overpayment on a former transaction, but not allowing plaintiff its charge of nine dollars and ten cents for Sunday work.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The utmost that could properly have been awarded the plaintiff was less than this; namely, forty-four dollars and ten cents, obtained as follows: Allow plaintiff the full con-</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">tract price of seventy-five dollars, add to this nine dollars and ten cents,- its entire charge for Sunday work, making a total of eighty-four dollars and ten cents, and deduct from this forty dollars, the amount conceded by the plaintiff to have been received upon account, leaving forty-four dollars and ten cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">As the judgment is not supported by the proofs in any. aspect the same should be reversed. <em>Fuld </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>4 Misc. Rep. 600; 24 N. Y. Supp. 558; 54 N. Y. St. Repr. 134; <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>7 Misc. Rep. 171; 57 N. Y. St. Repr. 531; 27 N. Y. Supp. 336; <em>Pionier </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>7 Misc.

Rep. 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">A new trial will no doubt result in a more satisfactory presentation of the evidence, which -is confused, and will eliminate, and so render unnecessary any present discussion of, certain other questions argued upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">For these reasons the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide .the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Daly, Oh.
