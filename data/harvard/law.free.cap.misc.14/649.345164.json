The testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses was to the effect that no such loose flagstone rested upon' or projected over the flagged part of the walk. If this latter version be true, then .the former cannot be,, and we think the court properly instructed the jury that, unless the loose flag rested upon or projected over the flagged part of the walk, the plaintiff cannot recover.
