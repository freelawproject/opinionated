But, by .stipulation of the parties, that person was president <em>defaoto; </em>and in every jurisdiction, from the necessities of social order and distributive justice, the acts of an officer <em>defacto </em>are1 conclusive as to the public and third persons. <em>Demarest </em>v. Mayor, 147 N. Y. 203, 208 ; <em>Lambert </em>v. People, 76 id. 220, 231; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>People, </em>64 id. 483; <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>People, </em>64 id. 485; <em>People ex rel. Sinkler </em>v. Terry, 108 id. 1; <em>Trustees of Vernon Society </em>v. Hills, 6 Cow. 23; <em>Charitable Assn. </em>v. Baldwin, 1 Metc. (Mass.) 359; <em>Hildredth </em>v. <em>McIntire, </em>19 Am. Dec. 66, note; <em>Mallett </em>v. <em>Uncle Sam, etc., Co., </em>90 id. 484, note; <em>Ward </em>v. State, 91 id. 270, note; 5 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 94. lienee, by service on the president <em>de facto, </em>the court acquired jurisdiction .of the defendant <em>(Berrian </em>v. <em>Methodist Society, </em>4 Abb. 424, 425 ; 6 Duer, 682); and upon the plainest prin-' ciples that jurisdiction was not divested or defeated by the subsequent order of the Supreme Court in a summary proceeding to Which this plaintiff was an entire stranger. <em>Taylor </em>v. Ranney, 4 Hill, 619, 623. Indeed, the \u2022 order does not determine that the president was not'an officer <em>d\u00e9 facto, </em>but only that he was not sncli <em>de jure. </em>. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Were the motion under review an address to the favor of the court we should not be justified in admitting appellant to a defense\u2019 after its deliberate refusal, to appear on the trial and , its long delay in applying for relief. It disclaims, however, the position of a suppliant, and stands defiantly Upon its supposed'right. In' default of such right we have no alternative' but to affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u2018Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Daia^ Ch.
