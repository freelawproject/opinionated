It appeared that the driver of the car did not see the boy until the car ' was upon him. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was as consistent with negligence on the part of the boy as with that of the driver, and that a dismissal of the complaint was proper.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">Motion by plaintiff for a new trial on the minutes, after dismissal of his complaint by the trial judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-7\"><em>Hoffmam, &lt;&amp; Hoffm\u2019an (H M.

One of the defendant\u2019s cars came along the street towards the north, and when near Spring street some' of the appliances of the car struck the intestate, causing death. The carts evidently hindered the driver from seeing the lad until the car had almost reached him, when he was discovered lying upon the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">One of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses swears that the driver was conversing with a passenger on the platform <em>and did not see the boy until the cam was on him; that it was a little damTc at the time, </em>and that the car was stopped in time to prevent the wheels passing over the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The defendant\u2019s counsel, upon these facts, moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that no cause of action had been made out against the defendant. The motion was granted upon the ground that the driver did not see the boy, and was not bound to anticipate that he was lying on the track. See <em>Jetter </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>2 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 458 ; 2 Keyes, 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">It has been held that where the plaintiff\u2019s negligence is not contemporaneous with, but precedes that of the defendant, and the defendant might, by the exercise of care on his part, have avoided the consequences of the plaintiff\u2019s neglect, a recovery may be had ; for a remote fault in one party does not, of course, dispense with care in the other, if thereby a calamitous injury can' be avoided or an unavoidable calamity essentially mitigated. But in order to piake this rule, which is prevalent in many states, applicable, it must be made to appear that the defendant or its servant was aware of the danger to which the plaintiff was exposed. <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Hannibal, etc., R. R. Co., </em>71 Mo. 476; 2 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. R. R. Cas. 191, 196 ; <em>Isabel </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>60 Mo. 475 ; <em>Chrystal </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>105 N. Y. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">There are a number of reported cases holding that it is negligence <em>per se </em>for a 'foot passenger to attempt to cross a public thoroughfare ahead of vehicles of any kind upon, \u201c nice calculations\u201d of the chances of injury, for the reason that the pedestrian has no priority over the drivers of vehicles, and having assumed the danger he cannot complain of the consequences. <em>Volenti non fit injuria. </em>Broom\u2019s Max. (7th ed.) 268; <em>Belton </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>54 N. Y. 245 ; <em>Elze </em>v. <em>Baumann, </em>2 Misc. Rep. 78 ; <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>68 N. Y. St. Repr. 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Of this.class-of cases is that of <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Second Avenue Railroad Company, </em>126 N. Y. 625. There it appeared that an intelligent, healthy lad, ten years of age, attempted to run ahead of a car, the horses of which were on a trot. The boy stumbled and fell, and the car passed over him, causing death: The court held that the car had a preference in the street, that the accident did not happen at a street crossing, and hence the driver had no reason to anticipate, the presence of the boy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>front of his car, and that the boy, seeing the peril, was bound to use reasonable caution to keep out of the \"way of the impending danger which' must have been apparent to him when he unwisely assumed the risk of attempting to escape from it. The judgment entered on a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the court below was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">A nonsuit is proper if the evidence only suggests a possibility of negligence, or is as consistent with the .absence of .all negligence as with its existence. Shearm. <em>&amp; </em>Redf. Neg. \u25a0(4th ed.) \u00a7 56.' As was said in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>40 N. Y. Super. Ct. 13: <em>\u201c </em>There must be something more shown. than a probability of defendants\u2019 negligence ; there must be' .some element of'moral certainty and exclusion of reasonable doubt. Justice requires that it should be proved that defend.ants committed the wrong before they can be adjudged liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In an action to recover damages for alleged negligence \u25a0 causing death, freedom of contributory negligence must be proved; and where the circumstances \u2022 point as much to the \"negligence of the deceased as to its absence, or point in neither direction, a refusal to nonsuit is error. <em>Wiwirowski </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>124 N. Y. 420. The circumstances here rather point to the theory that the deceased by his own imprudence brought the injuries upon himself; and their consequences .should not, therefore, be visited upon the defendant. There is no negligence where there is no breach of \u25a0 duty, and the breach to be actionable must be the proximate cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">If it is to be assumed from the facts that the defendant was guilty of negligence, it would be an equally fair inference that the deceased was likewise at fault, and that his contributory negligence or the combined negligence of both led to the accident. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>58 N. Y. 248 ; <em>Day </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>75 id. 610; <em>Ogier </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>68 N. Y. St. Repr. 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">While it is always preferable to send this class of eases to a jury for their opinion, it is evident that if the jury found for the plaintiff their verdict would have to be set aside; and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>is now made the test whether a nonsuit should be granted. <em>Hemmens </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>138 N. Y. 517: <em>Linkauf </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>137 id. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The application of the principles stated sustains the dismissal of the. complaint, and the motion for a new trial must be; denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
