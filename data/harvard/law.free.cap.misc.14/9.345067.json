Smith promised him a lease of <em>\u201c </em>the house\u201d at a rental of eighty dollars a month <em>\u201c </em>when he (Smith) got his Seed.\u201d As a matter of fact James Z. Smith never obtained a de\u00f3d of the property, it having been sold- to- the appellant at auction, and the latter thereafter took title.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Moreover, there was no proof of agency in James Z. Smith to make any contract of lease for filie appellant; hence, no question of-' estoppel, as relied upon by the respondent, appears in the case. The only evidence in this regard was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>appellant and James Z. Smith were \u201c connected in business.\u201d' This, of course, was no sufficient proof \u00f3f a general agency. No subsequent ratification by the appellant is predicable of' James Z. Smith\u2019s acts, since it does not appear that the latter-assumed to act for the former. <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Schmid, </em>7 Misc. Rep. 455, 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The remaining evidence in support of the defense was that, after the appellant took title he personally agreed to give \u201c the-lease\u201d at eighty dollars a month, and at that time, in the-respondent\u2019s presence, drew a lease of the premises No. 197 Worth street, which lease the respondent took away with him for examination. That instrument was never executed by either party, and, furthermore, was repudiated by the respondent because it did not embrace the premises 197\u00a3.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">It thus appears that there was a complete failure of proof\" that .the appellant at any time agreed to lease the premises in , suit, 197J Worth street, to the respondent. The respondent, failed to show that these premises were in the contemplation of both parties, and the appellant\u2019s understanding was clearly set forth in the written proposed lease, drawn at the time of the alleged oral agreement. The <em>aggregatio mentium </em>essential to a valid contract was conspicuously wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Final order reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to-the appellant to abide the event: ,</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Giegerich, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Final order reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to-appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
