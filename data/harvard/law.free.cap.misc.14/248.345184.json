Hand, Appellant, <em>v. </em>Charles P. Rogers et al., Respondents.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b290-5\">(City Court of New York</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"Ae\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6U\">October, 1895.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b290-6\">In.an action against several defendants as copartners upon a contract made by one of them in the name of the firm, where it appears that the pres-' ent copartnership was formed after the making of the contract, and that prior thereto a partnership existed between the defendant executing the contract and another person, a dismissal of the complaint against all the defendants is proper, as no judgment could be entered against such defendant individually.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b290-7\">, Appeal from judgment dismissing the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-8\"><em>G. JDe H. </em>Brower, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-9\"><em>J. BJ. </em>Hull, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-10\">Eitzsimons, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANV\">The plaintiff failed to show that the defendants were copartners; not only that, but he affirmatively shows that the defendants\u2019 firm was not the firm who signed the instrument or agreement upon which this action is based. It is a fact that defendants\u2019 firm was not in existence at the time it was signed; therefore, it is clear that no cause of action was established against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment against Charles P. Rogers individually. The agreement in question was not one upon which he might be sued alone; it was not his individual agreement, but the agreement of his firm as it then existed, and no action could be maintained against Rogers indi- \u2019 vidually upon such agreement, and could only be brought against him and his (their) copartners.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">This being in our judgment the law, it follows that in this action no judgment could be entered against him, and, therefore, as against him the complaint was rightfully dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Van Wyck, Ch. J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
