The case is a peculiar one, and not likely to- be of frequent occurrence. It is that of a tenant who acquires an overdue mortgage upon the demised property and desires to set off the debt against the' rent in a summary proceeding: This we held he could not do, and we pointed out the ample remedies at his disposal in an action to foreclose his mortgage. . The question is not one which would authorize us to grant the motion asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">Motion denied, with ten.dollars costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">Present: Daly, Cli.
