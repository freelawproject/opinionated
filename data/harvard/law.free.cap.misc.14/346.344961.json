It is a plain agreement that summary proceedings may be had. for nonpayment of <em>rent, </em>and under the principle <em>espressio unius est exolusio alterius </em>default in the payment of taxes is not comprehended. Upon first impression it might seem, that rent should be regarded as the entire consideration Which a tenant pays, to a landlord for the use of. the demised premises, whether directly as rent proper or indirectly and for his benefit in form of taxes and assessments., But the word must be interpreted in the light of its context, and, when used with respect to summary proceedings, it means .something quite different from taxes. <em>People ex rel. Wilson </em>v. Swayze, 15 Abb. Pr. 432; <em>Witty </em>v. <em>Acton, </em>58 Hun, 552; 35 N. Y. St. Repr. 949; 12 N. Y. Supp. 757; see, also, the various Code provisions under the title, \u00a7\u00a7 2231-22|65. The clause cannot be construed as though it stood only in the lease of 1882, or .even as though it found its way into the lease of 1891' by virtue, of an unconditional agreement by the landlords in the first lease to execute a renewal upon similar terms, at the option of the tenant. The landlords could, under the provisions of the lease of 1882, either grant a new lease upon the identical terms, so far as the point in question is concerned, or pay the value of the buildings erected upon the demised premises. The agreement niust be treated, therefore, as though entered into, and its terms selected, for the first time in 1891. Could it be construed as though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>made in 1882, the clause quoted might be regarded as a mere recital of the law as it then stood, and as without any significance respecting the point now under consideration. But in 1891 the laws relating to summai\u2019y proceedings had been amended (Chap. 13, Laws of 1885, amending Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2231, subd. 3) by making default in payment of taxes an additional ground for this summary relief to the landlord. Here, therefore, is a case where the parties, at a time when \"a remedy is allowed upon several grounds, explicitly indicate one of these grounds as being permitted between them. It is not a case where parties to a lease <em>\u201c </em>are presumed to have- contracted with reference to the power of the legislature. to annul, modify or change the remedies therein provided \u25a0, for the collection of the rent- reserved \u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. Rector, 118 N. Y. 476), but where they agree that' only one of several existing remedies, as it were, shall be resorted to between them. We are aware of no reason why such a contract should not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The reservation in the lease of the right of re-entry by the lessor upon default on the part of the lessee in performance \u25a0of any -of the covenants assumed by the latter cannot be regarded as a provision for summary proceedings, but for an action in ejectment, and by a similar process of reasoning supports the conclusion above reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">For .these reasons the final order should be reversed and restitution ordered to the appellant, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Bischoff, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Final order reversed and restitution ordered to appellant, ' with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
