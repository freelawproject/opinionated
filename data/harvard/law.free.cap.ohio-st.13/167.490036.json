Newton, at the time stated in said plea, secretly, covinously, and fraudulently, and without the knowledge or consent of the-said Bell, or his attorneys, procure said pretended release, set forth in said plea, from the said Weakly, all which the saicV plaintiff, for the use of the said Samuel Bell, is ready to verify; wherefore, he prays judgment, and his damages by him sustained on occasion of the non-performance of the said several promises and undertakings in the said declaration maintained to be adjudged to him,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">To this replication the defendant demurred, and assigned as eause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">1.

The said plea contains- distinct and independent matters of defense in this, that it sets forth that the claim on which the action is based, was previous to the commencement of the suit assigned to the said Samuel Bell, and also sets forth that the said release was obtained by fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">3. The fraud charged in said replication is not charged to have</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">been committed upon the plaintifT in the suit, but upon Samuel Bell,, who is not claimed to have any other than a contingent interest in the case. *</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-10\">Wade &amp; Rannet, in support of demurrer:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-11\">So far as regards the formal objection to the replication, that it. is double, we suppose there can be no doubt. This difficulty, however, may be removed by an amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUp\">*Wo contend that the replication is bad in substance:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-13-pl-split\">1. It may be stated as a general rule that pleadings at common law must be predicated upon the legal rights of the parties. An equitable right, however perfect, can not lay the foundation of a, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>suit at law, nor can an equitable right be interposed to arrest the course of a legal title. 1 Chitty\u2019s Plead. 1, note a; 1 Chitty\u2019s Prac. 6, 7; Foreman <em>v. </em>Jervis, 5 Barn. &amp; Adol. 836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-5\">2. The replication in this case abandons the legal plaintiff upon the record, and introduces a person not legally a party to the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">3, The facts set forth' do hot show an assignment of the whole interest in the claim to Bell, but a mere lien upon apart for costs, \u25a0etc. He does not, therefore, stand upon the ground of an assignee to whom the whole interest is assigned.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-7\">Peter Hitchcock submitted an argument on the same side.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-8\">Tod &amp; Hoffman, and Hutchins, contra:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-9\">Without looking at the replication with a technical eye, but \u2022merely at the substance of it, and its sufficiency as to matter, we \u25a0refer to authorities as follows, viz:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-10\">Courts of law will take notice of, and protect, the rights of assignees against all persons having either express or implied notice of the trust, or assignment of choses in action. Johnson <em>v. </em>Bloodgood, 1 Johns. Ch. 51; Wardell <em>v. </em>Eden, 2 Johns. Ch. 121; S. P., Van Vechen <em>v. </em>Graves, 4 Johns. 403; Littlefield <em>v. </em>Story, 3 Johns. 425; Anderson <em>v. </em>Van Allen, 12 Johns. 343; Briggs <em>v. </em>Dorr, 19 Johns. 95.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-11\">The assignee of a chose in action can not defeat a suit brought in his name by his assignee, by a release to the defendant, who \u25a0has notice of the assignment. Andrews <em>v. </em>Beecker, 1 Johns. Ch. 411; S. P., Raymond <em>v. </em>Squire, 11 Johns. 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-12\">And to a release pleaded, the plaintiff may reply the.assignment, and that the defendant had notice of it. Ib.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-13\">*So to a plea of payment. Littlefield v. Story, 3 Johns. 425. See also 12 Johns. 484; 15 Johns. 405; 16 Johns. 51; 20 Johns. 140, for decisions protecting the rights of assignees 'of choses in action at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-14\">The law in Now York and Massachusetts seems to be well settled on this point; and Swan, in his treatise, refers to those decisions as containing the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-15\">Where any one has the entire beneficial interest, or only an \u25a0agency coupled with an interest, suing for his use, in order to protect his lien, it is out of the power of the assignor, or legal owner of the chose in action, to deal with the defendant, and defeat the beneficiary. If he could do so, law would be inadequate to project his rights; whether he owns the whole or only a part, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>he has purchased and paid for the equity, or only has a lien by reason of advancements made in collecting, coupled with his authority to collect, it is all the same. He has an equity in the proceeds, in whole or in part, that should be protected. The nominal plaintiff in this case is a non-resident of the state, and may be irresponsible. The defendant had notice of all that is alleged in the replication. His demurrer admits it, nor can he tamper with the nominal plaintiff without the consent of the beneficiary, and thereby legally defeat the beneficial plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-5\">The defendant says, in his demurrer, that the beneficiary does not claim tho whole equity; that he has not an absolute suit, only contingent. Well, what matters it? An interest in half should be protected as well as interest in the whole. Why not? Can the defendant complain? He knew the <em>\u201ccestui que </em>use\u201d had a. lien. He knew the attorneys had fees. He knew they had paid large bills of costs in pursuing the claim. He knew they were liable for'eosts. He knew they had a lien. It was his duty to-come and settle with the beneficiary, or with him and legal plaintiff together. He ought not to be permitted to go to the legal plaintiff, behind the back of those having liens, paying him and getting his release. This release can not affect the \u201c <em>cestui que use.\u201d </em>It is no defense as to him, nor as to the lien of the attorneys, even for *their fees. To protect the beneficiary in such cases, there seems to us to be no other way than to require-the defendant to pay the claim-, if it all belongs to the assignee, or to pay so much as belongs to the assignee. If the assignee, or \u201c <em>cestui que use\u201d </em>only claims a part,, then such part should be the rule of damage, the release being shown as defense to that part of the claim belonging to the legal owner. The defendant should first pay the lien on the claim and pay the costs, and keep the \u201c <em>cestui que use \u201d </em>clear of costs. The very fact of the defendant paying the legal plaintiff and taking a release, is evidence that the plaintiff had a right to recover; and hence the costs should not be thrown onto the beneficial plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">If this could not be done, then judgment, generally, should go for the plaintiff, and the defendant should be left to resoz-t to the legal plaintiff, with whom he dealt, behind the back of the assignee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-7-pl-split\">The causes of demurrer are not consistent with each other. Demurrant says that plaintiff does not claim full interest. Then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>again, that he claims an assignment of the claim; says the replication contains two distinct matters, viz: assignment, then fraud;, but says again, that the fraud charged is not on Weakly, but on Bell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">The truth is, the replication states exactly the interest of Bell, and how that interest is attempted to be interfered with ; and it, all taken together, constitutes his answer to the plea of release.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">1. His interest, in fact, is just this, he took the claim to collect,, to employ attorneys, pay the expense, and collect, and to have-$100 out of the proceeds. Second suit was commenced, but inability to get depositions, etc., compelled a discontinuance, and costs were incurred and paid by attorneys, and Bell assumed to pay them. The claim sued the third time for Bell\u2019s use, deposi tions taken, paid for, attorneys\u2019 fees incurred to large amount as stated. Newton, attorney for defendant, knew this; the replication charges this notice to Newton, and then says, making fraud the gist of the replication, that Newton secretly got the release, without the knowledge or consent *of Bell, or his attorneys. Does this amount to duplicity? The last allegation barely rebuts the conclusion that the release was obtained by consent, and knowledge of Bell.. We think the replication is not double. We think it good in substance, so far as Bell is concerned. The question recurs, ought he to be protected in law against the after actii of the assignor, or legal holder of the chose in action? The law seems to be clear that he ought. This case is a proper one for the exercise of the rule.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b157-7\">Wood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiU5\">The question raised by the pleadings is, whether the replication avoids the effect of the release set up in bar of the action, in the special plea, and therefore shows a right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">It is by no means our intention to shake tho well-established principle, that a court of law will protect the interest of the <em>bona fide </em>assignee of a chose in action, after notice to the debtor of the assignment. The rule is convenient, and necessary in the administration of justice, to secure parties against fraud and circumvention.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">What, then, is the case made by the replication? It is this - Hall was indebted to Weakly in a claim of many years\u2019 standing. For some reason he does not choose to prosecute it himself, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>assigns it over to Bell, not a lawyer, who agrees to collect it in Weakly\u2019s name, to employ counsel, advance money, procure bail, etc., reimburse himself tor his allowances from the proceeds when collected, and receive a portion of the avails for his compensation. The averment is that advances had been made, and liabilities incurred to a largo amount, that Bell had a lien on the claim assigned to him, of all which premises, Hall had notice ; and that alter such notice, in fraud of Bell\u2019s rights, Hall procured the release from Weakly.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">While the replication thus attempts to avoid the release sot up in the special plea, it show clearly there was no absolute transfer of tho entire interest in the chose to Bell. The extent of his interest was to depend on circumstances, limited by his allowances and liabilities, and his share of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">*Weakly and Bell, therefore, were tenants in common in this chose in action against Hall, as between themselves. Each had a distinct interest, and there was, therefore, something which Hall\u2019s release could operate upon and discharge, notwithstanding this assignment to BolL and notice to Hall. It would seem to follow that Bell could no longer pursue Hall at law, in Weakly\u2019s name, for Weakly\u2019s rights are all absolutely discharged by the releaso. He can not sue at law in his own name, because tho chose in action is not negotiable, and his remedy, if any, must be in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">It is insisted, moreover, by counsel, that the assignment by Weakly to Bell shows a case of champerty, and is therefore void. \u25a0Champerty and maintenance are offenses at common law, punishable by fine and imprisonment. The English and American courts have considered agreements founded on such considerations as champerty or maintenance, as against sound policy, and void. Key <em>v. </em>Vattier, 1 Ohio, 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Champerty is an agreement to prosecute at one\u2019s own risk and expense, and to take a part of the thing received in compensation. Tho common law discourages officious intermeddling in the litigation of others, as it clearly ought. In some of the states they have statutes passed to prevent it, in others not; but where no statutory regulation exists, the common law is universally holdon to prevail, as imported by our ancestors, and applicable to our local circumstances; and Bell, by the agreement set out in the replication, would seem to be within its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>It is unnecessary, perhaps, <em>to </em>say anything in reference to the lien which is set up in the replication, and which, it is insisted, \u25a0could not be discharged by the release of Weakly to Hall. But wo take occasion to say that the law of Ohio will tolerate no lien in or out of the profession, as a general rule, which will prevent litigants from compromising or settling their controversies, or which, in its tendencies, encourages, promotes, or extends litigation. We think the replication is bad, and^he demurrer is sustained. Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
