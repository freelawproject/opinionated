The action was assumpsit. The defendant plead the general issue, and gave notice of set-off. At the trial term of the court of common pleas, on his motion, Burt was ordered to deposit with the clerk, for Dodge, $85.48, which he admitted to be duo, and which he then paid to the clerk. Verdict and judgment were for Dodge, in tho common pleas, and an appeal taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">The cause was submitted to a jury in the Suprome Court, at the November term, 1843, and tho following verdict returned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">That the defendant did assume and promise, etc., 11 and the jury assess the damages of the said plaintiff, etc., to $85.44, the amount which the said defendant admits to be due to the said plaintiff, and deposited as a tender.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">Whereupon the court gave judgment that the said plaintiff recover of the defendant the sum of *$85.44, his damages aforesaid, in form aforesaid, etc., and that the said defendant recover of the said plaintiff his costs, since the deposit was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\">Tho errors assigned are, first, that tho court rendered judgment against the defendant below for $85.44, the amount deposited with the clerk; second, that the court did not, by their judgment, discharge the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-9\">Isaac Parrish, for plaintiff in error, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-10\">Swan\u2019s Stat. 660, sec. 61; Bank of Columbia v.

The amount of costs which had then accrued, was not included. As a statutory deposit, therefore, the plaintiff in error did not bring himself within the provision. It was no legal deposit, and judgment was correctly given for the defendant in error, on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"A9c\">*The judgment for costs is erroneous. The law is, that in this class of cases, where the plaintiff recovers less than $100, he shall recover no costs \u2014 not that he shall pay costs to the defendant. The deposit being insufficient, did not lay a legal foundation for the judgment for costs, in favor of tho plaintiff in error, from the time such deposit was made. Such judgment, however, is not to the prejudice, but for the benefit of tho plaintiff in error, and he can not avail himself of it to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
