The court sustained the objections, and ruled oul: tho testimony. To this opinion of the court, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-17\">The court of common pleas rendered up judgment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>plaintiff, and, upon error, the Supreme Court on the circuit affirmed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">To reverse that judgment this writ of error is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\">C. C. Covet, for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">The testimony offered was sufficient, if true, to bar the plaintiff\u2019s right of action. The promissory note on which the action was founded was incomplete at the time of its delivery to MeKitrick, and-was delivered as an escrow; and before it was to take effect and be of binding force the defendant in error was bound to perform certain conditions, which the testimony offered showed lie had not performed. It was by agreement with him made payable to McKitrick, and the conditions, on the performance of which it was to become his property, wore acceded to by him; and having taken from McKitrick an assignment of the note, knowing, as he must, that the conditions had not been complied with, to allow him to recover on the note would bo allowing him to take advantage of his own wrong; The note in his hands is of no binding force against Brown, the plaintiff in error, whatever it might have been in the hands of McKitrick; and oven in the hands of McKitrick, it could be viewed in no other light than as an escrow. Pawling et al. <em>v. </em>The United States, 4 Cranch, 219. *But if in no other light, can it be looked upon as of binding effect until the conditions respecting it are performed, the fact that McKitrick was acting as the trustee of both parties will justify that conclusion ; and the rule that is sometimes applied to instruments absolute on their face, and payable to the person to whom they are delivered, that a contract or deed can not be delivered as an escrow to the party himself, does not apply in cases )f trustees. 1 Esp. Nisi Prius, 222. McKitrick having assigned the note can not bring suit on it; and as it has passed into the hands of Willis, he not having performed the conditions, by the performance of which alone he was entitled to the note, the nonperformance of the conditions is a good bar to the action.

Parol evidence is inadmissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>show that a note made payable on a day certain was to bo payable on a contingency only. Ros. Crim. Ev. 9; 11 Johns. 201. Parol evidence is not admissible to show a different consideration than the one stated. 1 Johns. 139. Oral declarations, though made at the time of the contract, are not admissible. 5 Conn. 451; 2 Stark. Ev. 550. A contract can not rest partly in writing and partly in parol. 1 Johns. Ch. 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">It is assumed by\"the plaintiff in error that the note referred to in this case was passed to McKitrick as an escrow. The position is not sound. An escrow is a conditional delivery of an obligation, to take effect on the happening of some event consistent with the instrument. \u201cA condition of delivery repugnant to the contract, whose object is to vary its terms, is no escrow.\u201d Wright, 662.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">*The note referred to is absolute on its face. It is negotiable; is made payable to McKitrick or order, at a fixed time, and without any contingency. It is an acknowledgment of a sum of money due said McKitrick, to be paid at a future fixed day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">The parol evidence sought to be introduced is inconsistent with the instrument, and varies the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">An escrow is put into the hands of a third person, to be delivered up or not on the happening of a certain contingency.- It is never put into the- hands of the porson contracted with. The note, then, in this case, can not be regarded as an escrow.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-9\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APG\">The Supreme Court erred in affirming the judgment of the court of common pleas, because the facts offered to bo proved and ruled out would, if true, constitute a complete bar to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Brown executed and delivered the note in controversy to MeKitrick, as payee, to be assigned to Willis, and take effect and become absolute when Willis should pay a specified sum of money, and perform a certain amount of labor. The payment of the money, and performance of labor by Willis, formed the consideration of the note; and Willis not having paid the money, nor performed the labor, there was a total want of consideration for the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">The evidence ruled out by the court of common pleas did not set up a parol contract different from the written one, or in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>respect alter or vary it, but disclosed merely the want of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">If the parol evidence went to alter tho date of tho note, by showing that it was not to take effect from tho time specified in the note itself, but from its delivery over to Willis, such evidence would bo clearly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The suggestion that the note was an escrow, and that the evidence proved that it was not to take effect from its date, but when it should be delivered over to Willis, on his compliance with certain terms, instead of proving want of consideration, no doubt led the court into this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
