We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">Was Hammer\u2019s employment exempted from workers\u2019 compensation coverage under \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">At age 11, Hammer\u2019s parents died and she went to live with her mother\u2019s brother, Earl Gorin (Earl), and his wife, Mary Alexine (Mary). After Mary and Earl divorced, Hammer continued to live with Mary. In 1989, when Hammer was 15 years old, Mary married Robert Helms (Helms), the owner and sole proprietor of Mostly Montana Construction (MMC). Although Helms did not adopt Hammer, he treated her as a member of the family and supplied her with all necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">In 1992, Hammer turned 18 years old, dropped out of school, and moved in with her boyfriend. Later that year, Hammer was arrested and jailed for writing bad checks. While in jail, Hammer contacted Helms and asked him if she could live with him. Hammer was released on her own recognizance based on her agreement to abide by a list of conditions. The list of conditions included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>1. She [Hammer] shall live with Bob Helms at [Helms\u2019Address],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\">Kalispell, Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">2. She shall follow the rules set for her by Bob Helms as a condition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">of residing in his home including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">a. Curfew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">b. Household duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">c. Who can be brought into his home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">d. Who [Hammer] associates with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Dated Sept. 25,1992</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">/S/ [Hammer]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">In addition to establishing the above rules, Helms spoke with Hammer about the necessity of finding a job in order for her to make restitution on her bad checks. Helms also contacted the state Job Service and arranged an appointment for Hammer to meet with an adviser. In the meantime, Helms insisted that Hammer go to work with him and pick up debris around various construction job sites so she could \u201cearn her keep.\u201d Helms explained that in past dealings with Hammer and his own children, he had used the phrase \u201cearn your keep\u201d to indicate that he would not be paying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">Hammer had worked for Helms on two previous occasions. On the first occasion, Hammer was paid a lump sum amount to complete a painting project. On the second occasion, Hammer worked to pay off a debt she owed as a result of Helms having purchased a dress for her. Both times, the terms of the agreement between Helms and Hammer were predetermined and the arrangement was temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">Hammer testified that after she was released to live with Helms, she thought she would be paid between $4.00 and $5.00 per horn for work she performed for him. However, she conceded no discussion of an hourly rate occurred. During her second day of work for Helms, Hammer fell while she was caulking the eaves of a house. Hammer suffered serious injuries to her back including a C-7 burst fracture, Tll-12 burst fractures, and an L-4 burst fracture with 90% canal compromise. Following her release from the hospital, Hammer stayed at Helms\u2019 house while she recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">While recovering from her injuries, Hammer was contacted by James A. Haynes (Haynes), an attorney for the Western Montana Mental Health Center (MHC). Mary was employed with MHC and claimed Hammer as a dependent daughter on her health insurance policy. The MHC had become involved in the case because Hammer had filed an insurance claim for $44,000 with MHC\u2019s insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>company. After reviewing the case with Hammer, Haynes told her that he thought she was an employee of MMC and therefore qualified for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Haynes notified the Department of Labor &amp; Industry of the accident, of the fact that MMC was an uninsured employer, and asked the Department of Labor &amp; Industry to look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In response to Haynes\u2019 inquiry, the UEF sent separate letters to Helms and Hammer requesting that they return the enclosed forms. Fearing that he may be subject to a fine, Helms contacted his attorney who drafted letters for both Helms and Hammer explaining that Hammer was not an employee at the time of her accident. Helms informed Hammer that if she did not sign the letters he would be assessed a fine. Hammer eventually signed the letter. Based in part on Hammer\u2019s letter, the UEF denied Hammer\u2019s request for benefits on the grounds that she was not an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Following the UEF\u2019s denial of Hammer\u2019s claim, Haynes wrote the UEF asking that it reconsider its decision. Since Hammer had not filed a written claim within the requisite 12 months, the UEF did not look into the matter. Hammer then retained counsel who instituted waiver proceedings before the Department of Labor &amp; Industry, Employment Relations Division, Dispute Resolution Bureau. In those proceedings, Hammer requested an extension of time in which to file the claim alleging that Helms\u2019 coercion of Hammer should estop him and the UEF from asserting a statute of limitations defense. This request was denied and the matter was appealed to a hearings officer. On appeal, the hearings officer found that Helms\u2019 misrepresentation to Hammer that she was not an employee was the cause of her failure to timely file a claim and thus an extension of time was warranted. This decision was not appealed and Hammer filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Following a hearing on the merits of the case, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that although Hammer was an employee, the fact that she did not have a reasonable expectation that payment would exceed room and board exempted her employment from workers\u2019 compensation coverage under \u00a7 39-71-402(2)(h), MCA. Hammer appeals the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">Was Hammer\u2019s employment exempted from workers\u2019 compensa-, tion coverage under \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>This Court employs two standards of review for Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decisions: We review the findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial, credible evidence, and we review conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Turjan v. Valley View Estates </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 386, 390, 901 P.2d 76, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">In the instant case, Hammer contends that she, like any other employee, had a reasonable expectation of payment. Helms, on the other hand, maintains that Hammer\u2019s expectations of compensation were not reasonable and compensation for her work extended no further than room and board. In its findings of fact, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found Helms\u2019 testimony to be more consistent and more credible than Hammer\u2019s. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court specifically noted that Hammer testified at a Department of Labor hearing, in her affidavit, in her deposition, and at trial; each time her story differed. The court contrasted these inconsistencies with Helms\u2019 consistent testimony that he merely brought Hammer to work to \u201ckeep an eye on her\u201d and so she could \u201cearn her keep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">When conflicting testimony exists, it is within the province of the trial court to determine the credibility of witnesses as well as the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Taylor v. State Compensation Insurance Fund </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 432, 437, 913 P.2d 1242, 1246 (citing <em>Wilson v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 313, 317, 903 P.2d 785, 787-88). In this case, as in <em>Taylor, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was faced with conflicting testimony. In such cases, our standard is not whether the evidence supports findings different than those made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, but whether substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s findings. <em>Taylor, </em>913 P.2d at 1246. In the instant case, we find that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determination that Hammer did not have a reasonable expectation of being paid is supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Section 39-71-401(2)(h), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(2) Unless the employer elects coverage for these employments under this chapter and an insurer allows an election, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not apply to any of the following employments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">(h) employment of a person performing services in return for aid or sustenance only, except employment of a volunteer under 67-2-105 [.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-G\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In arguing that she does not fit under this exception, Hammer cites to <em>Carlson v. Cain </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 311, 664 P.2d 913. In <em>Carlson, </em>Debra Carlson\u2019s (Carlson) fianc\u00e9 had entered into a contract with the Billings Gazette to deliver newspapers from Billings, Montana, to Fairview, Montana, and all drop points in between. While living with her fianc\u00e9, Carlson began making deliveries three or four times a week to assist him in his contractual obligations to the Gazette. <em>Carlson, </em>664 P.2d at 914. When Carlson was unable to make the deliveries, her fianc\u00e9 had to hire someone else, whom he paid $15 to $30. <em>Carlson, </em>664 P.2d at 915. While delivering newspapers for her fianc\u00e9, Carlson was severely injured in an auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In <em>Carlson, </em>this Court upheld the following Workers\u2019 Compensation Court findings: that Carlson was an employee of her fianc\u00e9; that Carlson\u2019s employment was not excluded under statutory exceptions; and that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Carlson\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was an employee of the newspaper despite language in the contract and the fact that the newspaper disclaimed having control. <em>Carlson, </em>664 P.2d at 918-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In <em>Carlson, </em>this Court explained that employment status can be established by the existence of a contract for hire, and that such an employment contract may be \u201cexpress or implied, oral or written.\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>664 P.2d at 916 (quoting \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA). This Court explained that Carlson was not just doing housework and cooking in exchange for room and board, rather she was working virtually full time outside the home and her reasonable expectations exceeded room and board. <em>Carlson, </em>664 P.2d at 919. In <em>Carlson, </em>this Court held that an implicit agreement existed between Carlson and her fianc\u00e9 because Carlson furnished valuable driving services to her fianc\u00e9 and reasonably expected payment beyond those benefits which were just a part of her living arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In the instant case, Hammer argues that she, like Carlson, furnished valuable services to her employer and had a reasonable expectation she would be paid. However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Hammer\u2019s expectations were limited to her obligation to offset room and board for herself. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court points to the consistent testimony of Helms that Hammer was merely \u201cearning her keep\u201d and thus any expectation of compensation was not reasonable. In contrast, Carlson and her fianc\u00e9 had an implicit agreement that she would receive some benefit for her services above and beyond room and board. <em>Carlson, </em>664 P.2d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>At the time of her accident, Hammer was merely \u201cearning her keep\u201d for the room and board she received from Helms. Hammer\u2019s work with Helms was a temporary arrangement which was to continue only until she was able to find a paying job through the Job Service. In contrast to previous work arrangements, Helms and Hammer had not specifically agreed to anything other than room and board. Indeed, Helms had made Hammer aware that she would be \u201cearning her keep.\u201d The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial credible evidence and they indicate that Hammer did not have a reasonable expectation of monetary compensation. Rather, she was performing services at the job site in return for aid and sustenance. We hold that Hammer\u2019s employment falls under the exception set forth in \u00a7 39-71-401(2)(h), MCA, exempting her from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
