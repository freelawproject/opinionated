In response, Rebecca filed an adversarial proceeding in Bankruptcy Court, in which she objected to the discharge of Justin\u2019s obligations to her. On January 12, 1995, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order in which it abstained from the proceeding and remanded the question of dischargeability to the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial Court in Yellowstone County. Following a hearing, the District Court issued an order in which it concluded that, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), Justin\u2019s debts to Rebecca for maintenance and property settlement are not dischargeable. Justin appeals the District Court\u2019s order. We affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">We address three issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">1. Did the District Court have jurisdiction to decide the issue of dischargeability, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">2. Did the District Court err when it concluded that Justin\u2019s maintenance obligation is not dischargeable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">3. Did the District Court err when it concluded that Justin\u2019s property settlement obligation is not dischargeable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">The marriage of Justin and Rebecca Yates was dissolved by decree on June 30, 1992. The dissolution decree required Justin to pay Rebecca the amount of $23,171.50 for property settlement, and maintenance in the amount of $300 per month for twenty-four months or until full-time employment or remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">As of 1994, Justin had not paid any of the amount owed to Rebecca for property settlement or maintenance. Following a hearing on August 11,1994, the District Court entered an order in which it found that Justin had property and income sufficient to make some payments on the two obligations to Rebecca. The court therefore found Justin to be in contempt and ordered him to sell certain items of property and to sign a partial assignment of wages to purge himself of contempt. Justin did not appeal the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>On September 6,1994, Justin filed a petition pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court and sought a discharge from his property division and maintenance obligations. In response, Rebecca filed an adversarial proceeding in which she claimed that Justin\u2019s debts to her were not dischargeable. On January 12, 1995, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order of abstention and remanded the case to the Thirteenth Judicial District Court for a determination of dischargeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The District Court held a hearing to consider the issue of the dischargeability of Justin\u2019s two debts to Rebecca on October 27,1995. In its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order, entered November 15,1995, the court concluded that, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), neither Justin\u2019s maintenance obligation nor his property settlement obligation are dischargeable. The court therefore ordered Justin to comply with its contempt order of August 23, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Our review of a district court\u2019s order is two-fold. First, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Daines v. Knight </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 R2d 904, 906. Second, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Did the District Court have jurisdiction to decide the issue of dischargeability, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In this case, the United States Bankruptcy Court in the District of Montana entered an order in which it abstained from the issue of the dischargeability of Justin\u2019s debts and transferred the issue to the Thirteenth Judicial District Court in Yellowstone County. The Bankruptcy Court reasoned that the proper forum for the issue of the discharge of a support claim in a divorce action is the state district court. In support of its conclusion, the court relied on <em>In re Rough </em>(Bankr. Mont. 1986), 3 Mont. B.R. 1,3, in which the same court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyW\">It is a well settled rule that the Bankruptcy Court has concurrent jurisdiction, as opposed to exclusive jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of a debt under Section 523(a)(5). <em>In re Aldrich, </em>34 B.R. 776, 780 (BAP 9th Cir. 1983); <em>State of Montana ex rel. Rough v. District Court, </em>[218 Mont. 499, 502, 710 P.2d 47, 49], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>42 St. Rep. 1773, 1775 (1985); 3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>523.15(6), pp. 108-109 (15th edition).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The District Court accepted concurrent jurisdiction and concluded that (1) Justin\u2019s maintenance obligation is not dischargeable, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), and that (2) Justin\u2019s property-settlement obligation is not dischargeable, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">It is well established that a state district court has concurrent jurisdiction with a federal bankruptcy court to determine the issue of the dischargeability of debts pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). <em>State ex rel. Rough v. District Court </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 499, 502, 710 P.2d 47, 49. Therefore, we hold that the District Court in this case had jurisdiction, following the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s abstention, to decide the issue of the dischargeability of Justin\u2019s maintenance and property division obligations pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Did the District Court err when it concluded that Justin\u2019s maintenance obligation is not dischargeable?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The parties\u2019 decree of dissolution, entered on June 30, 1992, required Justin to pay Rebecca the amount of $23,171.50 as the value of her interest in marital property, and maintenance in the amount of $300 per month for twenty-four months or until full-time employment or remarriage. In support of its award of maintenance, the District Court made a finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">Rebecca had no skills or job training at the time of separation. She has embarked on a plan of vocational training, and she needs some financial assistance to complete that so that she can become self-supporting. She is receiving financial assistance during her training by reason of a PELL grant. Justin\u2019s living expenses are very low because he lives on his parents\u2019 ranch and is able to contribute something to Rebecca\u2019s reasonable maintenance .... Commencing July 1st, 1992 Justin should pay Rebecca $300 per month until she obtains <em>full </em>employment or remarries, but in any event not to exceed 24 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Justin did not appeal the District Court\u2019s order which awarded Rebecca maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">In determining the issue of the dischargeability of Justin\u2019s debt, the District Court concluded that its original maintenance award is not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5) excepts from discharge a debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>to a spouse, former spouse, or a child of the debtor, for alimony to, maintenance for, or support of such spouse or child, in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of record, determination made in accordance with State or territorial law by a governmental emit, or property settlement agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Section 523(a)(5)(B) provides that the exception does not extend to a debt to the extent that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">such debt includes a liability designated as alimony, maintenance, or support, unless such liability is actually in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In this case, Justin maintains that the District Court\u2019s award of maintenance is not \u201cin the nature of... maintenance,\u201d pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5)(B), and is thus dischargeable. Specifically, Justin alleges that Rebecca became self-supporting in mid-September 1992, so that the District Court\u2019s maintenance award was no longer necessary after that date. Justin therefore maintains that \u201c[t]he portion payable after Rebecca became self-supporting ... should be discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The determination of whether a debt to a former spouse qualifies as nondischargeable support pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5)(B) is a matter of federal law. <em>In re Gianakas </em>(3d Cir. 1990), 917 F.2d 759, 762. Federal courts have held that \u201c[t]he critical question in determining whether the obligation is, in substance, support is \u2018the function served by the obligation at the time of divorce.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Sampson </em>(10th Cir. 1993), 997 F.2d 717, 725. Factors relied on by bankruptcy courts in making such a determination include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">(1) Whether the obligation under consideration is subject to contingencies, such as death or remarriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">(2) Whether the payment was fashioned in order to balance disparate incomes of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">(3) Whether the obligation is payable in installments or a lump sum;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">(4) Whether there are minor children involved in a marriage requiring support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">(5) The respective physical health of the spouse and the level of education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">(6) Whether, in fact, there was a need for spousal support at the time of the circumstances of the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>In re Robinson </em>(Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1996), 193 B.R. 367, 372. <em>See also In re Bowsman </em>(Bankr. M.D. FI. 1991), 128 B.R. 485, 487; <em>In re Graves </em>(Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1987), 69 B.R. 626, 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In this case, an evaluation of the terms of the dissolution decree in light of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5)(B) and federal bankruptcy factors clearly supports the District Court\u2019s finding that the original maintenance award was in the nature of support, and therefore nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). As set forth above, the award was payable in monthly installments for a period of up to twenty-four months and was made contingent upon remarriage or full-time employment. Furthermore, the award was based on the court\u2019s finding that Rebecca had no skills or job training at the time of the couple\u2019s separation and therefore needed financial assistance for vocational training. Finally, the award referred to the couple\u2019s disparate incomes and found that Justin had the means to contribute to Rebecca\u2019s reasonable maintenance. Based on the foregoing factors, we hold that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Justin\u2019s maintenance obligation was not dischargeable is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Furthermore, we reject Justin\u2019s contention that the District Court was required to re-evaluate the original maintenance award in light of Rebecca\u2019s subsequent employment. The majority of federal bankruptcy courts holds that an inquiry into whether a maintenance award is in the nature of support, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), should not include an examination of the present situation of the parties. <em>See, e.g., Forsdick v. Turgeon </em>(2d Cir. 1987), 812 F.2d 801, 803; <em>In re Harrell </em>(11th. Cir. 1985), 754 F.2d 902, 907; <em>Boyle v. Donovan </em>(8th Cir. 1984), 724 F.2d 681, 683; <em>In re Stone </em>(Bankr. D.Md. 1987), 79 B.R. 633, 639. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in fact, addressed the same issue and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">As a secondary position the husband argues that even if the ... award was in the nature of alimony and hence was nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(5), the bankruptcy court should have taken notice of the alleged \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d of the parties and held that because the wife apparently no longer requires the support granted to her by the state court decision, the obligation is dischargeable despite the language of \u00a7 523(a)(5)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">There is no support in the language of \u00a7 523(a)(5) for the husband\u2019s position. As the eleventh circuit noted in <em>Harrell, </em>754 F.2d at 906, \u201c[t]he language does not suggest a precise inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>financial circumstances to determine precise levels of need or support; nor does the statutory language contemplate an ongoing assessment of need as circumstances change.\u201d <em>To be exempt from discharge an award of alimony or support does not have to conform exactly to some level that a bankruptcy judge might deem necessary for maintenance of a former spouse or children; it merely has to be \u201cin the nature of\u2019 alimony or support. In short, there is no warrant for a federal bankruptcy court to evaluate the state court\u2019s alimony award against the needs of the former spouse to whom it was granted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><em>Forsdick, </em>812 F.2d at 803-04 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In this case, then, the circumstances of Rebecca\u2019s employment after the decree of dissolution are clearly irrelevant to a determination of the dischargeability of Justin\u2019s maintenance debts. If Justin had chosen to contest Rebecca\u2019s award of maintenance, he could have appealed the District Court\u2019s original dissolution decree or petitioned that court for a modification of the decree. It is a matter of federal law, however, that the proper forum for a determination of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d is not a federal bankruptcy court or a state court sitting as a bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We therefore hold that the District Court did not err when it declined to consider the changed circumstances of the parties. We affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that Justin\u2019s maintenance debt was not dischargeable, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Did the District Court err when it concluded that Justin\u2019s property settlement obligation is not dischargeable?</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The District Court, in its \u201cOrder of Nondischargeability,\u201d concluded that Justin\u2019s obligation to pay Rebecca the amount of $23,171.50 for settlement of her interest in the marital property is not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), which provides that debts which constitute alimony, maintenance, or support are excepted from discharge. On appeal, Justin maintains that the $23,171.50 obligation is not a debt for alimony, maintenance, or support of Rebecca, and is thus dischargeable as a debt for the division of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">It is well established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">An indebtedness for a former spouse for alimony, maintenance, or support of the spouse or the couple\u2019s children which is memorialized in the divorce decree is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). <em>An indebtedness in the divorce decree that merely divides the marriage property, however, is dischargeable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALk\"><em>State ex rel. Rough v. District Court </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 499, 503, 710 P.2d 47, 49 (quoting <em>In re Coil </em>(7th Cir. 1982), 680 F.2d 1170, 1171). <em>See also In re Morel </em>(8th Cir. 1992), 983 F.2d 104, 105; <em>In re Brody </em>(2d Cir. 1993), 3 F.3d 35, 38. This Court has adopted a test for the determination of whether an alleged property settlement is intended for a spouse\u2019s support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">In determining whether an obligation is intended for support of a former spouse, the court must look beyond the language of the decree to the intent of the parties and to the substance of the obligation .... If an agreement fails to provide explicitly for spousal support, a court may presume that a so-called \u201cproperty settlement\u201d is intended for support when the circumstances of the case indicate that the recipient spouse needs support.... Factors indicating that support is necessary include the presence of minor children and an imbalance in the relative income of the parties .... Similarly, if an obligation terminates on the death or remarriage of the recipient spouse, a court may be inclined to classify the agreement as one for support.... A property settlement would not be affected by the personal circumstances of the recipient spouse; thus, a change in those circumstances would not affect a true property settlement, although it would affect the need for support. The court will look also to nature and duration of the obligation to determine whether it is intended as support. Support payments tend to mirror the recipient spouse\u2019s need for support. Thus, such payments are generally made directly to the recipient spouse and are paid in installments over a substantial period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Rough, </em>218 Mont, at 503-04, 710 P.2d at 50 (quoting <em>Shaver v. Shaver </em>(9th Cir. 1984), 736 F.2d 1314, 1316-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In this case, the District Court made no finding that the amount awarded for division of the couple\u2019s marital property was actually in the nature of support. In fact, a review of the decree of dissolution makes clear that the $27,171.50 obligation was solely intended as a division of the couple\u2019s marital estate. In the decree, the District Court entered the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">The court finds that... the net estate of the parties at the time of separation is $61,855 ($54,099 [cattle and other assets] + $3,450 C.D. + $1,600 state income refund + $2,706 federal income refund). Accordingly, each party should receive $30,927.50 as that party\u2019s one-half share of the net marital estate .... Justin shall transfer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Rebecca said certificate of deposit in the amount of $3,450 and transfer to her by endorsement of the check, or otherwise, the federal and state income tax refund in the amount of $4,306, which, when deducted from her share of the marital estate, leaves a balance due her of $23,171.50; said amount shall be paid Justin to Rebecca as soon as practicable, and in any event, not later than 60 days from the date of entry of judgment herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Based on the <em>Rough </em>factors, the District Court\u2019s property division does not qualify does not qualify as an order in the nature of support. First, the award was not dependent upon Rebecca\u2019s personal circumstances and was thus not terminable upon Rebecca\u2019s death or remarriage. Second, the award was not payable in installment payments over a substantial period of time, but instead was to be paid in one lump sum within a period of sixty days. Finally, the dissolution decree provided separately for Rebecca\u2019s support in the form of an award of maintenance, which, as set forth above, clearly addressed Rebecca\u2019s need for support in light of the disparity in the couple\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Because the property division award was not in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support, it is not a nondischargeable debt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). On appeal, however, Rebecca contends that even if Justin\u2019s debt is not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5), this Court may still affirm the District Court\u2019s \u201cOrder of Nondischargeability\u201d on the ground that Justin\u2019s debt is not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In this case, the District Court did not address the issue of the dischargeability of Justin\u2019s debts pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6), which provides that a debtor may not be released from a debt \u201cfor willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\u201d The District Court\u2019s failure to address that issue was, however, correct. A claim pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6), unlike \u00a7 523(a)(5), \u201cmay not be pursued in the state court as a result of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to the bankruptcy courts by the bankruptcy code.\u201d <em>In re Aldrich </em>(Bankr. App. 1983), 34 B.R. 776,781. <em>See also In re Martinez </em>(Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1990), 110 B.R. 353, 355; <em>In re Holt </em>(Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1989), 102 B.R. 116, 119; <em>In re Petronello </em>(Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1983), 33 B.R. 750, 751. Because the dischargeability of a debt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6) is within the exclusive jurisdiction of a federal bankruptcy court, the District Court in this case clearly did not have jurisdiction to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>whether Justin\u2019s debt for property division was dischargeable pursuant to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We hold that the District Court erred when it concluded that Justin\u2019s debt for property division is not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(5). We further hold that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to address the issue of the dischargeability of that debt pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6). We therefore reverse that portion of the court\u2019s \u201cOrder of Nondischargeability\u201d which concluded that Justin\u2019s $23,171.50 debt was not dischargeable and affirm that portion of the District Court\u2019s order which concluded that Justin\u2019s maintenance obligation was not dischargeable.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
