We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction against MHSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\"><em>Section 504 </em>/ <em>IDEA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Resolution of this appeal depends, in large part, on the proper interpretation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) (\u00a7 504), and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 through \u00a7 1491 (IDEA). Because of the importance of these federal statutes in understanding this case, we begin with a general overview of \u00a7 504 and IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Section 504 was enacted to address discrimination against disabled persons. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). Section 504 is divided into different subsections which address subject matters ranging from education and employment to social services. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104. The \u00a7 504 definition of disabled is broad and includes persons who have \u201cphysical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(j). A student who meets all of the criteria of \u00a7 504 must be provided an opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, such as interscholastic athletic competitions, which is equal to that of other students. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.37(a)(1) and (c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">IDEA originally was enacted to address the failure of state education systems to recognize and meet the educational needs of children with disabilities. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400. IDEAis much narrower than \u00a7 504 with regard to the types of disabilities which are protected. <em>Compare </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) <em>with </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(7)(B) and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(j). For example, IDEA lists specific disabilities, such as mental retardation, blindness and deafness, which qualify a student for IDEA assistance. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(l)(i). Thus, all students who are qualified under IDEA also fall within the anti-discrimination protections of \u00a7 504; however, all \u00a7 504 students are not necessarily IDEA-qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">State and local education agencies are required to provide children who qualify as disabled under IDEA with free and appropriate public education which means, in part, special education and related services provided in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP). <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400(c), 1415; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.8(d). An IEP, as that term is used in IDEA, is a formal written statement developed for an IDEA-qualified disabled student; an IEP must specify the student\u2019s educational goals, objectives, curriculum and related services and be in effect before special education is provided to the child. <em>See 20 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(20); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.340, 300.342, 300.346.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u201cEach public agency must provide special education and related services to a child with a disability in accordance with an IEP.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.350. \u201cRelated services,\u201d as that term is used in IDEA, includes recreational activities where such activities are required to assist an IDEA-qualified disabled student in benefitting from special education. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(17). Thus, where an IEP contains a requirement for participation in extracurricular activities, for example, interscholastic sports, such participation is encompassed in the student\u2019s guaranteed right to free and appropriate public education. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400(c), 1401(a)(17), (18) and (20); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.1, 300.8, 300.16, 300.350.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">MHSA is a nonprofit association incorporated under the laws of Montana. Membership in MHSA is voluntary and is comprised of various public and private high schools, including Butte High School. MHSA has the exclusive authority to supervise, control, regulate and administer interscholastic activities among member high schools. To that end, MHSA has enacted by-laws and rules governing member high schools, including rules addressing eligibility requirements for participating in interscholastic athletic competitions. MHSA has the power to sanction and penalize a member school which allows an ineligible student to participate in such competitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Two MHSA by-laws are at issue here. The first is a by-law commonly referred to as the \u201cage rule.\u201d It provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o student is eligible to participate in an Association contest [including interscholastic athletic competitions] who has become nineteen (19) years old on or before midnight, August 31, of a given year.\u201d Montana High Sch. Ass\u2019n Official Handbook (1995-1996), ByLaws, Article II, Section (8), p. 19. The second is a by-law entitled \u201cIDEA/SECTION 504 AGE. RULE APPEALS\u201d (IDEA/\u00a7 504 appeals rule) which provides that a \u201cspecial education\u201d student may appeal an MHSA ineligibility decision made under the age rule. Under the IDEA/\u00a7 504 appeals rule, the appealing student has the burden of proof with regard to six enumerated requirements. <em>See </em>Montana High Sch. Ass\u2019n Official Handbook (1995-1996), By-Laws, Article VII, Subsection (B)(4), p. 31. .</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Here, M.H. repeated both kindergarten and the third grade due to difficulties in school. In November of 1985, during his second year in the third grade, M.H. was referred to special education and a Child Study Team (CST) determined that M.H. was \u201cLearning Disabled\u201d due to difficulties with reading and spelling. After completing his freshman year at Butte High School in 1993, M.H. was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">During his freshman through junior years at Butte High School, M.H. competed in both wrestling and football. As a result of repeating kindergarten and the third grade, he turned nineteen prior to beginning his senior year. In May of 1995, just before M.H. turned nineteen years of age, a CST determined that M.H. qualified as a \u00a7 504 student <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>due to difficulties in English resulting from his ADD. M.H. did not qualify as a disabled student under IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Joseph Masolo (Masolo), a \u00a7 504 coordinator for the Butte public schools, made written recommendations regarding M.H. in a one-page letter. Specifically, Masolo recommended that M.H. continue to participate in wrestling to insure \u201cacademic success for the 1995-96 school [year].\u201d Masolo later stated that his letter was an \u201cIEP\u201d developed pursuant to Montana guidelines for \u00a7 504 students. <em>See </em>Montana Office of Public Instruction, Section 504 Guidelines for Educators (1995) (OPI guidelines). Masolo correctly noted, however, that \u00a7 504, unlike IDEA, does not require the development of an IEP. He acknowledged that, while OPI guidelines recommend development of an \u201cIEP\u201d for \u00a7 504 students, such a \u00a7 504 \u201cIEP\u201d can be informal and even verbal. Moreover, Masolo recognized \u2014 and it is undisputed in this case \u2014 that the recommendations he developed for M.H. fall far short of the requirements for an IEP under IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On behalf of M.H., Daniel J. Peters (Peters), the principal of Butte High School, petitioned MHSA for waiver of the age rule to allow M.H. to participate in wresting and football during the 1995-1996 school year. MHSA held a telephone hearing on the petition, during which Peters explained that M.H.\u2019s parents requested that the age rule be waived due to M.H.\u2019s ADD. MHSA denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">M.H. appealed MHSA\u2019s decision pursuant to the IDEA/\u00a7 504 appeals rule. MHSA conducted a hearing and received evidence according to the procedure provided for such appeals. <em>See </em>Montana High Sch. Ass\u2019n Official Handbook (1995-1996), By-Laws, Article VII, Subsection (B)(3), p. 30. Thereafter, it denied M.H.\u2019s appeal on the basis that M.H. failed to prove, as required by Article VII, Subsection (B)(4), that: (1) he would not create a safety risk to other players; (2) he would not skew the overall competitiveness of the particular activities in which he would participate; and (3) his participation would not result in the exclusion of other eligible players.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">M.H., individually and by his parents, filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction against MHSA in November of 1995, based primarily on IDEA. MHSA opposed M.H.\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. It argued that M.H. had not been classified as a disabled student under IDEA, had not received any services under IDEA, had no IEP under IDEA and, therefore, was not entitled to the rights and protections afforded by IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The District Court held a hearing on M.H.\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. M.H. indicated at the beginning of the hearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>he had spoken with MHSA about his intent to amend his complaint. Although M.H. did not file an amended complaint, he stated that he would be asserting a claim based on \u00a7 504 and Article VII, Subsection (B)(4) of the MHSA by-laws; he further indicated that he would be deleting the cause of action based on IDEA. MHSA stated that it had no objection to such an amendment of the complaint. Accordingly, the record before us contains evidence and arguments primarily related to \u00a7 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The District Court concluded that M.H. had a federally protected right to participate in wrestling for the 1995-1996 school year and that MHSA\u2019s denial of M.H.\u2019s application for a waiver of the age rule was arbitrary and capricious and denied M.H.\u2019s due process rights. Thus, having implicitly concluded that M.H. likely would prevail on his underlying \u00a7 504 claim, the court further concluded that M.H. would suffer irreparable injury if MHSA enforced the age rule during the pendency of this case. Accordingly, the court granted M.H.\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined MHSAfrom enforcing the age rule against M.H. MHSA appeals. Additional facts are set forth below where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction against MHSA?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Section 27-19-201, MCA, which sets forth when a preliminary injunction may be granted, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">An injunction order may be granted in the following cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">An applicant for a preliminary injunction must either establish a prima facie case on the underlying claim or show that it is at least doubtful whether he or she will suffer irreparable injury before an adjudication on the merits. <em>Knudson v. McDunn </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 61, 65, 894 P.2d 295, 298 (citing <em>Porter v. K &amp; S Partnership </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 175, 181, 627 P.2d 836, 839).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Granting a preliminary injunction is within a district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not interfere unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown. <em>J.M., Jr. v. Montana High School Ass\u2019n </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 230, 235, 875 P.2d 1026, 1030 (citing <em>Frame v. Frame </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 439, 444, 740 P.2d 655, 659). Where, however, the granting of such an injunction is based on a conclusion of law, no discretion is involved and we review the district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1030 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>A. Applicability of T.H.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The District Court relied on <em>T.H. v. Montana High Sch. Ass\u2019n </em>(D. Mont., Sept. 24, 1992), CV-92-150-BLG-JFB, in concluding that M.H. had a federally protected right, by virtue of the \u201cIEP\u201d prepared by Masolo, to participate in wrestling during the 1995-1996 school year. <em>T.H. </em>is distinguishable and, indeed, we distinguished <em>T.H. </em>in <em>J.M. </em>prior to the District Court\u2019s decision in the case presently before us. <em>J.M. </em>is dispositive here with regard to whether, absent an IEP pursuant to IDEA, a learning disabled student has a federally protected right to participate in interscholastic sports.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>J.M. </em>involved a Butte Central High School student who repeated the eighth grade due to difficulties in school. As a result, J.M. became ineligible to participate in football and wrestling during his senior year due to MHSA\u2019s maximum participation eligibility requirements. <em>J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1028. Two MHSA rules were at issue: the first provided that a student who has attended a secondary school more than eight semesters was ineligible to participate in an Association Contest (eight semester rule); the second provided that \u201c[n]o student shall be eligible to participate in an Association Contest during more than four seasons in any one sport\u201d (four seasons rule). <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">MHSA determined that J.M. was ineligible to participate in wrestling and football for the 1993-1994 school year and J.M. appealed. MHSA held an eligibility hearing and subsequently denied J.M.\u2019s request to waive the four season rule for the fall semester, but approved his request for a waiver of the eight semester rule for the spring semester. The basis for MHSA\u2019s decision was that J.M. already had competed in four seasons of fall sports, such as football, but had only competed in three seasons of spring sports. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">J.M. sued MHSA, arguing that he had constitutional and statutory rights under IDEA to participate in fall semester sports. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>court issued a temporary restraining order against MHSA and, as a result, J.M. was permitted to participate in football dining the pendency of his case. Thereafter, MHSA moved to dissolve the restraining order and an evidentiary hearing was held. The district court preliminarily enjoined MHSA from enforcing its four seasons rule against J.M. and from imposing sanctions against Butte Central. Its order was based on IDEA and <em>T.H. J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We discussed <em>T.H. </em>at length in <em>J.M. See J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1030-32. <em>T.H. </em>involved a nineteen year old high school student who had an IEP pursuant to IDEA and who became ineligible to participate in interscholastic sports due to MHSA\u2019s age rule. <em>J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1030-31. T.H.\u2019s IEP expressly required continued participation in interscholastic sports as a motivational tool. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1031. T.H. sued in federal district court to enforce his rights under IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The federal district court recognized that, ordinarily, students do not have a constitutional right to participate in interscholastic sports; rather, it is a privilege which may be withdrawn. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1031. It determined, however, that an IDEA-qualified student\u2019s guaranteed right to a free and appropriate public education and related services includes participation in interscholastic sports where such participation is included as a component of the student\u2019s IEP. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1031. On that basis, the court concluded that T.H.\u2019s privilege to participate in interscholastic sports had been transformed into a federally protected right by virtue of his IEP under IDEA and, further, that MHSA denied T.H. due process of law in failing to conduct an appropriate inquiry before depriving T.H. of that right. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1031. Accordingly, the court preliminarily enjoined MHSA from enforcing its age rule against T.H. until an appropriate inquiry could be conducted. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1031. MHSA enacted the IDEA/\u00a7 504 appeals rule and the hearing standards therein in response to <em>T.H. See J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We distinguished <em>T.H. </em>from the situation before us in <em>J.M. </em>Unlike T.H., the student in <em>J.M.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">had a specialized educational program, [but] he was not participating in a formal, written IEP established under the statutory and administrative mechanism mandated by IDEA and its implementing regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\"><em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1032. Thus, the dispositive elements on which the <em>T.H. </em>court based its conclusion that a federally protected right existed \u2014 namely, that the student had a formal, written IEP under IDEA which required his participation in interscholastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sports \u2014 were not present in <em>J.M. J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1033. We held, therefore, that the district court improperly elevated J.M.\u2019s privilege of participating in interscholastic sports to a federally protected right under IDEA. <em>J.M., 875 </em>P.2d at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">T.H.\u2019s federally protected right to participate in interscholastic sports derived solely from the express requirements of his IDEA IEP. <em>J.M. </em>and the present case share the same dispositive fact which distinguish them from <em>T.H.: </em>in each case, the student did not have an IEP developed pursuant to IDEA which required his participation in interscholastic sports. Consequently, <em>J.M. </em>controls and renders erroneous the elevation of a privilege into a federally protected right, pursuant to an IDEA IEP, in this case. As was the case in <em>J.M., </em>the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>T.H. </em>under these facts was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>B. Section 504</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The District Court recognized that a \u201cdistinguishing feature\u201d of this case, when compared to <em>T.H., </em>is that M.H.\u2019s \u201cIEP\u201d was pursuant to \u00a7 504 while T.H.\u2019s was pursuant to IDEA. Based on its review of the OPI \u00a7 504 guidelines and a federal regulation, however, the court concluded that \u201cthis is a distinction without a difference.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The OPI guidelines provide guidance and set forth recommendations for educators in dealing with \u00a7 504 students. The appendix to the OPI guidelines includes the text of 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b), which defines what constitutes an \u201cappropriate education\u201d under \u00a7 504 and provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">(1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">(2) Implementation of an [IEP] developed in accordance with [IDEA] is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(l)(i) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">As is clear from its express language, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2) does not require the development of an IEP for \u00a7 504 students. Moreover, neither the foregoing regulation nor the OPI guidelines renders a student\u2019s rights under \u00a7 504 and IDEA equivalent. Indeed, they are incapable of doing so because the differences between a student\u2019s rights under \u00a7 504 and a student\u2019s rights under IDEA are statutory. We conclude, therefore, that the OPI guidelines and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>regulation relied on by the District Court do not support its determination that the differences between M.H.\u2019s one-page letter \u201cIEP\u201d under \u00a7 504 and T.H.\u2019s IDEA IEP is \u201ca distinction without a difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Moreover, recent cases from the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals clarify that \u00a7 504 is an anti-discrimination statute which does not confer any special rights on disabled persons beyond the right to be free from discrimination based solely on disability. <em>Pottgen v. Missouri State High Sch. Activities Ass\u2019n </em>(8th Cir. 1994), 40 F.3d 926, involved a Missouri high school student who had repeated two grades in elementary school due to a learning disability and turned nineteen before beginning his senior year of high school. Like MHSA, the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) has an age rule which prohibits a student who turns nineteen prior to a certain date from participating in interscholastic sports. As a result, Pottgen was ineligible to play baseball during his senior year of high school. <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 927-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Pottgen petitioned the MSHSAA for a \u201chardship\u201d waiver since he was held back in school due to learning disabilities. MSHSAA denied his petition and Pottgen sued in federal court based, in part, on \u00a7 504. <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 928. The district court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining MSHSAA from enforcing its age rule. <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In addressing MSHSAA\u2019s appeal, the Eighth Circuit recognized that \u00a7 504 prohibits discrimination against an \u201cotherwise qualified individual\u201d on the basis of his or her disability and set forth a two-part test for determining whether a student is an \u201cotherwise qualified individual.\u201d A court must determine both whether the individual meets all of the essential eligibility requirements and whether reasonable modifications exist. <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The Eighth Circuit concluded that MSHSAA had demonstrated that the age rule is an essential eligibility requirement because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abl\">[a]n age limit helps reduce the competitive advantage flowing to teams using older athletes; protects younger athletes from harm; discourages student athletes from delaying their education to gain athletic maturity; and prevents over-zealous coaches from engaging in repeated red-shirting to gain a competitive advantage. These purposes are of immense importance in any interscholastic sports program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"><em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 929. However, even though Pottgen could not meet this essential eligibility requirement, he would still be an \u201cotherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>qualified individual\u201d for \u00a7 504 anti-discrimination purposes if reasonable accommodations would enable him to meet the age limit. <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 929 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Eighth Circuit noted that, since Pottgen already had exceeded MSHSAA\u2019s age limit, the only possible accommodation would be to waive the age rule. It rejected Pottgen\u2019s contention that a waiver would be a reasonable accommodation, however, concluding that the waiver of an essential eligibility standard would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of the baseball program and that accommodations which require such a fundamental alteration are not reasonable. <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 930. Observing that \u201c[s] ection 504 was designed only to extend protection to those potentially able to meet the essential eligibility requirements of a program or activity,\u201d the Eighth Circuit held that Pottgen was not an \u201cotherwise qualified individual.\u201d <em>Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 930 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>Sandison v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n </em>(6th Cir. 1995), 64 F.3d 1026, the Sixth Circuit followed the <em>Pottgen </em>analysis of \u00a7 504\u2019s \u201cotherwise qualified individual\u201d language in a similar age rule case. <em>See Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1034-35. <em>Sandison </em>involved two Michigan high school students who were held back in school due to learning disabilities and became nineteen prior to beginning their senior year in high school. Under the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) age rule, students who become nineteen prior to a certain date are prohibited from participating in interscholastic sports. <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The students sued MHSAAin federal district court, based on \u00a7 504, and the court held that the students were \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d and discriminated against based on their disabilities. The federal district court preliminarily enjoined MHSAA from enforcing its age rule against the students. <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The Sixth Circuit relied on <em>Pottgen </em>and concluded, on the record before it, that the age rule is a necessary requirement of interscholastic sports programs and that waiver of the rule fundamentally alters such programs. <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1035. The court observed that a \u201csignificant peculiarity\u201d exists in attempting to characterize waiver of the age rule as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d of a student\u2019s learning disabilities. <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1035.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">Ordinarily, an accommodation of an individual\u2019s disability operates so that the <em>disability </em>is overcome and the disability no longer prevents the individual from participating. In this case, although playing high school sports undoubtedly helped the [students] pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>gress through high school, the <em>waiver </em>of the age restriction is not directed at helping them overcome learning disabilities; the waiver merely removes the age ceiling as an obstacle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Sixth Circuit also considered the \u201csolely by reason of ... disability\u201d language of \u00a7 504 in the context of MHSAA\u2019s age rule. <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1031-33. It noted that the age rule did not preclude the students from participating in interscholastic sports until they turned nineteen and, therefore, the rule was neutral with respect to disability. <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1032. Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the age rule does not exclude students \u201csolely by reason of\u2019 their disabilities; rather, it excludes students \u201c\u2018solely by reason of\u2019 age, not disability.\u201d <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Both <em>Pottgen </em>and <em>Sandison </em>involved appeals from preliminary injunctions enjoining enforcement of age eligibility requirements for interscholastic sports. In both cases, the Circuit Courts of Appeals held that the preliminary injunctions were improperly granted because the students had virtually no likelihood of success on the merits of their \u00a7 504 claims. <em>See Pottgen, </em>40 F.3d at 930-31; <em>Sandison, </em>64 F.3d at 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In the present case, the District Court implicitly concluded that M.H. likely would prevail on his underlying \u00a7 504 claim. The court then specifically granted the preliminary injunction on the basis that M.H. would suffer irreparable injury if it did not enjoin MHSAffom enforcing its age rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The two statutory bases for granting a preliminary injunction at issue here \u2014 namely, the \u201clikelihood of success on merits\u201d basis and the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d basis as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 27-19-201(1) and (2), MCA, respectively \u2014 are not unrelated. \u201cInjury\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny wrong or damage done to another, either in his person, rights, reputation, or property.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 924 (1968). Thus, the irreparable injury basis for granting preliminary injunctions is based on an implicit determination that the applicant is likely to succeed on his or her underlying claim and, as a result, would suffer a \u201cwrong or damage done to ... his person, rights, reputation, or property\u201d if some act were committed or allowed to continue during the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Similarly, we previously have indicated that a likelihood of success on the merits is not always sufficient, in and of itself, to warrant injunctive relief. <em>See Porter, </em>627 P.2d at 840. There must also be a showing that, absent a preliminary injunction, the applicant would suffer harm which could not be adequately remedied after a trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the merits and, therefore, a preliminary injunction is necessary to maintain the status quo and minimize harm to the parties. <em>See Porter, </em>627 P.2d at 839-40. In other words, the applicant also must make a showing of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In the present case, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that M.H. would suffer irreparable injury presupposes that enforcement of MHSA\u2019s age rule would constitute a wrong or damage to M.H.\u2019s right to participate in interscholastic sports. As is clear from <em>J.M. </em>and our discussion above, however, participation in interscholastic sports is a privilege, not a right, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here. <em>See J.M., </em>875 P.2d at 1031-32. Thus, the District Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that M.H. would likely succeed on the merits of his underlying \u00a7 504 claim was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We previously have indicated that an applicant for a preliminary injunction need not make a case that would entitle him or her to relief at a trial on the merits; an applicant must prove only a probable right and a probable danger that such right will be denied absent injunctive relief. <em>See Porter, </em>627 P.2d at 840; <em>Boyer v. Karagacin </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 26, 33, 582 P.2d 1173, 1177. Indeed, we consistently have held that district courts cannot issue preliminary injunctions absent the applicant establishing a prima facie case on the underlying claim or, based on the showing made, that it is at least doubtful whether or not the applicant will suffer irreparable injury before adjudication of his or her rights. See, <em>e.g., Porter, </em>627 P.2d at 839; <em>Boyer, </em>582 P.2d at 1177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Here, the District Court concluded that M.H. would suffer irreparable injury based on its erroneous conclusion that M.H. had a federally protected right to participate in interscholastic sports. We hold that the District Court erred in concluding that M.H. would suffer irreparable injury and, therefore, that the court manifestly abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction against enforcement of MHSA\u2019s age rule. We reverse, dissolve the injunction and remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b160-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, ERDMANN and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b160-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Amp\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">I agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that whether M.H.\u2019s independent education program was implemented pursuant to \u00a7 504 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Although not necessary to the implementation of \u00a7 504 services, an independent education program is one alternative method of complying with the requirements of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The following federal regulations illustrate the significance of an independent education program (IEP) in the context of \u00a7 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.1 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is designed to eliminate discrimination on the basis of handicap in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person\u2019s handicap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b) gives the following explanation of what is included in an \u201cappropriate public education\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">(1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 104.34, 104.35, and 104.36.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Although an individualized education program is not necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 504 requirement for \u201cappropriate public education,\u201d it is one acceptable method of complying with that requirement. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">Implementation of an individualized education program developed in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(l)(i) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">In other words, when an individualized education program is developed for \u00a7 504 students to satisfy the requirement that an appropriate public education is being provided by designing services necessary to meet an individual\u2019s educational needs, that IEP is developed to satisfy the secondary education program\u2019s federal obligation to that student. Therefore, an IEP developed pursuant to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>regulations is no less a federally-protected right than an IEP developed pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(18) of the IDEA. Logically, when participation in interscholastic sports is included as a component of an IEP developed for \u00a7 504 students, it is also a federally-protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Montana High School Association (MHSA) was a party to <em>T.H. v. Montana High School Association </em>(D. Mont. Sept. 24, 1992), CV 92-150-BLG-JFB. It did not appeal from the Federal District Court\u2019s adverse decision in that case, and is therefore, collaterally estopped from denying its applicability based on subsequent decisions by federal courts of appeal in other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the relevant part of the <em>T.H. </em>decision, Federal District Court Judge Battin held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(c) guarantees T.H. the right to a free and appropriate public education, \u201cprovided in conformity with [an] individualized education program ....\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(18); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.4. When participation in interscholastic sports is included as a component of an IEP as a \u201crelated service,\u201d <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(1), (17), the \u201cprivilege\u201d of competing in interscholastic sports is transformed into a federally protected right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">8. Because T.H. has a federally protected right, and not a mere privilege, to participate in interscholastic sports, due process required that the MHSA conduct meaningful, individualized inquiry into T.H.\u2019s request for a waiver from the age rule. ... By failing to conduct a case-specific factual inquiry into T.H.\u2019s request for a waiver, and by denying a waiver without a sufficient evidentiary basis for that decision, the MHSA has made a mockery of the waiver provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">10. In this context, due process requires that the MHSA conduct an individualized inquiry to determine whether any of the four stated concerns underlying the age rule are implicated and violated by T.H.\u2019s participation in interscholastic sports, before it may deny waiver of that rule. The mere fact that T.H. is over the stated age limit justifies initial application of the rule, but does not justify a refusal to waive the rule, where a federally protected right to participate is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">11.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar93\">First, the MHSA must conduct a hearing and determine whether T.H.\u2019s participation in interscholastic sports actually creates a safety risk to other players. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Next, the MHSA must determine whether T.H.\u2019s participation would skew the overall competitiveness of the particular interscholastic sports events. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">Likewise, the MHSA must specifically determine whether Plaintiff\u2019s participation would result in the exclusion of other eligible players, and other facts relevant to intra-team competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>T.H., </em>CV 92-150-BLG-JFB, slip op. at 9-12 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">It is clear from the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in this case that MHSA did not conduct the kind of hearing, nor make the kind of findings which would enable M.H., his family, or the District Court to understand the impact of his participation on the safety of other students, whether his participation would skew competitiveness in his events, or the effect of his participation on other athletes. Absolutely no findings were made in this regard by the MHSA. Instead, it simply shifted the burden to M.H. to prove that these consequences would not occur, and concluded he had not done so. More is required to dispense with the rights provided by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The MHSA has not contended on appeal that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous. Therefore, based on the law which is applicable to this case, the following findings by the District Court are dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">7. ... It was determined by the Child Study Team that M. H. Jr. should receive Section 504 services, because of the discrepancy between the ability of M. H. Jr. to perform well in math and his actual achievements in math. It was further determined that M. H. Jr.\u2019s \u201cI.E.P. will be written by Mr. Masolo (504)\u201d. An I.E.P. is an Individualized Education Program and Section 504 refers to Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. Section 794.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">9.... The Child Study Team determined that \u201c[M.H.] does much better in his school work when he is involved in wrestling. The Child Study Team strongly recommended that [M.H.] participate in wrestling for the 1995-96 school year.\u201d Accordingly, Mr. Masolo, acting pursuant to the directions of the Child Study Team, set forth the following accommodation in writing for M. H. Jr.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A31\">ACCOMMODATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">1. The 504 coordinator will monitor [M.H.] in his math class on a monthly basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>2. [M.H.] should be involved in wrestling to insure even great academic success for the 1995-96 school [year].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">10. The above special education program has been in place for M. H. Jr. since he began his senior year at Butte High School for the 1995-96 school year. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">23. The record before this Court does not convince it that the MHSA conducted such an individualized, factual inquiry. The only official form that was adopted by the MHSA seeking facts related to the above three concerns was a form that was to be used when an appeal of the age rule was requested. This form was Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 2B and it asks only for limited general information. No other directions are given to the student seeking the waiver or the student\u2019s representative as to the information that should be provided to the MHSA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">24. The minutes of the first meeting that was held with regard to the appeal (Pi\u2019s Exh. 6) set forth no facts relating to the three concerns underlying the age rule, other than reciting that a poll of the schools against whom M. H. Jr. might be competing in football and in wrestling revealed that seven schools opposed his participation in football and seven schools were in favor of it. With regard to wrestling, twenty-two schools did not object to him participating in wrestling, and eleven schools did object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">25. The minutes of the second hearing where the request for the waiver from the age rule was discussed (see Defendants\u2019 Exhibit A) are even briefer, stating only that the motion was denied after much discussion. There is nothing before the Court that would indicate what, if any, pertinent facts were discussed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">26. The letter from Dan L. Freund (Pi\u2019s Exh. 9) stating that the appeal was denied also sets forth no facts upon which the board\u2019s decision could be based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">27. In view of the extremely sparse documentary record relating to the deliberations of the MHSA, the Court finds that the testimony of Leo Wohler and Dan Freund was not credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The majority opinion constructs a substantive difference, where none exists, between those rights created by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In the process, the majority arbitrarily denies procedural safeguards to one class of handicapped students, while implicitly recognizing the need for procedural safeguards for a different class of handicapped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>students. Whether analyzed in terms of the law, or common sense, that distinction is indefensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The District Court\u2019s decision was comprehensive, well reasoned, and fully supported by the record in this case. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment, and for the reasons given, dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE HUNT join in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
