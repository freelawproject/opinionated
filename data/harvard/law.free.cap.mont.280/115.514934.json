After a trial, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court entered judgment for Connery and against the appellant, Liberty Northwest Insurance Corp., which insured her employer. Liberty appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision. We affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it interpreted \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">2. Was there substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Connery was an employee injured in the course and scope of her employment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">Connery was employed as a certified ski instructor by Winter Sports, Inc., at Big Mountain ski area near Whitefish.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">On December 10, 1995, Connery signed in at work at 8:45 a.m., and attended a ski instructor lineup at 9:15 a.m. At approximately 9:45 a.m., she was assigned to a private lesson scheduled to commence at 11:00 a.m. She was told that the lesson would take place on a hill which is served by the Platter Lift.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Connery and Mark Roy, another ski instructor, took the main lift to the top of Big Mountain. They skied down the backside, and took another lift back to the top. They then skied down the front of the mountain.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">When Connery was approximately 200 yards above the base of the Platter Lift, she stopped to wait for Roy. As Roy approached, he was unable to stop and collided with Connery. As a result of the collision, she suffered a severe fracture of her left leg. The collision occurred at approximately 10:35 a.m.-twenty-five minutes before the private lesson was scheduled to commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Connery filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in which she sought lost wages and medical benefits. Liberty acknowledged the claim, but denied it based on \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">(1) The term \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cworker\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">(2) The terms defined in subsection (1) do not include a person who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">(a) participating in recreational activity and who at the time is relieved of and is not performing prescribed duties, regardless of whether the person is using, by discount or otherwise, a pass, ticket, permit, device, or other emolument of employment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoe\">Connery subsequently filed a petition for hearing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Atrial was held in Kalispell on June 5, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">At the trial, Liberty contended that when the accident occurred Connery was engaged in a recreational activity, and that she was relieved of and not performing prescribed duties related to her employment. On that basis, it asserted that the recreational activity exclusion in \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, is applicable, and that, pursuant to the statutory exclusion, Connery\u2019s claim should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Connery, however, claimed that on the morning of December 10, 1995, she was engaged in a \u201cwarm-up run.\u201d A \u201cwarm-up run\u201d allows ski instructors to become familiar with the weather and ski conditions, and to condition and physically prepare themselves before they give ski lessons. It is undisputed that Winter Sports, Inc., encourages its ski instructors to take \u201cwarm-up runs\u201d before they give ski lessons.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Connery claimed that her \u201cwarm-up run\u201d was, in fact, a prescribed duty of her employment. On that basis, she contended that the exclusion in \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, is not applicable, and that her injury is work-related and compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>At the conclusion of the trial, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that: (1) at the time Connery was injured, she was engaged in a \u201cwarm-up run\u201d; (2) the recreational activity exclusion in \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, is not applicable to the facts of Connery\u2019s claim; (3) Connery suffered a compensable industrial accident during the course and scope of her employment; and therefore (4) she is entitled to wage loss and medical benefits pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of Connery.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it interpreted \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">When we review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law, the standard of review is whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Wunderlich v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 404, 410, 892 P.2d 563, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The relevant portion of \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">(1) The term \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cworker\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(2) The terms defined in subsection (1) do not include a person who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">(a) participating in recreational activity and who at the time is relieved of and is not performing prescribed duties, regardless of whether the person is using, by discount or otherwise, a pass, ticket, permit, device, or other emolument of employment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\">When it interpreted the statute, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court made the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">Section 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, plainly requires atwo-part analysis, first focusing on whether activity leading to the accident was a recreational one. If it was, then a second criteria must be met, that being to wit: at the time of the activity the injured individual must have been relieved of and not performing duties of [her] employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The court held that the first prong of \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, was satisfied, because Connery conceded that she was involved in a recreational activity at the time of her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">When it analyzed the second prong, the court applied a traditional course and scope of employment analysis to determine \u201cwhether a worker involved in a recreational activity was nonetheless perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ing prescribed duties of employment at the time of an accident.\u201d Ultimately, the court determined that the second prong was not satisfied. Therefore, it held that the statutory exclusion is not applicable to the facts of Connery\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">On appeal, Liberty contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it interpreted \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, and applied a traditional course and scope of employment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In support of its claim, Liberty asserts the following argument: (1) the plain and unambiguous meaning of \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, is that a person engaged in recreational activity, and not performing what she has been hired and paid to do (her \u201cprescribed duties\u201d) is excluded from the statutory definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d; (2) because the statute is plain and unambiguous on its face, it must be directly applied as written, and no farther analysis is required or permitted; and therefore (3) the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it failed to apply the plain meaning of the statute and, instead, applied a traditional course and scope of employment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Liberty correctly recognizes that when a statute is plain and unambiguous on its face, it must be applied as written, and \u201cthe courts may not go further and apply any other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Murer v. State Compensation Mutual Insurance Fund </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 516, 520, 885 P.2d 428, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Liberty then, however: (1) asserts its own interpretation of the statute; (2) claims that its interpretation constitutes the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statute; and (3) maintains that, pursuant to well-established principles of statutory construction, the court is obligated to apply that (alleged) plain and unambiguous meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We reject Liberty\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Instead, we hold that the \u201cprescribed duties\u201d prong of \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, can only be reasonably applied based on a traditional course and scope of employment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The purpose of \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, as revealed by its legislative history, is clear. Many employers, such as Winter Sports, Inc., offer seasonal passes to their employees as a form of compensation. Those seasonal passes are used by the employees for work-related and personal recreational activities. Section 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, shields employers from workers\u2019 compensation liability when an employee is injured while he or she is off-duty and engaged in purely personal recreational activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Despite the statute\u2019s clear purpose, the term \u201cprescribed duties\u201d is, itself, not defined, and cannot be arbitrarily limited by a definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>such as the one Liberty proposes. Any attempt at a uniform definition of an employee\u2019s \u201cprescribed duties\u201d will, inevitably, fail to account for all of the potential fact patterns that could arise. The definition of an employee\u2019s \u201cprescribed duties\u201d is fact-intensive, and will vary considerably from case to case. Therefore, the application of a traditional course and scope of employment analysis is, and will be, necessary to determine exactly what an employee\u2019s \u201cprescribed duties\u201d are in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct, and that it did not err when it held that \u00a7 39-71-118.(2)(a), MCA, requires a traditional course and scope of employment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Was there substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Connery was an employee injured in the course and scope of her employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact will be upheld if they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Wunderlich, </em>270 Mont, at 408, 892 P.2d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that, at the time of the accident, Connery was engaged in a \u201cwarm-up run.\u201d Although she was, indisputably, involved in a recreational activity, the court also found that her \u201cwarm-up run\u201d was a prescribed duty of her employment. On that basis, the court determined that the exclusion in \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, is not applicable, that the injury occurred during the course and scope of her employment, and that, therefore, the injury is a compensable industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">On appeal, Liberty contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial credible evidence. Specifically, it asserts that the court erred when it found that Connery\u2019s \u201cwarm-up run\u201d was a prescribed duty of her employment; rather, it maintains that she was recreationally skiing on her own free time and not performing a prescribed duty of employment. Therefore, it claims that the exclusion in \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, applies, and that her claim must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">At the outset, we recognize that giving ski lessons was not Connery\u2019s only employment duty. Both she and Mark Roy testified that she was also expected or required to provide noon hour child care; report to work between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m.; sign up for work upon arrival, and sign-out upon departure; attend an employee lineup at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>9:15 a.m.; attend ski clinics each month; arrive at the lesson site fifteen minutes early; and frequently check the office and message boards to determine if any \u201cwalk-in\u201d lessons had been scheduled. Additionally, her employee manual recommended that all ski instructors take \u201cwarm-up runs\u201d before they give a lesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Most significant, however, is the application of the facts of Connery\u2019s claim to the legal principles of a traditional course and scope of employment analysis. In Montana, the test to determine whether an employee was injured in the course and scope of her employment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">Controlling factors repeatedly relied upon to determine a work-related injury include: (1) whether the activity was undertaken at the employer\u2019s request; (2) whether employer, either directly or indirectly, compelled employee\u2019s attendance at the activity; (3) whether the employer controlled or participated in the activity; and (4) whether both employer and employee mutually benefitted from the activity. The presence or absence of each factor, may or may not be determinative and the significance of each factor must be considered in the totality of all attendant circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE-\"><em>Courser v. Darby School Dist. No. 1 </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 13, 16-17, 692 P.2d 417, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that, pursuant to the facts of this case and the application of those facts to the four-factor test in <em>Courser, </em>Connery\u2019s \u201cwarm-up run\u201d was within the course and scope of her employment, and that, therefore, it was a prescribed duty of her employment. In support of this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">A warm-up run was recommended by her employer, thus the first <em>Courser </em>factor is met. It is also reasonable to assume that both the employer and [Connery] benefitted from a warm-up run in that [Connery] unlimbered her muscles and joints and generally familiarized herself with snow conditions. The fact that the employer recommended a warm-up run indicated its belief that such runs directly or indirectly contributed to ski lessons. Thus, the fourth <em>Courser </em>factor is met. By requiring instructors to sign-in and attend lineup, and assigning lessons at odd times, such as occurred in this case, the employer also indirectly contributed to claimant\u2019s warm-up run on December 10. There was insufficient time for her to leave the ski area or engage in other substantial activities, whereas she was dressed and ready for skiing and had sufficient time to make a warm-up run. Thus, the second [Courser] factor appears to be met, although weakly. The third [Courser] factor ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>is not met. Nonetheless, on balance [Connery\u2019s] warm-up run was within the course and scope of [Connery\u2019s] employment and part of her duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Additionally, the court found that Connery\u2019s \u201cwarm-up run\u201d \u201cterminated in the immediate vicinity of her lesson and terminated shortly before the lesson was to begin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence. Those findings are consistent with the testimony of both Connery and her co-worker, Mark Roy. Accordingly, we hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err when it determined that, based on the facts in this case, Connery was injured in the course and scope of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AU6\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
