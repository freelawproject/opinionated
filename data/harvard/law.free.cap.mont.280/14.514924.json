We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">On November 3, 1995, Jean Wentz (Jean), plaintiff in the underlying action, filed her complaint in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, alleging that on April 15, 1992, Gerald Wentz (Gerald) suffered a heart attack while on the job performing a welding test for North American Energy Services on the premises of Montana Power Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">According to Jean\u2019s complaint, Gerald was initially transported to the Colstrip Clinic (the Clinic) for treatment. She alleges that he was then transferred from the Clinic back into the Rosebud County EMS ambulance for transportation to Rosebud County Hospital in Forsyth for treatment that was unavailable at the Clinic. That trip was aborted, however, because of Gerald\u2019s deteriorating condition, and he was returned to the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Jean states that St. Vincent Hospital and Health Center in Billings, Yellowstone County, Montana (St. Vincent) was then contacted, and that its HELP helicopter was dispatched to the Clinic. Gerald was treated by the St. Vincent\u2019s flight team, but was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival at St. Vincent. Jean alleges that negligent medical treatment by the Clinic and defendants Rosebud County, William C. Anderson, M.D. (Dr. Anderson) and Carol Lands, P.A. (Lands) reduced Gerald\u2019s chances for survival and caused his death on April 15,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Jean\u2019s complaint, filed in one count, claims damages of the type recoverable in a survivorship cause of action under \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA, and in a wrongful death action under \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Dr. Anderson and Lands are residents of Rosebud County; the Clinic is located in Rosebud County; and Rosebud County operated the EMS ambulance that transported Gerald to, from and then back to the Clinic. Those defendants filed motions requesting that venue be changed to Rosebud County arguing that Yellowstone County was not a proper place for the trial of Jean\u2019s suit. The District Court ruled that Jean had filed her complaint in a proper county and denied defendants\u2019 motions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">While each of the appellants and Jean frame the questions to be resolved in this appeal somewhat differently, the basic issue is whether the District Court erred in denying the requested change of venue on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Whether a county is a proper place for trial is a question of law involving the application of the venue statutes to pleaded facts. <em>State v. Pegasus Gold Corp. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 32, 35, 889 P.2d 1197, 1199 (citing <em>Minervino v. University of Montana </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 493, 497, 853 P.2d 1242, 1245). Thus, our review of the trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for change of venue is plenary; we simply determine whether the court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>Pegasus, </em>889 P.2d at 1199 (citing <em>Carter v. Nye </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 226, 228, 879 P.2d 729, 730). See also <em>Gabriel v. School Dist. No. 4, Libby </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 177, 179, 870 P.2d 1351, 1352; <em>Emery v. Federated Foods, Inc. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 83, 87, 863 P.2d 426, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In the instant case, noting that \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA, requires that survivorship and wrongful death actions be combined in one legal action, the District Corut relied primarily on our decision in <em>Gabriel </em>in rejecting appellants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Dr. Anderson and, by adopting his arguments, Rosebud County, the Clinic and Lands, contend that <em>Gabriel </em>is not dispositive of the issue in this case. They base their arguments primarily on their interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-122 and 25-2-126, MCA. Section 25-2-122, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Torts. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the proper place of trial for a tort action is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">(a) the county in which the defendants, or any of them, reside at the commencement of the action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">(b) the county where the tort was committed. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Section 25-2-126, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">(2) The proper place of trial for an action against a county is that county unless such action is brought by a county, in which case any county not a party thereto is also a proper place of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">(3) The proper place of trial for an action against a political subdivision is in the county in which the claim arose or in any county where the political subdivision is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVq\">Before addressing those arguments, however, it is necessary that we discuss our decision in <em>Gabriel. </em>In <em>Gabriel, </em>decedent was injured and his survivorship action arose in Lincoln County when he fell from a roof while working on a construction project for a school district. His resulting death, however, occurred in Flathead County where he was taken for medical treatment. Plaintiff sued the school district in Flathead County premising venue on \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, (a suit against a political subdivision is proper in the county where the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>arose or where the political subdivision is located). <em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We agreed. We relied on <em>Carroll v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 485,830 P.2d 1253, in concluding that since death is the critical and final element in the accrual of a wrongful death action, a wrongful death claim arises for venue purposes where the death occurs. <em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1352. Moreover, we determined that because \u00a7 27-1-501(2), MCA, requires that survivorship and wrongful death actions be combined in one legal action and that because, as to this combined action, venue would properly lie either where the survivor-ship claim or the wrongful death claim arose, plaintiff\u2019s choice of a proper venue as to the wrongful death action \u2014 the county where death occurred \u2014 precluded a successful motion for change of venue to the county where the survivorship action arose. <em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1353 (citing <em>Petersen v. Tucker </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 393,396, 742 P.2d 483, 484-85). See also \u00a7 25-2-115, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Notwithstanding, on appeal, Dr. Anderson attempts to distinguish <em>Gabriel </em>in arguing that our decision in that case should not be followed. He contends <em>Gabriel </em>is of limited precedential value because that case involved a school district (a political subdivision) and a venue determination under \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, which pertains to political subdivisions. Dr. Anderson maintains, that, to the contrary, no named defendant in the instant case is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d (we will address this contention later in this opinion). Rather, he contends (and Rosebud County agrees) that the place of trial in this case is controlled by \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, which provides specifically that in an action brought against a county \u2014 here Rosebud County\u2014 venue lies in that county. Moreover, Dr. Anderson contends that, except for Rosebud County, all of the other defendants are \u201cprivate citizens\u201d and, therefore, come under the general venue statute dealing with torts, \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, instead of \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, dealing with political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In this regard, and while his argument is somewhat difficult to follow, it appears to be Dr. Anderson\u2019s position that since the school district in <em>Gabriel </em>was a \u201cpolitical subdivision,\u201d \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, by its language, specifically provided for venue where the claim \u201carose.\u201d However, since none of the defendants are \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d then the County is entitled to be sued in Rosebud County under \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, and all defendants are entitled to be sued in Rosebud County where the tortious acts were \u201ccommitted\u201d under \u00a7 25-2-122(l)(b), MCA. Relying on <em>Howard v. Dooner Laboratories, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Inc. </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 312, 688 P.2d 279, Dr. Anderson contends that a tort is \u201ccommitted\u201d (as opposed to when it \u201carises\u201d) where all negligent acts take place. Thus, reasons Dr. Anderson, since all the alleged negligent acts of which Jean complains took place in Rosebud County, the tort of wrongful death was \u201ccommitted\u201d there. According to Dr. Anderson, determining when the wrongful death action accrues does not address itself to the legal issue of where that tort is \u201ccommitted\u201d for purposes of analyzing a case in which the general tort venue statute applies as opposed to a venue statute that speaks in terms of where the claim \u201carises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">We are not persuaded by Dr. Anderson\u2019s argument. In fact, we rejected a similar argument in Gabriel, wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">Nor is the School District\u2019s reliance on <em>Howard v. Dooner Laboratories, Inc. </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 312, 688 P.2d 279, well placed. <em>Howard </em>involved application of the general tort statute providing for venue in the county where the tort \u201cwas committed\u201d to a situation involving medical malpractice. Addressing the word \u201ccommitted,\u201d we determined that the tort occurred where the medical negligence took place. <em>Howard, </em>688 P.2d at 282. <em>Howard </em>did not address either a post <em>-Carroll </em>wrongful death claim or the specific language contained in \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">While \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, and \u00a7 25-2-122(l)(b), MCA, are not consistent in the language used, the point is that the statutory cause of action for the tort of wrongful death cannot come into existence until death occurs. <em>Carroll, </em>830 P.2d at 1254-55. Thus, it necessarily follows that the tort of wrongful death cannot \u201carise,\u201d \u201caccrue\u201d or be \u201ccommitted\u201d until the critical and defining element of this claim\u2014 death \u2014 occurs. <em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1352. The location where death occurs is determinative for venue purposes of where the tort of wrongful death \u201carises,\u201d \u201caccrues\u201d or is \u201ccommitted.\u201d In this case, it is undisputed that Gerald died in Yellowstone Comity. Accordingly, it is equally clear that the tort of wrongful death for which Jean has filed suit arose, accrued arid was committed in that County.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Likewise, we find no merit in Dr. Anderson\u2019s and the County\u2019s argument that \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA, rather than \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, applies to Rosebud County. Without question, these two subparagraphs of the statute are contradictory. However, we addressed this problem over a decade ago and resolved this issue in <em>Spencer v. Flathead County </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 399, 687 P.2d 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In <em>Spencer </em>the plaintiff filed an action against Flathead County and the State in Lincoln County alleging wrongful arrest and invasion of privacy in Lincoln County on a Flathead County warrant. The defendants moved to change venue to Flathead County on the basis that \u00a7 25-2-106, MCA, controlled the venue of actions brought by nongovernmental entities against counties and established venue exclusively where the county being sued is located. <em>Spencer, </em>687 P.2d at 1391. Section 25-2-106, MCA, was adopted in 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">We noted, however, that \u00a7 2-9-312(2), MCA, adopted in 1973, established venue in actions brought by nongovernmental entities against counties in either the county where the cause of action arose or where the county being sued is located. <em>Citing Hutchinson v. Moran </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 330, 673 P.2d 818, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">[T]he authority of a private entity to sue a county now exists solely by virtue of 1972 Mont. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 18, and the venue of such actions is determined by the more recently enacted section 2-9-312(2), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">Counties are specifically included within the definition of a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d by section 2-9-101(5), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">In suits brought by private entities against counties, the new venue statute, section 2-9-312(2), MCA, supersedes the venue provision contained in section 25-2-106, MCA, and exclusively determines the venue of such actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\"><em>Spencer, </em>687 P.2d at 1391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">In 1985, the Code Commissioner renumbered and combined various venue statutes. Section 2-9-312, MCA, became \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, and subparagraphs (1) and (2), of the former \u00a7 2-9-312, MCA, became subparagraphs (1) and (3) of \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA, respectively. Unfortunately, \u00a7 25-2-106, MCA, became \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA. Thus, while it appears from the present arrangement of \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-126(2) and (3), MCA, that the legislature intended to treat counties as something other than what they are expressly defined to be under \u00a7 2-9-101(5), MCA \u2014 i.e., political subdivisions \u2014 such a conclusion is erroneous and derives solely from legislative oversight in failing to repeal \u00a7 25-2-106, MCA, (now \u00a7 25-2-126(2), MCA) when \u00a7 2-9-312, MCA, (now \u00a7 25-2-126, MCA) was enacted and the Code Commissioner\u2019s combining and renumbering the statutes. Section 25-2-126(2), MCA, was and remains superseded by \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA. <em>Spencer, </em>687 P.2d at 1391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Dr. Anderson\u2019s and Rosebud County\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit; Rosebud County is a political subdivision and is subject to the venue provisions of \u00a7 25-2-126(3), MCA, in the same manner that the school district was in <em>Gabriel. </em>Rosebud County may be sued in Yellowstone County since Jean\u2019s claim of wrongful death against Rosebud County arose in Yellowstone County, where Gerald died.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Finally, the Clinic and Lands argue that even though \u00a7 27-1-501(2), MCA, requires that wrongful death and survivorship claims be combined for purposes of suit, each cause of action remains unique with a separate existence and with distinct attributes. See, <em>Swanson v. Champion Intern. Corp. </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 509, 646 P.2d 1166. Consequently, according to the Clinic and Lands, \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, requires that the court ascertain whether plaintiff selected a proper venue as to both her claims, and if the county selected is proper as to one, but not both, any defendant is entitled to a change of venue which is proper for both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Section 25-2-116, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">Multiple claims. In an action involving two or more claims for which this part designates more than one as a proper place of trial, a party entitled to a change of place of trial on any claim is entitled to a change of place of trial on the entire action, subject to the power of the court to separate claims or issues for trial under Rule 42(b) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">While the Clinic and Lands concede that venue for Jean\u2019s wrongful death claim may appropriately lie in Yellowstone County, they argue that Yellowstone County is not a proper place for the trial of Gerald\u2019s estate\u2019s survivorship claim since the alleged negligent acts complained of all took place in Rosebud County. The Clinic and Lands conclude that since Jean selected an improper venue as to the survivorship claim, she waived the right to choose the place of trial leaving it to any defendant to select venue from among proper counties. Moreover, since the survivorship claim requires a change of venue, \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, allows venue to be changed to Rosebud County for the wrongful death claim as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Section 25-2-116, MCA, was enacted in 1985.1985 Mont. Laws 432. The Evidence Commission\u2019s recommendation for the adoption of this section of the Montana Code states that it is a codification of this Court\u2019s holdings involving venue changes in multiple claim cases. According to the Evidence Commission,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">The Court feels the rule is necessary to prevent a plaintiff from controlling venue by adding spurious claims that have little or no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>validity, but are triable in the forum the plaintiff chooses rather than at the normal situs which would be the defendant\u2019s residence or another location more favorable to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Without determining the sorts of cases to which \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, might apply, we conclude that since \u00a7 27-1-501(2), MCA, specifically mandates that wrongful death and survivorship actions be combined in one legal action, there is little likelihood that one such claim or the other would be added spuriously by the plaintiff simply to defeat a venue favorable to the defendant. The evil which \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, seeks to address simply is not present in these sorts of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Furthermore, our decision in <em>Gabriel </em>addressed and rejected essentially this same argument. In that case we agreed that Gabriel could have sued the school district for wrongful death and survivor-ship in either Lincoln County or Flathead County, as both were proper places for trial. <em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">However, also recognizing that under \u00a7 27-1-501(2), MCA, wrongful death and survivorship actions must be combined in one legal action, we rejected the same argument that the Clinic and Lands present here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">Nor does the School District\u2019s argument that venue for the survivorship claim is in Lincoln County \u2014 where the alleged tortious conduct was committed and the claim arose \u2014 advance its cause. It is well-established that venue may be appropriate in more than one place and that, in such an event, filing in <em>a </em>proper venue precludes a successful change of venue motion. <em>Petersen, </em>742 P.2d at 484.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\"><em>Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Given that the nature of the evil sought to be addressed by \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, is not present here; given that \u00a7 27-1-501(2), MCA, mandates that the plaintiff file a wrongful death and survivorship action in one combined legal action; and given our decision in <em>Gabriel, </em>that a proper venue for such a combined action can be determined on the basis of either the survivorship action or the wrongful death action if a proper venue for each cause of action is different, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to apply \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Venue for Jean\u2019s wrongful death action is properly in Yellowstone County because that is where Gerald died and where the cause of action, thus, arose. That her wrongful death action combined with the survivorship action could have also been brought in Rosebud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>County because the survivorship action arose there does not render Yellowstone County an improper place for trial for both.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">If... more than one county [is designated] as a proper place of trial for any action, an action brought in any such county is brought in a proper comity and no motion may be granted to change the place of trial upon the ground that the action is not brought in a proper county under 25-2-201(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Section 25-2-115, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We hold that the District Court properly denied appellants\u2019 motions for change of venue. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b47-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"A0o\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">I concur in the result reached by the Court because I agree that our decision in <em>Gabriel v. School Dist. No. 4, Libby </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 177, 870 P.2d 1351, is controlling. However, having paid deference to <em>stare decisis, </em>I must note that I fail to follow the logic of <em>Gabriel. </em>I agree with Justice Weber\u2019s dissent in <em>Gabriel </em>in which he reasons that if you have two causes of action, one in which venue is appropriate in county A and the other in which venue is appropriate in counties A or B, the logical venue is the county which is appropriate for both causes of action, i.e., county A. <em>See Gabriel, </em>870 P.2d at 1354 (Weber, J. dissenting). In the present case, Rosebud County would be proper venue for both the wrongful death action and the survivorship while Yellowstone Comity is appropriate only for the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Section 25-2-116, MCA, clearly provides that when an action involves two or more claims, and when the law designates more than one place as a proper place of trial, \u201ca party entitled to a change of place of trial on any claim is entitled to a change of place of trial on the entire action <em>...\u201d </em>Since defendants would be entitled to change of venue on the survivorship claim standing alone, they are entitled to a change of venue on both claims. The Court however, relying on the Evidence Commission\u2019s recommendation, reasons that \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, only has application when a plaintiff has added a spurious claim in order to control venue. Since the law requires that a wrongful death claim and a survivorship claim be combined in one suit, the Court concludes that \u201c[t]he evil which \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, seeks to address simply is not present in these sorts of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The intent behind \u00a7 25-2-116, MCA, may have been aimed at the \u201cevil\u201d of spurious claims. However, that intent was not incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>into the statute. The plain wording of the statute clearly applies to any suit involving \u201ctwo or more claims.\u201d It does not say \u201ctwo or more claims, one of which is spurious.\u201d If the intent of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, the Court may not go further and apply other means of construction. <em>Wunderlich v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 404, 410, 892 P.2d 563, 567. Given that the wording of the statute is clear and not subject to differing interpretations, there is no call to resort to legislative history. In my view, the statute clearly requires a change of venue to Rosebud County. That interpretation, however, was rejected in the <em>Gabriel </em>decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
