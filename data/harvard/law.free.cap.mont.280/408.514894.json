Following a hearing, the District Court granted Defendant Crago\u2019s motion for summary judgment. From this judgment, Plaintiff Basta appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it concluded that Basta and Crago did not enter into a written contract of employment for a specific term for the purposes of \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Defendant Crago, Inc. (Crago) operates a locally-owned general printing business known as the Printing Center located in Great Falls, Montana. Craig Barber (Barber) is the president, chief executive officer and the only shareholder of the business. Therefore, Barber is Crago\u2019s agent. Plaintiff Martin \u2018Doc\u201d Basta (Basta) worked at a different local printing shop in Great Falls from 1971 until Barber hired him to work as shop foreman at the Printing Center in March 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">In December 1991, Barber contacted Basta about hiring him to work for the Printing Center. Over the next two months, Barber sent Basta two letters and a memorandum concerning their employment negotiations. The memorandum, dated January 23,1992, referred to \u201cTerms of employment\u201d and was signed by Barber. The memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>set forth several items including medical insurance coverage, vacation time, a salary and bonus figure for the first year of employment, a salary and undetermined bonus system for the second year of employment, and a description of the employment position and responsibilities. Barber sent the memorandum to Basta with a letter explaining that the memorandum was a \u201cwritten copy of what we had talked about previously\u201d and requesting that Basta contact Barber so that they could discuss Basta\u2019s starting date. On March 1, 1992, Basta began working at the Printing Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Barber had hired Basta to perform the shop foreman duties that Barber had performed previously. Barber planned for Basta to take over Barber\u2019s old duties so that Barber could attend to matters concerning expansion of the business. However, Barber\u2019s plans were not realized and the economic conditions of the business declined. In response to this economic decline, Barber determined that the payroll must be reduced. Consequently, he discharged Basta on February 26, 1993, and one other employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On February 23, 1994, Basta filed his complaint, alleging that he had been wrongfully discharged without good cause pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-904(2), MCA (1991). Crago answered and denied the allegations of Basta\u2019s complaint. Crago then moved for summary judgment, alleging that Basta\u2019s discharge was for good cause. To support the motion, Crago submitted an affidavit indicating that Basta was terminated from employment due to financial stresses within the corporation, a legitimate business reason. The District Court initially denied Crago\u2019s summary judgment motion. However, Crago filed a motion for reconsideration. Initially, Basta opposed Crago\u2019s motion for reconsideration. However, Basta ultimately conceded that Crago\u2019s motion should be granted and requested leave to file an amended complaint. On September 6, 1995, the District Court granted both Crago\u2019s motion for reconsideration and Basta\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Basta\u2019s amended complaint set forth two claims: 1) breach of contract and 2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Crago answered and denied the allegations. Thereafter, Crago filed a Motion for Summary Judgment Concerning the Amended Complaint. Crago alleged that the parties never entered into a written contract for a specific term, and, therefore, Basta\u2019s claims were barred by Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, \u00a7 39-2-901, et seq., MCA (1991). After reviewing the briefs and considering the testimony of Basta and the arguments of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>at the hearing on the motion, the District Court granted Crago\u2019s motion for summary judgment on December 12,1995. It is from this judgment that Basta appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Our standard of review for an appeal from an order granting summary judgment is <em>de novo. Motarte v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We review the order granting summary judgment using the same evaluation as did the district court, based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Motarte, </em>907 P.2d at 156. Our inquiry is set out as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261,264-65,900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In the case before us, Basta has not raised an issue concerning any genuine issues of material fact. Instead, Basta only raises the legal issue whether Basta and Crago entered into a written contract of employment for a specific term. Accordingly, we review the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (the Act) bars Basta\u2019s breach of contract and breach of covenant claims under \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991), because the parties did not enter into a written contract of employment for a specific term as required by \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), to determine if the court was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Did the District Court err when it concluded that Basta and Crago did not enter into a written contract of employment for a specific term for the purposes of \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991)?</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Basta contends that he and Barber entered into a written contract of employment for a specific term, and, therefore, the Act does not bar his claims for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Crago responds that Barber and Basta did not enter into a written contract of employment for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>specific term, and, therefore, the Act does bar Basta\u2019s claims. We conclude that the District Court correctly determined that the parties did not enter into a written contract of employment for a specific term, and that the court properly granted Crago\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The Act provides that \u201cno claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.\u201d Section 39-2-913, MCA (1991). We have determined that the plain meaning of \u201cclaim for discharge\u201d is simply \u201cthose claims for damages caused by an asserted wrongful discharge.\u201d <em>Beasley v. Semitool, Inc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 258, 261, 853 P.2d 84, 86. Therefore, not all tort or contract claims are barred by \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991), merely because they arise from employment. <em>Beasley, </em>853 P.2d at 86. Rather, only those tort or contract claims which are \u201cfor discharge\u201d will be barred by \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991). <em>Beasley, </em>853 P.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In the present case, Basta bases both his breach of contract and breach of covenant claims on his discharge. First, Basta alleges that Crago violated the contract with Basta \u201cby virtue of terminating [Basta] on February 26, 1993. ...\u201d Second, Basta alleges that Crago violated its obligation to act in good faith with Basta \u201cin that termination was false and dishonest in fact.\u201d By virtue of this language contained in Basta\u2019s amended complaint, we conclude that both claims are \u201ccompletely and inextricably intertwined with and based upon\u201d Basta\u2019s discharge. See <em>Beasley, </em>853 P.2d at 87. Consequently, Basta\u2019s claims are \u201cclaims for discharge\u201d and will be barred under \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991), unless one of the exemptions to the Act applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The exemptions to the Act are set forth as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">39-2-912. Exemptions. This part does not apply to a discharge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">(1) that is subject to any other state or federal statute that provides a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute. Such statutes include those that prohibit discharge for filing complaints, charges, or claims with administrative bodies or that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, national origin, sex, age, handicap, creed, religion, political belief, color, marital status, and other similar grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">(2) <em>of an employee covered by </em>a written collective bargaining agreement or <em>a written contract of employment for a specific term. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The issue raised on appeal is whether the parties entered into a written contract of employment for a specific term. If they did, Basta\u2019s claims are exempted from the Act pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), and will not be barred under \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991). If not, Basta\u2019s \u201cclaims for discharge\u201d are preempted by the Act pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991), and will be barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In order for the exemption under \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), at issue here, to apply, there must be (a) a written contract <em>and </em>(b) this contract must be for a specified term. Under the plain language of the statute, if either the contract is not in writing or it is not for a specified term, then the exemption does not apply, and Basta\u2019s claims will be barred. Without so deciding, we will simply assume for purposes of this appeal that Crago\u2019s memorandum to Basta was a written contract and that Basta\u2019s employment was therefore governed by a written contract. We make this assumption because our determination that, regardless, the contract was not for a specified term, is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">At best, the memorandum simply states Basta\u2019s proposed salary for the first two years of his employment. In fact, nothing in the memorandum sets out a specific term, whether for two years or more. The memorandum not only fails to specify a termination date; it does not even designate a hiring date. Indeed, at the time Basta received the memorandum, the parties were still negotiating Basta\u2019s starting date. This is evidenced by the letter Barber sent with the memorandum wherein Barber asked Basta to call him to discuss Basta\u2019s starting date.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Moreover, Basta\u2019s testimony at the summary judgment hearing held on November 6, 1995, shows that he was unclear as to what the parties had actually agreed would be the \u201cspecific term\u201d of Basta\u2019s employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">Q: [Mr. Lynch, Basta\u2019s attorney] Now, does that agreement [referring to the memorandum] \u2014 it\u2014what are the terms of that agreement? Without reading it, I mean, you know, how long was your employment with him to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">A: [Basta] When we first talked about this and came out with this, he said I would be with him for at least five years. ... And he told it in front of me and my wife, hell, I would be there for five years. He had no plans of me going anywhere, that he was going to keep me employed. So, then he came up with this \u201cI\u2019ll start you at this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>and after a year I\u2019ll start you at this figure, and if my business progresses, you\u2019ll progress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">Q: And let me ask you this. That agreement doesn\u2019t say anything\u2014 how many years does that agreement cover?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">A: Two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">Q: Okay. Was there \u2014 when you got that agreement, was there any discussion about the five years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">A: Yes, there was. Like I say, he said it\u2019s good for five years. Or longer. He just said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you go.\u201d I just took the man for his word. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to get a written contract or anything else. He says, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this for you the first year and second year. And you\u2019re going to be with me.\u201d I trusted him.. And I thought, you know, this is a good way for me to go. It\u2019s what I like to do is to get shops going. So I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, okay, you\u2019ve got to write up a five-year agreement or a two-year agreement\u201d or anything. What he wrote down here I took to be a good agreement, that he would face up to it as a man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">Q: But what did you understand that agreement to be, as far as how long? That written agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">A: Two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">Q: And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">A: Because that\u2019s all he did. He told me if \u2014 because it has down the first year I\u2019ll get so much and the second year I\u2019ll get so much. And he signed it. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d have to have it notarized or anything else. Or that I\u2019d have to sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">Q: Did he say in the cover letter or that agreement that if there was any disagreement with it on your part, that you would work it out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">A: Yes. That\u2019s what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">Q: And did you disagree with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-15\">A: No, I did not. I accepted what he had written down here and gave to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-16\">Q: And did you feel that that was your agreement, what was written down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-17\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-18\">After reviewing Basta\u2019s testimony, it is apparent that while Basta regarded the memorandum as covering the first two years of his employment, he anticipated that his employment with Crago would last for \u201cat least five years.\u201d However, nothing in the evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ports the conclusion that the parties agreed to either a two-year or a five-year employment term. Rather, the evidence supports the conclusion that the parties failed to agree to any specific term of employment at all; there was simply no meeting of the minds on the term of Basta\u2019s employment \u2014 whether it was two years, five years or longer. Therefore, based on the uncertain nature of both Basta\u2019s testimony and the memorandum, we conclude that the parties did not enter into a contract of employment \u201cfor a specific term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Basta also alleges that Crago violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and Basta seeks damages for emotional distress. As we stated above, Basta\u2019s claims are not exempted from the Act under \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), because the parties did not enter into a written contract of employment for a specific term. Therefore, \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA(1991), controls and Basta\u2019s tort claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith is barred. Furthermore, under the Act, Basta cannot seek damages for emotional distress. Section 39-2-905(3), MCA (1991). See also <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 238, 819 P.2d 186, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In sum, we conclude that Basta and Crago did not enter into a written contract of employment \u201cfor a specific term.\u201d Therefore, Basta\u2019s contract and covenant claims are not exempted from the Act pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991). Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Basta\u2019s breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are barred by the Act pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b439-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ATU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">I conclude that the parties did enter into a written contract of employment for a specific term within the meaning of \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), and therefore, dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Martin \u201cDoc\u201d Basta worked for Advanced Litho Printing Shop in Great Falls for twenty-one years until he was induced to leave that employment with a written promise from Craig Barber, owner and operator of the Printing Center, that he would be employed on more favorable terms at that business for at least two years. However, less than one year after he began work for Barber, he was told that the Printing Center could not afford him and his employment was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Section 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), provides that the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act found at \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-901 to -915, MCA, does not preclude a person covered by a written contract of employment for a specific term from enforcing the terms of the employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Section 28-2-102, MCA, sets forth the necessary elements of a contract. It provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">It is essential to the existence of a contract that there be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">(1) identifiable parties capable of contracting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">(2) their consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">(3) a lawful object; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">(4) a sufficient cause or consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The document which was submitted to Basta after being prepared and signed by Craig Barber, and which is relied on by Basta as a \u201cwritten contract of employment for a specific term\u201d provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">January 23, 1992</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmF\">TO: Doc Basta</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANG\">FROM: Craig Barber</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0c\">RE: Terms of employment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">INSURANCE, The Printing Center will pay medical insurance for you and your wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">VACATION &amp; DAYS OFF 3 weeks paid vacation plus 5 days off as needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">1ST YEAR $35,000 a year salary plus a bonus not to exceed $1,000 if predetermined goals are met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-15\">2ND YEAR $36,000 a year salary with a bonus system, (to be determined)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-16\">POSITION &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES Position: Working Foreman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfA\">Camera</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbH\">Shooting</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4VB\">Stripping</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsA\">Training</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-17\">Route &amp; schedule jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-18\">Quality control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-19\">Employee supervision and training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-20\">Involvement in customer relations as needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Assisting with the transition from conventional camera work to computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">Other duties as need arises</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">I hope that you .find this agreeable and as we had discussed. Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">/s/ Craig Barber</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azg\">Craig Barber</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The document obviously included identification of the parties, the consent of Craig Barber, a lawful object, and sufficient consideration. There is no question presented regarding the capacity of either party to contract; Barber simply contends, and the District Court agreed, that because Basta had not signed the agreement, his consent had not been provided, and therefore, the agreement was incomplete. The District Court gave the following rationale for its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">The Court found quite credible the Plaintiff\u2019s testimony, that he left a good job in reliance upon the Defendant\u2019s offer of employment for a term of at least two years, but that offer had to be finalized into a \u201cwritten contract of employment for a specific term,\u201d if it is to take the Plaintiff\u2019s case outside the parameters of the Wrongful Discharge Act. Testimony presented by the Plaintiff established that the Plaintiff accepted the Defendant\u2019s offer by leaving his prior employment and beginning work with the Defendant, but his acceptance was not in writing as presented to the Court, but an acceptance based on performance. Unless both the offer and acceptance is finalized in the form of written contract, it does not appear to be exempted from the requirements of the Wrongful Discharge Act. Section 39-2-912, MCA (1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">I disagree. When Basta actually went to work for Barber and fully performed, according to the terms of the contract, from March 1, 1992, until he was terminated on February 26,1993, he accepted the terms proposed by Barber by performing his responsibilities set forth in the contract. Section 28-2-503, MCA, provides for acceptance in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">(1) Performance of the conditions of a proposal or the acceptance of the consideration offered with a proposal is an acceptance of the proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">(2) A voluntary acceptance of the benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations arising from it, so far as the facts are known or ought to be known to the person accepting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Based on Basta\u2019s acceptance by performance of the contract terms proposed by Barber, I conclude that there was a completed contract of employment for a specific term and that all essential terms of the contract were in writing. I would conclude that, when the employer has set forth the conditions of employment in a written document which includes the term of employment and is signed by the employer, the requirements of \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA (1991), have been satisfied. The purpose, after all, of that section\u2019s requirement that there be a written contract is to protect the employer by limiting his employee\u2019s remedies to the provisions of the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, unless it can be documented that the employer offered him or her something greater than the Act\u2019s protections. Here, there is no question about the terms of employment which were offered by the employer. Therefore, the requirements of \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA (1991), have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">However, based on Basta\u2019s testimony to the effect that he felt Barber had committed to a term greater than two years during their conversations, the majority concludes that the contract in question does not provide for a specific term. I disagree again.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The written contract, which is set forth in this opinion, provides for a first year and a second year. It provides for the salary to be paid dining each year, and a bonus to be determined at a later date. Based on the plain language in the contract, it provided for a minimum term of two years employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">At most, the term of employment in defendant\u2019s proposed written contract is unartfully drawn and leaves some question about whether the term was to extend beyond two years. However, as we have repeatedly held, the author of a written agreement should not be able to avoid liability for performance of that agreement based on ambiguities which are his or her own creation.
