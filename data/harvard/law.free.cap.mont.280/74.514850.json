We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Bank based on its conclusion that the nonjudicial foreclosure sale under the Small Tract Financing Act of Montana was properly conducted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Bank based on its conclusion that Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate the trust property after the nonjudicial foreclosure sale under the Small Tract Financing Act of Montana?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The following facts are undisputed. On July 28, 1979, Stuart executed a trust indenture covering residential property (trust property) in Blaine County, Montana. The trust indenture, which conveyed the trust property to a trustee and named the Bank as beneficiary, secured Stuart\u2019s obligation to the Bank in the principal amount of $80,000. The trust indenture was modified in 1991 and rerecorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Stuart subsequently defaulted on his obligation to the Bank and a successor trustee (trustee) began nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings on the trust property under the Small Tract Financing Act of Montana (STFA). The trustee notified Stuart and his counsel of the foreclosure proceedings and the date of the foreclosure sale. At the time of the sale, Stuart owed the Bank $97,051.63 in principal and interest; he also owed delinquent taxes on the trust property in excess of $15,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">The Bank was the only bidder at the foreclosure sale held in April of 1995. It made a $69,900 \u201ccredit bid,\u201d which the trustee accepted over Stuart\u2019s objection. The trustee then executed and recorded a trustee\u2019s deed conveying the trust property to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Stuart remained in possession of the trust property during the foreclosure proceedings. The Bank did not send him a notice to vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the trust property after the foreclosure sale, and he continues to refuse to relinquish possession of the trust property to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On May 18,1995, the Bank filed its complaint for possession of the trust property pursuant to \u00a7 71-1-319, MCA, and for attorney fees and costs incurred in the action for possession. In answering the Bank\u2019s complaint, Stuart argued that the foreclosure sale was invalid because it was not a cash sale as required by law; the Bank did not follow statutory procedures to obtain possession of the trust property after the foreclosure sale; and the Bank was not entitled to attorney fees in the action for possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The Bank moved for summary judgment, contending that its so-called \u201ccredit bid,\u201d under which it applied the amount bid against the outstanding debt owed by Stuart, complied with the statutory requirements for a nonjudicial STFA foreclosure sale and that Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate after the sale. Stuart filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. He did not dispute that the Bank applied the bid amount against his outstanding debt; he claimed, instead, that the foreclosure sale was improperly conducted because the Bank did not pay the trustee in cash. Alternatively, Stuart argued that the Bank\u2019s complaint for possession was premature because \u00a7 70-27-104, MCA, entitled him to post-sale notice to vacate and the Bank did not give such notice; therefore, according to Stuart, the Bank\u2019s complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The District Court granted the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the parties\u2019 stipulated facts and briefs. In addition to its conclusions that the foreclosure sale was properly conducted and Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate thereafter, the court determined that the Bank was entitled to reasonable costs and attorney fees and assistance from the Blaine County Sheriff (Sheriff) in obtaining possession. The Bank subsequently filed its memorandum of costs as directed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Stuart moved to alter or amend the summary judgment order and for a stay of execution pending the District Court\u2019s decision on that motion. The District Court entered a judgment of possession in favor of the Bank and subsequently granted Stuart\u2019s motion for stay of execution. Later, the court denied Stuart\u2019s motion to alter or amend and lifted the stay, and the Bank filed its affidavit of attorney fees incurred in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In response to a motion for clarification filed on behalf of the Sheriff, the District Court amended its judgment of possession by deleting the order of assistance until the Bank made a demand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>possession and Stuart had an opportunity to respond. Stuart subsequently refused to relinquish possession to the Bank and the Bank applied for a writ of assistance. Stuart appealed before the District Court could rule on the Bank\u2019s application for a writ of assistance or hold a hearing to determine the amount of attorney fees to which the Bank is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R, criteria used by that court. <em>Jarrett v. Valley Park, Inc. </em>(1996), [277 Mont. 333], 922 R2d 485, 487 (citation omitted). Ordinarily, such a review requires that we first determine whether the moving party met its burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Jarrett, </em>922 R2d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In this case, however, the parties agreed on the material facts and, via their cross-motions for summary judgment, each party asserted entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The District Court having granted the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we need only determine whether it was correct in concluding that the nonjudicial foreclosure sale was properly conducted and that Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Bank based on its conclusion that the nonjudicial foreclosure sale under the STFA was properly conducted?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Nonjudicial STFA foreclosure sale procedures and requirements are governed by statute in Montana. The STFA provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he purchaser at the [foreclosure] sale shall pay the price bid in cash ....\u201d Section 71-1-315(4), MCA. The Bank maintains that the STFA permitted it, as the trust indenture beneficiary, to pay the price bid by applying the amount of its bid to Stuart\u2019s outstanding indebtedness. Stuart, on the other hand, contends that the foreclosure sale was not properly conducted because the Bank did not pay cash for the trust property as required by the STFA. He contends that the plain language of the statute requires that foreclosure sales be conducted only on cash bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>We have not previously interpreted the phrase \u201cshall pay the price bid in cash\u201d contained in \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA. In interpreting a statute, we look first to the plain meaning of the words it contains. <em>Werre v. David </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 376, 385, 913 P.2d 625, 631 (citing <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088); <em>Gulbrandson v. Carey </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 494, 500, 901 P.2d 573, 577. Where the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation. <em>Werre, </em>913 P.2d at 631 (citing <em>Clarke, 897 </em>P.2d at 1088). In this regard, words used by the legislature must be given their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Werre, </em>913 P.2d at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The proper interpretation of the word \u201ccash,\u201d undefined by the legislature in enacting the STFA, is determinative of whether the nonjudicial foreclosure sale at issue here complied with \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA, and we previously have determined the ordinary meaning of that word. In <em>Sidwell v. The New Mine Sapphire Syndicate </em>(1956), 130 Mont. 189,196, 297 P.2d 299, 302, we discussed the definition of \u201ccash\u201d in the context of an agreement for the sale of mining claims. Under the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff had agreed to deposit a sum of money in cash to the defendant\u2019s credit at a local bank immediately upon ratification of the agreement by the defendant\u2019s stockholders. <em>Sidwell, </em>297 P.2d at 299-300. The plaintiff deposited a substantial sum of money, but not the entire amount required, to the defendant\u2019s credit at the bank after the agreement was ratified and then sued for specific performance. <em>Sidwell, </em>297 P.2d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In addressing whether the plaintiff\u2019s deposit of less than the stipulated amount of cash constituted compliance with the agreement, we discussed the concepts of cash and credit. \u201c With reference to the terms or time of payment, \u201ccash\u201d has been defined as meaning immediate payment; money paid down; money or its equivalent paid immediately or promptly after purchasing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sidwell, </em>297 P.2d at 302 (quoting 14 C.J.S. <em>Cash, </em>p. 16) (citations omitted). Courts generally define cash as the antonym of credit. <em>Sidwell, </em>297 P.2d at 302 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Applying this ordinary meaning of the word, \u201ccash\u201d \u2014 as used in \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA \u2014 means money or its equivalent paid immediately or promptly after the purchase. Placed in the context of the statutory phrase \u201cshall pay the price bid in cash,\u201d paying the price bid in money or its equivalent immediately or promptly after the foreclosure sale satisfies the requirement set forth in \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Here, the Bank was the trust indenture beneficiary. It bid $69,900 on the trust property at the foreclosure sale and, after acceptance of its bid by the trustee, credited the bid amount to the outstanding indebtedness owed to it by Stuart. Application of the bid amount to Stuart\u2019s outstanding indebtedness is the equivalent of a money payment of the bid amount because it reduced the amount of Stuart\u2019s outstanding indebtedness to the Bank in precisely the same way that a payment in cash to the trustee \u2014 followed by the trustee turning over that amount of cash to the Bank for application to Stuart\u2019s indebtedness \u2014 would reduce the amount Stuart owed the Bank. We conclude, therefore, that an accepted \u201ccredit bid\u201d by the trust indenture beneficiary at a nonjudicial STFA foreclosure sale, defined as the prompt application of the bid amount to the trust indenture grantor\u2019s outstanding debt, constitutes payment by the purchaser of the price bid in cash as required by \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Stuart contends that the Bank\u2019s purchase of the trust property was a credit sale prohibited by \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA. He relies on the definition of a credit sale, contained in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 333 (5th ed. 1979), as a \u201csale in which the buyer is permitted to pay for the goods at a later time, as contrasted with a cash sale.\u201d The definition, while valid, is not applicable to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Here, the Bank was not permitted to pay \u201cat a later time\u201d as would be the case if the bid were in the form of a note or other instrument pursuant to which either a lump sum payment or payment by installments over time would be made in the future. Rather, as discussed above, the Bank\u2019s application of the bid amount to Stuart\u2019s outstanding debt constituted payment of the price bid in cash as required by \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA. In the context of the definition advanced by Stuart, the foreclosure sale at issue here was, indeed, a cash sale rather than a credit sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Nor is Stuart\u2019s reliance on <em>Greenberg v. Alter Company </em>(Iowa 1963), 124 N.W.2d 438, to any avail. While Stuart correctly cites to <em>Greenberg </em>for the proposition that a cash sale and a credit sale are \u201ccompletely opposite creatures\u201d (see <em>Greenberg, </em>124 N.W.2d at 441), <em>Greenberg </em>merely exemplifies our observation in <em>Sidwell </em>that courts generally define cash as the antonym of credit. <em>See Sidwell, </em>297 P.2d at 302. Moreover, <em>Greenberg </em>addressed whether cash includes cashier\u2019s checks, certified checks or the placement of a bid amount in an escrow account. <em>Greenberg, </em>124 N.W.2d at 441. Nothing in <em>Greenberg </em>supports Stuart\u2019s argument that the foreclosure sale before us was a credit sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>As a final matter, we observe that the District Court determined that the Bank was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of a different legal conclusion than we have reached above. The court concluded that to interpret \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA, as requiring a trust indenture beneficiary to actually pay cash to the trustee\u2014 who, in turn, would return the cash to the beneficiary for application to the borrower\u2019s indebtedness \u2014 would be to require an idle act, which the law never requires. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-3-223, MCA. While the \u201cidle acts\u201d maxim of jurisprudence has been statutorily enacted in Montana, we note that such maxims are intended \u201cnot to qualify any of the other provisions of [the MCA] but to aid in their just application.\u201d Section 1-3-101, MCA. Under our interpretation of the plain meaning of \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA, above, it is unnecessary to determine whether \u2014 or to what extent \u2014 the \u201cidle acts\u201d maxim of jurisprudence might otherwise aid in the just application of \u00a7 71-1-315(4), MCA. In any event, we will affirm a district court\u2019s decision which reaches the correct result regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Bowen v. McDonald </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 193, 915 P.2d 201, 206 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Bank based on its conclusion that the nonjudicial foreclosure sale under the STFA was properly conducted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Bank based on its conclusion that Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate the trust property after the nonjudicial foreclosure sale under the STFA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Section 71-1-319, MCA, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">The purchaser at the trustee\u2019s sale shall be entitled to possession of the property on the 10th day following the sale, and any persons remaining in possession after that date under any interest, except one prior to the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be tenants at will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The Bank contends that, pursuant to \u00a7 71-1-319, MCA, it was entitled to possession of the trust property ten days after the STFAnonjudicial foreclosure sale without giving Stuart notice to vacate the trust property. Stuart maintains that his interest in the trust property did not arise prior to his execution of the trust indenture and, therefore, he became a tenant at will by remaining in possession past the tenth day after the sale. Accordingly, he argues that \u00a7 70-27-104, MCA, requires the Bank to provide him with a thirty-day notice to vacate the trust property prior to terminating the tenancy and obtaining possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The parties\u2019 stipulated facts do not provide a sufficiently clear basis for determining whether Stuart had an interest in the trust property prior to executing the trust indenture. Thus, we cannot resolve the specific question of whether Stuart became a tenant at will under \u00a7 71-1-319, MCA. We need not do so, however, in order to determine whether he was entitled to notice to vacate the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">In this case, Stuart executed a trust indenture covering the trust property with the Bank as beneficiary. Except where statutes governing real property mortgages are inconsistent with the laws governing trust indentures, a trust indenture is deemed to be a mortgage on real property and is subject to the laws governing real property mortgages. <em>See </em>\u00a7 71-1-305, MCA. Therefore, a trust indenture, like a mortgage, is a contract \u2014 an agreement between two or more parties to do, or not to do, something \u2014 by which property is pledged, without delivery of title or possession, for the performance of an act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 71-1-101, MCA; \u00a7 28-2-101, MCA; <em>Weldon v. Montana Bank </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 88, 93, 885 P.2d 511, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">By executing the contractual trust indenture in July of 1979, Stuart obligated himself to perform according to its terms. One of those terms, expressly set out in Paragraph 15 of the trust indenture, is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">Grantor agrees to surrender possession of the hereinabove described trust property to the purchaser at the aforesaid sale on the tenth (10th) day following said sale, in the event such possession has not previously been delivered by Grantor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Stuart was the grantor named in the trust indenture; the Bank was the purchaser at the foreclosure sale. Pursuant to Paragraph 15, therefore, Stuart specifically contracted to surrender possession of the trust property to the Bank on the tenth day after the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Notwithstanding Paragraph 15, Stuart contends that the Bank was statutorily required to provide a thirty-day notice to him to vacate the trust property. He relies on \u00a7 70-27-104, MCA, which requires landlords to give tenants at least one month written notice before terminating a tenancy at will. Section 70-27-104, MCA, clearly was enacted in order to protect a tenant against termination of the tenancy without adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Even assuming arguendo the validity of Stuart\u2019s claim that he is a tenant at will, he is not entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 70-27-104, MCA. Section 1-3-204, MCA, provides that \u201c[a]nyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.\u201d By executing the trust indenture and agreeing, via paragraph 15, to vacate the trust prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>erty on the tenth day following the foreclosure sale, Stuart waived any benefit under \u00a7 70-27-104, MCA, to which he might otherwise have been entitled. We conclude, therefore, that Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate under \u00a7 70-27-104, MCA. On that basis, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Bank based on its conclusion that Stuart was not entitled to notice to vacate the trust property after the STFA nonjudicial foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Finally, the Bank raises several matters which do not relate to the issues raised by Stuart in his appeal. First, the Bank contends that it is entitled to a writ from this Court directing the Sheriff to assist it in obtaining possession of the trust property. The record reflects, however, that the Bank\u2019s application for a writ of assistance is still pending before the District Court. Moreover, the cases cited by the Bank .in support of its request involve our review of trial court decisions relating to writs of possession,. <em>See Fuller v. Gibbs </em>(1948), 122 Mont. 177, 199 R2d 851; <em>Dodd v. Simon </em>(1942), 113 Mont. 536, 129 P.2d 224. They are not authority for the issuance of a writ of assistance by this Court. For these reasons, we reject the Bank\u2019s request that this Court issue a writ of assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Bank also contends that it is entitled to attorney fees incurred in its efforts to gain possession of the property. Its reason for raising this matter is unclear since the record reflects that the District Court already has determined that the Bank is entitled to reasonable attorney fees incurred in its action for possession. Indeed, the Bank has responded to the court\u2019s directive to submit a memorandum of costs and affidavit of attorney fees. Stuart\u2019s notice of appeal merely short-circuited the District Court\u2019s ability to hold a hearing on the amount of attorney fees to be awarded. Stuart did not, however, appeal the Bank\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees and, therefore, the District Court\u2019s determination of that issue will become final when remittitur issues on this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, LEAPHART and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
