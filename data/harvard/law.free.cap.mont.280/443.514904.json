The District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, granted Carolyn\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and entered judgment in her favor. State Farm appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">The sole issue we address on appeal is whether the \u201cEach Person\u201d or the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limits of liability set out and contained in the State Farm policy apply to Carolyn\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">On August 9, 1992, Carolyn and her husband, Fredie, were riding their bicycles on Old Highway 200 about two miles east of East Missoula when Fredie was struck from behind by an automobile driven by Ruth Hintz (Hintz). Carolyn was riding some distance behind Fredie and was not injured. Carolyn saw Hintz\u2019s car strike Fredie and throw him into the air. She also saw the severe head wound Fredie received when his head hit the vehicle\u2019s windshield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>before he fell to the pavement. Fredie subsequently died from the injuries he sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Hintz was insured by an automobile policy issued by State Farm that provided in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Limits of Liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">The amounts of bodily injury liability coverage is [sic] shown on the declarations page under \u201cLimits of Liability \u2014 coverage A\u2014 Bodily Injury, Each Person, Each Accident.\u201d Under \u201cEach Person\u201d is the amount of coverage for all damages due to bodily injury to one person. \u201cBodily injury to one person\u201d includes all injury and damages to others resulting from this bodily injury. Under \u201cEach Accident\u201d is the total amount of coverage, subject to the amount shown under \u201cEach Person,\u201d for all damages due to bodily injury to two or more persons in the same accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The policy limited bodily-injury liability coverage to $25,000 for each person and $50,000 for each accident. State Farm paid Fredie\u2019s estate $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">On February 10, 1995, Carolyn brought this action against State Farm and Hintz claiming that she is entitled to an additional $25,000 under the policy for her emotional distress. In the Agreed Statement of Facts, filed April 25,1995, the parties agreed that Carolyn met all of the elements necessary for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress as set forth in the case of <em>Versland v. Caron Transport </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 313, 671 P.2d 583. The parties further agreed that the only issue to be determined by this action is \u201cwhether the \u2018each person\u2019 or \u2018each accident\u2019 limits of liability set out and contained in the policy ... applies to [Carolyn\u2019s] claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Carolyn filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 23, 1995, contending that, as a matter of law, her claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is an independent, non-derivative cause of action separate from Fredie\u2019s claim and thus covered under the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limits of liability contained in the policy. State Farm filed a Motion for Summary Judgment the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">After hearing oral argument, the District Court granted Carolyn\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, denied State Farm\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and entered judgment in Carolyn\u2019s favor. State Farm appeals the District Court\u2019s order and judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Discussion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">Whether the \u201cEach Person\u201d or the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limits of liability set out and contained in the State Farm policy apply to Carolyn\u2019s claim for negligent inflictipn of emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In its Opinion, Order and Declaratory Judgment, the District Court determined that Carolyn\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress arose \u201cout of the traumatic personal impact upon her own emotional and physical well-being by actually and immediately experiencing the accident which killed her husband directly in front of her.\u201d The court concluded that Carolyn was a second injured party in the accident, thus it granted Carolyn\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and declared that under the policy, Carolyn was entitled to an additional $25,000 for emotional distress damages separate and apart from the $25,000 limitation on Fredie\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Motarle v. N. Mont. Joint Refuse Disposal </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156 (citing <em>Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P.2d.782, 785). When we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we apply the same evaluation as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. In <em>Bruner, </em>we set forth the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\"><em>Bruner, </em>900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted). The parties in the case before us stipulated in their Agreed Statement of Facts that the only remaining issue in this case involves the interpretation of the State Farm policy. We have previously stated that the interpretation of an insurance contract involves a question of law. <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 354, 356, 849 P.2d 190, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The parties in this- case stipulated that Carolyn met all of the elements for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress as set out in <em>Versland v. Caron Transport </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 313,671 P.2d 583. However, subsequent to the parties\u2019 stipulation, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>decided <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, wherein we re-defined and clarified the elements of the torts of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The plaintiff in <em>Sacco </em>had been employed at the High Country Independent Press newspaper in Belgrade as a photographer/reporter. After she left the newspaper\u2019s employ, officers of High Country Independent Press, Inc. (HCIP), the corporation that owned the newspaper, made allegations to the Belgrade Police that the plaintiff had stolen proof sheets and photographs from the newspaper\u2019s offices. Criminal charges were brought against the plaintiff but were eventually dismissed. The plaintiff brought an action against HCIP and a Belgrade police officer for civil rights violation, malicious prosecution, defamation and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We held in <em>Sacco </em>that an independent cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress will arise under circumstances where serious or severe emotional distress to the plaintiff was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligent act or omission. <em>Sacco, </em>896 P.2d at 426. We also concluded that \u201cserious or severe emotional distress\u201d should be defined by employing the definition of these terms found in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">[Emotional distress] includes all highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry and nausea. It is only where it is extreme that the liability arises. Complete emotional tranquility is seldom attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living among people. The law intervenes only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure it. The intensity and the duration of the distress are factors to be considered in determining its severity. Severe distress must be proved. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\"><em>Sacco, </em>896 P.2d at 426 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46, comment j at 77-78).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In granting Carolyn\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the District Court relied on our decision in <em>Sacco. </em>State Farm contends that this was error because although Carolyn witnessed the accident, she did not sustain any bodily injury, thus she was a \u201cbystander\u201d victim as defined in <em>Versland. </em>State Farm maintains that since the policy provides bodily-injury liability coverage for damages the insured is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>legally liable to pay because of bodily injury to one person in an accident, including all injury and damages to others as a result of that bodily injury, Carolyn is subject to the $25,000 per person limit applicable to Fredie\u2019s claim because Carolyn\u2019s emotional distress resulted from Fredie\u2019s injury. State Farm also argues that Carolyn\u2019s claim should be treated the same as a claim for loss of consortium and that our prior decision in <em>Bain v. Gleason </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 442, 726 P.2d 1153, is controlling in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We disagree; neither <em>Versland </em>nor <em>Bain </em>is controlling under the facts here given our decision in <em>Sacco. </em>In <em>Sacco </em>it was our intention to simplify and clarify the elements of claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, not to further complicate this body of law by adding yet another theory to those already in existence. See <em>Sacco, </em>896 P.2d at 429. In view of State Farm\u2019s arguments and in light of <em>Sacco </em>it is appropriate that we discuss <em>Versland </em>and <em>Bain, </em>however. We had previously said in <em>Versland </em>that to recover on a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff must show (1) that the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon the plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous perception of the accident, (2) that the plaintiff and the victim were closely related, and (3) that the victim suffered either death or serious physical injury as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Versland, </em>671 P.2d at 588. Thus the plaintiff had to be a bystander and actually witness the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">However, in clarifying the elements of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress in <em>Sacco, </em>we eliminated the other various sorts of theories by which independent torts of negligent infliction of emotional distress came into Montana law such as the <em>Versland </em>bystander analysis. <em>Sacco, </em>896 P.2d at 429. Under the <em>Versland </em>analysis, a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action hinges upon the death or serious bodily injury of the accident victim. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is derivative. Under the <em>Sacco </em>analysis, a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action requires a showing of severe or serious emotional distress to the-plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is independent and non-derivative. Furthermore, even prior to <em>Sacco, </em>Montana law recognized that where recovery is for emotional distress absent physical injury, such a claim is allowed as an independent cause of action. See <em>Johnson v. Supersave Markets, Inc. </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 465,473,686 P.2d 209,213.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">State Farm\u2019s reliance on <em>Bain </em>is also misplaced. <em>Bain </em>involved a claim for loss of consortium. The plaintiff in <em>Bain </em>brought an action to recover for the injuries his wife sustained in an automobile acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>dent. In <em>Bain, </em>we said that the \u201cEach Person\u201d limitation refers to all damages imposed by law by whomever suffered resulting from one bodily injury and one accident and that the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limitation only applies when two or more persons suffer bodily injury in the same accident. <em>Bain, </em>726 P.2d at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Unlike Carolyn, the plaintiff in <em>Bain </em>was not at the scene of the accident and did not witness the injuries to his spouse. As the District Court pointed out in the case before us \u201c[i]t is this personal, on the scene, direct physical and emotional impact which distinguishes emotional distress claims under <em>Sacco </em>from loss of consortium claims. ...\u201d Carolyn was a separate person who received an independent and direct injury at the accident scene. Her serious and severe emotional distress was th\u00e9 reasonably foreseeable consequence of Hintz\u2019s negligence. <em>Sacco, </em>896 P.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">State Farm further argues that emotional distress is not a bodily injury, therefore Carolyn cannot be considered a second party injured under the policy. We note that while the State Farm policy does not define bodily injury, per se, it does allow recovery for various injuries including loss of consortium which is not a physical injury. Moreover, State Farm is willing to provide coverage for emotional injuries resulting from the decedent\u2019s physical injury, but only subject to the one person limitation. Under the circumstances, State Farm is estopped from arguing that there is no coverage for emotional or mental injuries. Clearly, State Farm is willing to provide coverage for those types of injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Accordingly, we hold that Carolyn was a second injured person in the accident, thus the \u201cEach Accident\u201d limits in the policy apply, and we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES ERDMANN , HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
