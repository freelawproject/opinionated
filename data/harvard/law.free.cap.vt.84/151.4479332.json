Her counsel then produced three books, and asked if they were the books showing the entries to which she had testified, and she identified them as such. Counsel then offered the books in evidence \u201cin connection with her testimony.\u201d Objection being made that they were not proper books of account, counsel added, \u201cThey are offered as memoranda \u2014original memoranda in the books such as they are.\u201d It was then objected further that they did not purport to be memoranda of any transactions with the defendant, and that they were not used by the witness as memoranda to refresh her recollection in testifying. Upon this the court inquired of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cThen why do you need the books?\u201d and counsel replied, \u201cBecause they are evidence;\u201d if she keeps the entries \u201cit is evidence of their understanding as to the agreement; it is original evidence for that purpose, and with reference to her testimony.\u201d The court thereupon received the books, and in taking, an exception defendant\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI understand they are offered as evidence in chief.\u201d To this plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no reply. Upon this statement, we think it must be considered that the books were offered and received as independent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The first exhibit is contained in a diary, on pages having the printed heading \u201ccash account.\u201d The other exhibits are in blank memorandum books. In all of them the amounts are entered in columns under the headings \u201creceived\u201d and \u201cpaid.\u201d The entries are not in the ordinary form of book account entries. The items are without the usual signs of debit and credit. There is nothing to connect the defendant with the transactions represented. For anything that appears the several items may represent transactions with as many different persons. Considered as anything more than a cash account, the entries are meaningless until explained by the testimony of the person who made them. They must be regarded as mere private memoranda, available in aid of the recollection and as confirmatory of the testimony given, but not entitled to use as direct evidence against the party sought to be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The defendant moved for the direction of a verdict on the ground that there was no evidence tending to show either an express promise or a mutual expectation of payment. The mother of the parties died about 1895, and the father in 1901. Both the parties had always lived with their parents, except that the plaintiff had worked out some when a girl. After the father\u2019s death the defendant bought the shares of the other heirs, and continued to live on the farm, the plaintiff living with him as his housekeeper and doing all the housework. The plaintiff had filled this place in the family since the mother\u2019s death, and had received from her father as wages a specific sum each year, and had in addition the money received from the neighborhood sales of eggs, milk, butter and the like. She remained with her brother until her marriage in 1907, and during this time received from him various sums of money, and had the avails of the sales above mentioned. She had no other income.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The plaintiff testified that soon after the defendant got his deeds she had a talk with him about staying there, in which she told him that she could not afford to stay there for nothing \u2014that she must have some pay, and that he replied that he could not afford to pay her \u2014 that if he paid her he could not run the farm, and would have to sell it or give it away; that on another occasion she asked him for some money and he did not give her as much as she thought she ought to have, and that she told him she did not think she- was having much for her services, and that he said perhaps he could give her more later but that he was a little short then. Defendant testified that the payments he made to the plaintiff were presents, and were made because she was there doing the work; and when inquired of as to what brought up the second conversation, said'she thought he wasn\u2019t giving her pay enough \u2014 that she was not getting enough. Plaintiff testified that she did not talk with her brother when she left about the balance due her, and that this was because her brother was angry with her for getting married and leaving and had threatened to take measures to prevent the marriage. This was not contradicted by the defendant. We think there was evidence from which the jury could find that there was a mutual expectation that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>should have reasonable compensation for her services, and that defendant's motion for a verdict was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Judgment reversed and cause </em>remanded..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
