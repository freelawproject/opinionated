First, the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">[560 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-10\">of Appeals determined that a statement by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution, had been elicited in violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for an instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice was ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Both of these contentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in the habeas corpus proceedings before the United States District Court. Certiorari was granted to review the decision by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden of a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here, and Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-13\">On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall in Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel Morris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The other victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries and later testified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled. About one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-18\">Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to interrogate Thomp-kins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan. The interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted about three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a room that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair that resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that swings around to provide a surface to write on). App. 144a-145a. At the beginning of the interrogation, one of the officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with a form derived from the <em>Miranda </em>rule. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-19\">\u201cNOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND STATEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-20\">\u201c1. You have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-21\">[560 U.S. 375]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-22\">\u201c2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-23\">\u201c3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions and you have the right to have a lawyer present with you while you are answering any questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-24\">\u201c4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning, if you wish one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>\u201c5. You have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capitalization omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out loud. App. 8a. Thompkins complied. Helgert later said this was to ensure that Thomp-kins could read, and Helgert concluded that Thompkins understood English. <em>Id., </em>at 9a. Helgert then read the other four <em>Miranda </em>warnings out loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demonstrate that he understood his rights. App. 8a-9a. Thomp-kins declined to sign the form. The record contains conflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally confirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form. Compare <em>id., </em>at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert testified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he understood his rights), with <em>id., </em>at 148a (at trial, Helgert stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I orally asked him\u201d whether Thomp-kins understood his rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the interrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he wanted an attorney. <em>Id., </em>at 10a. Thompkins was \u201c[\u00bflargely\u201d silent during the interrogation, which lasted about three hours. <em>Id., </em>at 19a. He did give a few limited verbal responses, however, such as \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And on occasion he communicated by nodding his</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">[560 U.S. 376]</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">head. <em>Id., </em>at 23a. Thomp-kins also said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a peppermint\u201d that was offered to him by the police and that the chair he was \u201csitting in was hard <em>.\u2019\u2019Id., </em>at 152a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation, Helgert asked Thompkins, \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and said \u201cYes,\u201d as his eyes \u201cwell[ed] up with tears.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11a. Helgert asked, \u201cDo you pray to God?\u201d Thompkins said <em>\u201cYes.\u2019\u2019Id., </em>at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, \u201cDo you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 153a. Thompkins answered \u201cYes\u201d and looked away. <em>Ibid. </em>Thompkins refused to make a written confession, and the interrogation ended about 15 minutes later. <em>Id., </em>at 11a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder, assault with intent to commit murder, and certain firearms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the statements made during the interrogation. He argued that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, requiring police to end the interrogation at once, see <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 103, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975) (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694), that he had not waived his right to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">At trial, the prosecution\u2019s theory was that Thompkins shot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven by Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving the van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat while another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the back. The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Purifoy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon because the van was stopped and he was bending over near the floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained that, just after the shooting, Thomp-kins, holding a pistol, told Purifoy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>\u201cWhat the hell you doing? Pull off.\u201d Purifoy then drove away from the scene. App. 170a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">[560 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy\u2019s credibility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony from Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shooting under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and Detective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the murder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a concealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two other firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty. At Purifoy\u2019s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy was the driver and Thomp-kins was the shooter. This was consistent with the prosecution\u2019s argument at Thompkins\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">After Purifoy\u2019s trial had ended\u2014but before Thompkins\u2019 trial began\u2014Puri-foy sent Thompkins some letters. The letters expressed Purifoy\u2019s disappointment that Thompkins\u2019 family thought Purifoy was a \u201csnitch\u201d and a \u201crat.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 179a-180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a copy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that Purifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the shooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained statements by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent. <em>Id., </em>at 178a-179a. At Thompkins\u2019 trial, the prosecution suggested that one of Puri-foy\u2019s letters appeared to give Thompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution suggested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Puri-foy and Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the shooting started. <em>Id.., </em>at 187a-189a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see Thompkins shoot the victims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-8\">\u201cDid Eric Purifoy\u2019s Jury make the right decision? I\u2019m not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a] twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but his tight buddy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 202a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">[560 U.S. 378]</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">Defense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did not ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial only to assess Purifoy\u2019s credibility, not to establish Thompkins\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-11\">The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-13\">The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by Thompkins\u2019 appellate counsel. The trial court rejected the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice Thomp-kins. <em>Id.., </em>at 236a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-14\">Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under <em>Miranda. </em>The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the <em>Miranda </em>claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked his right to remain silent and had waived it. It also rejected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding that Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy\u2019s conviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompkins, </em>No. 242478, (Feb. 3, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a-82a. The Michigan Supreme Court denied discretionary review. 471 Mich. 866, 683 N.W.2d 676 (2004) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-15\">Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The District Court rejected Thompkins\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>and ineffective-assistance claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a-72a. It noted that, [1] under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not coerced into making statements</p>\n<p id=\"almu-dedup-1\">[560 U.S. 379]</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">during the interrogation. It held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his <em>Miranda </em>and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F.3d 572 (2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in rejecting Thompkins\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>claim, unreasonably applied clearly established federal law and based its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be express, as it can be \u201c \u2018inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.\u2019 \u201d 547 F.3d, at 582 (quoting <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979)). The panel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances here. The Court of Appeals found that the state court unreasonably determined the facts because \u201cthe evidence demonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours and forty-five minutes.\u201d 547 F.3d, at 586. According to the Court of Appeals, Thompkins\u2019 \u201cpersistent silence for nearly three hours in response to questioning and repeated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a clear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins did not wish to waive his rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">The Court of Appeals next determined that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by rejecting Thompkins\u2019 ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based on counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s acquittal. The Court of Appeals asserted that because Thomp-kins\u2019 central strategy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reasonable probability that the result of Thompkins\u2019 trial would have been different if there had been a limiting instruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 48, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">[560 U.S. 380]</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-12\">Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a habeas corpus application \u201cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number><em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 114, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2009). The relevant state-court decision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming Thomp-kins\u2019 conviction and rejecting his <em>Miranda </em>and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">The <em>Miranda </em>Court formulated a warning that must be given to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial interrogation. The substance of the warning still must be given to suspects today. A suspect in custody must be advised as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-6\">\u201cHe must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d 384 U.S., at 479, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">All concede that the warning given in this case was in full compliance with these requirements. The dispute centers on the response\u2014or nonre-sponse\u2014from the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers to questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He first</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">[560 U.S. 381]</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">contends that he \u201cinvoke [d] his privilege\u201d to remain silent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of time, so the interrogation should have \u201ccease[d]\u201d before he made his inculpatory statements. <em>Id., </em>at 474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694; see <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S., at 103, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (police must \u201c \u2018scrupulously hono[r]\u2019 \u201d this \u201ccritical safeguard\u201d when the accused invokes his or her \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 474, 479, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-13\">This argument is unpersuasive. [4] In the context of invoking the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, the Court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994), held that a suspect must do so \u201cunambiguously.\u201d If an accused makes a statement concerning the right to counsel \u201cthat is ambiguous or equivocal\u201d or makes no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, <em>ibid., </em>or ask questions to clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights, 512 U.S., at 461-462, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-14\">The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of the right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal, but there is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel at issue in <em>Davis. See, e.g., Solem </em>v. <em>Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 648, 104 S. Ct. 1338, 79 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1984) (\u201c[M]uch of the logic and language of <em>[Mosley],\u201d </em>which discussed the <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent, \u201ccould be applied to the invocation of the <em>[.Miranda </em>right to counsel]\u201d). Both protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 467-473, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is invoked, <em>Mosley, supra, </em>at 103, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (citing <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694); <em>Fare </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number><em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 719, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">There is good reason to require an accused who wants to invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambiguously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights results in an objective inquiry that \u201cavoid [s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide [s] guidance to officers\u201d on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S.,</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">[560 U.S. 382]</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">at 458-459, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362. If an ambiguous act, omission, or statement could require police to end the interrogation, police would be required to make difficult decisions about an accused\u2019s unclear intent and face the consequence of suppression \u201cif they guess wrong.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362. Suppression of a voluntary confession in these circumstances would place a significant burden on society\u2019s interest in prosecuting criminal activity. See <em>id,, </em>at 459-461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 427, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986). Treating an ambiguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cmight add marginally to <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S., at 425, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. But \u201cas <em>Miranda </em>holds, full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 427, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410; see <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 460, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would have invoked his \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mosley, supra, </em>at 103, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (quoting <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694). Here he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">We next consider whether Thomp-kins waived his right to remain silent.  Even absent the accused\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent, the accused\u2019s statement during a custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the prosecution can establish that the accused \u201cin fact knowingly and voluntarily waived <em>[Miranda] </em>rights\u201d when making the statement. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. The waiver inquiry \u201chas two distinct dimensions\u201d: waiver must be \u201cvoluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception,\u201d and \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right</p>\n<p id=\"AfoQ\">[560 U.S. 383]</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Burbine, supra, </em>at 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">Some language in <em>Miranda </em>could be read to indicate that waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit written waiver or a formal, express oral statement. <em>Miranda </em>said \u201ca valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d 384 U.S., at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694; see <em>id., </em>at 470, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (\u201cNo effective waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made after the <em>[Miranda] </em>warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>. . . have been given\u201d). In addition, the <em>Miranda </em>Court stated that \u201ca heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">The course of decisions since <em>Miranda, </em>informed by the application of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the whole course of law enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be established even absent formal or express statements of waiver that would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to determine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of <em>Miranda </em>is to ensure that an accused is advised of and understands the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. See <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 460, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362; <em>Burbine, supra, </em>at 427, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. Thus, \u201c[i]f anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the <em>Miranda </em>rule on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decision\u2019s core ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 443-444, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import of <em>Miranda </em>with respect to the question of waiver was <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler. </em>The <em>Butler </em>Court, after discussing some of the problems created by the language in <em>Miranda, </em>established certain important propositions. <em>Butler </em>interpreted the <em>Miranda </em>language concerning the \u201cheavy burden\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">[560 U.S. 384]</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">to show waiver, 384 U.S., at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, in accord with usual principles of determining waiver, which can include waiver implied from all the circumstances. See <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 373, 376, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. And in a later case, the Court stated that [7] this \u201cheavy burden\u201d is not more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 168, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was express. An \u201cimplicit waiver\u201d of the \u201cright to remain silent\u201d is sufficient to admit a suspect\u2019s statement into evidence. <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 376, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. <em>Butler </em>made clear that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights may be implied through \u201cthe defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver.\u201d 441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. The Court in <em>Butler </em>therefore \u201cretreated\u201d from the \u201clanguage and tenor of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion,\u201d which \u201csuggested that the Court would require that a waiver ... be \u2018specifically made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 531-532, 107 S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-10\">If the State establishes that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was given and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this showing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate \u201ca valid waiver\u201d of <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. The prosecution must make the additional showing that the accused understood these rights. See <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 573-575, 107 S. Ct. 851, 93 L. Ed. 2d 954 (1987); <em>Barrett, supra, </em>at 530, 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920; <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S., at 421-422, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. Cf. <em>Tague </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 469, 471, 100 S. Ct. 652, 62 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1980) <em>(per curiam) </em>(no evidence that accused understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights); <em>Carnley </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S. Ct. 884, 8 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1962) (government could not show that accused \u201cunderstandingly\u201d waived his right to counsel in light of \u201csilent record\u201d). Where the prosecution shows that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an accused\u2019s uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">[560 U.S. 385]</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Although <em>Miranda </em>imposes on the police a rule that is both formalistic and practical when it prevents them from interrogating suspects without first providing them with a <em>Miranda </em>warning, see <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S., at 427, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410, it does not impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect must follow to relinquish those rights. As a general proposition, the law can presume that an individual who, with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish the protection those rights afford. See, <em>e.g., Butler, supra, </em>at 372-376, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286; <em>Connelly, supra, </em>at 169-170, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (\u201cThere is obviously no reason to require more in the way of a \u2018volun-tariness\u2019 inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context than in the [due process] confession context\u201d). The Court\u2019s cases have recognized that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights need only meet the standard of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). See <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 374-375, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286; <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 475-476, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (applying <em>Zerbst </em>standard of intentional relinquishment of a known right). As <em>Butler </em>recognized, 441 U.S., at 375-376, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286, <em>Miranda </em>rights can therefore be waived through means less formal than a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and necessities of interrogation and the fact that <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>main protection lies in advising defendants of their rights, see <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S., at 460, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362; <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S., at 427, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived his right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to conclude that he did not understand his rights; and on these facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on those rights when he did speak. First, there is no contention that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and from this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he spoke. See <em>id., </em>at 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. There was more than enough evidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thompkins received a written copy of <em>the Miranda </em>warnings; Detective Hel-gert determined that Thompkins</p>\n<p id=\"AzUqO\">[560 U.S. 386]</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">could read and understand English; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings. Thompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning, which stated that \u201cyou have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>(capitalization omitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain silent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time and that police would have to honor his right to be silent and his right to counsel during the whole course of interrogation. Those rights, the warning made clear, could be asserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warnings aloud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Second, Thompkins\u2019 answer to Detective Helgert\u2019s question about whether Thompkins prayed to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim is a \u201ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\u201d of the right to remain silent. <em>Butler, </em>supra, at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response to Hel-gert\u2019s questions, or he could have unambiguously invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thompkins made a statement about three hours after receiving a <em>Miranda </em>warning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. [11] Police are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time. Thomp-kins\u2019 answer to Helgert\u2019s question about praying to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. This is confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins had given sporadic answers to questions throughout the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins\u2019 statement was coerced. See <em>Burbine, supra, </em>at 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. Thompkins does not claim that police threatened or injured him during the interrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The interrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in the middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he was in a</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">[560 U.S. 387]</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is no authority for the proposition that an interrogation of this length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where interrogations of greater duration were held to be improper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by other facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated and sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and threats. Cf. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S., at 163-164, n. 1, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473. The fact that Helgert\u2019s question referred to Thompkins\u2019 religious beliefs also did not render Thompkins\u2019 statement involuntary. [12] \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned \u2018with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 170, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (quoting <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 305, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to Detective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him until they obtained a waiver first. <em>Butler </em>forecloses this argument. The <em>Butler </em>Court held that courts can infer a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cfrom the actions and words of the person interrogated.\u201d 441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. This principle would be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at the outset. The <em>Butler </em>Court thus rejected the rule proposed by the <em>Butler </em>dissent, which would have \u201crequired] the police to obtain an express waiver of <em>[.Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>rights] before proceeding with interrogation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 379, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (Brennan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given that  \u201cthe primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed] to custodial interrogation is the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 460, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362. The <em>Miranda </em>rule and its requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings, understands them, and has an opportunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or admissions. Any waiver, express or implied,</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">[560 U.S. 388]</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">may be contradicted by an invocation at any time. If the right to counsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any point during questioning, further interrogation must cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Interrogation provides the suspect with additional information that can put his or her decision to waive, or not to invoke, into perspective. As questioning commences and then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to consider the choices he or she faces and to make a more informed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooperate. When the suspect knows that <em>Miranda </em>rights can be invoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to reassess his or her immediate and long-term interests. Cooperation with the police may result in more favorable treatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accomplices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; beginning steps toward relief or solace for the victims; and the beginning of the suspect\u2019s own return to the law and the social order it seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">In order for an accused\u2019s statement to be admissible at trial, police must have given the accused a <em>Miranda </em>warning. See <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 471, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. If that condition is established, the court can proceed to consider whether there has been an express or implied waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id., </em>at 476, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. In making its ruling on the admissibility of a statement made during custodial questioning, the trial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence to support the conclusion that, from the whole course of questioning, an express or implied waiver has been established. Thus, after giving a <em>Miranda </em>warning, police may interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights. On these premises, it follows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>rights before commencing the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">In sum,  a suspect who has received and understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and has not invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights,</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-12\">[560 U.S. 389]</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-13\">waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning. Understanding his rights in full, he waived his right to remain silent by making a voluntary statement to the police. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a waiver of Thomp-kins\u2019 right to remain silent before interrogating him. The state court\u2019s decision rejecting Thompkins\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>claim was thus correct under <em>de novo </em>review and therefore necessarily reasonable under the more deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). See <em>Knowles, </em>556 U.S., at 123-124, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (state court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>decision was correct under <em>de novo </em>review and not unreasonable under AEDPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins\u2019 counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could consider the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial.  To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant \u201cmust show both deficient performance bu counsel and prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 122, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674). To establish prejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. In assessing prejudice, courts \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 695, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The Court of Appeals, however, neglected to take into account the other evidence presented against Thomp-kins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">The Court of Appeals determined that the state court was unreasonable, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), when it found that Thompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense counsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s earlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges. The state court had rejected Thompkins\u2019 claim that he was prejudiced by evidence of Purifoy\u2019s earlier conviction for firearms offenses, noting that \u201cthe record does not disclose an attempt to argue</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">[560 U.S. 390]</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">that conviction for an improper purpose.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. It is unclear what prejudice standard the state court applied. The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court used the incorrect standard for assessing prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>because \u201c[questions of the prosecution\u2019s purpose or intent are completely irrelevant in . . . analyzing whether an error resulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the error\u2019s effect upon the outcome.\u201d 547 F.3d, at 591-592 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard, we need not determine whether AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), applies in this situation. Cf. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 397-398, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). That is because, even if AE-DPA deference does not apply, Thomp-kins cannot show prejudice under <em>de novo </em>review, the more favorable standard of review for Thompkins. [16] Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254 by engaging only in <em>de novo </em>review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, \u00a7 2254(d). In those situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA deference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner may not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254 by engaging in <em>de novo </em>review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a habeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if his or her claim is rejected on <em>de novo </em>review, see \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction about the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient representation; but on the assumption that it was, on this record Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record establishes that it was not reasonably likely that the instruction would have made any difference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>light of all the other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Frederick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the identification was supported by a photograph taken from a surveillance camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">[560 U.S. 391]</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Thomp-kins\u2019 friend Omar Stephens testified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone conversation, and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that Thomp-kins stripped the van and abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Puri-foy\u2019s credibility, as it was instructed to do. The jury in Thompkins\u2019 case could have concluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy\u2019s case made a mistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact guilty of the crime for which he had been charged. There was ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins\u2019 guilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to weigh ah of the evidence in determining whether there was guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our <em>de novo </em>review of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"pA5OPS\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"55\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAVcAAAA3AQAAAACQyTRbAAAAoUlEQVR4nO2UMQrCQBBF3w6pJQcS9GZ6GA9h4WVMkTp2grLfIkXG4kNAUgg73fv7Z/gMwxaxthSrrdC8zfuT9+suPQRAPSfFw1Z5kaT9Q0tZqAFoyL0WCKBM0yJ4mPNex6R4QJKehxTRQg2A7piaPQTAmBUPAXDpkuIBSdrdU0QL8377PvVamOfeXmmUhYokvU/p2ULd6s5K+6ubt3n/3vsBAgnxWg7eVv0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"344\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b1205-10\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"ajpr-dedup-0\">with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">The Court concludes today that a criminal suspect waives his right to remain silent if, after sitting tacit and uncommunicative through nearly three hours of police interrogation, he utters a few one-word responses. The Court also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard his right to remain silent against such a finding of \u201cwaiver\u201d must, counterintuitively, speak\u2014and must do so with sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule that construes ambiguity in favor of the police. Both propositions mark a substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self-incrimination that <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), has long provided during custodial interrogation. The broad rules the Court announces today are also troubling</p>\n<p id=\"A-lr\">[560 U.S. 392]</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">because they are unnecessary to decide this case, which is governed by the deferential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Because I believe Thompkins is entitled to relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements were admitted at trial without the prosecution having carried its burden to show that he waived his right to remain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial restraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of law the Court reaches out to decide; and because the Court\u2019s answers to those questions do not result from a faithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-15\">We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that Thompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). 547 F.3d 572 (2008). As to the <em>Miranda </em>claims, Thompkins argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>first that through his conduct during the 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked his right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off questioning in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975). Thompkins also contends his statements were in any case inadmissible because the prosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under <em>Miranda </em>of proving that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit agreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach the question of invocation. 547 F.3d, at 583-584, n. 4. In my view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invocation claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to waiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins\u2019 claim that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">The strength of Thompkins\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>claims depends in large part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interrogation,</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">[560 U.S. 393]</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">at the end of which he made inculpatory statements later introduced at trial. The Court\u2019s opinion downplays record evidence that Thompkins remained almost completely silent and unresponsive throughout that session. One of the interrogating officers, Detective Hel-gert, testified that although Thomp-kins was administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins expressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that he had been advised of and understood his rights. There is conflicting evidence in the record about whether Thompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record contains no indication that the officers sought or obtained an express waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">As to the interrogation itself, Hel-gert candidly characterized it as \u201cvery, very one-sided\u201d and \u201cnearly a monologue.\u201d App. 10a, 17a. Thomp-kins was \u201c[pleculiar,\u201d \u201cMullen,\u201d and \u201c[generally quiet.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 149a. Hel-gert and his partner \u201cdid most of the talking,\u201d as Thompkins was \u201cnot verbally communicative\u201d and \u201c[l]argely\u201d remained silent. <em>Id., </em>at 149a, 17a, 19a. To the extent Thompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of \u201ca word or two. A \u2018yeah,\u2019 or a \u2018no,\u2019 or T don\u2019t know.\u2019 . . . And sometimes . . . he simply sat down . . . with [his] head in [his] hands looking down. Sometimes ... he would look up and make eye-contact would be the only response.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 23a-24a. After proceeding in this fashion for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Hel-gert</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">[560 U.S. 394]</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">asked Thompkins three questions relating to his faith in God. The prosecution relied at trial on Thomp-kins\u2019 one-word answers of \u201cyes.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 10a-lla.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-11\">Thompkins\u2019 nonresponsiveness is particularly striking in the context of the officers\u2019 interview strategy, later explained as conveying to Thompkins that \u201cthis was his opportunity to explain his side [of the story]\u201d because \u201c[everybody else, including [his] co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>[d]efendants, had given their version,\u201d and asking him \u201c[w]ho is going to speak up for you if you don\u2019t speak up for yourself?\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 10a, 21a. Yet, Helgert confirmed that the <em>\u201conly </em>thing [Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shooting]\u201d occurred near the end of the interview\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>in response to the questions about God. <em>Id., </em>at 10a-lla (emphasis added). The only other responses Hel-gert could remember Thompkins giving were that \u201c \u2018[h]e didn\u2019t want a peppermint\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the chair that he was sitting in was hard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 152a. Nevertheless, the Michigan court concluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked his right to remain silent because \u201che continued to talk with the officer, albeit sporadically,\u201d and that he voluntarily waived that right. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompkins, </em>No. 242478 (Feb. 3, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\">Thompkins\u2019 federal habeas petition is governed by AEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the writ unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits of the claim at issue \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) begins with our landmark <em>Miranda </em>decision, which \u201cg[a]ve force to the Constitution\u2019s protection against compelled self-incrimination\u201d by establishing \u201c \u2018certain procedural safeguards that require police to advise criminal suspects</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">[560 U.S. 395]</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing custodial interrogation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>559 U.S. 50, 59, 130 S.

Ed. 2d 166 (1989)). <em>Miranda </em>prescribed the now-familiar warnings that police must administer prior to questioning. See 384 U.S., at 479, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694; <em>ante, </em>at 380, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1110. <em>Miranda </em>and our subsequent cases also require police to \u201crespect the accused\u2019s decision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.\u201d <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 420, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986). \u201cIf [an] individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent\u201d or if he \u201cstates that he wants an attorney,\u201d the interrogation \u201cmust cease.\u201d 384 U.S., at 473-474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">Even when warnings have been administered and a suspect has not affirmatively invoked his rights, statements made in custodial interrogation may not be admitted as part of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief \u201cunless and until\u201d the prosecution demonstrates that an individual \u201cknowingly and intelligently waive [d] [his] rights.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 479, 86 S.

Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. The government must satisfy the \u201chigh standar [d] of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>forth in] <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.

Ct. 490, 83 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1984) <em>(per curiam). </em>The questions are related, however, in terms of the practical effect on the exercise of a suspect\u2019s rights. A suspect may at any time revoke his prior waiver of rights\u2014or, closer to the facts of this case, guard against the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly waived his rights\u2014by invoking the rights and thereby requiring the police to cease questioning.

Even if Thompkins did not invoke that right, he is entitled to relief because Michigan did not satisfy its burden of establishing waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\"><em>Miranda\u2019s </em>discussion of the prosecution\u2019s burden in proving waiver speaks with particular clarity to the facts of this case and therefore merits reproducing at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-10\">\u201cIf [an] interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. . . . Since the State is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which [an] interrogation takes place and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-12\">\u201cAn express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement could constitute a waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d 384 U.S., at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-13\"><em>Miranda </em>went further in describing the facts likely to satisfy the prosecution\u2019s burden of establishing the admissibility of statements obtained after a lengthy interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-14\">\u201cWhatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a statement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ao1x-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 397]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-15\">is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights. In these circumstances the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 476, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-17\">This Court\u2019s decisions subsequent to <em>Miranda </em>have emphasized the prosecution\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d in proving waiver. See, <em>e.g., Tague </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 470-471, 100 S. Ct. 652, 62 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1980) <em>(per </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number><em>curiam); Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 724, 99 S. Ct. 2560, 61 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1979). We have also reaffirmed that a court may not presume waiver from a suspect\u2019s silence or from the mere fact that a confession was eventually obtained. See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\">Even in concluding that <em>Miranda </em>does not invariably require an express waiver of the right to silence or the right to counsel, this Court in <em>Butler </em>made clear that the prosecution bears a substantial burden in establishing an implied waiver. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had obtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and confirming that he understood them. When presented with a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the agents, \u201c T will talk to you but I am not signing any form.\u2019 \u201d 441 U.S., at 371, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. He then made inculpatory statements, which he later sought to suppress on the ground that he had not expressly waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment concluding that the statements were inadmissible, we quoted at length portions of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion reproduced above. We cautioned that even an \u201cexpress written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel\u201d is not \u201cinevitably . . . sufficient to establish waiver,\u201d emphasizing that \u201c [t]he question is . . . whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.\u201d 441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. <em>Miranda,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">[560 U.S. 398]</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">we observed, \u201cunequivocally said . . . mere silence is not enough.\u201d 441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. While we stopped short in <em>Butler </em>of announcing a <em>per se </em>rule that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights,\u201d we reiterated that \u201ccourts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s burden is great.\u201d <em>Ibid..</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-9\">Rarely do this Court\u2019s precedents provide clearly established law so closely on point with the facts of a particular case. Together, <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Butler </em>establish that a court \u201cmust presume that a defendant did not waive his rights\u201d; the prosecution bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in attempting to demonstrate waiver; the fact of a \u201clengthy interrogation\u201d prior to obtaining statements is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d against a finding of valid waiver; \u201cmere silence\u201d in response to questioning is \u201cnot enough\u201d; and waiver may not be presumed \u201csimply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 475-476, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 694; <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 372-373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">[560 U.S. 399]</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">It is undisputed here that Thomp-kins never expressly waived his right to remain silent. His refusal to sign even an acknowledgment that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those rights. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Plugh, </em>576 F.3d 135, 142 (CA2 2009) (suspect\u2019s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form \u201cconstituted an unequivocally negative answer to the question . . . whether he was willing to waive his rights\u201d). That Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements at issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes of interrogation serves as \u201cstrong evidence\u201d against waiver. <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Butler </em>expressly preclude the possibility that the incul-patory statements themselves are sufficient to establish waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">In these circumstances, Thomp-kins\u2019 \u201cactions and words\u201d preceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evidence a \u201ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\u201d sufficient to carry the prosecution\u2019s burden. See <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">[560 U.S. 400]</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-9\">the Michigan court stated that Thompkins \u201csporadically\u201d participated in the interview, App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, that court\u2019s opinion and the record before us are silent as to the subject matter or context of even a single question to which Thompkins purportedly responded, other than the exchange about God and the statements respecting the peppermint and the chair. Unlike in <em>Butler, </em>Thompkins made no initial declaration akin to \u201cI will talk to you.\u201d See also 547 F.3d, at 586-587 (case below) (noting that the case might be different if the record showed Thomp-kins had responded affirmatively to an invitation to tell his side of the story or described any particular question that Thompkins answered). Indeed, Michigan and the United States concede that no waiver occurred in this case until Thompkins responded \u201cyes\u201d to the questions about God. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>believe it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly established precedents to conclude the prosecution met its \u201cheavy burden\u201d of proof on a record consisting of three one-word answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence punctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to unidentified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">Perhaps because our prior <em>Miranda </em>precedents so clearly favor Thomp-kins, the Court today goes beyond AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review and announces a new general principle of law. Any new rule, it must be emphasized, is unnecessary to the disposition of this case. If, in the Court\u2019s view, the Michigan court did not unreasonably apply our <em>Miranda </em>precedents in denying Thompkins relief, it should simply say so and reverse the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment on that ground. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . that this Court will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\u201d <em>Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation </em>v. <em>Wold Engineering, P. C., </em>467 U.S. 138, 157, 104 S. Ct. 2267, 81 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1984). Consistent with that rule, we have frequently declined to address questions beyond</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">[560 U.S. 401]</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">what is necessary to resolve a case under AEDPA. See, <em>e.g., Tyler </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 667-668, 121 S. Ct. 2478, 150 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2001) (declining to address question where any statement by this Court would be \u201cdictum\u201d in light of AEDPA\u2019s statutory constraints on habeas review); cf. <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 522, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003) (noting that <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000), \u201cmade no new law\u201d because the \u201ccase was before us on habeas review\u201d). No necessity exists to justify the Court\u2019s broad announcement today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">The Court concludes that when <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given and understood, \u201can accused\u2019s uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 384, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1113. More broadly still, the Court states that, \u201c[a]s a general proposition, the law can presume that an individual who, with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish the protection those rights afford.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 385, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">These principles flatly contradict our longstanding views that \u201ca valid waiver will not be presumed . . . simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained,\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, and that \u201c[t]he courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights,\u201d <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286. Indeed, we have in the past summarily reversed a state-court decision that inverted <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>antiwaiver presumption, characterizing the error as \u201creadily apparent.\u201d <em>Tague, </em>444 U.S., at 470-471, 100 S. Ct. 652, 62 L. Ed. 2d 622. At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and conflicting set of presumptions that will undermine <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>goal of providing \u201cconcrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,\u201d 384 U.S., at 442, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. At worst, it overrules <em>sub silentio </em>an essential aspect of the protections <em>Miranda </em>has long provided for the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-11\">The Court\u2019s conclusion that Thomp-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>kins\u2019 inculpatory statements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver, <em>ante, </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">[560 U.S. 402]</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">386-387, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1114, finds no support in <em>Butler. Butler </em>itself distinguished between a sufficient \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d and in-culpatory statements, reiterating <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>admonition that \u201c \u2018a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from . . . the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u2019 \u201d 441 U.S., at 373, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (quoting <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694). Michigan suggests Butler\u2019s silence \u201c \u2018when advised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,\u2019 \u201d combined with our remand for the state court to apply the implied-waiver standard, shows that silence followed by statements can be a \u201c \u2018course of conduct.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 26 (quoting <em>Butler, supra, </em>at 371, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286). But the evidence of implied waiver in <em>Butler </em>was worlds apart from the evidence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said \u201cI will talk to you\u201d after having been read <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">The Court also relies heavily on <em>Burbine </em>in characterizing the scope of the prosecution\u2019s burden in proving waiver. Consistent with <em>Burbine, </em>the Court observes, the prosecution must prove that waiver was \u201c \u2018voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 382-383, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1111-1112 (quoting 475 U.S., at 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410). I agree with the Court\u2019s statement, so far as it goes. What it omits, however, is that the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of showing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d sufficiently clear to support a finding of implied waiver. Nothing in <em>Burbine </em>even hints at removing that obligation. The question in that case, rather, was whether a suspect\u2019s multiple express waivers of his rights were invalid because police \u201cmisinformed an inquiring attorney about their plans concerning the suspect or because they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney\u2019s efforts to reach him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 420, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410; see also <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 573, 107 S. Ct. 851, 93 L. Ed. 2d 954</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-8\">[560 U.S. 403]</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-9\">(1987). The Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Burbine </em>was predicated on the existence of waiver in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\">Today\u2019s dilution of the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof to the bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and understood takes an unprecedented step away from the \u201chigh standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights\u201d this Court has long demanded. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 475, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694; cf. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 404, 97 S. Ct. 1232, 51 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1977) (\u201c[CJourts indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d); <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S., at 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461. When waiver is to be inferred during a custodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require evidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves. <em>Miranda </em>and our subsequent cases are premised on the idea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive. See 384 U.S., at 455, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (\u201cEven without employing brutality, the \u2018third degree\u2019 or [other] specific strategems . . . the very fact of custodial interrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals\u201d); <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 435, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405 (2000). Requiring proof of a course of conduct beyond the inculpatory statements themselves is critical to ensuring that those statements are voluntary admissions and not the dubious product of an overborne will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\">Today\u2019s decision thus ignores the important interests <em>Miranda </em>safeguards. The underlying constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination reflects \u201cmany of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations,\u201d our society\u2019s \u201cpreference for an accu-satorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal justice\u201d; a \u201cfear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses\u201d and a resulting \u201cdistrust of self-deprecatory statements\u201d; and a realization that while the privilege is \u201csometimes a shelter to the guilty, [it] is often a protection to the innocent.\u201d <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 692, 113 S. Ct. 1745, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). For these reasons, we have observed, a criminal law system \u201cwhich comes to depend on the \u2018confession\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">[560 U.S. 404]</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system relying on independent investigation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cBy bracing against \u2018the possibility of unreliable statements in every instance of in-custody interrogation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>prophylactic rules serve to \u201c \u2018protect the fairness of the trial itself.\u2019 \u201d 507 U.S., at 692, 113 S. Ct. 1745, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407 (quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719, 730, 86 S. Ct. 1772, 16 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1966); <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 240, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973)). Today\u2019s decision bodes poorly for the fundamental principles that <em>Miranda </em>protects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">Thompkins separately argues that his conduct during the interrogation invoked his right to remain silent, requiring police to terminate questioning. Like the Sixth Circuit, I would not reach this question because Thompkins is in any case entitled to relief as to waiver. But even if Thomp-kins would not prevail on his invocation claim under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s much broader ruling that a suspect must clearly invoke his right to silence by speaking. Taken together with the Court\u2019s reformulation of the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof as to waiver, today\u2019s novel dear-statement rule for invocation invites police to question a suspect at length\u2014notwithstanding his persistent refusal to answer questions\u2014in the hope of eventually obtaining a single inculpatory response which will suffice to prove waiver of rights. Such a result bears little semblance to the \u201cfully effective\u201d prophylaxis, 384 U.S., at 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, that <em>Miranda </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-11\">Thompkins\u2019 claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the clearly established federal law of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Mosley. </em>In <em>Miranda, </em>the Court concluded that \u201c [i]f [an] individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">[560 U.S. 405]</p>\n<p id=\"A0Vo6\">cease. . . . [A]ny statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>erwise.\u201d 384 U.S., at 473-474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694. In <em>Mosley, </em>the Court said that a \u201ccritical safeguard\u201d of the right to remain silent is a suspect\u2019s \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning.\u2019 \u201d 423 U.S., at 103, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (quoting <em>Miranda, supra, </em>at 474, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694). Thus, \u201cthe admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d 423 U.S., at 104, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Thompkins contends that in refusing to respond to questions he effectively invoked his right to remain silent, such that police were required to terminate the interrogation prior to his inculpatory statements. In Michigan\u2019s view, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because this Court\u2019s precedents have not previously established whether a suspect\u2019s ambiguous statements or actions require the police to stop questioning. We have held that a suspect who has \u201c \u2018invoked his right to have counsel present ... is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S. 98, 104, 130 S. Ct. 1213, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (2010) (quoting <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-485, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981)). Notwithstanding <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>statement that \u201cthere can be no questioning\u201d if a suspect \u201cindicates in any manner . . . that he wishes to consult with an attorney,\u201d 384 U.S., at 444-445, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, the Court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994),</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">[560 U.S. 406]</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">established a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to counsel. After a suspect has knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, <em>Davis </em>held, police may continue questioning \u201cuntil and unless the suspect <em>clearly </em>requests an attorney.\u201d 512 U.S., at 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Because this Court has never decided whether <em>Davis\u2019 </em>clear-statement rule applies to an invocation of the right to silence, Michigan contends, there was no clearly established federal law prohibiting the state court from requiring an unambiguous invocation. That the state court\u2019s decision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in Michigan\u2019s view, by the number of Federal Courts of Appeals to have applied <em>Davis </em>to invocation of the right to silence. Brief for Petitioner 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">Under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, it is indeed difficult to conclude that the state court\u2019s application of our precedents was objectively unreasonable. Although the duration and consistency of Thompkins\u2019 refusal to answer questions throughout the 3-hour interrogation provide substantial evidence in support of his claim, Thompkins did not remain absolutely silent, and this Court has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>previously addressed whether a suspect can invoke the right to silence by remaining uncooperative and nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">The Court, however, eschews this narrow ground of decision, instead extending <em>Davis </em>to hold that police may continue questioning a suspect until he unambiguously invokes his right to remain silent. Because Thompkins neither said \u201che wanted to remain silent\u201d nor said \u201che did not want to talk with the police,\u201d the Court concludes, he did not clearly invoke his right to silence. Ante, at 8-10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">[560 U.S. 407]</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-7\">I disagree with this novel application of <em>Davis. </em>Neither the rationale nor holding of that case compels today\u2019s result. <em>Davis </em>involved the right to counsel, not the right to silence. The Court in <em>Davis </em>reasoned that extending <em>Edwards\u2019 </em>\u201crigid\u201d prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests for a lawyer would transform <em>Miranda </em>into a \u201c \u2018wholly irrational obstad [e] to legitimate police investigative activity\u2019 \u201d by \u201cneedlessly preventing] the police from questioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did not wish to have a lawyer present.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>at 460, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362. But <em>Miranda </em>itself \u201cdistinguished between the procedural safeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S., at 104, n. 10, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313; accord, <em>Edwards, supra, </em>at 485, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378. <em>Mosley </em>upheld the admission of statements when police immediately stopped interrogating a suspect who invoked his right to silence, but reap-proached him after a 2-hour delay and obtained inculpatory responses relating to a different crime after administering fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The different effects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct standards for invocation. To the extent <em>Mosley </em>contemplates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards\u2014and, in particular, does not categorically bar police from reapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to remain <em>silent\u2014Davis\u2019 </em>concern about \u201c \u2018wholly irrational obstacles\u2019 \u201d to police investigation applies with less force.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">In addition, the suspect\u2019s equivocal reference to a lawyer in <em>Davis </em>occurred only <em>after </em>he had given express oral and written waivers of his rights. <em>Davis\u2019 </em>holding is explicitly predicated on that fact. See 512 U.S., at 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (\u201cWe therefore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney\u201d). The Court ignores this aspect of <em>Davis, </em>as well as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts declining</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">[560 U.S. 408]</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect has not previously given an express waiver of rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-12\">In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing a suspect\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>ambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent is the constraint <em>Mosley </em>places on questioning a suspect who has invoked that right: The suspect\u2019s \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 \u201d must be \u201c \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d See 423 U.S., at 104, 96 S. Ct. 321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313. Such a standard is necessarily precautionary and fact specific. The rule would acknowledge that some statements or conduct are so equivocal that police may scrupulously honor a suspect\u2019s rights without terminating questioning\u2014for instance, if a suspect\u2019s actions are reasonably understood to indicate a willingness to listen before deciding whether to respond. But other statements or actions\u2014in particular, when a suspect sits silent throughout prolonged interrogation, long past the point when he could be deciding whether to respond\u2014cannot reasonably be understood other than as an invocation of the right to remain silent. Under such circumstances, \u201cscrupulous\u201d respect for the suspect\u2019s rights will require police to terminate questioning under Mosley.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">[560 U.S. 409]</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with a bright-line rule. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 381-382, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 11110-1111. But, as we have previously recognized, <em>Mosley </em>itself does not offer clear guidance to police about when and how interrogation may continue after a suspect invokes his rights. See <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Stumes, </em>465 U.S. 638, 648, 104 S. Ct. 1338, 79 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1984); see also <em>Shatzer, </em>559 U.S., at 119, 130 S. Ct. 1213, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Given that police have for nearly 35 years applied <em>Mosley\u2019s </em>fact-specific standard in questioning suspects who have invoked their right to remain silent; that our cases did not during that time resolve what statements or actions suffice to invoke that right; and that neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General has provided evidence in this case that the status quo has proved unworkable, I see little reason to believe today\u2019s dear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\"><em>Davis\u2019 </em>clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right to silence. Advising a suspect that he has a \u201cright to remain silent\u201d is unlikely to convey that he must speak (and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the right will be protected. Cf. <em>Soffar </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>300 F.3d 588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhat in the world must an individual do to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in fact, remaining silent\u201d). By contrast, telling a suspect \u201che has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires,\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S., at 479, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, implies the need for speech to exercise that right. <em>Davis\u2019 </em>requirement that a suspect must \u201cclearly reques[t] an attorney\u201d to terminate questioning thus aligns with a suspect\u2019s likely under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>standing of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a way today\u2019s rule does not. 512 U.S., at 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362. The Court suggests Thompkins could have employed the \u201csimple, unambiguous\u201d means of saying \u201che wanted to remain silent\u201d or \u201cdid not want to talk with the police.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 382, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1111. But the <em>Miranda </em>warnings give no</p>\n<p id=\"azlo-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 410]</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">hint that a suspect should use those magic words, and there is little reason to believe police\u2014who have ample incentives to avoid invocation\u2014will provide such guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Conversely, the Court\u2019s concern that police will face \u201cdifficult decisions about an accused\u2019s unclear intent\u201d and suffer the consequences of \u201c \u2018guess[ing] wrong,\u201d\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 382, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1111 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S., at 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362), is misplaced. If a suspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in conduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke his right, police can simply ask for clarification. See <em>id., </em>at 467, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). It is hardly an unreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for instance, \u201cDo you want to talk to us?\u201d The majority in <em>Davis </em>itself approved of this approach as protecting suspects\u2019 rights while \u201cminimiz [ing] the chance of a confession [later] being suppressed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 461, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362. Given this straightforward mechanism by which police can \u201cscrupulously hono[r]\u201d a suspect\u2019s right to silence, today\u2019s clear-statement rule can only be seen as accepting \u201cas tolerable the certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to remain silent] will be disregarded,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 471, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (opinion of Souter, J.), without any countervailing benefit. Police may well prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous statement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights. But \u201cour system of justice is not founded on a fear that a suspect will exercise his rights. \u2018If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S., at 458, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 490, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 12 L.

Ed. 2d, at 1111. Experience suggests the contrary. In the 16 years since <em>Davis </em>was decided, ample evidence has accrued that criminal suspects often use equivocal or colloquial language in attempting to invoke their right to silence. A number of</p>\n<p id=\"arhr-dedup-1\">[560 U.S. 411]</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">lower courts that have (erroneously, in my view) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invocation of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an array of statements whose meaning might otherwise be thought plain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At a minimum, these decisions suggest that differentiating \u201cclear\u201d from \u201cambiguous\u201d statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>is often a subjective inquiry. Even if some of the cited decisions are themselves in tension with <em>Davis\u2019 </em>admonition that a suspect need not \u201c \u2018speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don\u2019 \u201d to invoke his rights,</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">[560 U.S. 412]</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">512 U.S., at 459, 114 S.

Ed. 2d 362 (opinion of Souter, J.)), they demonstrate that today\u2019s decision will significantly burden the exercise of the right to silence. Notably, when a suspect \u201cunderstands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored ... in contravention of the \u2018rights\u2019 just read to him by his interrogator, he may well see further objection as futile and confession (true or not) as the only way to end his interrogation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 472-473, 114 S.

Criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent\u2014which, coun-terintuitively, requires them to speak. At the same time, suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so. Those results, in my view, find no basis in <em>Miranda </em>or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on which those precedents are grounded. Today\u2019s broad new rules are all the more unfortunate because they are unnecessary to the disposition of the case before us. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1206-12\">. At the suppression hearing, Detective Helgert testified that after reading Thompkins the warnings, \u201cI believe I asked him if he understood the Rights, and I think I got a verbal answer to that as a Ves.\u2019 \u201d App. 9a. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on that factual premise. <em>Id., </em>at 26a. In his later testimony at trial, Helgert remembered the encounter differently. Asked whether Thompkins \u201cindicate[d] that he understood [the warnings]\u2019\u2019 after they had been read, Helgert stated \u201cI don\u2019t know that I orally asked him that question.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 148a. Nevertheless, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated that Thompkins verbally acknowledged understanding his rights. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompkins, </em>No. 242478 (Feb. 3, 2004), App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1209-10\">.

But nothing in <em>Connelly </em>displaced the core presumption against finding a waiver of rights, and we have subsequently relied on Miranda's characterization of the prosecution\u2019s burden as \u201cheavy.\u2019\u2019 See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 680, 108 S.

Likely reflecting the great weight of the prosecution\u2019s burden in proving implied waiver, many contemporary police training resources instruct officers to obtain a waiver of rights prior to proceeding at all with an interrogation. See, <em>e.g., </em>R Inbau, J. Reid, J. Buckley, &amp; B. Jayne, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 491 (4th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Inbau) (\u201cOnce [a] waiver is given, the police may proceed with the interrogation\u2019\u2019); D. Zulawski &amp; D.

Although such decisions are not controlling under AEDPA, it is notable that lower courts have similarly required a showing of words or conduct beyond inculpatory statements. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>848 F.2d 1464, 1475 (CA9 1988) (no implied waiver when warned suspect \u201cmaintained her silence for . . . perhap[s] as many as ten minutes\u2019\u2019 before answering a question); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>677 F.2d 518, 521-522 (CA5 1982) (no implied waiver when defendant refused to sign waiver and there was \u201cno evidence of words or actions implying a waiver, except the [inculpatory] statement\u2019\u2019). Generally, courts have found implied waiver when a warned suspect has made incriminating statements \u201cas part of a steady stream of speech or as part of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,\u2019\u2019 or when a warned suspect who previously invoked his right \u201cspontaneously recommences the dialogue with his interviewers.\u2019\u2019 <em>Bui </em>v. <em>DiPaolo, </em>170 F.3d 232, 240 (CA1 1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>218 F.3d 777, 781 (CA7 2000) (implied waiver where suspect \u201cimmediately began talking to the agents after refusing to sign the waiver form and continued to do so for an hour\u2019\u2019); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scarpa, </em>897 F.2d 63, 68 (CA2 1990) (implied waiver where warned suspect engaged in a \u201c \u2018relaxed and friendly\u2019 \u2019\u2019 conversation with officers during a 2-hour drive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">.

Because the Sixth Circuit declined to decide Thompkins\u2019 invocation claim, a remand would permit the lower court to address the question in the first instance.

Indeed, this rule appears to reflect widespread contemporary police practice. Thompkins\u2019 <em>amici </em>collect a range of training materials that instruct police not to engage in prolonged interrogation after a suspect has failed to respond to initial questioning.

One widely used police manual, for example, teaches that a suspect who \u201cindicates,\u201d \u201ceven by silence itself,\u201d his unwillingness to answer questions \u201chas obviously exercised his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Inbau 498.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">.
