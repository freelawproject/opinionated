A., provided medical care to Sonia E. Galvez for injuries she suffered in an automobile accident. As partial payment for that care, Galvez assigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits under a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance Co. Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned benefits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to pay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. \u00a7 5106(a) (West 2009). Allstate apparently paid, but not on time, and it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on the overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern District of New York to recover the unpaid statutory interest. Alleging that Allstate routinely refuses to pay interest on overdue benefits, Shady Grove sought relief on behalf of itself and a class of all others to whom Allstate owes interest. The District Court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction. 466 F. Supp. 2d 467 (2006). It reasoned that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 901(b), which precludes a suit to recover a \u201cpenalty\u201d from proceeding as a class action, applies in diversity suits in federal court, despite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding that statutory interest is a \u201cpenalty\u201d under New York law, it held that \u00a7 901(b) prohibited the proposed class action. And, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim (worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in-controversy requirement for indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>vidual suits under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">[559 U.S. 398]</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F.3d 137 (2008). The court did not dispute that a Federal Rule adopted in compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, would control if it conflicted with \u00a7 901(b). But there was no conflict because (as we will describe in more detail below) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b) address different issues. Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 901(b) is \u201csubstantive\u201d within the meaning of <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938), and thus must be applied by federal courts sitting in diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We granted certiorari. 556 U.S. 1220, 129 S. Ct. 2160, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1155 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The framework for our decision is familiar. We must first determine whether Rule 23 answers the question in dispute. <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>480 U.S. 1, 4-5, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1987). If it does, it governs\u2014New York\u2019s law notwithstanding\u2014unless it exceeds statutory authorization or Congress\u2019s rulemaking power. <em>Id., </em>at 5, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1; see <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Plumer, </em>380 U.S. 460, 463-464, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (1965). We do not wade into <em>Erie\u2019s </em>murky waters unless the Federal Rule is inapplicable or invalid. See 380 U.S., at 469-471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove\u2019s suit may proceed as a class action.  Rule 23 provides an answer. It states that \u201c[a] class action may be maintained\u201d if two conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) <em>(i.e., </em>numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this creates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class action. (The Federal Rules regularly use \u201cmay\u201d to confer categorical permission, see, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(d)(2)\u2014(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)-(b), 20(a)(1)-(2), 27(a)(1), 30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">[559 U.S. 399]</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">procedural entitlements, see, <em>e.g., </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all formula for deciding the class-action question. Because \u00a7 901(b) attempts to answer the same <em>question\u2014i.e., </em>it states that Shady Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay <em>not </em>be maintained as a class action\u201d (emphasis added) because of the relief it seeks\u2014it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">The Second Circuit believed that \u00a7 901(b) and Rule 23 do not conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23, it said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether a given class can and should be certified; \u00a7 901(b), on the other hand, addresses an antecedent question: whether the particular type of claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>is eligible for class treatment in the first place\u2014a question on which Rule 23 is silent. See 549 F.3d, at 143-144. Allstate embraces this analysis. Brief for Respondent 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility and certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are preconditions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that eligibility must depend on the \u201cparticular cause of action\u201d asserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, <em>id., </em>at 12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, provide that only claims involving more than a certain number of plaintiffs are \u201celigible\u201d for class treatment in federal court. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)\u2019s prerequisites \u201celigibility criteria\u201d would obviate Allstate\u2019s objection\u2014a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinction is made-to-order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether claims made eligible for class treatment by some <em>other </em>law should be certified as class actions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly nor implicitly empowers a federal court \u201cto certify a class in each and every case\u201d where the Rule\u2019s criteria are met. <em>Id., </em>at 13-14. But that is <em>exactly </em>what Rule 23 does: It says that if the</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">[559 U.S. 400]</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">prescribed preconditions are satisfied \u201c[a] class action <em>may be </em>maintained\u201d (emphasis added)\u2014not \u201ca <em>class action may be permitted.\u201d </em>Courts do not maintain actions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23\u2019s \u201cmay\u201d is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring his claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 <em>automatically </em>applies \u201cin all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See <em>Califano </em>v. <em>Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 699-700, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some federal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach, see, <em>e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(e)(1)(B)\u2014which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule 23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but rather leaves room for laws like \u00a7 901(b). But Congress, unlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an individual rule as it sees fit\u2014either by directly amending the rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in certain instances. Cf. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 654, 668, 116 S. Ct. 1638, 134 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1996). The fact that Congress has created specific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule does not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If Rule 23 did <em>not </em>authorize class actions across the board, the statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Allstate next suggests that the structure of \u00a7 901 shows that Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a), it notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly analogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees <em>that </em>subsection is pre-empted). But \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s rule barring class actions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection, and where it applies, \u00a7 901(a) does not. This shows, according to Allstate, that \u00a7 901(b) concerns a separate subject. Perhaps it does concern a subject separate from the subject of \u00a7 901(a). But the question before us is whether it concerns a subject separate from the subject of <em>Rule </em>23\u2014and for purposes of answering</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">[559 U.S. 401]</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\"><em>that </em>question the way New York has structured its statute is immate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>rial. Rule 23 permits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a State cannot limit that permission by structuring one part of its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part that imposes additional requirements. Both of \u00a7 901\u2019s subsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule 23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit. Cf. <em>Burlington, </em>480 U.S., at 7-8, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The dissent argues that \u00a7 901(b) has nothing to do with whether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class action, but affects only the <em>remedy </em>it may obtain if it wins. See <em>post, </em>at 443-451, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 345-351 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). Whereas \u201cRule 23 governs procedural aspects of class litigation\u201d by \u201cprescrib [ing] the considerations relevant to class certification and postcertification proceedings,\u201d \u00a7 901(b) addresses only \u201cthe size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may pursue.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 446-447, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 347-348. Accordingly, the dissent says, Rule 23 and New York\u2019s law may coexist in peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We need not decide whether a state law that limits the remedies available in an existing class action would conflict with Rule 23; that is not what \u00a7 901(b) does. By its terms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from \u201cmain-tainting]\u201d a class action seeking statutory penalties. Unlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other remedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions, \u00a7 901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may award; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming into existence at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently,</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">[559 U.S. 402]</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">a court bound by \u00a7 901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statutory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in advance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the event the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the statute\u2019s clear prohibition on \u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d such suits as class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s barrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a request for statutory penalties. See <em>post, </em>at 449-450, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 349-350. Even assuming all statutory penalties are waivable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the fact that a complaint omitting them could be brought as a class action would not at all prove that \u00a7 901(b) is addressed only to remedies. If the state law instead banned class actions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff could drop the fraud counts from his complaint and proceed with the remainder in a class action. Yet that would not mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban would affect only the procedural means by which the remedy may be pursued. In short, although the dissent correctly abandons Allstate\u2019s eligibility-certifiability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>distinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of \u00a7 901(b) address the same subject as Rule <em>23\u2014i.e., </em>whether a class action may be maintained\u2014but insists the provision\u2019s <em>purpose </em>is to restrict only remedies. See <em>post, </em>at 447-448, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 348-349; <em>post, </em>at 450, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 349 (\u201c[Wjhile phrased as responsive to the question whether certain class actions may begin, \u00a7 901(b) is unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions must end\u201d). Unlike Rule 23, designed to further procedural fairness and efficiency, \u00a7 901(b) (we are told) \u201cresponds to an entirely different concern\u201d: the fear that allowing statutory damages to be awarded on a classwide basis would \u201cproduce overkill.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 447, 444, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 348, 346 (internal quotation marks omitted). The</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">[559 U.S. 403]</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">dissent reaches this conclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in the law\u2019s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the legislature \u201capparently fear[edj\u201d that combining class actions and statutory penalties \u201ccould result in annihilating punishment of the defendant,\u201d V. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\u2019s Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); (3) a remark by the Governor in his signing statement that \u00a7 901(b) \u201c \u2018provides a controlled remedy,\u2019 \u201d <em>post, </em>at 444, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 346 (quoting Memorandum on Approving L. 1975, Ch. 207, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws, p. 1748; emphasis deleted); and (4) a state court\u2019s statement that the final text of \u00a7 901(b) \u201c \u2018was the result of a compromise among competing interests,\u2019 \u201d <em>post, </em>at 444, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 346 (quoting <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp., </em>8 N.Y.3d 204, 211, 863 N.E.2d 1012, 1015 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">This evidence of the New York Legislature\u2019s purpose is pretty sparse. But even accepting the dissent\u2019s account of the legislature\u2019s objective at face value, it cannot override the statute\u2019s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the remedy a plaintiff can obtain, \u00a7 901(b) achieves that end by limiting a plaintiffs power to maintain a class action. The manner in which the law \u201ccould have been written,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 457, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 354, has no bearing; what matters is the law the legislature <em>did </em>enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our perception of legislative purpose, see <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s concern</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">[559 U.S. 404]</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">for state prerogatives is frustrated rather than fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>thered by revising state laws when a potential conflict with a Federal Rule arises; the state-friendly approach would be to accept the law as written and test the validity of the Federal Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The dissent\u2019s approach of determining whether state and federal rules conflict based on the subjective intentions of the state legislature is an enterprise destined to produce \u201cconfusion worse confounded,\u201d <em>Sibbach </em>v. <em>Wilson &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 1, 14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479 (1941). It would mean, to begin with, that one State\u2019s statute could survive pre-emption (and accordingly affect the procedures in federal court) while another State\u2019s identical law would not, merely because its authors had different aspirations. It would also mean that district courts would have to discern, in every diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively pre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely conflicts with federal law. That task will often prove arduous. Many laws further more than one aim, and the aim of others may be impossible to discern. Moreover, to the extent the dissent\u2019s purpose-driven approach depends on its characterization of \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s aims as substantive, it would apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to procedure. Pleading standards, for example, often embody policy preferences about the types of claims that should succeed\u2014as do rules governing summary judgment, pretrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence. Hard cases will abound. It is not even clear that a state supreme court\u2019s pronouncement of the law\u2019s purpose would settle the issue, since existence of the factual predicate</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">[559 U.S. 405]</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">for avoiding federal preemption is ultimately a federal question. Predictably, federal judges would be condemned to poring through state legislative history\u2014 which may be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less familiar than its federal counterpart, see R. Mersky &amp; D. Dunn, Fundamentals of Legal Research 233 (8th ed. 2002); Torres &amp; Windsor, State Legislative Histories: A Select, Annotated Bibliography, 85 L. Lib. J. 545, 547 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">But while the dissent does indeed artificially narrow the scope of \u00a7 901(b) by finding that it pursues only substantive policies, that is not the central difficulty of the dissent\u2019s position. The central difficulty is that even artificial narrowing cannot render \u00a7 901(b) compatible with Rule 23. <em>Whatever </em>the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict each other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see <em>post, </em>at 438, 446, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 342, 347) that we can (and must) <em>interpret </em>Rule 23 in a manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings\u2014one that would vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>late</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">[559 U.S. 406]</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00a7 2072(b) and another that would not\u2014we would agree. See <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 842, 845, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999); cf. <em>Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>531 U.S. 497, 503-504, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32 (2001). But it is not. Rule 23 unambiguously authorizes <em>any </em>plaintiff, in <em>any </em>federal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the Rule\u2019s prerequisites are met. We cannot contort its text, even to avert a collision with state law that might render it invalid. See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Armco Steel Corp., </em>446 U.S. 740, 750, n. 9, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What the dissent\u2019s approach achieves is not the avoiding of a \u201cconflict between Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b),\u201d <em>post, </em>at 452, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 351, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23 (pursuant to \u00a7 2072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the extent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of \u00a7 901. There is no other way to reach the dissent\u2019s destination. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule 23 falls within the statutory authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Erie </em>involved the constitutional power of federal courts to supplant state law with judge-made rules. In that context, it made no difference whether the rule was technically one of substance or procedure; the touchstone was whether it \u201csignificantly affect[s] the result of a litigation.\u201d <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>York, </em>326 U.S. 99, 109, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2079 (1945). That is not the test for either the constitutionality or the statutory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has undoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted power to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so long as those rules regulate matters \u201crationally capable of classification\u201d as procedure. <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 472, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. In the Rules Enabling</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">[559 U.S. 407]</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Act, Congress authorized this Court to promulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(a), but with the limitation that those rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a7 2072(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">We have long held that this limitation means that the Rule must \u201creally regulat[e] procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them,\u201d <em>Sibbach, </em>312 U.S., at 14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479; see <em>Hanna, supra, </em>at 464, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8; <em>Burlington, </em>480 U.S., at 8, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1. The test is not whether the Rule affects a litigant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>substantive rights; most procedural rules do. <em>Mississippi Publishing Corp. </em>v. <em>Murphree, </em>326 U.S. 438, 445, 66 S. Ct. 242, 90 L. Ed. 185 (1946). What matters is what the Rule itself <em>regulates: </em>If it governs only \u201cthe manner and the means\u201d by which the litigants\u2019 rights are \u201cenforced,\u201d it is valid; if it alters \u201cthe rules of decision by which [the] court will adjudicate [those] rights,\u201d it is not. <em>Id., </em>at 446, 66 S. Ct. 242, 90 L. Ed. 185 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Applying that test, we have rejected every statutory challenge to a Federal Rule that has come before us. We have found to be in compliance with \u00a7 2072(b) Rules prescribing methods for serving process, see <em>id., </em>at 445-446, 66 S. Ct. 242, 90 L. Ed. 185 (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(f)); <em>Hanna, supra, </em>at 463-465, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(d)(1)), and requiring litigants whose mental or physical condition is in dispute to submit to examinations, see <em>Sibbach, supra, </em>at 14-16, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479 (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 35); <em>Schlagenhauf v. Holder, </em>379 U.S. 104, 113-114, 85 S. Ct. 234, 13 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1964) (same). Likewise, we have upheld Rules authorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file frivolous appeals, see <em>Burlington, supra, </em>at 8, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1 (Fed. Rule App. Proc. 38), or who sign court papers without a reasonable inquiry into the facts asserted, see <em>Business Guides, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., </em>498 U.S. 533, 551-554, 111 S. Ct. 922, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1991) (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11). Each of these Rules had some practical effect on the parties\u2019 rights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for enforcing those rights; none altered the rights</p>\n<p id=\"AO1T\">[559 U.S. 408]</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">themselves, the available remedies, or the rules of decision by which the court adjudicated either.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that Rules allowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multiple parties) to be litigated together are also valid. See, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder of parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such Rules neither change plaintiffs\u2019 separate entitlements to relief nor abridge defendants\u2019 rights; they alter only how the claims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23\u2014at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their separate claims against the same defendants in a class action\u2014falls within \u00a7 2072(b)\u2019s authorization. A class action, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a species), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate suits. And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties\u2019 legal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions is not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue on behalf of a class \u201ctransform[s] [the] dispute over a five <em>hundred </em>dollar penalty into a dispute over a five <em>million </em>dollar penalty.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1. Allstate\u2019s aggregate liability, however, does not depend on whether the suit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus members of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowledges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual claim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who would not bring individual suits for the relatively small sums involved will choose to join a class action. That has no bearing, however, on Allstate\u2019s or the plaintiffs\u2019 legal rights. The likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that some (even many) plaintiffs will be induced to sue by the availability of a class action is just the sort of \u201cincidental effec[t]\u201d we have long held does not violate \u00a7 2072(b), <em>Mississippi Publishing, supra, </em>at 445, 66 S. Ct. 242, 90 L. Ed. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Allstate argues that Rule 23 violates \u00a7 2072(b) because the state law it displaces, \u00a7 901(b), creates a right that the Federal</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">[559 U.S. 409]</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Rule abridges\u2014 namely, a \u201csubstantive right . . . not to be subjected to aggregated class-action liability\u201d in a single suit. Brief for Respondent 31. To begin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 901(b) (which is to be found in New York\u2019s procedural code) confines it to claims under New York law; and of course New York has no power to alter substantive rights and duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said, the <em>consequence </em>of excluding certain class actions may be to cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit, but the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect, \u00a7 901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple joinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even if \u00a7 901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted \u201cfor <em>substantive reasons,\u201d id., </em>at 24 (emphasis added). Its end was not to improve \u201cthe conduct of the litigation process itself\u2019 but to alter \u201cthe outcome of that process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is that the substantive nature of New York\u2019s law, or its substantive purpose, <em>makes no difference. </em>A Federal Rule of Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid in others\u2014or valid in some cases and invalid in others\u2014depending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state substantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for substantive purposes). That could not be clearer in <em>Sibbach:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">\u201cThe petitioner says the phrase [\u2018substantive rights\u2019 in the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use Congress intended that in regulating procedure this Court should not deal with important and substantial rights theretofore recognized. Recognized where and by whom? The state courts are divided as to the power in the absence of statute to order a physical examination. In a number such an order is authorized by statute or rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEAB\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"22\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAIcAAAAWAQAAAADCprJBAAAATUlEQVR4nM2QsQ2AMBDE/KnoWIFNGQ1GgSlIwztNhAQSLcKldXJxIXcsPPmhWYEKZFc6qrtaZ9UsCLD13UsnACZguDqLeqinqhkf/tMADCIp1rh6P7kAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"135\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">\u201cThe asserted right, moreover, is no more important than many others enjoyed by litigants in District Courts sitting in the several states, before the Federal Rules</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP-\">[559 U.S. 410]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">of Civil Procedure altered and abolished old rights or privileges and created new ones in connection with the conduct of litigation. ...

Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In sum, it is not the substantive or procedural nature or purpose of the affected state law that matters, but the substantive or procedural nature of the Federal Rule. We have held since <em>Sibbach, </em>and reaffirmed repeatedly, that the validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon whether it regulates procedure. See <em>Sibbach, supra, </em>at 14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479; <em>Hanna, supra, </em>at 464, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8; <em>Burlington, </em>480 U.S., at 8, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1. If it does, it is authorized by \u00a7 2072 and is valid in all jurisdictions, with respect to all claims, regardless of its incidental effect upon state-created rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">A few words in response to the concurrence. We understand it to accept the framework we apply\u2014which requires first, determining whether the federal and state rules can be reconciled (because they answer different questions), and second, if they cannot, determining whether the Federal Rule runs afoul of \u00a7 2072(b). <em>Post, </em>at 421-422, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 331-333 (Stevens, J.,</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">[559 U.S. 411]</p>\n<p id=\"axi-dedup-2\">concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b) conflict, <em>post, </em>at 429-431, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 336-338, and departs from us only with respect to the second part of the test, <em>i.e., </em>whether application of the Federal Rule violates \u00a7 2072(b), <em>post, </em>at 422-428, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 332-336. Like us, it answers no, but for a reason different from ours. Post, at 431-436, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 338-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not that Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it displaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not \u201cfunction as a part of the State\u2019s definition of substantive rights and remedies.\u201d Post, at 416-417, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 329. A state procedural rule is not pre-empted, according to the concurrence, so long as it is \u201cso bound up with,\u201d or \u201csufficiently intertwined with,\u201d a substantive state-law right or remedy \u201cthat it defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 420, 428, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 331, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">This analysis squarely conflicts with <em>Sibbach, </em>which established the rule we apply. The concurrence contends that <em>Sibbach </em>did not rule out its approach, but that is not so. Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on the idiosyncrasies of state law, <em>Sibbach </em>adopted and applied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal Rule \u201creally regulates procedure.\u201d 312 U.S., at 14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That the</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">[559 U.S. 412]</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">concurrence\u2019s approach would have yielded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the same result in <em>Sibbach </em>proves nothing; what matters is the rule we <em>did </em>apply, and that rule leaves no room for special exemptions based on the function or purpose of a particular state rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have rejected an attempt to read into <em>Sibbach </em>an exception with no basis in the opinion, see <em>Schlagenhauf, </em>379 U.S., at 113-114, 85 S. Ct. 234, 13 L. Ed. 2d 152, and we see no reason to find such an implied limitation today.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply <em>Sibbach, </em>but to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it). Its approach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the statutory text prohibiting the Federal Rules from \u201cabridging], enlarging], or modifying] any substantive right,\u201d \u00a7 2072(b). See <em>post, </em>at 424-425, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 333-334. There is something to that. It is possible to understand how it can be determined whether a Federal Rule \u201cenlarges\u201d substantive rights without consulting state law: If the Rule creates a substantive right, even one that duplicates some state-created rights, it establishes a new <em>federal </em>right. But it is hard to understand how it can be determined whether a Federal Rule \u201cabridges\u201d or \u201cmodifies\u201d substantive rights without knowing what state-created rights would obtain if the Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AI99\">[559 U.S. 413]</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">exclusive focus on the challenged Federal Rule\u2014driven by the very real concern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State would be chaos, see 312 U.S., at 13-14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479\u2014is hard to square with \u00a7 2072(b)\u2019s terms.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\"><em>Sibbach </em>has been settled law, however, for nearly seven decades.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Setting aside any precedent requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cspecial justification\u201d beyond a bare belief that it was wrong. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em>491 U.S. 164, 172, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). And a party seeking to</p>\n<p id=\"ApHB\">[559 U.S. 414]</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">overturn a <em>statutory </em>precedent bears an even greater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us, <em>ibid., </em>and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see, <em>e.g., Finley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>490 U.S. 545, 556, 109 S. Ct. 2003, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1989); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367; <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. </em>v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc., </em>545 U.S. 546, 558, 125 S. Ct. 2611, 162 L. Ed. 2d 502 (2005). We do Congress no service by presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate has not even asked us to overrule <em>Sibbach, </em>let alone carried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. <em>IBP, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>546 U.S. 21, 32, 126 S. Ct. 514, 163 L. Ed. 2d 288 (2005). Why we should cast aside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since (as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The concurrence also contends that applying <em>Sibbach </em>and assessing whether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure is not always easy. See <em>post, </em>at 426, n. 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 335. Undoubtedly some hard cases will arise (though we have managed to muddle through well enough in the 69 years since</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">[559 U.S. 415]</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\"><em>Sibbach </em>was decided). But as the concurrence acknowledges, <em>post, </em>at 426, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 334-335, the basic difficulty is unavoidable: The statute itself refers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>to \u201csubstantive right[s],\u201d \u00a7 2072(b), so there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinction. What is more, the concurrence\u2019s approach does nothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it many times over. Instead of a single hard question whether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure, that approach will present hundreds of hard questions, forcing federal courts to assess the substantive or procedural character of countless state rules that may conflict with a single Federal Rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And it still does not sidestep the problem it seeks to avoid. At the end of the day, one must come face to face with the decision whether or not the state policy (with which a putatively procedural state rule may be \u201cbound up\u201d) pertains to a \u201csubstantive right or remedy,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 433, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 339\u2014that is, whether it is substance or procedure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The more one explores the alternatives to <em>Sib-bach\u2019s </em>rule, the more its wisdom becomes apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We must acknowledge the reality that keeping the federal-court door open to class actions that cannot proceed in state court will produce forum shopping. That is unacceptable</p>\n<p id=\"Ai5c\">[559 U.S. 416]</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules created to fill supposed \u201cgaps\u201d in positive federal law. See <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471-472, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. For where neither the Constitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of decision or authorizes a federal court to supply one, \u201cstate law must govern because there can be no other law.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see Clark, <em>Erie\u2019s </em>Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1289, 1302, 1311 (2007). But divergence from state law, with the attendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable (indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform system of federal procedure. Congress itself has created the possibility that the same case may follow a different course if filed in federal instead of state court. Cf. <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 472-473, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. The short of the matter is that  a Federal Rule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters the outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shopping. To hold otherwise would be to \u201cdisembowel either the Constitution\u2019s grant of power over federal procedure\u201d or Congress\u2019s exercise of it. <em>Id., </em>at 473-474, 85 S.

See, <em>e.g., </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(f)(2)(B); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal Rules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case of a conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\">.

Ed. 2d, at 344, 349, is not to the contrary. There we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is \u201c \u2018commenced\u2019 \u201d by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a state law providing that \u201c \u2018[a]n action shall be deemed commenced, <em>within the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], </em>as to each defendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . \u201d 446 U.S., at 743, n. 4, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, \u00a7 97 (1971); alteration in original; emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, \u201cgoverns the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations\u2019\u2019 or tolling rules, which it did not \u201cpurpor[t] to displace.\u2019\u2019 446 U.S., at 751, 750, 100 S.

Ed. 2d, at 335-336. Had <em>Sibbach </em>been applying the concurrence\u2019s theory, that is quite true\u2014which demonstrates how inconsistent that theory is with <em>Sibbach. </em>For conformity with the Rules Enabling Act was the <em>very issue Sibbach </em>decided: The petitioner\u2019s position was that Rules 35 and 37 exceeded the Enabling Act\u2019s authorization, 312 U.S., at 9, 13, 61 S.

There could not be a clearer rejection of the theory that the concurrence now advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">The concurrence responds that \u201cthe specific question of \u2018the obligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state\u2019\u201d was not before the Court, <em>post, </em>at 427, 176 L.

It is clear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the <em>Erie </em>prohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. See <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938). The opinion unquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules\u2019 compliance with \u00a7 2072(b), and it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question, which does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule abridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U.S., at 13-14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479. To the extent <em>Sibbach </em>did not address the Federal Rules\u2019 validity vis-\u00e1-vis contrary state law, <em>Hanna </em>surely did, see 380 U.S., at 472, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8, and it made clear that <em>Sibbach's </em>test still controls, see 380 U.S., at 464-465, 470-471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\">. The concurrence insists that we have misread <em>Sibbach, </em>since surely a Federal Rule that \u201cin most cases\u2019\u2019 regulates procedure does not do so when it displaces one of those \u201crare\u201d state substantive laws that are disguised as rules of procedure. <em>Post, </em>at 428, n. 13, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 336. This mistakes what the Federal Rule <em>regulates </em>for its incidental <em>effects. </em>As we have explained, <em>supra, </em>at 406-408, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 322-324, most Rules have some effect on litigants\u2019 substantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not mean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">. The concurrence\u2019s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the statute\u2019s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgment or modification only of \u201csubstantive rights,\u2019\u2019 but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption of \u201cprocedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a substantive right or remedy,\u2019\u2019 <em>post, </em>at 433, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 339. This would allow States to force a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as they are \u201csufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.\u2019\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 428, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 336.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\">. The concurrence implies that <em>Sibbach </em>has slipped into desuetude, apparently for lack of sufficient citations. See <em>post, </em>at 428-429, n. 14, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 336-337. We are unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if the case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event, the concurrence\u2019s account of our shunning of <em>Sibbach </em>is greatly exaggerated. <em>Hanna </em>did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as establishing the governing rule. 380 U.S., at 464-465, 470-471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. <em>Mississippi Publishing Corp. </em>v. <em>Murphree, </em>326 U.S. 438, 445-446, 66 S. Ct. 242, 90 L. Ed. 185 (1946), likewise cited <em>Sibbach </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>applied the same test, examining the Federal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>480 U.S. 1, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1987), and for that matter <em>Business Guides, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., </em>498 U.S. 533, 111 S. Ct. 922, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1991), did not cite <em>Sibbach. </em>But both cited and followed Hanna\u2014which as noted held out <em>Sibbach </em>as setting forth the governing rule. See <em>Burlington Northern, supra, </em>at 5-6, 8, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1; <em>Business Guides, supra, </em>at 552-554, 111 S. Ct. 922, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1140. Thus, while <em>Sibbach </em>itself may appear infrequently in the U. S. Reports, its rule\u2014and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule as the proper unit of analysis\u2014is alive and well.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In contrast, <em>Hanna's </em>obscure <em>obiter dictum </em>that a court \u201cneed not wholly blind itself\u2019 to a Federal Rule\u2019s effect on a case\u2019s outcome, 380 U.S., at 473, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8\u2014which the concurrence invokes twice, <em>post, </em>at 423, 428-429, n. 14, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 333, 336-337\u2014has never resurfaced in our opinions in the 45 years since its first unfortunate utterance. Nor does it cast doubt on <em>Sibbach's </em>straightforward test: As the concurrence notes, <em>Hanna </em>cited <em>Sibbach </em>for that statement, 380 U.S., at 473, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8, showing it saw no inconsistency between the two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\">. The concurrence is correct, <em>post, </em>at 425, n. 9, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 334-335, that under our disposition any rule that \u201creally regulates procedure,\u2019\u2019 <em>Sibbach, </em>312 U.S., at 14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479, will pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however \u201cbound up\u2019\u2019 the latter is with substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that result proves our interpretation of \u00a7 2072(b) implausible, <em>post, </em>at 425-426, n. 9, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 334-335. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term \u201csubstantive rights\u2019\u2019 in \u00a7 2072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but also any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the text nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The examples the concurrence offers\u2014statutes of limitations, burdens of proof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards\u2014do not make its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They merely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine whether a rule \u201creally regulates\u2019\u2019 procedure or substance. If one concludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal Rule itself is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">The concurrence\u2019s concern would make more sense if many Federal Rules that effectively alter state-law rights \u201cbound up with procedures\u2019\u2019 would survive under <em>Sibbach. </em>But as the concurrence concedes, <em>post, </em>at 426, n. 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 335, very few would do so. The possible existence of a few outlier instances does not prove <em>Sibbach's </em>interpretation is absurd. Congress may well have accepted such anomalies as the price of a uniform system of federal procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\">. The concurrence argues that its approach is no more \u201ctaxing\u201d than ours because few if any Federal Rules that are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under the Enabling Act will fail the concurrence\u2019s test. <em>Post, </em>at 426, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 334-335, and n. 10. But that conclusion will be reached only after federal courts have considered hundreds of state rules applying the concurrence\u2019s inscrutable standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\">. The concurrence insists that the task will be easier if courts can \u201cconside[r] the nature and functions of the state law,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 426, n. 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 335, regardless of the law\u2019s \u201cform,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 419, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 330 (emphasis deleted), <em>i.e., </em>what the law actually says. We think that amorphous inquiry into the \u201cnature and functions\u201d of a state law will tend to increase, rather than decrease, the difficulty of classifying Federal Rules as substantive or procedural. Walking through the concurrence\u2019s application of its test to \u00a7 901(b), <em>post, </em>at 431-436, 176 L.

Accordingly, I agree with Justice Scalia that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 must apply in this case and join Parts I and II-A of the Court\u2019s opinion. But I also agree with Justice Ginsburg that there are some state procedural rules that federal courts must apply in diversity cases because they function</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">[559 U.S. 417]</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">as a part of the State\u2019s definition of substantive rights and remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">It is a long-recognized principle that federal courts sitting in diversity \u201capply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\u201d <em>Hanna </em>v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 465, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (1965).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This principle is governed by a statutory framework, and the way that it is administered varies depending upon whether there is a federal rule addressed to the matter. See id., at 469-472, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659. If no federal rule applies, a federal court must follow the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652, and make the \u201crelatively unguided <em>Erie </em>choice,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8, to determine whether the state law is the \u201crule of decision.\u201d But when a situation is covered by a federal rule, the Rules of Decision Act inquiry by its own terms does not apply. See \u00a7 1652; <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. Instead, the Rules Enabling Act (Enabling Act) controls. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">That does not mean, however, that the federal rule always governs. Congress has provided for a system of uniform federal rules, see <em>ibid.., </em>under which federal courts sitting in diversity operate as \u201can independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Byrd </em>v. <em>Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., </em>356 U.S. 525, 537, 78 S. Ct. 893, 2 L. Ed. 2d 953 (1958), and not as state-court clones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are managed by Article III judges. See <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 473-474, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. But while Congress</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">[559 U.S. 418]</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">may have the constitutional power to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with state substantive law in any number of respects, that is not what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in the Enabling Act that although \u201c [t]he Supreme Court\u201d may \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\u201d \u00a7 2072(a), those rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a7 2072(b). Therefore, \u201c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, . . . the court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule\u201d unless doing so would violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the Act or the Constitution. <em>Id., </em>at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Although the Enabling Act and the Rules of Decision Act \u201csay, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state \u2018substantive\u2019 law and federal \u2018procedural\u2019 law,\u201d the inquiries are not the same. <em>Ibid..; </em>see also <em>id., </em>at 469-470, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. The Enabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in the \u201crelatively unguided <em>Erie </em>choice,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8, but instead instructs only that federal rules cannot \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a7 2072(b). The Enabling Act\u2019s limitation does not mean that federal rules cannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that federal rules cannot displace a State\u2019s definition of its own rights or remedies. See <em>Sibbach </em>v. <em>Wilson &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 1, 13-14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479 (1941) (reasoning that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantive rights\u2019 \u201d embraces only those state rights that are sought to be enforced in the judicial proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Congress has thus struck a balance: \u201c [Housekeeping rules for federal courts\u201d will generally apply in diversity cases, notwithstanding that some federal rules \u201cwill inevitably differ\u201d from state rules. <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 473, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. But not every federal \u201crul[e] of practice or procedure,\u201d \u00a7 2072(a), will displace state law. To the contrary, federal rules must be interpreted with some degree of \u201csensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies,\u201d <em>Gasperini </em>v. <em>Center for Humanities, Inc., </em>518 U.S. 415, 427, n. 7, 116 S.

Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. This can be a tricky balance to implement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is important to observe that the balance Congress has struck turns, in part, on the nature of the state law that is being displaced by a federal rule. And in my view, the application of that balance does not necessarily turn on whether the state law at issue takes the <em>form </em>of what is traditionally described as substantive or procedural. Rather, it turns on whether the state law actually is part of a State\u2019s framework of substantive rights or remedies. See \u00a7 2072(b); cf. <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471, 85 S.

Such laws, for example, may be seemingly procedural rules that make it significantly more difficult to bring or to prove a claim, thus serving to limit the scope of that claim. See, <em>e.g., Cohen, </em>337 U.S., at 555, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (state \u201cprocedure\u201d that required plaintiffs to post bond before suing); <em>Guaranty Trust Co., </em>326 U.S. 99, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L.

And were federal courts to ignore those portions of substantive state law that operate as procedural devices, it could in many instances limit the ways that sovereign States may define their rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a traditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the scope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts must recognize and respect that choice. Cf. <em>Ragan </em>v. <em>Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., </em>337 U.S. 530, 533, 69 S. Ct. 1233, 93 L.

See <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>480 U.S. 1, 4-5, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1987); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Armco Steel Corp., </em>446 U.S. 740, 749-750, and n. 9, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate alongside the state rule, then there is no \u201cAc[t] of Congress\u201d governing that particular question, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules of Decision Act inquiry under <em>Erie </em>and its progeny. In some instances, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a federal rule will not come into \u201c \u2018direct collision\u2019 \u201d with the state law, and both can operate. <em>Walker, </em>446 U.S., at 750, n. 9, 749, 100 S.

Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659, the court must decide whether application of the federal rule \u201crepresents a valid exercise\u201d of the \u201crulemaking authority . . . bestowed on this Court by the Rules Enabling Act,\u201d <em>Burlington Northern R. Co., </em>480 U.S., at 5, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1; see also <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 427, n. 7, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659; <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471-474, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. The Enabling Act requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that federal rules \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or modify <em>any </em>substantive right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b) (emphasis added). Unlike Justice Scalia, I believe that an application of a federal rule that effectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created right or remedy violates this command. Congress may have the constitutional power \u201cto supplant state law\u201d with rules that are \u201crationally capable of classification as procedure,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 406, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 322 (internal quotation marks omitted), but we should generally presume that it has not done so. Cf. <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>555 U.S. 555, 565, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (2009) (observing that \u201cwe start with the assumption\u201d that a federal statute does not displace a State\u2019s law \u201cunless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that federal rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right\u201d evinces the opposite intent, as does Congress\u2019 decision to delegate the creation of rules to this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back into the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge, enlarge,</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">[559 U.S. 423]</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">or modify a substantive right, federal courts must consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible result. See, <em>e.g., Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>531 U.S. 497, 503, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32 (2001) (avoiding an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) that \u201cwould arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act\u201d contained in \u00a7 2072(b)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And when such a \u201csaving\u201d construction is not possible and the rule would violate the Enabling Act, federal courts cannot apply the rule. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b) (mandating that federal rules \u201cshall not\u201d alter <em>\u201cany </em>substantive right\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 473, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (\u201c[A] court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the Enabling Act. . . , need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts\u201d); see also <em>Semtek Int\u2019l Inc., </em>531 U.S., at 503-504, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32 (noting that if state law granted a particular right, \u201cthe federal court\u2019s extinguishment of that right . . . would seem to violate [\u00a7 2072(b)]\u201d); cf.

A federal rule, therefore, cannot govern a particular case in which the rule would displace a state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the state-created right. And absent a governing federal rule, a federal court must engage in the traditional Rules of Decision Act inquiry, under the <em>Erie </em>line</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">[559 U.S. 424]</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">of cases. This application of the Enabling Act shows \u201csensitivity to important state interests,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 442, 176 L.

Ed. 2d, at 342, but it does so as Congress authorized, by ensuring that federal rules that ordinarily \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\u201d \u00a7 2072(a), do \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a7 2072(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Justice Scalia believes that the sole Enabling Act question is whether the federal rule \u201creally regulates procedure,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 407, 410, 411, 414, n. 13, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 322, 324, 325, 327 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), which means, apparently, whether it regulates \u201cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\u2019 rights are enforced,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 407, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 323 (internal quotation marks omitted). I respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>fully disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This interpretation of the Enabling Act is consonant with the Act\u2019s first limitation to \u201cgeneral rules of practice and procedure,\u201d \u00a7 2072(a). But it ignores the second limitation that such rules also \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or modify <em>any </em>substantive right,\u201d \u00a7 2072(b) (emphasis added),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in so doing ignores the balance that</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">[559 U.S. 425]</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Congress struck between uniform rules of federal procedure and respect for a State\u2019s construction of its own rights and remedies. It also ignores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright \u00a7 4509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see <em>Wyeth, </em>555 U.S., at 565, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51, that counsel against judicially created rules displacing state substantive law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">[559 U.S. 426]</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Although the plurality appears to agree with much of my interpretation of \u00a7 2072, see <em>ante, </em>at 412-413, 176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>L. Ed. 2d, at 326, it nonetheless rejects that approach for two reasons, both of which are mistaken. First, Justice Scalia worries that if federal courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state law, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determinations about whether application of a given rule would displace a state determination about substantive rights. See <em>ante, </em>at 409, 414-415, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 324, 327-328, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an Enabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is more taxing than Justice Sca-lia\u2019s.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But in any event, that inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it may not be easy to decide what is actually a \u201csubstantive right,\u201d \u201cthe designations substantive and procedural become important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.\u201d Ely 723; see also Wright \u00a7 4509, at 266. The question, therefore, is not what rule <em>we </em>think would be easiest on federal courts. The question is what rule Congress established. Although Justice Scalia may generally prefer easily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does not give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of the Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and context in the service of simplicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">[559 U.S. 427]</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Second, the plurality argues that its interpretation of the Enabling Act is dictated by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sibbach, </em>which applied a Federal Rule about when parties must submit to medical examinations. But the plurality misreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in <em>Hanna, </em>\u201cshorthand formulations which have appeared in earlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that frequently arise from oversimplification.\u201d 380 U.S., at 475, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (concurring opinion). To understand <em>Sibbach, </em>it is first necessary to understand the issue that was before the Court. The petitioner raised only the facial question whether \u201cRules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this court\u201d and not the specific question of \u201cthe obligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 312 U.S., at 9, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to consider whether the particular application of the Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>eral Rules in question would offend the Enabling Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">[559 U.S. 428]</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Nor, in <em>Sibbach, </em>was any further analysis necessary to the resolution of the case because the matter at issue, requiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to \u201csubstantive rights\u201d under the Enabling Act. Although most state rules bearing on the litigation process are adopted for some policy reason, few seemingly \u201cprocedural\u201d rules define the scope of a substantive right or remedy. The matter at issue in <em>Sibbach </em>reflected competing federal and state judgments about privacy interests. Those privacy concerns may have been weighty and in some sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the scope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litigation. Thus, in response to the petitioner\u2019s argument in <em>Sibbach </em>that \u201csubstantive rights\u201d include not only \u201crights sought to be adjudicated by the litigants\u201d but also \u201cgeneral prin-cipi\u00e9is]\u201d or \u201cquestion[s] of public policy that the legislature is able to pass upon,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 2-3, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479, we held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantive rights\u2019 \u201d embraces only state rights, such as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be enforced in the judicial proceedings, <em>id,, </em>at 13-14, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479. If the Federal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then perhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been different.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">[559 U.S. 429]</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Justice Ginsburg views the basic issue in this case as whether and how to apply a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to join plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that \u201cdefines the dimensions\u201d of a state-created claim dictates the opposite answer. <em>Post, </em>at 447, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 348. As explained above, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>readily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state rule that is \u201c \u2018procedural\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the term,\u201d <em>S. A. Healy Co., </em>60 F.3d, at 310, but sufficiently interwoven with the scope of a substantive right or remedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the federal rule would have to give way. In my view, however, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\n<em>Rule 23 Controls Class Certification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMFt\">When the District Court in the case before us was asked to certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 squarely governed the determination whether the court</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1X\">[559 U.S. 430]</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">should do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule 23, therefore, must apply unless its application would abridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I understand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does <em>not </em>govern the question of class certification in this matter because New York has made a substantive judgment that such a class should not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages. Although, as discussed <em>infra, </em>at 432-435, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 338-340, I do not accept the dissent\u2019s view of \u00a7 901(b), I also do not see how the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> I agree with Justice Ginsburg that courts should \u201cavoi[d] immoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that would trench on state prerogatives,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 439, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 343, and should in some instances \u201cinterpret the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>post, </em>at 441, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 344 (internal quotation marks omitted). But that is not what the dissent</p>\n<p id=\"A9pv\">[559 U.S. 431]</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">has done. Simply because a rule should be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not follow that courts may rewrite the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">At bottom, the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 seems to be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its application would create no <em>Erie </em>problem. The dissent would apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under <em>Erie </em>even to cases in which there is a governing federal rule, and thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But \u201c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided <em>Erie </em>choice.\u201d <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. The question is only whether the Enabling Act is satisfied. Although it reflects a laudable concern to protect \u201cstate regulatory policies,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 441, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 344 (internal quotation marks omitted), Justice Ginsburg\u2019s approach would, in my view, work an end run around Congress\u2019 system of uniform federal rules, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, and our decision in <em>Hanna. </em>Federal courts can and should interpret federal rules with sensitivity to \u201cstate prerogatives,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 439, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 343; but even when \u201cstate interests . . . warrant our respectful consideration,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 443, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 345, federal courts cannot rewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly that \u00a7 901(b) is substantive and that class certification should be denied, then they should argue within the Enabling Act\u2019s framework. Otherwise, \u201cthe Federal Rule applies regardless of contrary state law.\u201d <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 427, n. 7, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659; accord, <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\n<em>Applying Rule 23 Does Not Violate the Enabling Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">As I have explained, in considering whether to certify a class action such as this one, a federal court must inquire whether doing so would abridge, enlarge, or modify New York\u2019s rights or remedies, and thereby violate the Enabling Act. This inquiry is not always a simple one because \u201c [i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that cannot have</p>\n<p id=\"A8JZ\">[559 U.S. 432]</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">a significant effect on the outcome of a case,\u201d Wright \u00a7 4508, at 232-233, and almost \u201cany rule can be said to have . . . \u2018substantive effects,\u2019 affecting society\u2019s distribution of risks and rewards,\u201d Ely 724, n. 170. Faced with a federal rule that dictates an answer to a traditionally procedural question and that displaces a state rule, one can often argue that the state rule was <em>really </em>some part of the State\u2019s definition of its rights or remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling Act problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law is designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a judgment about how state courts ought to operate and not a judgment about the scope of state-created rights and remedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal court system, there are costs involved in attempting to discover the true nature of a state procedural rule and allowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule that appears to govern the same question. The mere possibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created right is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">The text of CPLR \u00a7 901(b) expressly and unambiguously applies not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to claims based on New York law but also to claims based on federal law or the law of any other State. And there is no interpretation from New York courts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how \u00a7 901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though procedural in form, serves the function of defining New York\u2019s rights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because lawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal class actions well before New York passed \u00a7 901(b) in 1975, and New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is true, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited amount of legislative history that can be read to suggest that the New York officials who supported \u00a7 901(b) wished to create a \u201climitation\u201d on New York\u2019s \u201cstatutory damages.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 443, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 345. But, as Justice Scalia</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">[559 U.S. 433]</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">notes, that is not the law that New York adopted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>ante, </em>at 402-403, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 319-320 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly describe a judgment that \u00a7 901(b) would operate as a limitation on New York\u2019s statutory damages. In evaluating that legislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between procedural rules adopted for <em>some </em>policy reason and seemingly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost every rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect on the outcome of litigation, not every state rule \u201cdefines the dimensions</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">[559 U.S. 434]</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">of [a] claim itself,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 447, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 348. New York clearly crafted \u00a7 901(b) with the intent that only certain lawsuits\u2014those for which there were not statutory penalties\u2014could be joined in class actions in New York courts. That decision reflects a policy judgment about which lawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class form and which should not. As Justice Ginsburg carefully outlines, see <em>post, </em>at 443-445, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 345-347, \u00a7 901(b) was \u201capparently\u201d adopted in response to fears that the class-action procedure, applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>statutory penalties, would lead to \u201cannihilating punishment of the defendant.\u201d V. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C901:ll, reprinted in 7B McKinney\u2019s Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp., </em>8 N.Y.3d 204, 211, 863 N.E.2d 1012, 1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not particularly strong evidence that \u00a7 901(b) serves to define who can obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a class would enlarge New York\u2019s remedy. Any device that makes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some opponents of a broad class-action device \u201cargued that there was no <em>need </em>to permit class actions in order to encourage litigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an aggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to pursue a claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 211, 863 N.E.2d, at 1015 (emphasis added). But those opponents may have felt merely that, for any number of reasons, New York courts should not conduct trials in the class format when that format is unnecessary to motivate litigation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Justice Ginsburg asserts that this could not</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">[559 U.S. 435]</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">be true because \u201csuits seeking statutory damages are arguably <em>best </em>suited to the class device because individual proof of actual damages is unnecessary.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 445, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 346. But some people believe that class actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as they join together slightly disparate claims or force courts to adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss the possibility that New York legislators shared in those beliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when it appeared to be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The legislative history of \u00a7 901 thus reveals a classically procedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims in New York courts (under any source of law) only when it is necessary to do so, and not making it <em>too </em>easy when the class tool is not required. This is the same sort of calculation that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for briefs. There is of course a difference of degree between those examples and class certification, but not a difference of kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical effect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but that does not transform it into a damages \u201cproscription,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 447, n. 6, 456, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 348, 353, or \u201climitation,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 443, and n. 2, 444, 447, 459, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 345, 346, 348, 355.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The difference of degree is relevant to the forum shopping considerations that are part of the Rules of Decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Act or <em>Erie </em>inquiry. If the applicable federal rule did not govern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly read not to do so), then those considerations would matter, for precisely the reasons given by the dissent. See <em>post, </em>at 452-458, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 351-355.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">[559 U.S. 436]</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">But that is not <em>this </em>case. As the Court explained in <em>Hanna, </em>it is an \u201cincorrect assumption that the rule of <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins </em>constitutes the appropriate test of . . . the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.\u201d 380 U.S., at 469-470, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. \u201cIt is true that both the Enabling Act and the <em>Erie </em>rule say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state \u2018substantive\u2019 law and federal \u2018procedural\u2019 law,\u201d but the tests are different and reflect the fact that \u201cthey were designed to control very different sorts of decisions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only decision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case would \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify\u201d New York\u2019s substantive rights or remedies. \u00a7 2072(b). Although one can argue that class certification would enlarge New York\u2019s \u201climited\u201d damages remedy, see <em>post, </em>at 443, and n. 2, 444, 447, 459, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 345, 346, 348, 355, such arguments rest on extensive speculation about what the New York Legislature had in mind when it created \u00a7 901(b). But given that there are two plausible competing narratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect the plain textual reading of \u00a7 901(b), a rule in New York\u2019s procedural code about when to certify class actions brought under any source of law, and respect Congress\u2019 decision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal courts. In order to displace a federal rule, there must be more than just a possibility that the state rule is different than it appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Accordingly, I concur in part and concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-14\">.

Justice Scalia concedes as much, see <em>ante, </em>at 412-413, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 326, but argues that insofar as I allow for the possibility that a federal rule might violate the Enabling Act when it displaces a seemingly procedural state rule, my approach is itself \u201cunfaithful to the statute\u2019s terms,\u2019\u2019 which cover \u201csubstantive rights\u2019\u2019 but not \u201cprocedural rules,\u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 413, n. 11, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 326 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not an objection to my interpretation of the Enabling Act\u2014that courts must look to whether a federal rule alters substantive rights in a given case\u2014but simply to the way I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that regulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might actually define a substantive right. Justice Scalia\u2019s objection, moreover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears procedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on appeal may really be a damages cap. See <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 427, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659. A rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really be a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress. A rule that a claim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a definition of the scope of the claim. These are the sorts of rules that one might describe as \u201cprocedural,\u201d but they nonetheless define substantive rights. Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the federal rule would have altered the State\u2019s \u201csubstantive rights.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b422-11\">. The plurality\u2019s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean that no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State\u2019s own rights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate \u201cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\u2019 rights are enforced,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 407, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 323 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are many ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State\u2019s formulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations, although in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a temporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to promulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in some instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Similarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could eviscerate a critical aspect\u2014albeit one that deals with <em>how </em>a right is enforced\u2014of a State\u2019s framework of rights and remedies. Or if a federal rule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages are reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state damages cap.

It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072 will displace a State\u2019s definition of its own substantive rights. See Wright \u00a7 4509, at 272 (observing that \u201cunusual cases occasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state rule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state substantive rights\u2019\u2019). Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation, moreover, is not much more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts\u2019 having to evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal rule is really \u201cprocedural.\u2019\u2019 It is hard to know the answer to that question and especially hard to resolve it without considering the nature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.

Ed. 2d, at 348, 353, whereas Rule 23 \u201cdoes not command that a particular remedy be available when a party sues in a representative capacity,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 446, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 347, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the dissent\u2019s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question whether petitioner may certify a class, and \u00a7 901(b) would be relevant only to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action lawsuit, may collect statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">It may be that if the dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 901(b) were correct, this class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the federal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(6). But that issue was not raised in respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss (from which the case comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the Court. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has \u201cacknowledged that its individual claim\u201d is for less than the required amount in controversy, see 549 F.3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what actual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court were to adopt all of the dissent\u2019s premises, I believe the correct disposition would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of whether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b427-11\">. In its <em>Erie </em>analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns create laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws will apply only within their territory. See <em>post, </em>at 453-454, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 351-352. That is a true fact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent\u2019s position. For one thing, as the dissent observes, this <em>Erie </em>analysis is relevant only if there is no conflict between Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b), and the court can thus apply both. <em>Post, </em>at 451, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 350-351. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the only question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. And that inquiry is different from the Rules of Decision Act, or <em>Erie, </em>inquiry. See 380 U.S., at 469-471, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">The dissent\u2019s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when interpreting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that laws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending upon, <em>inter alia, </em>whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume that \u201cthe character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,\u2019\u2019 <em>American Banana Co. </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co., </em>213 U.S. 347, 356, 29 S. Ct. 511, 53 L. Ed. 826 (1909). But in the context of \u00a7 901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes little sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing what people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed to the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts. Thus, \u00a7 901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it states that it governs <em>New York </em>courts. It is possible that the New York Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear claims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims under New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had written a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up \u00a7 901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong presumption is to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">. To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature would create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply only when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a lawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to see how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York\u2019s penalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or individual, and that \u00a7 901(b) addresses penalties that are created under any source of state or federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b428-11\">. Justice Ginsburg asserts that class certification in this matter would \u201ctransform a $500 case into a $5 million award.\u2019\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 436, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 341. But in fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one $5 million case. It may be that without class certification, not all of the potential plaintiffs would bring their cases. But that is true of any procedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located courthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other features of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b429-9\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"A2x4\">with whom Justice Kennedy, Justice Breyer, and Justice Alito join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The Court today approves Shady Grove\u2019s attempt to transform a $500 case into a $5 million award, although the State creating the right to recover has proscribed this alchemy. If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state court, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York Ins. Law Ann. \u00a7 5106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for overdue benefits would, by Shady Grove\u2019s own measure, amount to no more than</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">[559 U.S. 437]</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">$500. By instead filing in federal court based on the parties\u2019 diverse citizenship and requesting class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for the class, statutory damages of more than $5 million. The New York Legislature has barred this remedy, instructing that, unless specifically permitted, \u201can action to recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \u00a7 901(b) (West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures for the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts the application of \u00a7 901(b) in diversity suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New York\u2019s restriction on the availability of statutory damages. Our decisions, however, caution us to ask, before undermining state legislation: Is this conflict really necessary? Cf. Traynor, Is This Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>flict Really Necessary? 37 Texas L. Rev. 657 (1959). Had the Court engaged in that inquiry, it would not have read Rule 23 to collide with New York\u2019s legitimate interest in keeping certain monetary awards reasonably bounded. I would continue to interpret Federal Rules with awareness of, and sensitivity to, important state regulatory policies. Because today\u2019s judgment radically departs from that course, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u201cUnder the <em>Erie </em>doctrine,\u201d it is long settled, \u201cfederal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\u201d <em>Gasperini </em>v. <em>Center for Humanities, Inc., </em>518 U.S. 415, 427, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1996); see <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938). Justice Harlan aptly conveyed the importance of the doctrine; he described <em>Erie </em>as \u201cone of the modern cornerstones of our federalism, expressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of judicial power between the state and federal systems.\u201d <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Plumer,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">[559 U.S. 438]</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">380 U.S. 460, 474, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (1965) (concurring opinion). Although we have found <em>Erie\u2019s </em>application \u201csometimes [to be] a challenging endeavor,\u201d <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 427, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659, two federal statutes mark our way.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The first, the Rules of Decision Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits federal courts from generating substantive law in diversity actions. See <em>Erie, </em>304 U.S., at 78, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188. Originally enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a policy of prime importance to our federal system. We have therefore applied the Act \u201cwith an eye alert to . . . avoiding disregard of State law.\u201d <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>York, </em>326 U.S. 99, 110, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2079 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934, authorizes us to \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u201d for the federal courts, but with a crucial restriction: \u201cSuch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072. Pursuant to this statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, including, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the limits on our authority. See, <em>e.g., Ortiz </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 845, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act counsels against \u201cadventurous application\u201d of Rule 23; any tension with the Act \u201cis best kept within tolerable limits.\u201d); <em>Amchem Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 612-613, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997). See also <em>Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed. Martin Corp., </em>531 U.S. 497, 503-504, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts with state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with the Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 469-474, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. If, however, no Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted</p>\n<p id=\"AtgQ\">[559 U.S. 439]</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">in <em>Erie, </em>controls. That Act directs federal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when failure to do so would invite forum shopping and yield markedly disparate litigation outcomes. See <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 428, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659; <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 468, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. Recognizing that the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act simultaneously frame and inform the <em>Erie </em>analysis, we have endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within the bounds of both congressional directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In our prior decisions in point, many of them not mentioned in the Court\u2019s opinion, we have avoided immoderate interpretations of the Federal Rules that would trench on state prerogatives without serving any countervailing federal interest. \u201cApplication of the <em>Hanna </em>analysis,\u201d we have said, \u201cis premised on a \u2018direct collision\u2019 between the Federal Rule and the state law.\u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Armco Steel Corp., </em>446 U.S. 740, 749-750, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1980) (quoting <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 472, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8). To displace state law, a Federal Rule, \u201cwhen fairly construed,\u201d must be \u201c \u2018sufficiently broad\u2019 \u201d so as \u201cto \u2018control the issue\u2019 before the court, thereby leaving <em>no room </em>for the operation of that law.\u201d <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>480 U.S. 1, 4-5, 107 S. Ct. 967, 94 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1987) (quoting <em>Walker, </em>446 U.S., at 749-750, and n. 9, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659; emphasis added); cf. <em>Stewart Organization, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ricoh Corp., </em>487 U.S. 22, 37-38, 108 S. Ct. 2239, 101 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]n deciding whether a federal . . . Rule of Procedure encompasses a particular issue, a broad reading that would create significant disunifor-mity between state and federal courts should be avoided if the text permits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">In <em>pre-Hanna </em>decisions, the Court vigilantly read the Federal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 117, 63 S. Ct. 477, 87 L. Ed. 645 (1943), for example, the Court read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative defenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed defenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in such cases, <em>Palmer </em>held, state law controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">[559 U.S. 440]</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Six years later, in <em>Ragan </em>v. <em>Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., </em>337 U.S. 530, 69 S. Ct. 1233, 93 L. Ed. 1520 (1949), the Court ruled that state law determines when a diversity suit commences for purposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although Federal Rule 3 specified that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court,\u201d we held that the Rule did not displace a state law that tied an action\u2019s commencement to service of the summons. <em>Id., </em>at 531-533, 69 S. Ct. 1233, 93 L. Ed. 1520. The \u201ccause of action [wa]s created by local law,\u201d the Court explained, therefore \u201cthe measure of it [wa]s to be found only in local law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 533, 69 S. Ct. 1233, 93 L. Ed. 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Similarly in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diversity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prerequisite to pursuit of a stockholder\u2019s derivative action, to post a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litigation, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>institution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the Federal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder\u2019s maintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no conflict between the Rule and the state statute in question; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court observed. See <em>id., </em>at 556, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528. Burdensome as the security-for-costs requirement may be, <em>Cohen </em>made plain, suitors could not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the federal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In all of these cases, the Court stated in <em>Hanna, </em>\u201cthe scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which covered the point in dispute, <em>Erie </em>commanded the enforcement of state law.\u201d 380 U.S., at 470, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. In <em>Hanna </em>itself, the Court found the clash \u201cunavoidable,\u201d <em>ibid.\\ </em>the petitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by Federal Rule 4(d)(1), but that \u201chow-to\u201d method did not satisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service on an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the Massachusetts prescription in favor of the federal procedure, however, \u201c[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . . that federal rules . . . must</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">[559 U.S. 441]</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">be interpreted by the courts applying them, and that the process of interpretation can and should reflect an awareness of legitimate state interests.\u201d R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 593 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Hart &amp; Wechsler).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Following <em>Hanna, </em>we continued to \u201cinterpre[t] the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies.\u201d Hart &amp; Wechsler 593. In <em>Walker, </em>the Court took up the question whether <em>Ragan </em>should be overruled; we held, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly conflict with state rules governing the time when an action commences for purposes of tolling a limitations period. 446 U.S., at 749-752, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659. Rule 3, we said, addresses only \u201cthe date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 751, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659, and does not \u201cpurpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 750-751, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659. Significant state policy interests would be frustrated, we observed, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state rule, which required actual service on the defendant to stop the clock on the statute of limitations. <em>Id., </em>at 750-752, 100 S. Ct. 1978, 64 L. Ed. 2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">We were similarly attentive to a State\u2019s regulatory policy in <em>Gasperini. </em>That diversity case concerned the standard for determining when the large size of a jury verdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts alike had generally employed a \u201cshock the conscience\u201d test in reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U.S., at 422, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule 59(a) which, as worded at the time of <em>Gasperini, </em>instructed that a trial court could grant a new trial \u201cfor any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide greater control, New York prescribed procedures under which jury verdicts would be examined to determine whether they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cdeviate [d] materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\u201d See</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">[559 U.S. 442]</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 423-425, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659 (quoting CPLR \u00a7 5501(c)). This Court held that Rule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of New York\u2019s invigorated test.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Most recently, in <em>Semtek, </em>we addressed the claim-preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a diversity action on the basis of a California statute of limitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff renewed the same fray against the same defendant in a Maryland state court. (Plaintiff chose Maryland because that State\u2019s limitations period had not yet run.) We held that Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involuntary dismissal \u201coperate [d] as an adjudication on the merits,\u201d did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in Maryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Maryland courts from entertaining the case, we said, \u201cwould arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules Enabling Act,\u201d 531 U.S., at 503, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32, and \u201cwould in many cases violate <em>[Erie\u2019s] </em>federalism principle,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 504, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In sum, both before and after <em>Hanna, </em>the above-described decisions show, federal courts have been cautioned by this Court to \u201cinterpre[t] the Federal Rules . . . with sensitivity to important state interests,\u201d <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 427, n. 7, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659, and a will \u201cto avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 438, n. 22, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court veers away from that approach\u2014and</p>\n<p id=\"AZ9g\">[559 U.S. 443]</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">conspicuously, its most recent reiteration in <em>Gasperini, ante, </em>at 405, n. 7, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 321-322\u2014in favor of a mechanical reading of Federal Rules, insensitive to state interests and productive of discord.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Our decisions instruct over and over again that, in the adjudication of diversity cases, state interests\u2014 whether advanced in a statute, <em>e.g., Cohen, </em>or a procedural rule, <em>e.g., Gas</em>perini\u2014warrant our respectful consideration. Yet today, the Court gives no quarter to New York\u2019s limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tion on statutory damages and requires the lower courts to thwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive damages, New York\u2019s law controls the penalty to which a defendant may be exposed in a single suit. The story behind \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s enactment deserves telling.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New York proposed a new class-action statute designed \u201cto set up a flexible, functional scheme\u201d that would provide \u201can effective, but controlled group remedy.\u201d Judicial Conference Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws pp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted, the legislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class actions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for certification, eventually codified at \u00a7 901(a), that closely tracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR \u00a7 901(a) (requiring, for class certification, numerosity,</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">[559 U.S. 444]</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">predominance, typicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New York Legislature\u2019s hopper, \u201cvarious groups advocated for the addition of a provision that would prohibit class action plaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty . . . except when expressly authorized in the pertinent statute.\u201d <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Crompton Corp., </em>8 N.Y.3d 204, 211, 863 N.E.2d 1012, 1015 (2007). These constituents \u201cfeared that recoveries beyond actual damages could lead to excessively harsh results.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThey also argued that there was no need to permit class actions . . . [because] statutory penalties . . . provided an aggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to pursue a claim.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Such penalties, constituents observed, often far exceed a plaintiffs actual damages. \u201cWhen lumped together,\u201d they argued, \u201cpenalties and class actions produce overkill.\u201d Attachment to Letter from G. Perkinson, New York State Council of Retail Merchants, Inc., to J.

V. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, C90L11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\u2019s Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). In his signing statement, Governor Hugh Carey stated that the new statute \u201cempowers the court to prevent abuse of the class action device and provides <em>a controlled </em>remedy.\u201d Memorandum on Approving L. 1975, Ch. 207, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws, at 1748 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">\u201c[T]he final bill . . . was the result of a compromise among competing interests.\u201d <em>Sperry, </em>8 N.Y.3d, at 211, 863 N.E.2d, at 1015. Section 901(a) allows courts leeway in deciding whether to certify a class, but \u00a7 901(b) rejects the use of the class mechanism to pursue the particular remedy of statutory</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">[559 U.S. 445]</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">damages. The limitation was not designed with the fair conduct or efficiency of litigation in mind. Indeed, suits seeking statutory damages are arguably <em>best </em>suited to the class device because individual proof of actual damages is unnecessary. New York\u2019s decision instead to block class-action proceedings for statutory damages therefore makes scant sense, except as a means to a manifestly substantive end: limiting a defendant\u2019s liability in a single lawsuit in order to prevent the exorbitant inflation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>penalties\u2014remedies the New York Legislature created with individual suits in mind.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Shady Grove contends\u2014and the Court today agrees\u2014that Rule 23 unavoidably preempts New York\u2019s prohibition on the recovery of statutory damages in class actions. The Federal Rule, the Court emphasizes, states that Shady Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay be\u201d maintained as a class action, which conflicts with \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s instruction that it \u201cmay not\u201d so proceed. <em>Ante, </em>at 399, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted). Accordingly, the Court insists, \u00a7 901(b) \u201ccannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vi-res.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Concluding that Rule 23 does not violate the Rules Enabling Act, the Court holds that the federal provision controls Shady Grove\u2019s ability to seek, on behalf of a class, a statutory penalty of over $5 million. <em>Ante, </em>at 406-410, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 322-325 (plurality opinion);</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">[559 U.S. 446]</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>ante, </em>at 431-436, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 338-341 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">The Court, I am convinced, finds conflict where none is necessary. Mindful of the history behind \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s enactment, the thrust of our precedent, and the substantive-rights limitation in the Rules Enabling Act, I conclude, as did the Second Circuit and every District Court to have considered the question in any detail,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Rule 23 does not collide with \u00a7 901(b). As the Second Circuit well understood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to class certification and postcertification proceedings\u2014but it does not command that a particular remedy be available when a party sues in a representative capacity. See 549 F.3d 137, 143 (2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 901(b), in contrast, trains on that latter issue. Sensibly read, Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>23 governs procedural aspects of class litigation,</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">[559 U.S. 447]</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">but allows state law to control the size of a monetary award a class plaintiff may pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing a claim for relief, while \u00a7 901(b) defines the dimensions of the claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that \u00a7 901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than retail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have embedded the limitation in every provision creating a cause of action for which a penalty is authorized; \u00a7 901(b) operates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a part of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be were it included claim by claim in the New York Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cmay not\u201d be maintained as a class action. See <em>ante, </em>at 398-401, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 317-319. Putting the question that way, the Court does not home in on the reason <em>why. </em>Rule 23 authorizes class treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites because the class mechanism generally affords a fair and efficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section 901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does not allow class members to recover statutory damages because the New York Legislature considered the result of adjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fair and efficient <em>conduct </em>of class litigation is the legitimate concern of Rule 23; the <em>remedy </em>for an infraction of state law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State\u2019s lawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of <em>Ene, </em>87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 722 (1974) (It is relevant \u201cwhether the state provision embodies a substantive policy or represents</p>\n<p id=\"apm4-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 448]</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">only a procedural disagreement with the federal rulemakers respecting the fairest and most efficient way of conducting litigation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Suppose, for example, that a State, wishing to cap damages in class actions at $1 million, enacted a statute providing that \u201ca suit to recover more than $1 million may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d Under the Court\u2019s reasoning\u2014which attributes dispositive significance to the words \u201cmay not be maintained\u201d\u2014Rule 23 would preempt this provision, never mind that Congress, by authorizing the promulgation of rules of procedure for federal courts, surely did not intend to displace state-created ceilings on damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court suggests that the analysis might differ if the statute \u201climit[ed] the remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>available in an existing class action,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 401, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 319, such that Rule 23 might not conflict with a state statute prescribing that \u201cno more than $1 million may be recovered in a class action.\u201d There is no real difference in the purpose and intended effect of these two hypothetical statutes. The notion that one directly impinges on Rule 23\u2019s domain, while the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the office of Rule 23.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">[559 U.S. 449]</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended that a federal court sitting in diversity can accord due respect to both state and federal prescriptions. Plaintiffs seeking to vindicate claims for which the State has provided a statutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action if they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual damages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative class member who objects can opt out and pursue actual damages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an individual action. See, <em>e.g., Mendez </em>v. <em>The Radec Corp., </em>260 F.R.D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); <em>Brzychnalski </em>v. <em>Unesco, Inc., </em>35 F. Supp. 2d 351, 353 (SDNY 1999).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also Alexander, Practice Commentaries, at 105 (\u201cEven if a statutory penalty or minimum recovery is involved, most courts hold that it can be waived, thus confining the class recovery to actual damages and eliminating the bar of CPLR 901(b).\u201d). In this manner, the Second Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">[559 U.S. 450]</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">explained, \u201cRule 23\u2019s procedural requirements for class actions can be applied along with the substantive requirement of CPLR 901(b).\u201d 549 F.3d, at 144. In sum, while phrased as responsive to the question whether certain class actions may begin, \u00a7 901(b) is unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that remedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves \u00a7 901(b) in control of the remedial issue at the core of this case should be dispelled by our <em>Erie </em>jurisprudence, including <em>Hanna, </em>which counsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions against stretching a Rule to cover every situation it could conceiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ably reach.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court states that \u201c[t]here is no reason ... to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether claims made eligible for class treatment by some <em>other </em>law should be certified as class actions.\u201d Ante, at 399, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 318. To the contrary, <em>Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, </em>and <em>Semtek </em>provide good reason to look to the law that creates the right to recover. See <em>supra, </em>at 439-442, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 343-345. That is plainly so on a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there any reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief when the State that created the remedy disallows its pursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our federal system should give.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain penalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class relief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for certain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum recovery. See, <em>e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) (Truth in Lending Act) (\u201c[I]n the case of a class action ... no minimum recovery shall be applicable.\u201d); \u00a7 1693m(a)(2)(B) (Electronic Fund</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">[559 U.S. 451]</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Transfer Act) (same); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4010(a)(2)(B)(i) (Expedited Funds Availability Act) (same). Today\u2019s judgment denies to the States the full power Congress has to keep certain monetary awards within reasonable bounds. Cf. <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Kindler, </em>558 U.S. 53, 62, 130 S. Ct. 612, 175 L. Ed. 2d 417 (2009) (\u201cIn light of . . . federalism and comity concerns . . . it would seem particularly strange to disregard state . . . rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.\u201d). States may hesitate to create determinate statutory penalties in the future if they are impotent to prevent federal-court distortion of the remedy they have shaped.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">By finding a conflict without considering whether Rule 23 rationally should be read to avoid any collision, the Court unwisely and unnecessarily retreats from the federalism principles undergirding <em>Ene. </em>Had the Court reflected on the respect for state regulatory interests endorsed in our decisions, it would have found no cause to interpret Rule 23 so woodenly\u2014and every reason not to do so. Cf. Traynor, 37 Texas L. Rev., at 669 (\u201cIt is bad enough for courts to prattle unintelligibly about choice of law, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>unforgiveable when inquiry might have revealed that there was no real conflict.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">[559 U.S. 452]</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Because I perceive no unavoidable conflict between Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b), I would decide this case by inquiring \u201cwhether application of the [state] rule would have so important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure to [apply] it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court.\u201d <em>Hanna, </em>380 U.S., at 468, n. 9, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8. See <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 428, 116 S. Ct. 2211, 135 L. Ed. 2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Seeking to pretermit that inquiry, Shady Grove urges that the class-action bar in \u00a7 901(b) must be regarded as \u201cprocedural\u201d because it is contained in the CPLR, which \u201cgovern [s] the <em>procedure </em>in civil judicial proceedings <em>in all courts of the state.\u201d </em>Brief for Petitioner 34 (quoting CPLR \u00a7 101; emphasis in original). Placement in the CPLR is hardly disposi-tive. The provision held \u201csubstantive\u201d for <em>Erie </em>purposes in <em>Gasperini </em>is also contained in the CPLR ( \u00a7 5501(c)), as are limitations periods, \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>prescriptions plainly \u201csubstantive\u201d for <em>Erie </em>purposes however they may be characterized for other purposes, see <em>York, </em>326 U.S., at 109-112, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2079. See also, <em>e.g., </em>1 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 133, Reporter\u2019s Note, p. 369 (1969) (hereinafter Restatement) (\u201cUnder the rule of Erie . . . the federal courts have classified the burden of persuasion as to contributory negligence as a matter of substantive law that is governed by the rule of the State in which they sit even though the courts of that State have characterized their rule as procedural for choice-of-law purposes.\u201d); Cook, \u201cSubstance\u201d and \u201cProcedure\u201d in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Shady Grove also ranks \u00a7 901(b) as \u201cprocedural\u201d because \u201cnothing in [the statute] suggests that it is limited to rights of action based on New York state law, as opposed to federal law or the law of other states\u201d; instead it \u201capplies to actions seeking penalties under <em>any </em>statute.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35-36. See also <em>ante, </em>at 432, 176 L.

But neither is it expressly <em>extended </em>to claims arising under foreign law. The rule prescribes, without elaboration either way, that \u201can action to recover a penalty . . . may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d We have often recognized that \u201cgeneral words\u201d appearing in a statute may, in fact, have limited application; \u201c[t]he words \u2018any person or persons,\u2019 \u201d for example, \u201care broad enough to comprehend every human being. But general words must not only be limited to cases within the jurisdiction of the state, but also to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 Wheat. 610, 631, 4 L.

See Baxter, Choice of Law and the Federal System, 16 Stan. L. Rev. 1, 11 (1963) (\u201c[L]awmakers often speak in universal terms but must be understood to speak with reference to their constituents.\u201d); cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>507 U.S. 197, 204, n. 5, 113 S.

The article centers on a now-archaic Massachusetts law that prevented married women from binding themselves by contract as sureties for their husbands. Discussing whether the Massachusetts prescription applied to transactions involving foreign factors (a foreign forum, foreign place of contracting, or foreign parties), Currie observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201cWhen the Massachusetts legislature addresses itself to the problem of married women as sureties, the undeveloped image in its mind is that of <em>Massachusetts </em>married women, husbands, creditors, transactions, courts, and judgments.

Rev. 227, 231 (1958) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Shady Grove\u2019s suggestion that States must specifically limit their laws to domestic rights of action if they wish their enactments to apply in federal diversity litigation misses the obvious point: State legislators generally do not focus on an interstate setting when drafting statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">[559 U.S. 455]</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Shady Grove also observes that a New York court has applied \u00a7 901(b) to a federal claim for relief under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7227, see <em>Rudgayzer &amp; Gratt </em>v. <em>Cape Canaveral Tour &amp; Travel, Inc., </em>22 App. Div. 3d 148, 799 N.Y.S.2d 795 (2005), thus revealing \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s \u201cprocedural\u201d cast. Brief for Petitioner 36. We note first that the TCPA itself calls for the application of state law. See <em>Rudgayzer, </em>22 App. Div. 3d, at 149-150, 799 N.Y.S.2d, at 796-797 (federal action authorized in state court \u201cif otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of the court of [the] State\u201d (quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(3))). See also <em>Gottlieb </em>v. <em>Carnival Corp., </em>436 F.3d 335, 342 (CA2 2006) (Sotomayor, J.) (\u201cCongress sought, via the TCPA, to enact the functional equivalent of a state law.\u201d). The TCPA, the Supreme Court of Connecticut has recognized, thus \u201ccarves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>out an exception to th[e] general rule\u201d that \u201cwhen <em>Erie </em>... is reversed . . . , a state court hearing a federal case is normally required to apply federal substantive law\u201d: \u201cUnder \u00a7 227(b)(3) . . . it is state substantive law that determines, as a preliminary matter, whether a federal action under the act may be brought in state court.\u201d <em>Weber </em>v. <em>U.

See, <em>e.g., Cohen, </em>337 U.S., at 555, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528; cf. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Interstate Realty Co., </em>337 U.S. 535, 536-538, and n. 1, 69 S. Ct. 1235, 93 L. Ed. 1524 (1949) (holding diversity case must be dismissed based on state statute that, by its terms, governed only proceedings in state court). Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary. They supply \u201csubstantive\u201d law in diversity suits, see <em>York, </em>326 U.S., at 109-112, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2079, even though, as Shady Grove acknowledges, state courts often apply the forum\u2019s limitations period as a \u201cprocedural\u201d bar to claims arising under the law of another State, see Reply Brief 24, n. 16; Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-17.

Similarly, federal courts sitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the burden of proving contributory negligence, see <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 117, 63 S. Ct. 477, 87 L. Ed. 645 (1943), yet state courts adjudicating foreign causes of action often apply their own local law to this issue. See Restatement \u00a7 133 and Reporter\u2019s Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In short, Shady Grove\u2019s effort to characterize \u00a7 901(b) as simply \u201cprocedural\u201d cannot successfully elide this fundamental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of an issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the sense our cases on <em>Erie </em>(pre- and <em>post-Hanna) </em>develop, the Rules of Decision Act commands application of the State\u2019s law in diversity suits. <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 428, 116 S.

As this case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award statutory penalties in class actions while New York courts are bound by \u00a7 901(b)\u2019s proscription, \u201csubstantial variations between state and federal [money judgments] may be expected.\u201d <em>Gasperini, </em>518 U.S., at 430, 116 S.

The \u201cvariation\u201d here is indeed \u201csubstantial.\u201d Shady Grove seeks class relief that is <em>ten thousand-times </em>greater than the individual remedy available to it in state court. As the plurality acknowledges, <em>ante, </em>at 415, 176 L.
