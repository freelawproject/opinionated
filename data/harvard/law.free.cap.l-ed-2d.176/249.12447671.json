See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1975). The question presented in this case is whether that right was accorded to respondent Diapolis Smith, an African-American convicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in Kent County, Michigan, in 1993. At the time of Smith\u2019s trial, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of Kent County\u2019s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>from which potential jurors were drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979), this Court described  three showings a criminal defendant must make to establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement. He or she must show: \u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepre-sentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 364, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. The first showing is, in most cases, easily made; the second and third are more likely to generate controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The defendant in <em>Duren </em>readily met all three measures. He complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson County, Missouri, jury pool. To establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of the persons summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of the persons on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn. To show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the underrepresentation, Du-ren pointed to Missouri\u2019s law exempting women from jury service, and to the manner in which Jackson County administered the exemption. Concluding that no significant state interest could justify Missouri\u2019s explicitly gender-based exemption,</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">[559 U.S. 320]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">this Court held the law, as implemented in Jackson County, violative of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">We here review the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that Smith \u201csat-isf[ied] the prima facie test established by <em>Duren,\u201d </em>and granting him habeas corpus relief, <em>i.e., </em>release from imprisonment absent a new trial commenced within 180 days of the Court of Appeals\u2019 order. 543 F.3d 326, 336 (2008). Despite marked differences between Smith\u2019s case and Duren\u2019s, and a cogent Michigan Supreme Court decision holding that Smith \u201cha[d] not shown . . . systematic exclusion,\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich. 199, 205, 615 N.W.2d 1, 3 (2000), the Sixth Circuit found the matter settled. Cognizant of the restrictions Congress placed on federal habeas review of state-court convictions, the Court of Appeals considered that a decision contrary to its own would \u201cinvolv[e] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). 543 F.3d, at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The Sixth Circuit erred in so ruling. No decision of this Court \u201cclearly established]\u201d Smith\u2019s entitlement to federal-court relief. According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith had demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror-assignment procedure, which Smith calls \u201csiphoning,\u201d \u201csystematic [ally] excluded]\u201d African-Americans. Under this procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and, only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s. The Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected Smith\u2019s \u201csiphoning\u201d plea for lack of proof that the assignment procedure caused underrepresentation. <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 205, 615 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>N.W.2d, at 3. As that determination was not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to disturb it. See \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">[559 U.S. 321]</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In addition to renewal of his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument, Smith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce systematically the number of African-Americans appearing on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent County court\u2019s practice of excusing people without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to appear. Brief for Respondent 53-54. Our decisions do not address factors of the kind Smith urges. We have cautioned, however, that  \u201c[t]he fair-cross-section principle must have much leeway in application.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>419 U.S., at 537-538, 95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690; see <em>id., </em>at 537, 95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690 (Court\u2019s holding that Sixth Amendment is violated by systematic exclusion of women from jury service \u201cdoes not augur or authorize the fashioning of detailed jury-selection codes by federal courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">On November 7, 1991, Christopher Rumbley was shot and killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200 to 300 people on the premises. All patrons of the bar were African-American. The State charged Smith with the murder in Kent County Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\"><em>Voir dire </em>for Smith\u2019s trial took place in September 1993. The venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals. The parties agree that, at most, three venire members were African-American. Smith unsuccessfully objected to the composition of the venire panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Smith\u2019s case proceeded to trial before an all-white jury. The case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the man who shot Rumbley. Thirty-seven witnesses from the bar, including Smith, testified at the trial. Of those, two testified that Smith fired the gun. Five testified that the shooter was not Smith, and the remainder made no identifications of the shooter. The jury convicted Smith of second-degree</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">[559 U.S. 322]</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">murder and possession of a firearm during a felony, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">On first appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim. The hearing occurred in early 1998. Smith\u2019s evidence showed that Grand Rapids, the largest city in Kent County, was home to roughly 37% of Kent County\u2019s population, and to 85% of its African-American residents. Felony charges in Kent County were tried in a sole Circuit Court. Misdemeanors were prosecuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geographical area. To fill the courts\u2019 venires, Kent County sent questionnaires to prospective jurors. The Circuit Court Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms were returned as undeliverable, and another 15% to 20% were not answered. App. 13a. From the pool of prospective jurors who completed questionnaires, the County granted requests for hardship exemptions, <em>e.g., </em>for lack of transportation or child care. <em>Id., </em>at 21a. Kent County then assigned nonexempt prospective jurors to their local district courts\u2019 venires. After fill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ing the district courts\u2019 needs, the County assigned the remaining prospective jurors to the Circuit Court\u2019s panels. <em>Id., </em>at 20a, 22a.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The month after <em>voir dire </em>for Smith\u2019s trial, Kent County reversed the assignment order. It did so, according to the Circuit Court Administrator, based on \u201c[t]he belief. . . that the respective districts essentially swallowed up most of the minority jurors,\u201d leaving the Circuit Court with a jury pool that \u201cdid not represent the entire county.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 22a. The Jury Minority Representation Committee, its co-chair testified, held the same view concerning the impact of choosing district court jurors first and not returning unused persons to the pool available for Circuit Court selections. <em>Id., </em>at 64a-65a.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">[559 U.S. 323]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The trial court considered two means of measuring the extent of un-derrepresentation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires: \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d and \u201ccomparative disparity.\u201d \u201cAbsolute disparity\u201d is determined by subtracting the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool (here, 6% in the six months leading up to Smith\u2019s trial) from the percentage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%). By an absolute disparity measure, therefore, African-Americans were underrepresented by 1.28%. \u201cComparative disparity\u201d is determined by dividing the absolute disparity (here, 1.28%) by the group\u2019s representation in the jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%). The quotient (here, 18%) showed that, in the six months prior to Smith\u2019s trial, African-Americans were, on average, 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on the jury-service list. App. to Pet. for Cert. 215a.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Isolating the month Smith\u2019s jury was selected, Smith\u2019s statistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity was 34.8%. App. 181a. In the 11 months after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to 15.1%. <em>Id., </em>at 102a-103a, 113a.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in demographics and economics, who tied the under-representation to social and economic factors. In Kent County, the expert explained, these forces made African-Americans less likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility questionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship excuse. <em>Id., </em>at 79a-80a.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans were underrepresented in Circuit Court ve-nires. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a. But Smith\u2019s evidence was insufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror-assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had systematically excluded African-Americans. <em>Id., </em>at 210a-212a.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">[559 U.S. 324]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">The court therefore rejected Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the juror-allocation system in place at the relevant time did result in the underrepresentation of African-Americans. <em>Id., </em>at 182a-183a. Reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, the intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment order installed shortly after the <em>voir dire </em>in Smith\u2019s case. Ibid.; see <em>supra, </em>at 322, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, concluding that Smith \u201cha[d] not established a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment fair cross-section requirement.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 207, 615 N.W.2d, at 4. The Michigan high court observed, first, that this Court has specified \u201c[no] preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 203, 615 N.W.2d, at 2. The court then noted that lower federal courts had applied three different methods to measure fair and reasonable representation: the absolute and comparative disparity tests, described <em>supra, </em>at 323, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 257, and \u201cthe standard deviation test.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory, the Michigan Supreme Court adopted a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of measuring un-derrepresentation. <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 204, 615 N.W.2d, at 3. Smith\u2019s statistical evidence, the court found, \u201cfailed to establish a legally significant disparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity tests.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">[559 U.S. 325]</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">204-205, 615 N.W.2d, at 3. (The parties had presented no expert testimony regarding application of the standard deviation test. <em>Id., </em>at 205, n. 1,615 N.W.2d, at 3, n. 1; <em>supra, </em>at 323, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Nevertheless \u201cgranting] [Smith] the benefit of the doubt on unfair and unreasonable underrepresentation,\u201d the Michigan Supreme Court ultimately determined that \u201che ha[d] not shown systematic exclusion.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 203, 205, 615 N.W.2d, at 2, 3. Smith\u2019s evidence, the court said, did not show \u201chow the alleged siphoning of African-American jurors to district courts affected the circuit court jury pool.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 205, 615 N.W.2d, at 3. In particular, the court observed, \u201c [t]he record does not disclose whether the district court jury pools contained more, fewer, or approximately the same percentage of minority jurors as the circuit court jury pool.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court also ruled that \u201cthe influence of social and economic factors on juror participation does not demonstrate a systematic exclusion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 206, 615 N.W.2d, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">In February 2003, Smith filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, reasserting his fair-cross-section claim. Because Smith is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\u201d the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a7 2254, governed the District Court\u2019s review of his application for federal habeas corpus relief.  Under the controlling provision of AEDPA, codified in \u00a7 2254(d), a state prisoner\u2019s application may not be granted as to \u201cany claim . . . adjudicated ... in State court\u201d unless the state court\u2019s adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>[559 U.S. 326]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Applying these standards, the District Court dismissed Smith\u2019s habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a-42a.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed. Where, as here, the allegedly excluded group is small, the Sixth Circuit ruled, courts should use the comparative disparity test to measure underrepresentation. 543 F.3d, at 338. In that court\u2019s view, Smith\u2019s comparative disparity statistics sufficed \u201cto demonstrate that the representation of African American veniremen in Kent County . . . was unfair and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As to systematic exclusion, the Sixth Circuit, in accord with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, believed that the juror-assignment order in effect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled significantly reduced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court venires. <em>Id., </em>at 342. Smith was entitled to relief, the court concluded, because no important state interest supported that allocation system. <em>Id., </em>at 345.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The State petitioned for certiorari, attacking the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision on two principal grounds: First, the State charged that the federal appellate court erred in adopting the comparative disparity test to determine whether a distinctive group was underrepresented in the jury pool. Pet. for Cert. ii. Second, the State urged that, in any event,</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">[559 U.S. 327]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u201cthere was no . . . systematic exclusion of African Americans from juries in Kent County, Michigan,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 25, and no warrant for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s contrary determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted review, 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 48, 174 L. Ed. 2d 631 (2009), and now reverse the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">According to the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment plea \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this Court in Duren].\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1); see 543 F.3d, at 345. We disagree. As explained below, our <em>Du-ren </em>decision hardly establishes\u2014no less \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, this Court\u2019s pathmarking deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sion in <em>Duren </em>instructs, a defendant must prove that: (l)a group qualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and reasonably represented in jury veni-res, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d in the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation. 439 U.S., at 364, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579; see <em>supra, </em>at 319, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 254-255.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The defendant in <em>Duren </em>successfully challenged Jackson County\u2019s administration of a Missouri exemption permitting any woman to opt out of jury service. 439 U.S., at 360, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. The Court explained why it was plain that defendant Duren had established a prima facie case. First, women in Jackson</p>\n<p id=\"A8zq\">[559 U.S. 328]</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">County were both \u201cnumerous and distinct from men.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 364 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>419 U.S., at 531, 95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690). Second, Duren\u2019s \u201cstatistical presentation\u201d showed gross underrepresentation: Women were over half the jury-eligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for less than 15% of jury venires. 439 U.S., at 364-366, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with particularity. He proved that women\u2019s underrepresen-tation was persistent\u2014occurring in every weekly venire for almost a year\u2014and he identified the two stages of the jury-selection process \u201cwhen . . . the systematic exclusion took place.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 366, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. First, questionnaires for prospective jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out of jury service. Less than 30% of those summoned were female, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed the exemption at the questionnaire stage. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cMoreover, at the summons stage women were . . . given another opportunity to [opt out].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 366-367, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. And if a woman ignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out; no further inquiry was made. <em>Id., </em>at 367, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. At this \u201cfinal, venire, stage,\u201d women\u2019s representation plummeted to 14.5%. <em>Ibid. </em>In the Federal District Court serving the same territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only childcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of those actually serving on juries. See <em>ibid., </em>n. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The \u201cdisproportionate and consistent exclusion of women from the [Jackson County] jury wheel and at the venire stage,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cwas quite obviously due to the <em>system </em>by which juries were selected.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 367, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. \u201c[A]ppropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemptions, the Court added, would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by an important state interest. <em>Id., </em>at 370, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. But no such interest, the Court held, could justify Missouri\u2019s exemption for each and every woman\u2014the altogether evident explanation for the un-derrepresentation. <em>Id., </em>at 369-370, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">[559 U.S. 329]</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly observed, see <em>supra, </em>at 324, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 257-258, neither <em>Duren </em>nor any other decision of this Court specifies the method or test courts must use to measure the representation of distinctive groups in jury pools. The courts below and the parties noted three methods employed or identified in lower federal court decisions: absolute disparity, comparative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>disparity, and standard deviation. See <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 204-205, 615 N.W.2d, at 2-3; Brief for Petitioner 3; Brief for Respondent 26; <em>supra, </em>at 324, 176 L.

It did so in order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in <em>Duren: </em>To the extent underrepre-sentation existed, was it due to \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d? 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.W.2d, at 3; see <em>Duren, </em>439 U.S., at 364, 99 S.

Brief for Respondent 46-48. But as the Michigan Supreme Court not at all unreasonably concluded, <em>Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.W.2d, at 3, Smith\u2019s evidence scarcely shows that the assignment order he targets caused underrepresentation. Although</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">[559 U.S. 331]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">the record established that some officials and others in Kent County <em>believed </em>that the assignment order created racial disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, <em>supra, </em>at 322, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 257, the belief was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Evidence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit Court\u2019s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District Court\u2019s could have indicated that the assignment order made a critical difference. But, as the Michigan Supreme Court noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect. See <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.W.2d, at 3. Nor did Smith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the County\u2019s largest African-American population, \u201cha[d] more need for jurors per capita than [any other district in Kent County].\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26; <em>id., </em>at 18, 37. Furthermore, Smith did not endeavor to compare the African-American representation levels in Circuit Court venires with those in the Federal District Court venires for the same region. See <em>id., </em>at 46-47; <em>Duren, </em>439 U.S., at 367, n. 25, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was offered by his statistics expert, who reported a decline in comparative underrepresentation, from 18% to 15.1%, after Kent County reversed the assignment order. See <em>supra, </em>at 323, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 257. This evidence\u2014particularly in view of AE-DPA\u2019s instruction, \u00a7 2254(d)(2)\u2014is insufficient to support Smith\u2019s claim that the assignment order caused the underrepresentation. As Smith\u2019s counsel recognized at oral argument, this decrease could not fairly be described as \u201ca big change.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see <em>ibid, </em>(the drop was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d). In short, Smith\u2019s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">[559 U.S. 332]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the defendant must show only that the underrepresentation is persistent and \u201cproduced by the method or \u2018system\u2019 used to select [jurors],\u201d rather than by chance. Brief for Respondent 38, 40. In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list of factors in addition to the alleged \u201csiphoning\u201d that, he urges, rank as \u201csystematic\u201d causes of underrepresentation of African-Americans in Kent County\u2019s jury pool. <em>Id., </em>at 53-54. Smith\u2019s list includes the County\u2019s practice of excusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply failed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail notices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of residential addresses at least 15 months old, and the refusal of Kent County police to enforce court orders for the appearance of prospective jurors. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">No \u201cclearly established\u201d precedent of this Court supports Smith\u2019s claim that he can make out a prima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, <em>might </em>contribute to a group\u2019s underrepresentation. Smith recites a sentence in our <em>Duren </em>opinion that, he says, placed the burden of proving causation on the State. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35. The sentence reads: \u201cAs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>suming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the exemptions mentioned by the court below [those for persons over 65, teachers, and government workers] would justify failure to achieve a fair community cross section on jury venires, the State must demonstrate that these exemptions [rather than the women\u2019s exemption] caused the underrepre-sentation complained of.\u201d 439 U.S., at 368-369, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. That sentence appears after the Court had already assigned to Du-ren\u2014and found he had carried\u2014the burden of proving that the underrep-resentation \u201cwas due to [women\u2019s] systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 366, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579. The Court\u2019s comment, which Smith clipped from its context, does not concern the demonstration</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">[559 U.S. 333]</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">of a prima face case. Instead, it addresses what the State might show <em>to rebut </em>the defendant\u2019s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme Court was therefore far from \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), in concluding that <em>Duren </em>first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrepresentation complained of was \u201cdue to systematic exclusion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 364, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579; see <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.W.2d, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">This Court, furthermore, has never \u201cclearly established\u201d that jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith\u2019s list can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim. In <em>Taylor, </em>we \u201crecognized broad discretion in the States\u201d to \u201cprescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.\u201d 419 U.S., at 537-538, 95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690. And in <em>Duren, </em>the Court understood that hardship exemptions resembling those Smith assails might well \u201csurvive a fair-cross-section challenge,\u201d 439 U.S., at 370, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In sum, the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim is consistent with <em>Duren </em>and \u201cinvolved [no] unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"panfz-dedup-0\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAS4AAAAlAQAAAADUizmZAAAAmUlEQVR4nO3UsQ3CMBCF4d8n90ANBaNkAAZjBbZJmTGyBFTnHB1npIeUIgVFrvv87mRbslyCFdVsTRfsbX/T5v2KhAG8+kRi+7M1m3JBwwC/d3MaBtRxzESjBHCpc0YKjYiIObpScAM49ZeSMIBHn2hExHI+5DYSXoHlest5DQN8GDLRKAHx9OMnkWgGlCWDH9j2hZT9R/quN+rofCcgHlKXAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"302\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-14\">.  Standard deviation analysis seeks to determine the probability that the disparity between a group\u2019s jury-eligible population and the group\u2019s percentage in the qualified jury pool is attributable to random chance. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich. 199, 219-220, 615 N.W.2d 1, 9-10 (2000) (Cavanagh, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\">.

Ed. 2d 579 (1979), when it declared that social and economic factors could not establish systematic exclusion. 543 F.3d, at 341-342. Because such factors disproportionately affect African-Americans, the Sixth Circuit said, Kent County\u2019s routine grants of certain hardship exemptions \u201cproduced systematic exclusion within the meaning of <em>Duren.\" Ibid. </em>The Sixth Circuit held, however, that the hardship exemptions could not establish a fair-cross-section claim because the State \u2018Ras a significant interest [in] avoiding undue burdens on individuals\u2019\u2019 by allowing such excuses. <em>Id., </em>at 345.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\">. Although the question presented by the State homes in on the proper measure for underrepresentation, it initially and more comprehensively inquires whether Smith was denied his right to a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.

Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in concluding that the Michigan Supreme Court failed to apply \u2018clearly established\u2019 Supreme Court precedent under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 on the issue of the fair cross-section requirement under <em>Duren . . . </em>\u2019\u2019). We therefore address that overarching issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\">.

Brief for Petitioner 45-46. Under the rule the State proposes, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment offers no remedy for complete exclusion of distinct groups in communities where the population of the distinct group falls below the 10 percent threshold.\u2019\u2019 Brief for Respondent 35.

Accordingly, in an appropriate case I would be willing to reconsider our precedents articulating the \u201cfair cross section\u201d requirement. But neither party asks us to do so here, and the only question before us is whether the state court\u2019s disposition was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, our precedents.
