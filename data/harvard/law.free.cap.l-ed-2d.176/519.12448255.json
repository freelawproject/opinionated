Section 813(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c), provides that a debt collector is not liable in an action brought under the Act if she can show \u201cthe violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>withstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d This case presents</p>\n<p id=\"AU8E\">[559 U.S. 577]</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">the question whether the \u201cbona fide error\u201d defense in \u00a7 1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting from a debt collector\u2019s mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to eliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e).  The Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors and \u201cdebt collector [s],\u201d defined to include any person who \u201cregularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1692a(5), (6). Among other things, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false representations as to a debt\u2019s character, amount, or legal status, \u00a7 1692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an \u201cunusual time or place\u201d likely to be inconvenient to the consumer, \u00a7 1692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane language or violence or the threat thereof, \u00a7\u00a7 1692d(1), (2). See generally \u00a7\u00a7 1692b-1692j; <em>Heintz </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>514 U.S. 291, 292-293, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The Act is enforced through administrative action and private lawsuits.  With some exceptions not relevant here, violations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 <em>et seq., </em>and are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See \u00a7 <em>16921. </em>As a result, a debt collector who acts with \u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]\u201d is subject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day. \u00a7\u00a7 45(m)(l)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16 CFR \u00a7 1.98(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">[559 U.S. 578]</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">The FDCPA also provides that \u201cany debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with respect to any person is liable to such person.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to \u201cactual damage [s],\u201d plus costs and \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A court may also award \u201cadditional damages,\u201d subject to a statutory cap of $1,000 for individual actions, or, for class actions, \u201cthe lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.\u201d \u00a7 1692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages, the court must consider \u201cthe frequency and persistence of [the debt collector\u2019s] noncompliance,\u201d \u201cthe nature of such noncompliance,\u201d and \u201cthe extent to which such noncompliance was intentional.\u201d \u00a7 1692k(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">The Act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing liability on debt collectors. Section 1692k(c), at issue here, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">\u201c[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The Act also states that none of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>provisions imposing liability shall apply to \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [FTC].\u201d \u00a7 1692k(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Respondents in this case are a law firm, Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich, L. P. A., and one of its attorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle). In April 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court on behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. Carlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Countrywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L. Jerman. The complaint included</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">[559 U.S. 579]</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">a \u201cNotice,\u201d later served on Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be assumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing. Jerman\u2019s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and Carlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When Countrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact, already paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the foreclosure lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certification and damages under the FDCPA, contending that Carlisle violated \u00a7 1692g by stating that her debt would be assumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While acknowledging a division of authority on the question, the District Court held that Carlisle had violated \u00a7 1692g by requiring Jerman to dispute the debt in writing. 464 F. Supp. 2d 720, 722-725 (ND Ohio 2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court ultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, however, concluding that \u00a7 1692k(c) shielded it from liability because the violation was not intentional, resulted from a bona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. 502 F. Supp. 2d 686, 695-697 (2007). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F.3d 469 (2008). Acknowledging that the</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">[559 U.S. 580]</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Courts of Appeals are divided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense, and that the \u201cmajority view is that the defense is available for clerical and factual errors only,\u201d the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held that \u00a7 1692k(c) extends to \u201cmistakes of law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 473-476 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals found \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about attorney debt collectors maintaining \u201cprocedures\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. <em>Id., </em>at 476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c), expressly excludes legal errors, the court observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Congress has amended the FDCPA several times since 1977 without excluding mistakes of law from \u00a7 1692k(c). 538 F.3d, at 476.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict of authority as to the scope of the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error defense,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 557</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">[559 U.S. 581]</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">U.S. 933, 129 S. Ct. 2863, 174 L. Ed. 2d 575 (2009), and now reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The parties disagree about whether a \u201cviolation\u201d resulting from a debt collector\u2019s misinterpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA can ever be \u201cnot intentional\u201d under \u00a7 1692k(c). Jerman contends that when a debt collector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the violation (here, sending a notice that included the \u201cin writing\u201d language), a misunderstanding about what the Act requires cannot render the violation \u201cnot intentional,\u201d given the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is no defense. Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue that nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors from the category of \u201cbona fide error [s]\u201d covered by \u00a7 1692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an unintentional \u201cact\u201d but rather an unintentional \u201cviolation.\u201d The latter term, they contend, evinces Congress\u2019 intent to impose liability only when a party knows its conduct is unlawful. Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read \u00a7 1692k(c) to encompass \u201call types of error,\u201d including mistakes of law. Brief for Respondents 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">We decline to adopt the expansive reading of \u00a7 1692k(c) that Carlisle proposes. We have long recognized the \u201ccommon maxim, familiar to all minds, that  ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\u201d <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>United States, </em>7 Pet. 404, 411, 8 L. Ed. 728 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.); see also <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 199, 111 S. Ct. 604, 112 L. Ed. 2d 617 (1991) (\u201cThe general rule that ignorance of the law or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">[559 U.S. 582]</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">is deeply rooted in the American legal system\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Our law is therefore no stranger to the possibility that an act may be \u201cintentional\u201d for purposes of civil liability, even if the actor</p>\n<p id=\"A_5_\">[559 U.S. 583]</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">lacked actual knowledge that her conduct violated the law. In <em>Kolstad </em>v. <em>American Dental Assn., </em>527 U.S. 526, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999), for instance, we addressed a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 authorizing compensatory and punitive damages for \u201cintentional discrimination,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a, but limiting punitive damages to conduct undertaken \u201cwith malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual,\u201d \u00a7 1981a(b)(1). We observed that in some circumstances \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d could occur without giving rise to punitive damages liability, such as where an employer is \u201cunaware of the relevant federal prohibition\u201d or acts with the \u201cdistinct belief that its discrimination is lawful.\u201d 527 U.S., at 536-537, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494. See also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed. 1984) (\u201c[I]f one intentionally interferes with the interests of others, he is often subject to liability notwithstanding the invasion was made under an erroneous belief as to some . . . legal matter that would have justified the conduct\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 164, and Comment e (1963-1964) (intentional tort of trespass can be committed despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>actor \u215b mistaken belief that she has a legal right to enter the property).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Likely for this reason, when Congress has intended to provide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more explicitly than here. In particular, the FTC Act\u2019s administrative-penalty provisions\u2014which, as noted above, Congress expressly incorporated into the FDCPA\u2014apply</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">[559 U.S. 584]</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">only when a debt collector acts with \u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\u201d that its action was \u201cprohibited by [the FDCPA].\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45(m)(l)(A), (C). Given the absence of similar language in \u00a7 1692k(c), it is a fair inference that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to recover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory damages for \u201cintentional\u201d conduct, including violations resulting from mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous penalties of the FTC Act for debt collectors whose intentional actions also reflected \u201cknowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\u201d that the conduct was prohibited. Cf. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 (authorizing courts to reduce liquidated damages under the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 if an employer demonstrates that \u201cthe act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\u201d); 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203(c)(5)(A) (provision of Digital Millennium Copyright Act authorizing court to reduce damages where \u201cthe violator was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Congress also did not confine liability under the FDCPA to \u201cwillful\u201d violations, a term more often understood in the civil context to excuse mistakes of law. See, <em>e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 125-126, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985) (civil damages for \u201cwillful violations\u201d of Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 require a showing that the employer \u201cknew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>551 U.S. 47, 57, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (2007) (although \u201c \u2018willfully\u2019 \u201d is a \u201c \u2018word of many meanings\u2019 \u201d dependent on context, \u201cwe have generally taken it [when used as a statutory condition of civil liability] to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as well\u201d (quoting <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>United States,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">[559 U.S. 585]</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">524 U.S. 184, 191, 118 S. Ct. 1939, 141 L. Ed. 2d 197(1998))). For this reason, the dissent missteps in relying on <em>Thurston </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Richland Shoe Co., </em>486 U.S. 128, 133, 108 S. Ct. 1677, 100 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1988), as both cases involved the statutory phrase \u201cwillful violation.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 613-614, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion based on the interaction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>words \u201cviolation\u201d and \u201cnot intentional\u201d in \u00a7 1692k(c). <em>Post, </em>at 613, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 546-547. But even in the criminal context, cf. n. 6, <em>supra, </em>reference to a \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cintentional\u201d \u201cviolation\u201d or cognate terms has not necessarily implied a defense for legal errors. See <em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S., at 192, 118 S. Ct. 1939, 141 L. Ed. 2d 197 (\u201c \u2018[T]he knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 345, 72 S. Ct. 329, 96 L. Ed. 367 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting)); <em>United States </em>v. <em>International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>402 U.S. 558, 559, 563, 91 S. Ct. 1697, 29 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1971) (statute imposing criminal liability on those who \u201c \u2018knowingly violat[e]\u2019 \u201d regulations governing transportation of corrosive chemicals does not require \u201cproof of [the defendant\u2019s] knowledge of the law\u201d); <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>206 U.S. 246, 255, 257, 27 S. Ct. 600, 51 L. Ed. 1047 (1907) (rejecting argument that criminal penalty applicable to those who \u201cintentionally violate\u201d a statute \u201crequires knowledge of the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The dissent advances a novel interpretative rule under which the combination of a <em>\u201cmens rea </em>requirement\u201d and the word \u201c \u2018violation\u2019 \u201d (as opposed to language specifying \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the violation\u201d) creates a mistake-of-law defense. <em>Post, </em>at 613, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 546-547. Such a rule would be remarkable in its breadth, applicable to the many scores of civil and criminal provisions throughout the U. S. Code that employ such a combination of terms. The dissent\u2019s theory draws no distinction between \u201cknowing,\u201d \u201cintentional,\u201d or \u201cwillful\u201d and would abandon the care we have traditionally taken to construe such words in their particular statutory context. See, <em>e.g., Safeco, </em>551 U.S., at 57, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1045. More fundamentally, the dissent\u2019s categorical rule is at odds with precedents such as <em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S., at 192, 118 S. Ct. 1939, 141 L. Ed. 2d 197, and <em>International Minerals, </em>402</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">[559 U.S. 586]</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">U.S., at 559, 563, 91 S. Ct. 1697, 29 L.

Ed. 2d, at 547. Even if the dissent is correct that the phrase \u201cintentional violation,\u201d standing alone in a civil liability statute, might be read to excuse mistakes of law, the FDCPA juxtaposes the term \u201cnot intentional\u201d \u201cviolation\u201d in \u00a7 1692k(c) with the more specific language of \u00a7 45(m)( 1)(A), which refers to \u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\u201d that particular conduct was unlawful. The dissent\u2019s reading gives short shrift to that textual distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">[559 U.S. 587]</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We draw additional support for the conclusion that bona fide errors in \u00a7 1692k(c) do not include mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt collector maintain \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d The dictionary defines \u201cprocedure\u201d as \u201ca series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite way.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976). In that light, the statutory phrase is more naturally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or other such \u201cregular orderly\u201d steps to avoid mistakes\u2014for instance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector might adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate with consumers at the wrong time of day, \u00a7 1692c(a)(l), or make false representations as to the amount of a debt, \u00a7 1692e(2). The dissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds nothing unusual in attorney debt collectors\u2019 maintaining procedures to avoid legal error. <em>Post, </em>at 628, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 556; 538 F.3d, at 476. We do not dispute that some entities may maintain procedures to avoid legal errors. But legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear process. For this reason, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as <em>amicus curiae </em>supporting Jerman) that the broad statutory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to avoid \u201cany\u201d bona fide error indicates that the relevant procedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical or factual mistakes. Such procedures are more likely to avoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, particularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex federal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open-ended prohibitions on, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfalse, deceptive,\u201d \u00a7 1692e, or \u201cunfair\u201d practices, \u00a7 1692f. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Even if the text of \u00a7 1692k(c), read in isolation, leaves room for doubt, the context and history of the FDCPA provide further reinforcement for construing that provision not to shield violations resulting from misinterpretations of the requirements of the Act. See <em>Dada </em>v. <em>Mukasey, </em>554 U.S. 1, 16, 128 S. Ct. 2307, 171 L. Ed. 2d 178 (2008) (\u201cIn reading a statute we must not look merely to</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">[559 U.S. 588]</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">a particular clause, but consider in connection with it the whole statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As described above, Congress included in the FDCPA not only the bona fide error defense but also a separate protection from liability for \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [FTC].\u201d \u00a7 1692k(e). In our view, the Court of Appeals\u2019 reading is at odds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>with the role Congress evidently contemplated for the FTC in resolving ambiguities in the Act. Debt collectors would rarely need to consult the FTC if \u00a7 1692k(c) were read to offer immunity for good-faith reliance on advice from private counsel. Indeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the law, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from claiming good-faith immunity for violations and would potentially trigger civil penalties for knowing violations under the FTC Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More importantly, the existence of a separate provision that, by its plain terms, is more obviously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liability when the Act\u2019s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs against stretching the language of the bona fide error defense to accommodate Carlisle\u2019s expansive reading.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Any remaining doubt about the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1692k(c) is dispelled by evidence of the meaning attached</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">[559 U.S. 589]</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">to the language Congress copied into the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error defense from a parallel provision in an existing statute. TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several statutes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA. As enacted in 1968, \u00a7 130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that was in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress later enacted into the FDCPA: \u201cA creditor may not be held liable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d 82 Stat. 157 (codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">During the 9-year period between the enactment of TILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no such court interpreted TILA to extend to violations resulting from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have often</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">[559 U.S. 590]</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">observed that  when \u201cjudicial interpretations have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial interpretations as well.\u201d <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>524 U.S. 624, 645, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998); see also <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., </em>552 U.S. 364, 370, 128 S. Ct. 989, 169 L. Ed. 2d 933 (2008). While the interpretations of three Federal Courts of Appeals may not have \u201csettled\u201d the meaning of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense, there is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed with those interpretations when it enacted the FDCPA. Congress copied verbatim the pertinent portions of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense into the FDCPA. Compare 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c) (1976 ed.) with \u00a7 813(c), 91 Stat. 881. This close textual correspondence supports an inference that Congress understood the statutory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">[559 U.S. 591]</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Carlisle and the dissent urge reliance, consistent with the approach taken by the Court of Appeals, on a 1980 amendment to TILA that added the following sentence to that statute\u2019s bona fide error defense: \u201cExamples of a bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and program [m]ing, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person\u2019s obligations under [TILA] is not a bona fide error.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>See Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, \u00a7 615, 94 Stat. 181. The absence of a corresponding amendment to the FDCPA, Carlisle reasons, is evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to give a more expansive scope to the FDCPA defense. For several reasons, we decline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpretative weight. For one, it is not obvious that the amendment changed the scope of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense in a way material to our analysis, given the uniform interpretations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA defense does not extend to mistakes of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">[559 U.S. 592]</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">(Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, <em>post, </em>at 631, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 557-558, this reading does not render the 1980 amendment sur-plusage. Congress may simply have intended to codify existing judicial interpretations to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions where courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA\u2019s defense to be broader than the one in TILA, which presents at least as significant a set of concerns about imposing liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, <em>e.g., Ford Motor Credit Co. </em>v. <em>Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 566, 100 S. Ct. 790, 63 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1980) (TILA is \u201c\u2018highly technical\u2019\u201d). Our reluctance to give controlling weight to the TILA amendment in construing the FDCPA is reinforced</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">[559 U.S. 593]</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">by the fact that Congress has not expressly <em>included </em>mistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to \u00a7 1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare, <em>e.g., </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in Expedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding \u201can error of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under that Act]\u201d) with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona fide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act that are silent as to er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>rors of legal judgment).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although Carlisle points out that Congress has amended the FDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting the scope of \u00a7 1692k(c), that does not suggest Congress viewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car-lisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a Court of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to include a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake of law. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>305 F.3d 1107, 1121-1124, and nn. 14-15 (CA10 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Carlisle\u2019s reliance on <em>Heintz, </em>514 U.S. 291, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395, is also unavailing. We held in that case that the FDCPA\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d includes lawyers who regularly, through litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. <em>Id., </em>at 292, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395. We</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">[559 U.S. 594]</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">addressed a concern raised by the petitioner (as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client) that our reading would automatically render liable \u201cany litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim against a debtor,\u201d on the ground that \u00a7 1692e(5) prohibits a debt collector from making any \u201c \u2018threat to take action that cannot legally be taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 295, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395. We expressed skepticism that \u00a7 1692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But even assuming the correctness of petitioner\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona fide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for litigating lawyers was not \u201cso absurd\u201d as to warrant implying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statutory text. <em>Ibid. </em>We had no occasion in <em>Heintz </em>to address the overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our discussion of \u00a7 1692e(5)did not depend on the premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall under the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run lawsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful because of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error. Lawyers can, of course, invoke \u00a7 1692k(c) for violations resulting from qualifying factual errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Carlisle\u2019s remaining arguments do not change our view of \u00a7 1692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between our reading of the term \u201cintentional\u201d in that provision and the instruction in \u00a7 1692k(b) that a court look to whether \u201cnoncompliance was intentional\u201d in assessing statutory additional damages. But assuming \u00a7 1692k(b) encompasses errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in reading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory damages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where a debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection of the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also concerned that under our read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ing, \u00a7 1692k(c) would be unavailable to a debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA applying to acts taken with particular intent because in such instances the relevant act</p>\n<p id=\"Apgi\">[559 U.S. 595]</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">would not be unintentional. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 1692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector from \u201c[clausing a telephone to ring . . . continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass\u201d). Including mistakes as to the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would ensure that \u00a7 1692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We see no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense must cover every provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The parties and <em>amici </em>make arguments concerning the legislative history that we address for the sake of completeness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Committee Report stating that \u201c[a] debt collector has no liability . . . if he violates the act in any manner, including with regard to the act\u2019s coverage, when such violation is unintentional and occurred despite procedures designed to avoid such violations.\u201d S. Rep. No. 95-382, p. 5 (1977); see also <em>post, </em>at 609-611, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 544-546 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (discussing report). But by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unambiguously support Car-lisle\u2019s reading. Even if a bona fide mistake \u201cwith regard to the act\u2019s coverage\u201d could be read in isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading does not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake \u201cwith regard to the act\u2019s coverage\u201d may derive wholly from a debt collector\u2019s factually mistaken belief, for example, that a particular debt arose out of a noncon-sumer transaction and was therefore not \u201ccovered\u201d by the Act. There is no reason to read this passing statement in the Senate Report as contemplating an exemption for legal error that is the product of an attorney\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA\u2014 particularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d until 1986. 100 Stat. 768. Moreover, the reference to \u201cany manner\u201d of violation is expressly qualified by the requirements that the violation be \u201cunintentional\u201d and occur despite maintenance of appropriate procedures. In any event, we need not choose between these possible readings of the Senate Report, as the legislative record taken as a whole does not lend</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">[559 U.S. 596]</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">strong support to Carlisle\u2019s view.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We therefore decline to give controlling weight to this isolated passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Carlisle, its <em>amici, </em>and the dissent raise the additional concern that our reading will have unworkable practical consequences for debt collecting lawyers. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Respondents 40-41, 45-48; NARCA Brief 4-16; <em>post, </em>at 615-624, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 548-554. Carlisle claims the FDC-PA\u2019s private enforcement provisions have fostered a \u201c \u2018cottage industry\u2019 \u201d of professional plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">[559 U.S. 597]</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">who sue debt collectors for trivial violations of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40-41. If debt collecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their reasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the Act, Carlisle and its <em>amici </em>foresee a flood of lawsuits against creditors\u2019 lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attorneys) seeking damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The threat of such liability, in the dissent\u2019s view, creates an irreconcilable conflict between an attorney\u2019s personal financial interest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on behalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the FDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand, exposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving the legal ambiguity against her client\u2019s interest or advising the client to settle\u2014even where there is substantial legal authority for a position favoring the client. <em>Post, </em>at 621-624, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 551-554.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We do not believe our holding today portends such grave consequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several provisions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits, thereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors\u2019 attorneys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the \u201cactual damage[s]\u201d sustained, \u00a7 1692k(a)(1), will likely be <em>de minimis </em>or even zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">[559 U.S. 598]</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The Act sets a cap on \u201cadditional\u201d damages, \u00a7 1692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to adjust such damages where a violation is based on a good-faith error, \u00a7 1692k(b). One <em>am-icus </em>suggests that attorney\u2019s fees may shape financial incentives even where actual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief 11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court\u201d in the case of \u201cany successful action to enforce the foregoing liability.\u201d \u00a7 1692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in calculat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ing reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under this statute,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and \u00a7 1692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">[559 U.S. 599]</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">award attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant if a plaintiff\u2019s suit \u201cwas brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in \u00a7 1692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation stems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act itself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for instance, where a violation results from a qualifying factual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that lawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the Act by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under \u00a7 1692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not frequently issued such opinions, and that the average processing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed, the Government informed us at oral argument that the FTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in response to seven requests), and the FTC\u2019s response time has typically been three or four months. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28, 30. Without disregarding the possibility that the FTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some cases, evidence of present administrative practice makes us reluctant to place significant weight on \u00a7 1692k(e) as a practical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise of Carlisle\u2019s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is a debt collector\u2019s sole recourse to avoid potential liability. We addressed a similar argument in <em>Heintz, </em>in which the petitioner urged that certain of the Act\u2019s substantive provisions would generate \u201c \u2018anomalies\u2019 \u201d if the term \u201cdebt collector\u201d was read to include litigating lawyers. 514 U.S., at 295, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395. Among other things, the petitioner in <em>Heintz </em>contended that \u00a7 1692c(c)\u2019s bar on further communication with a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is refusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>from filing a lawsuit to collect the debt. <em>Id., </em>at 296-297, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395. We agreed it would be \u201codd\u201d if the Act interfered in this way with \u201can ordinary debt-collecting</p>\n<p id=\"AiT4\">[559 U.S. 600]</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">lawsuit\u201d but suggested \u00a7 1692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several exceptions in the text of that provision itself. <em>Ibid. </em>As in <em>Heintz, </em>we need not authoritatively interpret the Act\u2019s conduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provisions should not be assumed to compel absurd results when applied to debt collecting attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a lawyer\u2019s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique in our law.  \u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s ethical duty to advance the interests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct.\u201d <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>475 U.S. 157, 168, 106 S. Ct. 988, 89 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1986). Lawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits presented \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\u201d Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11(b), (c). Model rules of professional conduct adopted by many States impose outer bounds on an attorney\u2019s pursuit of a client\u2019s interests. See, <em>e.g., </em>ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1 (2009) (requiring nonfrivo-lous basis in law and fact for claims asserted); 4.1 (truthfulness to third parties). In some circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability for conduct undertaken during representation of a client. See, <em>e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 191, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994) (\u201cAny person or entity, including a lawyer, . . . who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities and Exchange Commission Rule] 10b-5\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Moreover, a lawyer\u2019s interest in avoiding FDCPA liability may not always be adverse to her client. Some courts have held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers\u2019 violations of the FDCPA. See, <em>e.g., Fox </em>v. <em>Citicorp Credit Servs., Inc., </em>15 F.3d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also <em>First Interstate Bank</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">[559 U.S. 601]</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\"><em>of Fold Collins, N.

App. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The suggestion that our reading of \u00a7 1692k(c) will create unworkable consequences is also undermined by the existence of numerous state consumer protection and debt collection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal errors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Several States have enacted debt collection statutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney debt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all. See, <em>e.g., </em>Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, \u00a7 49 (West 2008); Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 14-203 (Lexis 2005); Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7646.641 (2007); Wis. Stat. \u00a7427.105 (2007-2008). More generally, a group of 21 States as <em>amici </em>supporting Jerman inform us they are aware of \u201cno [judicial] decisions interpreting a parallel state bona fide error provision [in a civil regulatory statute] to immunize a defendant\u2019s mistake of law,\u201d except in a minority of statutes that expressly provide to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>contrary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See Brief for State of New York et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11, and n. 6. Neither Carlisle and its <em>amici </em>nor the dissent demonstrates that lawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these state regimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In the dissent\u2019s view, these policy concerns are evidence that \u201cCongress could not have intended\u201d the reading we adopt today. <em>Post, </em>at 615, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 548. But the dissent\u2019s reading raises concerns of its own. The dissent focuses on the facts of this case, in which an attorney debt collector, in the dissent\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">[559 U.S. 602]</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">view, \u201cacted reasonably at every step\u201d and committed a \u201ctechnical violation\u201d resulting in no \u201cactual harm\u201d to the debtor. Post, at 622, 617, 618, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 552, 549, 550. But the dissent\u2019s legal theory does not limit the defense to attorney debt collectors or \u201ctechnical\u201d violations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under that approach, it appears, nonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel. Moreover, many debt collectors are compensated with a percentage of money recovered, and so will have a financial incentive to press the boundaries of the Act\u2019s prohibitions on collection techniques. It is far from obvious why immunizing debt collectors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of the law would be consistent with the statute\u2019s broadly worded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct.

The increased cost to prospective plaintiffs in time, fees, and uncertainty of outcome may chill private suits under the statutory right of action, undermining the FDCPA\u2019s calibrated scheme of statutory incentives to encourage self-enforcement. Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The Challenges of Change 67 (2009) (\u201cBecause the [FTC] receives more than 70,000 third-party debt collection complaints per year, it is not feasible for federal government law enforcement to be the exclusive or primary means of deterring all possible law violations\u201d).

To the extent debt collecting lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the requirements of the FDCPA, Carlisle, its <em>amici, </em>and the dissent have not shown that \u201cthe result [will be] so absurd as to warrant\u201d disregarding the weight of textual authority discussed above. <em>Heintz, </em>514 U.S., at 295, 115 S.

To the extent Congress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified by the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA\u2019s liability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute accordingly.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to revise \u00a7 1692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or grant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a plaintiffs recovery. This Court may not, however, read more into \u00a7 1692k(c) than the statutory language naturally supports. We therefore hold that [9] the bona fide error defense in \u00a7 1692k(c) does not apply to a violation of</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">[559 U.S. 605]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">the FDCPA resulting from a debt collector\u2019s incorrect interpretation of the requirements of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"pAClR\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"42\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATUAAAApAQAAAAB8B4P9AAAAmklEQVR4nO2TMQoCQRAEewcDM/2A3EfEt/kjMTM08AG+4TIjMVtBLIML7GAWLpEDuclquumdHXYLGlPPGGWT/st39lYOAHRYZVB/Mt91s/92cghJOpnSgJCk7cukBgA8jnbDFKoA3iuTUhj2UtZ2VAMA6sEiUhjybsUicghJ6pe2ixxCki4Li2gAwH1nI6VQp3ovZf7ns29C3wfLAPfgdXKF7gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"308\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">For the reasons discussed above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-12\">.

Noting that district courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results, and distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which Carlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the court adopted the reasoning from <em>Camacho </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Financial, Inc., </em>430 F.3d 1078, 1080-1082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain language of \u00a7 1692g does not impose an \u201cin writing\u2019\u2019 requirement on consumers.

We likewise express no view about whether inclusion of an \u201cin writing\u2019\u2019 requirement in a notice to a consumer violates \u00a7 1692g, as that question was not presented in the petition for certiorari.

The parties disagree about whether \u00a7 1692k(c) applies when a violation results from a debt collector\u2019s misinterpretation of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the FDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47-49 with Brief for Respondents 60-62. Because this case involves only an alleged misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach those other questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">. The dissent discounts the relevance of the principle here, on grounds that this case involves the scope of a statutory exception to liability, rather than a provision \u201cdelineat[ing] a category of prohibited conduct.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 625, 176 L.

That is a distinction without a difference, as our precedents have made clear for more than 175 years. <em>Barlow </em>involved a statute providing for forfeiture of any goods entered \u201cby a false denomination\u201d in the office of a customs collector \u201cfor the benefit of drawback or bounty upon the exportation\u201d; the statute included, however, an exception under which \u201csaid forfeiture shall not be incurred, if it shall be made appear . . . that such false denomination . . . happened by mistake or accident, and not from any intention to defraud the revenue.\u201d 7 Pet., at 406, 8 L.

But the Court declined to resolve the case on the ground of the shipper\u2019s intent, instead invoking the \u201ccommon maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Notwithstanding the existence of a statutory exception\u2014which did not expressly exclude legal errors from the category of \u201cmistake [s]\u201d made without \u201cintention to defraud\u201d\u2014the Court saw \u201cnot the least reason to suppose that the legislature, in this enactment, had any intention to supersede the common principle.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The dissent implies <em>Barlow </em>is too old to be relevant. <em>Post, </em>at 626, 176 L.

See <em>Montejo </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>556 U.S. 778, 792-793, 129 S. Ct. 2079, 173 L. Ed. 2d 955 (2009). In any event, Justice Story\u2019s opinion for a unanimous Court in <em>Barlow </em>is hardly a relic. As recently as 1994 this Court cited it for the \u201cvenerable principle\u201d that ignorance of the law generally is no defense. <em>Ratzlaf v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 149, 114 S.

As noted, in <em>International Minerals, </em>the Court rejected a mistake-of-law defense for a statute that applied to those who \u201cknowingly violat[e]\u2019\u2019 certain regulations. 402 U.S., at 559, 563, 91 S.

Carlisle raises concerns about whether, in light of contemporary administrative practice, the FTC safe harbor is a realistic way for debt collectors and their lawyers to seek guidance on the numerous time-sensitive legal issues that arise in litigation.

See, <em>e.g., Welmaker </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>365 F. Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972). But even assuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather than court of appeals, opinions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>discerning the meaning of the statutory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some doubt on those decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted. See, <em>e.g., Turner </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>537 F.2d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976) <em>(per curiarn) </em>(referring to \u00a7 1640(c) as the \u201cso-called clerical error defense\u2019\u2019). Carlisle also relies on the holding in <em>Thrift Funds of Baton Rouge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>274 So.2d 150 (La. 1973). But in that case, the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded only that a lender\u2019s mistaken interpretation of <em>state </em>usury law did not \u201camoun[t] to an intentional violation of [TILA\u2019s] disclosure requirements.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 161. The Louisiana court had no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we consider today: whether TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense extended to violations resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself. See n. 4, <em>supra; </em>see also <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Orleans Motors, Inc., </em>372 F. Supp. 928, 931 (ED La.) (distinguishing <em>Thrift Funds </em>on this basis), affd, 500 F.2d 1182 (CA5 1974). These precedents therefore do not convince us that Congress would have ascribed a different meaning to the statutory language it chose for the FDCPA. Compare <em>post, </em>at 607, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 543 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), with <em>Herman &amp; MacLean </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>459 U.S. 375, 384-386, and n. 21, 103 S. Ct. 683, 74 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1983) (concluding that Congress had \u201cratified\u201d the \u201cwell-established judicial interpretation\u201d of a statute by leaving it intact during a comprehensive revision, notwithstanding \u201c[t]wo early District Court decisions,\u201d not subsequently followed, that had adopted a contrary view).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">. That only three Courts of Appeals had occasion to address the question by the time the FDCPA was enacted does not render such an inference unreasonable. Contra, <em>post, </em>at 607, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 543 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Whether or not we would take that view when such an inference serves as a court\u2019s sole interpretative guide, here our conclusion also relies on common principles of statutory interpretation, as well as the statute\u2019s text and structure. Moreover, the inference is supported by the fact that TILA and the FDCPA were enacted as complementary titles of the CCPA, a comprehensive consumer protection statute. While not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the legislative record demonstrates that some Members of Congress understood the relationship between the FDCPA and existing provisions of the CCPA. See, <em>e.g., </em>123 Cong. Rec. 10242 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Annunzio) (civil penalty provisions in House version of bill were \u201cconsistent with those in the [CCPA] \u201d); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: Hearings on S. 656 et al. before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 51, 707 (1977) (statement of Rep.

The quoted legislative history sources, however, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes <em>legal </em>errors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors. Similarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction between factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented with claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfactual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See <em>Ives, </em>522 F.2d, at 756-757; <em>Haynes, </em>503 F.2d, at 1166-1167; <em>Palmer, </em>502 F.2d, at 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, constitute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are \u2018Rot intentional\u2019\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1692k(c), we need not and do not decide today the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or what kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs et al., National Consumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection \u00a7 7.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case law on scope of \u00a7 1692k(c)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">.

The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance, has promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(d)(3), does not apply to \u201c[a]n error of legal judgment,\u201d 24 CFR \u00a7 3500.15(b)(1)(h) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other statutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that no agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course, nothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations or the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in other statutes to adopt a different reading. See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. </em>v. <em>Brand X Internet Services, </em>545 U.S. 967, 982-983, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L.

For instance, an amendment was proposed and rejected during the Senate Banking Committee\u2019s consideration of the FDCPA that would have required proof that a debt collector\u2019s violation was \u201cknowin[g].\u201d Senator Riegle, one of the Act\u2019s primary sponsors, opposed the change, explaining that the bill reflected the view that \u201ccertain things ought not to happen, period. . . .

To similar effect, a House Report on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new legislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds that existing statutes \u201cfrequently require[d]\u2019\u2019 a showing of \u201cspecific intent[,] which is difficult to prove.\u2019\u2019 H. R. Rep. No. 95-131, p. 3 (1977). Elsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements more supportive of Carlisle\u2019s interpretation. In particular, a concern was raised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error defense had been interpreted \u201cas only protecting against a mathematical error,\u2019\u2019 and that the FDCPA defense should \u201cgo beyond\u2019\u2019 TILA to \u201callow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a technical error.\u2019\u2019 Markup 20.

See Brief for Respondents 44-48; <em>Heintz </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>514 U.S. 291, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1995). Can those lawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face personal liability when they rely on good-faith interpretations of the Act that are later rejected by a court? Or will that threat of personal liability lead them to do less than their best for those clients?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a way out of\u2014though not a panacea for\u2014this dilemma. <em>Ante, </em>at 588, 599, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 531-532, 538-539. Faced with legal uncertainty, a lawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) for an advisory opinion. 16 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1.1 to 1.4 (2009). And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it the dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion, he has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable. If he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any such liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(e) (debt collectors immune from liability for \u201cany act done or omitted in . . . conformity with any advisory opinion of the Commission\u201d). See also R. Hobbs et al., National Consumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection \u00a7\u00a7 6.12.2, 7.3 (6th ed. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">[559 U.S. 606]</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The FTC, of course, may refuse to issue such an opinion. See, <em>e.g., </em>16 CFR \u00a7 1.1 (providing that the Commission will issue advisory opinions \u201cwhere practicable\u201d and only when \u201c [t]he matter involves a substantial or novel question of fact or law and there is no clear Commission or court precedent\u201d or \u201cis of significant public interest\u201d). Apparently, within the past decade, the FTC has received only seven requests and issued four opinions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28; see also FTC, Commission FDCPA Advisory Opinions, online at http:// www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/ fdcpajump.shtm (as visited Apr. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Yet, should the dilemma I have described above prove serious, I would expect the FTC to receive more requests and to respond to them, thereby reducing the scope of the problem to the point where other available tools, <em>e.g., </em>damages caps and vicarious liability, will prove adequate. See <em>ante, </em>at 597-601, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 537-540.

A portion of the Court\u2019s reasoning consists of this: The language in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act) tracks language in the Truth in Lending Act (TILA); and in the nine years between the enactment of TILA and the enactment of the FDCPA, three Courts of Appeals had \u201cinter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>preted TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 589, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532. Relying on our statement in <em>Bragdon </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>524 U.S. 624, 645, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998), that Congress\u2019s repetition, in a new statute, of statutory language with a \u201c \u2018settled\u2019 \u201d judicial interpretation indicates \u201c \u2018the intent to incorporate its . . .judicial interpretations as well,\u2019 \u201d the Court concludes that these three Court of Appeals cases \u201csuppor[t] an inference that Congress understood the statutory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">[559 U.S. 607]</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">with Federal Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 590, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532-533.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Let me assume (though I do not believe it) that what counts is what Congress \u201cintended,\u201d even if that intent finds no expression in the enacted text. When a large majority of the Circuits, over a lengthy period of time, have uniformly reached a certain conclusion as to the meaning of a particular statutory text, it may be reasonable to assume that Congress was aware of those holdings, took them to be correct, and intended the same meaning in adopting that text.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It seems to me unreasonable, however, to assume that, when Congress has a bill before it that contains language used in an earlier statute, it is aware of, and approves as correct, a mere three Court of Appeals decisions interpreting that earlier statute over the previous nine years. Can one really believe that a majority in both Houses of Congress knew of those three cases, and accepted them as correct (even when, as was the case here, some District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court opinion had concluded, to the contrary, that the defense covered legal errors, see <em>ante, </em>at 589-590, n. 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532-533)? This is a legal fiction, which has nothing to be said for it except that it can sometimes make our job easier. The Court acknowledges that \u201cthe interpretations of three Federal Courts of Appeals may not have \u2018settled\u2019 the meaning of TI-LA\u2019s bona fide error defense,\u201d but says \u201cthere is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed with those interpretations.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 590, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 533. Perhaps not; but no reason to suppose that it knew of and agreed with them either\u2014which is presumably the proposition for which the Court cites them.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">[559 U.S. 608]</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Even assuming, moreover, that Congress knew and approved of those cases, they would not support the Court\u2019s conclusion today. All three of them said that TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense covered only <em>clerical </em>errors. See <em>Ives </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>522 F.2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975) (\u201conly available for clerical errors\u201d); <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., </em>503 F.2d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974) (\u201cbasically only clerical errors\u201d); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>502 F.2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (\u201c[C]lerical errors . . . are the only violations this section was designed to excuse\u201d). Yet the Court specifically interprets the identical language in the FDCPA as providing a defense not only for clerical errors, but also for <em>factual </em>errors. See <em>ante, </em>at 594, 599, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 535, 538; see also <em>ante, </em>at 595, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>176 L. Ed. 2d, at 536 (suggesting the same). If the Court really finds the three Courts of Appeals\u2019 interpretations of TILA indicative of congressional intent in the FDCPA, it should restrict its decision accordingly. As for me, I support the Court\u2019s inclusion of factual errors, because there is nothing in the text of the FDCPA limiting the excusable \u201cnot intentional\u201d violations to those based on clerical errors, and since there is a long tradition in the common law and in our construction of federal statutes distinguishing errors of fact from errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The Court\u2019s opinion also makes fulsome use of that other legal fiction, legislative history, ranging from a single Representative\u2019s floor remarks on the House bill that became the FDCPA, <em>ante, </em>at 590-591, n. 11, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 533, to a single Representative\u2019s remarks in a Senate Subcommittee hearing on the House bill and three Senate bills, <em>ibid., </em>to two 1979 Senate Committee Reports dealing not with the FDCPA but with the 1980 amendments to TILA, <em>ante, </em>at 591-592, n. 12, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 534, to remarks in a Committee markup of the Senate bill on the FDCPA, <em>ante, </em>at 596, n. 14, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 536-537, to a House Report dealing with an earlier version of the FDCPA, <em>ibid. </em>Is the conscientious attorney really expected to dig out such mini-nuggets of \u201ccongressional intent\u201d from floor remarks, committee hearings, committee markups, and committee reports covering many different</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">[559 U.S. 609]</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">bills over many years? When the Court addresses such far-afield legislative history merely \u201cfor the sake of completeness,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 595, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 536, it encourages and indeed prescribes such wasteful over-lawyering.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">As it happens, moreover, one of the supposedly most \u201cauthoritative\u201d snippets of legislative history, a Senate Committee Report dealing with the meaning of TILA, states very clearly that the 1980 amendment to TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense \u201cclarified\u201d the defense \u201cto make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,\u201d S. Rep. No. 96-73, pp. 7-8 (1979). Likewise, the 1999 American Law Report the Court cites, <em>ante, </em>at 591-592, n. 12, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 534, which relies on another Senate Committee Report, describes the amendment as clarifying the \u201cprevailing view\u201d that the defense \u201capplies to clerical errors,\u201d Lockhart, 153 A.L.R. Fed. 211-212, \u00a72[a].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once again, the legal fiction contradicts the Court\u2019s conclusion that the language in the FDCPA, identical to the original TILA defense, applies to mistakes of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">But if legislative history is to be used, it should be used impartially. (Legislative history, after all, almost always has something for everyone!) The Court dismisses with a wave of the hand what seems to me the most persuasive legislative history (if legislative history could ever be persuasive) in the case. The respondents point to the Senate Committee Report on the FDCPA, which says that \u201c[a] debt collector has no liability ... if he violates the act in any manner, <em>including with regard to the act\u2019s coverage, </em>when such violation is unintentional and occurred despite procedures designed to avoid such viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>tions.\u201d S. Rep. No. 95-382, p. 5 (1977) (emphasis added). The Court claims that a mistake about \u201cthe act\u2019s coverage\u201d in this passage might</p>\n<p id=\"annk-dedup-1\">[559 U.S. 610]</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">refer to factual mistakes, such as a debt collector\u2019s mistaken belief \u201cthat a particular debt arose out of a noncon-sumer transaction and was therefore not \u2018covered\u2019 by the Act,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 595, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 536. The Court\u2019s explanation seems to me inadequate. No lawyer\u2014indeed, no one speaking accurately\u2014would equate a mistake regarding the Act\u2019s coverage with a mistake regarding whether a particular fact situation falls within the Act\u2019s coverage. What the Act covers (\u201cthe act\u2019s coverage\u201d) is one thing; whether a particular case falls <em>within </em>the Act\u2019s coverage is something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Even if (contrary to my perception) the phrase <em>could </em>be used to refer to <em>both </em>these things, by what principle does the Court reject the more plausible meaning? The fact that \u201cattorneys were excluded from the Act\u2019s definition of \u2018debt collector\u2019 until 1986,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>does not, as the Court contends, support its conclusion that errors of law are not covered. Attorneys are not the only ones who would have been able to claim a legal-error defense; nonattorneys make legal mistakes too. They also sometimes receive and rely upon erroneous legal advice from attorneys. Indeed, if anyone could satisfy the defense\u2019s requirement of maintaining \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c), a legal error, it would be a nonattorney debt collector who follows the procedure of directing all legal questions to his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The Court also points to \u201cequivocal\u201d evidence from the Senate Committee\u2019s final markup session, <em>ante, </em>at 596, n. 14, 176 L.

The Court today interprets this exception to exclude legal errors. In doing so, it adopts a questionable</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">[559 U.S. 612]</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">interpretation and rejects a straightforward, quite reasonable interpretation of the statute\u2019s plain terms. Its decision aligns the judicial system with those who would use litigation to enrich themselves at the expense of attorneys who strictly follow and adhere to professional and ethical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">When the law is used to punish good-faith mistakes; when adopting reasonable safeguards is not enough to avoid liability; when the costs of discovery and litigation are used to force settlement even absent fault or injury; when class-action suits transform technical legal violations into windfalls for plaintiffs or their attorneys, the Court, by failing to adopt a reasonable interpretation to counter these excesses, risks compromising its own institutional responsibility to ensure a workable and just litigation system. The interpretation of the FDCPA the Court today endorses will entrench, not eliminate, some of the most troubling aspects of our legal system. Convinced that Congress did not intend this result, I submit this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">The FDCPA addresses \u201cabusive debt collection practices,\u201d \u00a7 1692(e), by regulating interactions between commercial debt collectors and consumers. See <em>ante, </em>at 577, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 525. The statute permits private suits against debt collectors who violate its provisions. \u00a7 1692k(a). An exception to liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">\u201cA debt collector may not be held liable in any action ... if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d \u00a7 1692k(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">[559 U.S. 613]</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">This language does not exclude mistakes of law and is most naturally read to include them. Certainly a mistaken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a \u201cbona fide error\u201d as that phrase is normally understood. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cerror\u201d as \u201ca belief that what is false is true or that what is true is false,\u201d def. 1); <em>ibid, </em>(\u201c[a] mistake of law or of fact in a tribunal\u2019s judgment, opinion, or order,\u201d def. 2); <em>ibid. </em>(listing categories of legal errors).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">The choice of words provides further reinforcement for this view. The bona fide error exception in \u00a7 1692k(c) applies if \u201cthe violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error.\u201d The term \u201cviolation\u201d specifically denotes a legal infraction. See <em>id., </em>at 1600 (\u201cAn infraction or breach of the law; a transgression,\u201d def. 1). The statutory term \u201cviolation\u201d thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>stands in direct contrast to other provisions of the FDCPA that describe conduct itself. This applies both to specific terms, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 1692e (\u201cA debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt\u201d), and to more general ones, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 1692k(e) (referring to \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith\u201d). By linking the <em>mens rea </em>requirement (\u201cnot intentional\u201d) with the word \u201cviolation\u201d\u2014rather than with the conduct giving rise to the violation\u2014the Act by its terms indicates that the bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well as to factual ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The Court\u2019s precedents accord with this interpretation. Federal statutes that link the term \u201cviolation\u201d with a <em>mens rea </em>requirement have been interpreted to excuse good-faith legal mistakes. See, <em>e.g., McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Richland Shoe Co., </em>486 U.S. 128, 129, 133, 108 S. Ct. 1677, 100 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1988) (the phrase \u201c \u2018arising out of a willful violation\u2019 \u201d in the Fair Labor Standards Act applies where an employer \u201ceither knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute\u201d); <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>469</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">[559 U.S. 614]</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">U.S. 111, 125, 126, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985) (damages provision under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which applies \u201conly in cases of willful violations,\u201d creates liability where an employer \u201cknew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. <em>Liparota </em>v. <em>United States, </em>471 U.S. 419, 428, 105 S. Ct. 2084, 85 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1985) (prohibition on use of food stamps \u201c \u2018knowing [them] to have been received ... in violation of\u2019 \u201d federal law \u201cundeniably requires a knowledge of illegality\u201d (emphasis deleted)). The FDCPA\u2019s use of \u201cviolation\u201d thus distinguishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the Court to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are disfavored. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 581-583, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 527-529 (citing <em>Kolstad </em>v. <em>American Dental Assn., </em>527 U.S. 526, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Court\u2019s response is that there is something distinctive about the word \u201cwillful\u201d that suggests an excuse for mistakes of law. This may well be true for criminal statutes, in which the terms \u201c \u2018knowing,\u2019 \u2018intentional,\u2019 [and] \u2018willful\u2019 \u201d have been distinguished in this regard. <em>Ante, </em>at 585, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 529-530 (citing <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>551 U.S. 47, 57, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (2007)). But this distinction is specific to the criminal context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201cIt is different in the criminal law. When the term \u2018willful\u2019 or \u2018willfully\u2019 has been used in a criminal statute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting liability to knowing violations. This reading of the term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where it is characteristically used to require a criminal intent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt, or an additional \u201c \u2018bad purpose,\u2019 \u201d or specific intent to violate a known legal duty created by highly technical statutes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 57-58, n. 9, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1045, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">For this reason, the Court\u2019s citation to criminal cases, which are themselves inconsistent, see <em>Ratzlaf </em>v. <em>United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1994), is unavailing. See <em>ante, </em>at 585-586, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 529-531, and n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>[559 U.S. 615]</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In the civil context, by contrast, the word \u201cwillful\u201d has been used to impose a <em>mens rea </em>threshold for liability that is lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement. See <em>Safeco, supra, </em>at 57, 127 S. Ct. 2201, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1045 (\u201c[W]here willfulness is a statutory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as well\u201d). Avoiding liability under a statute aimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier, not harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed at willful violations. And certainly there is nothing in <em>Thurston </em>or McLaughlin\u2014both civil cases\u2014suggesting that they would have come out differently had the relevant statutes used \u201cintentional violation\u201d rather than \u201cwillful violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">These considerations suffice to show that \u00a7 1692k(c) is most reasonably read to include mistakes of law. Even if this were merely a permissible reading, however, it should be adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must flow from the Court\u2019s contrary decision. The Court\u2019s reading leads to results Congress could not have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Congress has enacted to protect consumers. A number of these statutes authorize the filing of private suits against those who use unfair or improper practices. See, <em>e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k (FDCPA); \u00a7 1640 (Truth in Lending Act); \u00a7 1681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32710 (federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526(c)(2) (Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005). Several of these provisions permit a successful plaintiff to recover\u2014in addition to actual damages\u2014statutory damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and in some cases punitive damages. <em>E.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(2) (statutory damages); \u00a7 1640(a)(3) (attorney\u2019s fees and costs); \u00a7 1681n(a)(l)(B) (statutory</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">[559 U.S. 616]</p>\n<p id=\"AYfE\">and punitive damages); \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney\u2019s fees); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32710(a) (\u201c3 times the actual damages or $1,500, whichever is greater\u201d); \u00a7 32710(b) (costs and attorney\u2019s fees); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney\u2019s fees). Some also explicitly permit class-action suits. <em>E.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B); \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create incentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has occurred. This happens when the plaintiff can recover statutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney will receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how slight the injury. A favorable verdict after trial is not necessarily the goal; often the plaintiff will be just as happy with a settlement, as will his or her attorney (who will receive fees regardless). The defendant, meanwhile, may conclude a quick settlement is preferable to the costs of discovery and a protracted trial. And if the suit attains class-action status, the financial stakes rise in magnitude. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 1640(a)(2)(B) (class-action recovery of up to \u201cthe lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the [defendant]\u201d); \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The present case offers an object lesson. Respondents filed a complaint in state court on behalf of a client that mistakenly believed Jerman owed money to it. Jerman\u2019s attorney then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>informed respondents that the debt had been paid in full. Respondents confirmed this fact with the client and withdrew the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">This might have been the end of the story. But because respondents had informed Jerman that she was required to dispute the debt in writing, she filed a class-action complaint. It did not matter that Jerman had claimed no harm as a result of respondents\u2019 actions. Jerman sued for damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs\u2014including class damages of \u201c$500,000 or 1% of defendants\u2019 net worth whichever is less.\u201d Amended Complaint in No. 1:06-CV-01397 (ND Ohio), p. 4. In addition to merits-related discovery, Jerman sought information from respondents concerning the income and net</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">[559 U.S. 617]</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">worth of each partner in the firm. At some point, Jerman proposed to settle with respondents for $15,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney\u2019s fees. Amended Joint App. in No. 07-3964 (CA6), pp. 256-262. The case illustrates how a technical violation of a complex federal statute can give rise to costly litigation with incentives to settle simply to avoid attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Today\u2019s holding gives new impetus to this already troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the system to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into lucrative litigation, if not for themselves then for the attorneys who conceive of the suit. See <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation </em>v. <em>Lamar, </em>503 F.3d 504, 513 (CA6 2007) (referring to the \u201ccottage industry\u201d of litigation that has arisen out of the FDCPA (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is clear that Congress, too, was troubled by this dynamic. That is precisely why it enacted a bona fide error defense. The Court\u2019s ruling, however, endorses and drives forward this dynamic, for today\u2019s holding leaves attorneys and their clients vulnerable to civil liability for adopting good-faith legal positions later determined to be mistaken, even if reasonable efforts were made to avoid mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The Court seeks to brush aside these concerns by noting that trivial violations will give rise to little in the way of actual damages and that trial courts \u201chave discretion in calculating reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under [the] statute.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 598, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 537-538. It is not clear, however, that a court is permitted to adjust a fee award based on its assessment of the suit\u2019s utility. Cf. <em>Perdue </em>v. <em>Kenny A., ante, </em>at 554, 130 S. Ct. 1662, 176 L. Ed. 2d 494 (noting a \u201c \u2018strong presumption\u2019 \u201d of reasonableness that attaches to a lodestar calculation of attorney\u2019s fees). Though the Court, properly, does not address the question here, it acknowledges that some courts have deemed fee awards to victorious plaintiffs to be \u201c \u2018mandatory,\u2019 \u201d even if the plaintiff suffered no damage. <em>Ante, </em>at 598, n. 16, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">[559 U.S. 618]</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The Court\u2019s second response is that the FDCPA guards against abusive suits and that suits brought \u201c \u2018in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment\u2019 \u201d can lead to a fee award for the defendant. Ante, at 599, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 538 (quoting \u00a7 1692k(a)(3)). Yet these safeguards cannot deter suits based on technical\u2014but harmless\u2014 violations of the statute. If the plaintiff obtains a favorable judgment or a settlement, then by definition the suit will not have been brought in bad faith. See <em>Emanuel </em>v. <em>American Credit Exch., </em>870 F.2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989) (FDCPA defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>malicious prosecution cannot succeed unless the action subject of the claim is unsuccessful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Again the present case is instructive. Jerman brought suit without pointing to any actual harm that resulted from respondents\u2019 actions. At the time her complaint was filed, it was an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether a debt collector could demand that a debt be disputed in writing, and the district courts in the Circuit had reached different answers. <em>Ante, </em>at 579, n. 2, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 526. The trial court in this case happened to side with Jerman on the issue, 464 F. Supp. 2d 720, 722-725 (ND Ohio 2006), but it seems unlikely that the court would have labeled her suit \u201cabusive\u201d or \u201cin bad faith\u201d even if it had gone the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">There is no good basis for optimism, then, when one contemplates the practical consequences of today\u2019s decision. Given the complexity of the FDCPA regime, see 16 CFR pt. 901 (2009) (FDCPAregulations), technical violations are likely to be common. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that they are inevitable. See <em>ante, </em>at 587, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 531. As long as legal mistakes occur, plaintiffs and their attorneys will have an incentive to bring suits for these infractions. It seems unlikely that Congress sought to create a system that encourages costly and time-consuming litigation over harmless violations committed in good faith despite reasonable safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">When construing a federal statute, courts should be mindful of the effect of the interpretation on congressional purposes</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">[559 U.S. 619]</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">explicit in the statutory text. The FDCPA states an objective that today\u2019s decision frustrates. The statutory purpose was to \u201celiminate abusive debt collection practices\u201d and to ensure that debt collectors who refrain from using those practices \u201care not competitively disadvantaged.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e) (\u201cPurposes\u201d). The practices Congress addressed involved misconduct that is deliberate, see \u00a7 1692(a) (\u201cabusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices\u201d); \u00a7 1692(c) (\u201cmisrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices\u201d), or unreasonable, see \u00a7 1692c(a)(l) (prohibiting debt collectors from communicating with debtors at times \u201cwhich should be known\u201d to be inconvenient); \u00a7 1692e(8) (prohibiting the communication of credit card information \u201cwhich should be known to be false\u201d). That explains the statutory objective not to disadvantage debt collectors who \u201crefrain\u201d from abusive practices\u2014that is to say, debt collectors who do not intentionally or unreasonably adopt them. It further explains why Congress included a good-faith error exception, which exempts violations that are not intentional or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In referring to \u201cabusive debt collection practices,\u201d however, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who act based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal interpretations. A debt collector does not gain a competitive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more than by making good-faith factual errors. This is expressly so if the debt collector has implemented \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid\u201d them. By reading \u00a7 1692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court fails to align its interpretation with the statutory objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy concerns on the other side. The Court frets about debt collectors who \u201cpress the boundaries of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the Act\u2019s prohibitions\u201d and about a potential \u201c \u2018race to the bottom.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 602, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 540 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32). For instance, in its view, interpreting \u00a7 1692k(c) to encompass legal mistakes might</p>\n<p id=\"AZpK\">[559 U.S. 620]</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">mean that \u201cnonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 602, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 540. It must be remembered, however, that \u00a7 1692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector\u2019s error is \u201cbona fide\u201d and where \u201creasonable procedures\u201d have been adopted to avoid errors. There is no valid or persuasive reason to assume that Congress would want to impose liability on a debt collector who relies in good faith on the reasonable advice of counsel. If anything, we should expect Congress to think that such behavior should be encouraged, not discouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The Court also suggests that reading \u00a7 1692k(c) to include legal errors would encourage litigation over a number of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liability; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes; what standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney debt collectors as compared to nonat-torney debt collectors. Yet these questions are no different from ones already raised by the statute. Whether the debt collector is an attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be assessed before liability can be determined. Procedures to avoid mistakes\u2014whether legal or otherwise\u2014 must be \u201creasonable,\u201d which is always a context-specific inquiry. The Court provides no reason to think that legal errors raise concerns that differ in these respects from those raised by nonlegal errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">There is a further and most serious reason to interpret \u00a7 1692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes. In <em>Heintz </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>514 U.S. 291, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1995), the Court held that attorneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be \u201cdebt collectors\u201d for purposes of the FDCPA. In reaching this conclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its interpretation would produce the anomalous result that attorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against debtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful. <em>Id., </em>at 295. The Court rejected</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">[559 U.S. 621]</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">this argument. In doing so it said that \u00a7 1692k(c) provides debt collectors with a defense for their bona fide errors. <em>Id., </em>at 295,115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Today the Court relies on <em>Heintz </em>to allay concerns about the practical implications of its decision. Ante, at 599-600, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 538-539. Yet the Court reads \u00a7 1692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law, thereby producing the very result that <em>Heintz </em>said would not come about. Attorneys may now be held liable for taking reasonable legal positions in good faith if those positions are ultimately rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Attorneys are dutybound to represent their clients with diligence, creativity, and painstaking care, all within the confines of the law. When statutory provisions have not yet been interpreted in a definitive way, principled advocacy is to be prized, not punished. Surely this includes offering interpretations of a statute that are permissible, even if not yet settled. The FDCPA is a complex statute, and its provisions are subject to different interpretations. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 580-581, n. 4, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>527 (identifying splits of authority on two different FDCPA issues); Brief for National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5-6 (identifying another split); see also <em>ante, </em>at 587, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 531. Attorneys will often find themselves confronted with a statutory provision that is susceptible to different but still reasonable interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">An attorney\u2019s obligation in the face of uncertainty is to give the client his or her best professional assessment of the law\u2019s mandate. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation of the FDCPA, however, even that might leave the attorney vulnerable to suit. For if the attorney proceeds based on an interpretation later rejected by the courts, today\u2019s decision deems that to be actionable as an intentional \u201cviolation,\u201d with personal financial liability soon to follow. Indeed, even where a particular practice is compelled by existing precedent, the attorney may be sued if that precedent is later overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">[559 U.S. 622]</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">These adverse consequences are evident in the instant case. When respondents filed a foreclosure complaint against Jerman on behalf of their client, they had no reason to doubt that the debt was valid. They had every reason, furthermore, to believe that they were on solid legal ground in asking her to dispute the amount owed in writing. See, <em>e.g., Graziano </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>950 F.2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991) (written objection is necessary for coherent statutory scheme and protects the debtor by \u201ccreat[ing] a lasting record of the fact that the debt has been disputed\u201d). When Jerman disputed the debt, respondents verified that the debt had been satisfied and withdrew the lawsuit. Respondents acted reasonably at every step, and yet may still find themselves liable for a harmless violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">After today\u2019s ruling, attorneys can be punished for advocacy reasonably deemed to be in compliance with the law or even required by it. This distorts the legal process. Henceforth, creditors\u2019 attorneys of the highest ethical standing are encouraged to adopt a debtor-friendly interpretation of every question, lest the attorneys themselves incur personal financial risk. It is most disturbing that this Court now adopts a statutory interpretation that will interject an attorney\u2019s personal financial interests into the professional and ethical dynamics of the attorney-client relationship. These consequences demonstrate how untenable the Court\u2019s statutory interpretation is and counsel in favor of a different reading. See <em>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P. A. </em>v. <em>United States, ante, </em>at 246, n. 5, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 176 L. Ed. 2d 79 (rejecting a reading of federal law that \u201cwould seriously undermine the attorney-client relationship\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The Court\u2019s response is that this possibility is nothing new, because attorneys are already dutybound to comply with the law and with standards of professional conduct. Attorneys face sanctions for harassing behavior and frivolous litigation, and in some cases misconduct may give rise to personal liability. <em>Ante, </em>at 600-601, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 539-540.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">[559 U.S. 623]</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">This response only underscores the problem with the Court\u2019s approach. By reading \u00a7 1692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law, the Court ensures that attorneys will face liability even when they have done nothing wrong\u2014indeed, even when they have acted in accordance with their profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sional responsibilities. Here respondents\u2019 law firm did not harass Jer-man; it did not file a frivolous suit against her; it did not intentionally mislead her; it caused her no damages or injury. The firm acted upon a reasonable legal interpretation that the District Court later thought to be mistaken. The District Court\u2019s position, as all concede, was in conflict with other published, reasoned opinions. <em>Ante, </em>at 579, n. 2, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 526. (And in the instant case, neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has decided the issue. See <em>ante, </em>at 580, n. 3, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 527.) If the law firm can be punished for making a good-faith legal error, then to be safe an attorney must always stick to the most debtor-friendly interpretation of the statute, lest automatic liability follow if some later decision adopts a different rule. This dynamic creates serious concerns, not only for the attorney-client relationship but also for First Amendment rights. Cf. <em>Legal Services Corporation </em>v. <em>Velazquez, </em>531 U.S. 533, 545, 121 S. Ct. 1043, 149 L. Ed. 2d 63 (2001) (law restricting arguments available to attorneys \u201cprohibits speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power\u201d). We need not decide that these concerns rise to the level of an independent constitutional violation, see <em>ante, </em>at 604, n. 21, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 541, to recognize that they counsel against a problematic interpretation of the statute. See <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. </em>v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S. Ct. 1392, 99 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1988) (\u201c[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Justice Breyer\u2014although not the Court\u2014argues that an attorney faced with legal uncertainty only needs to turn</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">[559 U.S. 624]</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for an advisory opinion. An attorney\u2019s actions in conformity with the opinion will be shielded from liability. <em>Ante, </em>at 605, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 542 (concurring opinion) (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(e)). This argument misconceives the practical realities of litigation. Filings and motions are made under pressing time constraints; arguments must be offered quickly in reply; and strategic decisions must be taken in the face of incomplete information. Lawyers in practice would not consider this alternative at all realistic, particularly where the defense is needed most.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">And even were there time to generate a formal request to the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for a response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argument assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious, not latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that a conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be made. But the problem in many instances is that interpretive alternatives are not at once apparent. All this may explain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only four opinions in response to just seven requests. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28, 30. The FTC advisory process does not remedy the difficulties that the Court\u2019s opinion will cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethical dilemma of counsel is not resolved. If the FTC adopts a position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the FTC is mistaken. Yet under today\u2019s decision, the attorney who in good faith continues to assert a reasonable position to the contrary does so at risk of personal liability. This alters the ethical balance central to the adversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court to adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to avoid systemic disruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Court does not assert that its interpretation is clearly commanded by the text. Instead, its decision relies on an</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">[559 U.S. 625]</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are said to establish the superiority of its preferred reading. This does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">First, the Court relies on the maxim that \u201c \u2018ignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 581, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 527 (quoting <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>United States, </em>7 Pet. 404, 411, 8 L. Ed. 728 (1833)). There is no doubt that this principle \u201cis deeply rooted in the American legal system.\u201d <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 199, 111 S. Ct. 604, 112 L. Ed. 2d 617 (1991). Yet it is unhelpful to the Court\u2019s position. The maxim the Court cites is based on the premise \u201cthat the law is definite and knowable,\u201d so that all must be deemed to know its mandate. <em>Ibid. See </em>also O. Holmes, The Common Law 48 (1881) (\u201c[T]o admit the excuse [of ignorance] at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make men know and obey\u201d). In other words, citizens cannot avoid compliance with the law simply by demonstrating a failure to learn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The most straightforward application of this principle is to statutory provisions that delineate a category of prohibited conduct. These statutes will not be read to excuse legal mistakes absent some indication that the legislature meant to do so. See, <em>e.g., Armour Packing Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>209 U.S. 56, 70, 85-86, 28 S. Ct. 428, 52 L. Ed. 681 (1908) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s attempt to read a mistake-of-law defense into a criminal statute forbidding shippers to \u201cobtain or dispose of property at less than the regular rate established\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 583, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 528-529 (discussing a federal statute imposing liability for \u201c \u2018intentional discrimination\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">In the present case, however, the Court is not asked whether a mistake of law should excuse respondents from a general prohibition that would otherwise cover their conduct. Rather, the issue is the scope of an express exception to a general prohibition. There is good reason to think the distinction matters. It is one thing to presume that Congress does not intend to create an exception to a general rule through silence; it is quite another to presume that an explicit</p>\n<p id=\"A4CN\">[559 U.S. 626]</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">statutory exception should be confined despite the existence of other sensible interpretations. Cf. <em>Kosak </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U.S. 848, 853-854, n. 9, 104 S. Ct. 1519, 79 L. Ed. 2d 860 (1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity, \u201cthe proper objective of a court attempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception\u2014no less and no more\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is all the more true where the other possible interpretations are more consistent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme. By its terms, \u00a7 1692k(c) encompasses\u2014without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>limitation\u2014all violations that are \u201cnot intentional and resul[t] from a bona fide error.\u201d The Court provides no reason to read this language narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The Court responds that \u201cour precedents have made clear for more than 175 years\u201d that the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit statutory exceptions. <em>Ante, </em>at 582, n. 5, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 528. By this the Court means that one case applied the presumption to an exception more than 175 years ago. In <em>Barlow, </em>the Court declined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statutory provision that excepted \u201cfalse denomination [s] . . . [that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any intention to defraud the revenue.\u201d 7 Pet., at 406, 8 L. Ed. 728. In construing this language, the <em>Barlow </em>Court noted that it demonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201cThe very association of mistake and accident, in this [connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume that the legislature had the same classes of cases in view . . . . Mistakes in the construction of the law, seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso, as accidents in the construction of the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 411-412, 8 L. Ed. 728.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Unlike the provision at issue in <em>Barlow, </em>\u00a7 1692k(c) gives no indication that its broad reference to \u201cbona fide error [s]\u201d was meant to exclude legal mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">[559 U.S. 627]</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Even if statutory exceptions should normally be construed to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guideline would only apply absent intent to depart from the general rule. There is no doubt that Congress may create a mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has done so here. See <em>Ratzlaf, </em>510 U.S., at 149, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615. As explained above, see Part I-A, <em>supra, </em>Congress has made its choice plain by using the word \u201cviolation\u201d in \u00a7 1692k(c) to indicate that mistakes of law are to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between \u00a7 1692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 <em>et seq. </em>Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with \u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that [an] act is\u201d prohibited under the FDCPA. \u00a7\u00a7 45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16 CFR \u00a7 1.98(d) (2009)). The Court reasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide relatively harsh penalties for intentional violations. By contrast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA itself must cover\u2014and hence \u00a7 1692k(c) must not excuse\u2014 unintentional violations. <em>Ante, </em>at 583-584, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 528-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The argument rests on a mistaken premise\u2014namely, that \u00a7 1692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none. This misreads the statute. As the text states, it applies only to \u201cbona fide\u201d errors committed despite \u201cthe maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid\u201d these mistakes. So under a sensible reading of the statute, (1) intentional violations are punishable under the heightened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations are generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA; and (3) a defendant may escape liability altogether by proving that a violation was based on a bona fide error and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in place. There is nothing incongruous in this scheme. Indeed, for the reasons described</p>\n<p id=\"ayqn-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 628]</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">in Part I, <em>supra, </em>it is far less peculiar than the Court\u2019s reading, which would subject attorneys to liability for good-faith legal advocacy, even advocacy based on an accurate assessment of then-existing case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Third, in construing \u00a7 1692k(c) to exclude legal errors, the Court points to the requirement that a debt collector maintain \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d The Court asserts that this phrase most naturally evokes procedures to avoid clerical or factual mistakes. There is nothing natural in reading this phrase contrary to its plain terms, which do not distinguish between different categories of mistakes. Nor is there anything unusual about procedures adopted to avoid legal mistakes. The present case is again instructive. According to the District Court, respondents designated a lead FDCPA compliance attorney, who regularly attended conferences and seminars; subscribed to relevant periodicals; distributed leading FDCPA cases to all attorneys; trained new attorneys on their statutory obligations; and held regular firmwide meetings on FDCPA issues. See 538 F.3d 469, 477 (CA6 2008). These procedures are not only \u201creasonably adapted to avoid [legal] error[s],\u201d but also accord with the FDCPA\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The Court argues, nonetheless, that the statute contemplates only clerical or factual errors, for these are the type of errors that can mostly naturally be addressed through \u201c \u2018a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 587, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 531 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1807 (1976)). As made clear by the steps that respondents have taken to ensure FDCPA compliance, this is simply not true. The Court also speculates that procedures to avoid clerical or factual errors will be easier to implement than procedures to avoid legal errors. Even if this were not pure conjecture, it has nothing to do with what the statute requires. The statute does not talk about procedures that eliminate all\u2014or even most\u2014errors. It merely requires procedures \u201creasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">[559 U.S. 629]</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">The statute adopts the sensible approach of requiring reasonable safeguards if liability is to be avoided. This approach, not the Court\u2019s interpretation, reflects the reality of debt-collection practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Fourth, the Court argues that construing \u00a7 1692k(c) to encompass a mistake-of-law defense \u201cis at odds with\u201d the role contemplated for the FTC. <em>Ante, </em>at 588, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 531-532. This is so, it contends, because the FTC is authorized to issue advisory opinions, and the statute shields from liability \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity\u201d with such opinions. \u00a7 1692k(e). But why, asks the Court, would a debt collector seek an opinion from the FTC if immunity under \u00a7 1692k(c) could be obtained simply by relying in good faith on advice from private counsel? Going further, the Court suggests that debt collectors might \u201chave an affirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the law, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from claiming good-faith immunity for violations.\u201d Ante, at 588, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">There is little substance to this line of reasoning. As the Court itself acknowledges, debt collectors would have an incentive to invoke the FTC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>safe harbor even if \u00a7 1692k(c) is construed to include a mistake-of-law defense, because the safe harbor provides a \u201cmore categorical immunity.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 588, n. 8, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532. Additionally, if a debt collector avoids seeking an advisory opinion from the FTC out of concern that the answer will be unfavorable, that seems quite at odds with saying that his or her ignorance is \u201cbona fide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">It should be noted further that the Court\u2019s concern about encouraging ignorance could apply just as well to \u00a7 45(m)(l)(A). That provision subjects a debt collector to harsh penalties for violating an FTC rule \u201cwith actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive and is prohibited by such rule.\u201d No one contends that this will encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">[559 U.S. 630]</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Yet there is no doubt that \u00a7 45(m)(l)(A) permits a mistake-of-law defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advisory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility. For the reasons stated above, see Part I-B-2, <em>supra, </em>this is to be doubted. Even the Court recognizes the limited role that the FTC has played. <em>Ante, </em>at 599, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 538 (\u201c[EJvidence of present administrative practice makes us reluctant to place significant weight on \u00a7 1692k(e) as a practical remedy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Fifth, the Court asserts that \u201c[a]ny remaining doubt\u201d about its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the FDCPA\u2019s statutory history. <em>Ante, </em>at 588, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532. The Court points to the fact that \u00a7 1692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision in the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), arguing that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA the view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense applied only to clerical errors. <em>Ante, </em>at 588-590, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 532-533. As Justice Scalia points out, the Court\u2019s claims of judicial uniformity are overstated. See <em>ante, </em>at 607, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 543 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). They rest on three Court of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by several District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court opinion\u2014hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which to divine legislative intent. The Court also ignores the fact that those three Courts of Appeals had construed the TILA provision to apply only to clerical errors. See <em>Ives </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>522 F.2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., </em>503 F.2d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>502 F.2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974). The Court therefore cannot explain why it reads \u00a7 1692k(c) more broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress amended the TILA\u2019s bona fide error exception explicitly to exclude \u201can error of legal judgment with respect to a person\u2019s obligations under [the TILA].\u201d See Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, \u00a7 615(a), 94 Stat. 181. This</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">[559 U.S. 631]</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">amendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had understood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors. The natural inference is that the preamendment TILA language\u2014the same language later incorporated nearly verbatim into \u00a7 1692k(c)\u2014was understood to cover those errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">The Court\u2019s responses to this point are perplexing. The Court first says that the 1980 amendment did not \u201cobvious [ly] \u201d change the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense, given the \u201cuniform interpretatio[n]\u201d that the defense had been given in the Courts of Appeals. Ante, at 591, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 534. The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory amendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious assumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court of Appeals consensus. Cf. <em>Corley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U.S. 303, 314, 129 S. Ct. 1558, 173 L. Ed. 2d 443 (2009) (\u201c[0]ne of the most basic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). (Without any evidence, the Court speculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to codify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal errors. <em>Ante, </em>at 592, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 534. If those judicial interpretations were truly as uniform as the Court suggests\u2014and the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as ironclad\u2014there would have been no need for such a recodification.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amendment weight because Congress \u201chas not expressly <em>included </em>mistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to \u00a7 1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 593, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 534-535 (emphasis in original). In other words, the Court refuses to read \u00a7 1692k(c) to cover mistakes of law because other bona fide error statutes do not expressly refer to such mistakes. But the reverse should be true: If other bona fide error provisions included mistake-of-law language but \u00a7 1692k(c) did not, we might think that the omission in \u00a7 1692k(c) signaled Congress\u2019 intent to exclude</p>\n<p id=\"ARZ6\">[559 U.S. 632]</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">mistakes of law. The absence of mistake-of-law language in \u00a7 1692k(c) is consequently less noteworthy because other statutes also omit such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The Court emphasizes that some bona fide error defenses, like the one in the current version of the TILA, expressly exclude legal errors from their scope. <em>Ante, </em>at 592-593, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 534-535 (citing 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4010(c)(2)). Yet this also can prove the opposite of what the Court says it does: If a bona fide error defense were generally assumed not to include legal mistakes (as the Court argues), there would be no need to expressly exclude them. It is only if the defense would otherwise include such errors that exclusionary language becomes necessary. By writing explicit exclusionary language into the TILA (and some other federal provisions), Congress has indicated that those provisions would otherwise cover good-faith legal errors.</p>\n<p id=\"pA8sk\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARgAAAAfAQAAAAAUh+8tAAAAiElEQVR4nNXTMQqEQBAEwN7BwEw/IH5EfNv9SMwMDXzAveGyiw4zA7k2tIMGExHdrJqZZYZlE3F44rjk1JpRAweSNeUYnDjPu3rtdghgkNQigGaV2IKce9nEAeS/kNghgFTK9Rbk0kmrQwDfJK0OAXxy2dchgCmTVgvy18oIDle+e7rhv3hazQaLjd4cd7wZRQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"279\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">For these reasons, \u00a7 1692k(c) is best read to encompass mistakes of law. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
