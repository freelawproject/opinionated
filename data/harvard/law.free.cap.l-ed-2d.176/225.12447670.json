The Act now contains a provision barring <em>qui tam </em>actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain specified sources. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is whether  the reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits, and investigations in that pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>vision encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources. We hold that it does.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North Carolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to perform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suffered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed to shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent Karen T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the Graham</p>\n<p id=\"Ay2t\">[559 U.S. 284]</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">County Soil and Conservation District, a special-purpose government body that had been delegated partial responsibility for coordinating and performing the remediation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection with this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local officials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and had a meeting with, agents of the USDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Graham County officials began an investigation. An accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit and, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified several potential irregularities in the county\u2019s administration of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying similar problems. The USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General eventually issued a third report that contained additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petitioners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation Districts and a number of local and federal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant to the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation of those false claims. Following this Court\u2019s review of the statute of limitations applicable to Wilson\u2019s retaliation claim, <em>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson, </em>545 U.S. 409, 125 S. Ct. 2444, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390 (2005), the Court of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as time barred. 424 F.3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the District Court subsequently dismissed Wilson\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>action for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a-105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. <em>Id., </em>at 95a-98a. Those reports, the District Court determined, constituted \u201cadministrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or investigation[s]\u201d within the</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">[559 U.S. 285]</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">meaning of the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court because the reports had been generated by state and local entities. \u201c[0]nly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>federal </em>administrative reports, audits or investigations,\u201d the Fourth Circuit concluded, \u201cqualify as public disclosures under the FCA.\u201d 528 F.3d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added). The Circuits having divided over this issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 557 U.S. 918, 129 S. Ct. 2824, 174 L. Ed. 2d 551 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We have examined the FCA\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>provisions in several recent opinions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At issue in this case is  the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction over <em>qui tam </em>suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through certain channels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction-stripping disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">[559 U.S. 286]</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Following the example of the Court of Appeals, see 528 F.3d, at 300-301, we have inserted Arabic numerals to identify these categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] of the information.\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">This dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective \u201cadministrative\u201d in the second category (Category 2): whether it embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as respondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures made in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Report and the Audit Report, as petitioners allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">In debating this question, petitioners have relied primarily on the statute\u2019s text whereas respondent and the Solicitor General, as her <em>amicus, </em>have relied heavily on considerations of history and policy. Although there is some overlap among the three types of argument, it is useful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The term \u201cadministrative\u201d \u201cmay, in various contexts, bear a range of related meanings,\u201d <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Judicial Council of Tenth Circuit, </em>398 U.S. 74, 103, n. 8, 90 S. Ct. 1648, 26 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to private bodies as</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">[559 U.S. 287]</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">well as to governmental bodies. When used to modify the nouns \u201creport, hearing, audit, or investigation,\u201d in the context of a statutory provision about \u201cthe public disclosure\u201d of fraud on the United States, the term is most naturally read to describe the activities of governmental agencies. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cadministration,\u201d \u201c [i]n public law, [as] the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies\u201d). Given that \u201cadministrative\u201d is not itself modified by \u201cfederal,\u201d there is no immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the activities of state and local agencies (or their contractors) from its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized,  \u201cthe statute by its express terms does not limit its reach to federal administrative reports or investigations.\u201d 528 F.3d, at 301. \u201c[T]here is nothing inherently federal about the word \u2018administrative,\u2019 and Congress did not define the term in the FCA.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201cadministrative\u201d nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its application of the interpretive maxim <em>noscitur a sociis. See id., </em>at 302-305. This maxim, literally translated as \u201c \u2018it is known by its associates,\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s 1160, counsels lawyers reading statutes that \u201ca word may be known by the company it keeps,\u201d <em>Russell Motor Car Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>261 U.S. 514, 519, 43 S. Ct. 428, 67 L. Ed. 778 (1923). All participants in this litigation acknowledge that the terms \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative Branch of the Federal Government,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the GAO is a federal agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">[559 U.S. 288]</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">our opinions in <em>S. D. Warren Co. </em>v. <em>Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, </em>547 U.S. 370, 126 S. Ct. 1843, 164 L. Ed. 2d 625 (2006), and <em>Beecham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U.S. 368, 114 S. Ct. 1669, 128 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201cthe placement of \u2018administrative\u2019 squarely in the middle of a list of obviously federal sources strongly suggests that \u2018administrative\u2019 should likewise be restricted to <em>federal </em>administrative reports, hearings, audits, or investigations.\u201d 528 F.3d, at 302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what we might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit. Both courts \u201c \u2018f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of this provision intended the word \u201cadministrative\u201d to refer to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tween modifiers which are unquestionably federal in character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>United States ex rel. Dunleavy </em>v. <em>County of Delaware, </em>123 F.3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">We find this use of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>unpersuasive. A list of three items, each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminating. Although this list may not be \u201ccompletely disjunctive,\u201d 528 F.3d, at 302\u2014it refers to \u201ccongressional, administrative, or [GAO] \u201d sources, \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), rather than \u201ccongressional, <em>or </em>administrative, or [GAO] \u201d sources\u2014neither is it completely harmonious. The substantive connection, or fit, between the terms \u201ccongressional,\u201d \u201cadministrative,\u201d and \u201cGAO\u201d is not so tight or so self-evident as to demand that we \u201crob\u201d any one of them \u201cof its independent and ordinary significance.\u201d <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 338-339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979); see also <em>Russell, </em>261 U.S., at 519, 43 S. Ct. 428, 67 L. Ed. 778 (  \u201cThat a word may be known by the company it keeps is . . . not an invariable rule, for the word may have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association\u201d). The adjectives in Category</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">[559 U.S. 289]</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">2 are too few and too disparate to qualify as \u201ca string of statutory terms,\u201d <em>S. D. Warren Co., </em>547 U.S., at 378, 126 S. Ct. 1843, 164 L. Ed. 2d 625, or \u201citems in a list,\u201d <em>Beecham, </em>511 U.S., at 371, 114 S. Ct. 1669, 128 L. Ed. 2d 383, in the sense that we used those phrases in the cited cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">More importantly, we need to evaluate \u201cadministrative\u201d within the larger scheme of the public disclosure bar. Both parties acknowledge, as they must, that  \u201c[statutory language has meaning only in context,\u201d <em>Graham County Soil, </em>545 U.S., at 415, 125 S. Ct. 2444, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390; where they differ is in determining the relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes that Category 2 is the only piece of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) that matters. We agree with petitioners, however, that <em>all </em>of the sources listed in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance. All of these sources drive at the same end: specifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose <em>qui tam </em>actions. In light of the public disclosure bar\u2019s grammatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarifying to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it does not follow that we should</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">[559 U.S. 290]</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">treat these categories as islands unto themselves.  Courts have a \u201cduty to construe statutes, not isolated provisions.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Alloyd Co., </em>513 U.S. 561, 568, 115 S. Ct. 1061, 131 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure bar, the case for limiting \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal sources becomes significantly weaker. The \u201cnews media\u201d referenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep. The Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and certain private outlets have a national focus; but no one contends that Category 3 is limited to these sources. There is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the \u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\u201d listed in Category 1 must be federal hearings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Of the numerous types of sources that serve a common function in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), then, only two are distinctly federal in nature, while one (the news media) is distinctly nonfederal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">If the Court of Appeals was correct that the term \u201cadministrative\u201d encompasses state and local sources in Category 1, see 528 F.3d, at 303, it becomes even harder to see why the term would not do the same in Category 2. See <em>Erlenbaugh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 239, 243, 93 S. Ct. 477, 34 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1972) (\u201c[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context\u201d). Respondent and the Solicitor General assert that \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s two references to \u201cadministrative\u201d can be distinguished because Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to refer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as rulemak-ing, oversight, and investigations. See Brief for Respondent 16-18; Brief</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">[559 U.S. 291]</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25-26 (hereinafter Brief for United States). Yet even if this reading were correct, state and local administrative reports, hearings, audits, and investigations of a legislative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Respondent and the Solicitor General try to avoid this inference, and to turn a weakness into a strength, by further averring that the sources listed in Category 1 are themselves only federal. See Brief for Respondent 23-24; Brief for United States 25-26. No court has ever taken such a view of these sources. See 528 F.3d, at 303 (citing cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and stating that \u201c[t]he courts have easily concluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings\u201d); Sylvia \u00a7 11:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The arguments in favor of reading</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">[559 U.S. 292]</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">a federal limitation into Category 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history and policy; they find no support in the statute\u2019s text.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to a bird\u2019s-eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General also maintain that the \u201cexclusively federal focus\u201d of the FCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to encompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10, 18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has a federal focus. But so does every other federal statute. And as respondent and the Solicitor General elsewhere acknowledge, quite a few aspects of the FCA, including a reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d proceedings in \u00a7 3733(L(7)(A)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the reference to \u201cnews media\u201d in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) itself, are not just federal. In any event, the \u201cfederal focus\u201d of the statute, as a whole, does not shine light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to certain non-federal contexts.  It is the fact of \u201cpublic disclosure\u201d\u2014not Federal Government creation or receipt\u2014that is the touchstone of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last argument grounded in the statutory text: It would be anomalous, they say, for state and local administrative reports to count as public disclosures, when state legislative reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for United States 15-16. Yet neither respondent nor the Solicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners and their <em>amici </em>that, at the time the public disclosure bar was enacted in 1986, Congress</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">[559 U.S. 293]</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">rarely gave state legislatures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing federally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36-39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>8-13. As in the instant case, the Federal Government was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and to provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies. Whether or not state legislative sources <em>should </em>have been included in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">In sum, although the term \u201cadministrative\u201d may be sandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal in nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases that have been generally understood to include nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Category 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of our inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>canon, as it was applied by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the associates with which \u201cadministrative\u201d keeps company in \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) endow it with an exclusively federal character.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources from which a relator could acquire the information to bring</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">[559 U.S. 294]</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">a <em>qui tam </em>action. In <em>United States ex rel. Marcus </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (1943), we upheld the relator\u2019s recovery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a federal criminal indictment\u2014a quintessential \u201cparasitic\u201d suit. <em>Id., </em>at 545-548, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443; see <em>id., </em>at 545, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (\u201cEven if, as the government suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing to the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to accomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was passed\u201d). Congress promptly reacted to that decision by amending the statute to preclude <em>qui tam </em>actions \u201cbased upon evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.\u201d Act of Dec. 23, 1943, 57 Stat. 609 (codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 232(C) (1946 ed.)). This amendment erected what came to be known as a Government knowledge bar: \u201c[0]nce the United States learned of a false claim, only the Government could assert its rights under the FCA against the false claimant.\u201d <em>Hughes Aircraft Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer, </em>520 U.S. 939, 949, 117 S. Ct. 1871, 138 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the years that followed the 1943 amendment, the volume and efficacy of <em>qui tam </em>litigation dwindled. \u201cSeeking the golden mean between adequate incentives for whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own,\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Springfield Terminal R. Co. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>14 F.3d 645, 649 (CADC 1994), Congress overhauled the statute once again in 1986 \u201cto make the FCA a \u2018more useful tool against fraud in modern times,\u2019 \u201d <em>Cook County </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Chandler, </em>538 U.S. 119, 133, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2003) (quoting S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 2 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The present text of \u00a7 3730(e)(4) was enacted in 1986 as part of this larger reform. Congress apparently concluded that a total bar on <em>qui tam </em>actions based on information already in the Government\u2019s possession thwarted a significant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather than simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, however, Congress replaced</p>\n<p id=\"AOQk\">[559 U.S. 295]</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">it with the public disclosure bar in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>effort to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits such as the one in <em>Hess. </em>How exactly \u00a7 3730(e)(4) came to strike this balance in the way it did is a matter of considerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees each reported bills that contained very different public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in the Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not include the words \u201cadministrative,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d or \u201cinvestigation\u201d in its version of Category 2, nor did it contain an original source exception. See S. Rep., at 42-43 (text of proposed \u00a7 3730(e)(4)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In respondent and her <em>amici\u2019s </em>view, this background counsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of \u201cadministrative\u201d for three separate reasons. First, the drafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that Congress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of the 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Government knowledge bar, and \u201c[c]onstruing [ \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)] as limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers Congress\u2019s purpose \u2018to encourage more private enforcement suits.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep., at 23-24). Third, whereas federal administrative proceedings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General with a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA action based on revelations made therein, the Attorney General is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in state proceedings. Respondent and her <em>amici </em>further maintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal sources in Category 2, as local governments would then be able to shield themselves from <em>qui tarn </em>liability by discretely disclosing evidence of fraud in \u201cpublic\u201d reports.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">[559 U.S. 296]</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but they do not go very far. As many have observed, the drafting history of the public disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Significant substantive changes\u2014including the introduction of the term we are construing in this case\u2014were inserted without floor debate, as \u201ctechnical\u201d amendments. That the original Senate bill mentioned only congressional and GAO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sources in Category 2 is therefore of little moment. Neither the House nor the Senate Committee Report explained why a federal limitation would be appropriate, and the subsequent addition of \u201cadministrative\u201d sources to this Category might be taken as a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full Chambers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">[559 U.S. 297]</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Respondent and her <em>amici </em>place particular emphasis on a remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Grassley. See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for United States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13-14; Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>30-31. In a floor statement, Grassley said that \u201cthe term \u2018Government\u2019 in the definition of original source is meant to include any Government source of disclosures cited in [the public disclosure bar]; that is, Government includes Congress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or independent agency as well as all other governmental bodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.\u201d 132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence by a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful weight, Senator Grass-ley\u2019s remark merely begs the question before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether the \u201cother governmental bodies\u201d may be state or local bodies. It also turns on a term, \u201cGovernment\u201d with a capital \u201cG,\u201d that does not appear in the codified version of the public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently revised in numerous respects prior to passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record that squarely corroborates respondent\u2019s reading of the statute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986 amendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145 Cong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in which Rep. Berman and Sen. Grassley state: \u201cWe did intend, and any fair reading of the statute will confirm, that the disclosure must</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">[559 U.S. 298]</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">be in a federal criminal, civil or administrative hearing. Disclosure in a state proceeding of any kind should not be a bar to a subsequent qui tam suit\u201d). Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as legislative \u201chistory,\u201d given that it was written 13 years after the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of scant or no value for our purposes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">We do not doubt that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>passed the 1986 amendments to the FCA \u201cto strengthen the Government\u2019s hand in fighting false claims,\u201d <em>Cook County, </em>538 U.S., at 133-134, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247, and \u201cto encourage more private enforcement suits,\u201d S. Rep., at 23-24. It is equally beyond cavil, however, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to <em>bar </em>a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or downright harmful. The question before us concerns the precise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record is all but opaque. While \u201cthe absence of specific legislative history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 310, 96 S. Ct. 523, 46 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1976), there is no \u201cevident</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">[559 U.S. 299]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">legislative purpose\u201d to guide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Respondent and her <em>amici </em>likewise fail to prove their case that petitioners\u2019 reading of the statute will lead to results that Congress could not have intended. Their argument rests on an empirical proposition: \u201cWhile federal inquiries and their outcomes are readily available to Department of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.\u201d Brief for United States 22; see also528 F.3d, at 306 (\u201cBecause the federal government is unlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a large number of fraudulent claims against the government would go unremedied without the financial incentives offered by the <em>qui tam </em>provisions of the FCA\u201d). This proposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture. Numerous federal investigations may be occurring at any given time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn about their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about quite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the inquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state program financed in part by federal dollars, such as the program at issue in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Just how accessible to the Attorney General a typical state or local source will be, as compared to a federal source, is an open question. And it is</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">[559 U.S. 300]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">not even the right question. The statutory touchstone, once again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been \u201cpublic[ly] disclos[ed],\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>whether they have landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Respondent\u2019s argument also gives insufficient weight to Congress\u2019 decision to bar <em>qui tam </em>actions based on disclosures \u201cfrom the news media.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because there was no such bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a jurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion that the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded intent to increase the availability of <em>qui tam </em>litigation. And since the \u201cnews media\u201d include a large number of local newspapers and radio stations, this category likely describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come to the attention of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As for respondent and her <em>amici\u2019s </em>concern that local governments will insulate themselves from <em>qui tam </em>liability \u201cthrough careful, low key \u2018disclosures\u2019 \u201d of potential fraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>17, this argument rests not just on speculation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any such disclosure would not immunize the local government from FCA liability in an action brought by the United States, see <em>Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>549 U.S. 457, 478, 127 S. Ct. 1397, 167 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2007)\u2014and to the contrary it could tip off the Attorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It seems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view when they assert that, \u201c[g]iven the fact that the submission of a false claim to the United States subjects a defendant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, no rational entity would prepare a report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of cutting off <em>qui tam </em>actions.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19; see also <em>United States ex rel. Bly-Magee </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>470 F.3d 914, 919 (CA9 2006) (\u201cThe fear [of self-insulating disclosures] is unfounded in general because it is unlikely that an agency trying to cover up its fraud would</p>\n<p id=\"A0qC\">[559 U.S. 301]</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">reveal the requisite \u2018allegations or transactions\u2019 underlying the fraud in a public document\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Congress carefully preserved the rights of the most deserving <em>qui tam </em>plaintiffs: those whistle-blowers who qualify as original sources. Notwithstanding public disclosure of the allegations made by a <em>qui tam </em>plaintiff, her case may go forward if she is \u201can original source of the information.\u201d \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A). It is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a finding for petitioners will \u201c \u2018in effect return us to the unduly restrictive \u201cgovernment knowledge\u201d standard\u2019 \u201d that prevailed prior to 1986.

Today\u2019s ruling merely confirms that disclosures made in one type of context\u2014a state or local report, audit, or investigation\u2014may trigger the public disclosure bar. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>has no bearing on disclosures made in other contexts, and it leaves intact the ability of original sources to prosecute <em>qui tam </em>actions irrespective of the state of Government knowledge. Whether respondent can qualify as an \u201coriginal source,\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 3730(e)(4), is one of many issues that remain open on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Respondent and the Solicitor General have given numerous reasons why they believe their reading of the FCA</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">[559 U.S. 302]</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">moves it closer to the golden mean between an inadequate and an excessive scope for private enforcement.

The Constitution gives legal effect to the \u201cLaws\u201d Congress enacts, Art. VI, cl. 2, not the objectives its Members aimed to achieve in voting for them. See <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201(1998). If \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s text includes state and local administrative reports and audits, as the Court correctly concludes it does, then it is utterly irrelevant whether the Members of Congress intended otherwise. Anyway, it is utterly impossible to discern what the Members of Congress intended except to the extent that intent is manifested in the <em>only </em>remnant of \u201chistory\u201d that bears the unanimous endorsement of the majority in each House: the text of the enrolled bill that became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">[559 U.S. 303]</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b329-18\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"AEBz\">with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">The False Claims Act (FCA) divests federal courts of jurisdiction to hear <em>qui tam </em>lawsuits based on allegations or transactions publicly disclosed in a \u201ccongressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation,\u201d unless the <em>qui tam </em>relator is an \u201coriginal source\u201d of the information. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted). Today, the Court reads the phrase \u201cadministrative . . . report, hearing, audit, or investigation\u201d to encompass not only federal, but also state and local, government sources.

No party here disputes that \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d refer only to Federal Government sources. <em>Ante, </em>at 287, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 232, and nn. 5-6. As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante, </em>at 286-287, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 232, the word \u201cadministrative\u201d is more capacious, potentially reaching not only federal, state, and local government sources but also disclosures by private entities. See, <em>e.g., </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \u201cadministrative\u201d as \u201cpertain [ing] to administration, especially management, . . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or things\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress\u2019 choice of two \u201cclearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly federal term\u201d as a \u201cvery strong contextual cue about the meaning of \u2018administrative.\u2019 \u201d 528 F.3d 292, 302 (CA4 2008). \u201c \u2018The maxim <em>noscitur a sociis, . . . </em>while not an inescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Ada, </em>528 U.S. 250, 255, 120 S.

Here, the immediate proximity of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d suggests that \u201cadministrative\u201d should be read, like its neighbors, as referring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had intended to include state or local government administrative materials, it could have said so, for instance by referring generically to \u201cgovernmental\u201d sources. See 528 F.3d, at 304-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The Court applies the logic that underlies the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>canon in concluding that \u201cadministrative\u201d does not refer to private entities because of the meaning suggested by the slightly more distant neighbors \u201creport, hearing, audit, or investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tion.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>at 286-287, 176 L.

But in my view, \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d provide the better textual grounding for that conclusion. I see no reason why the \u201cadministrad[on]\u201d of a private university, for instance, could not issue a \u201creport,\u201d order an \u201caudit\u201d or \u201cinvestigation,\u201d or conduct a \u201chearing.\u201d Nor, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, are private entities\u2014particularly those receiving federal funds or participating in federal programs\u2014 incapable of making \u201cpublic disclosure [s]\u201d of fraud on the Federal Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court nevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>to interpret the three terms in Category 2, concluding that \u201c[a] list of three items, each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminating.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 288, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 233. The three terms in Category 2, the Court concludes, are \u201ctoo few and too disparate\u201d to justify invocation of <em>noscitur a sociis. Ante, </em>at 289, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 233. We have not previously constrained the canon in this way, and I would not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">To take just one example, in <em>Jarecki </em>we construed the statutory term \u201c \u2018abnormal income,\u2019 \u201d which the statute defined to include income resulting from \u201c \u2018exploration, discovery, or prospecting.\u2019 \u201d 367 U.S., at 304-305, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859 (quoting \u00a7 456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recognizing that the word \u201c \u2018[d]iscovery\u2019 \u201d is \u201cusable in many contexts and with various shades of meaning,\u201d we observed that it \u201cgathers meaning from the words around it\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he three words in conjunction ... all describe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 307, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859. As a result, and in light of other contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion, we held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera equipment did not give rise to \u201cabnormal income\u201d even if such inventions might otherwise be understood as \u201cdiscover[ies].\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 307-313, 81 S.

Here, application of the <em>noscitur a sociis </em>principle readily yields a common feature: The sources at issue are federal in nature, not related to state or local governments or private entities. See <em>Third Nat. Bank in Nashville </em>v. <em>Impac Limited, Inc., </em>432 U.S. 312, 322-323, 315, 97 S. Ct. 2307, 53 L.

Ed. 2d, at <em>233\u2014i.e., </em>the sources enumerated in Categories 1 and 3. Although the scope of Category 1 is not before us today (and although this Court has never addressed that question), the Court believes that reading Category 2 as limited to Federal Government sources would be inconsistent with decisions of lower</p>\n<p id=\"AdrP\">[559 U.S. 307]</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">courts that have interpreted \u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\u201d in Category 1 to include both state and federal proceedings. There is no conflict, however, if both categories are read, as respondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively federal. See Brief for Respondent 23-24; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>25-26. Even reading Category 1 more broadly, however, does not change the exclusively federal nature of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d which undermines whatever inference might be drawn from taking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating the entirety of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of items gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress made in offsetting each category with commas and prepositions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that modify different nouns.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Finally, the Court also views \u201cnews media\u201d as \u201cdistinctly nonfederal in nature.\u201d Ante, at 290, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 234. But \u201cnews media\u201d does not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As the Court of Appeals observed, although media sources may be national or local in scope, that distinction is not analogous to the difference between federal and state government sources. 528 F.3d, at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In my view, the statutory context and legislative history are also less \u201copaque,\u201d cf. <em>ante, </em>at 298, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 239, and more supportive of the reading adopted by the Court of Appeals, than the majority today acknowledges. While the legislative record is concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise caution before giving the statutory text its broadest possible <em>meaning\u2014i.e., </em>to encompass not only federal, but also state and local, government sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the 1986 amendments, the \u201cGovernment knowledge\u201d bar unquestionably referred only to information in the possession of the</p>\n<p id=\"afq3-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 308]</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Federal Government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even still, the bar was criticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an initial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, described the FCA\u2019s history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>and need for legislative reform, noting \u201cseveral restrictive court interpretations of the act . . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.\u201d S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For instance, courts had applied the Government knowledge bar \u201ceven if the Government makes no effort to investigate or take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12 (citing <em>United States ex rel.

Supp. 244 (Haw. 1980)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Second, there is more support than the Court recognizes for the proposition that Congress sought in the 1986 amendments to broaden the availability of <em>qui tam </em>relief. The Senate Report characterized the reform effort as intended to \u201cenhance the Government\u2019s ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the Government\u201d and dwelt at length on the \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cgrowing\u201d problem of \u201cfraud in Federal programs.\u201d S. Rep., at 1-2; accord, H. R.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">[559 U.S. 309]</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Rep. No. 99-660, p. 18 (1986) (\u201cEvidence of fraud in Government programs and procurement is on a steady rise\u201d). The Senate Report also articulated a desire to \u201cencourage any individual knowing of Government fraud to bring that information forward,\u201d and it identified as \u201cperhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective enforcement [of an-tifraud laws] a lack of resources on the part of Federal enforcement agencies.\u201d S. Rep., at 2, 7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted legislation was replete with provisions encouraging <em>qui tam </em>actions. By replacing the Government knowledge bar with the current text of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) and including an exception for \u201coriginal source [s],\u201d Congress \u201callowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Government\u2019s possession.\u201d <em>Cook County </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Chandler, </em>538 U.S. 119, 133, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2003). The 1986 amendments also established the right of <em>qui tam </em>rela-tors to continue as a party to a suit after the Government intervenes, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(1) (1988 ed.); increased the percentage of recovery available as an incentive for private suits, \u00a7 3730(d)(1); and created a cause of action against employers who retaliate against <em>qui tam </em>relators, \u00a7 3730(h).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>[559 U.S. 310]</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">To be sure, Congress was also concerned in 1986, as in 1943, with guarding against purely opportunistic, \u201cparasitic\u201d <em>qui tam </em>relators. See S. Rep., at 10-11 (describing history of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); <em>ante, </em>at 293-295, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 236-237. Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amendments as striking a balance between the \u201ctwin goals of rejecting suits which the government is capable of pursuing itself, while promoting those which the government is not equipped to bring on its own.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Springfield Terminal R. Co. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>14 F.3d 645, 651 (CADC 1994). But evidence that Congress sought to balance two competing goals supports moderation in interpreting an arguably ambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">[559 U.S. 311]</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">statutory text, rather than woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest possible extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Third, the legislative record \u201c \u2018contains no hint of any intention\u2019 \u201d to bar suits based on disclosures from state or local government sources.

Inclusion of state or local government sources would have constituted a significant departure from the Federal Government knowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986. But neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and House Committees nor statements by individual Members of Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation suggest any consideration or debate about expanding the pre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government sources.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">[559 U.S. 312]</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Although these points do not defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tively resolve the question presented today, to my mind they counsel against reading \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) so broadly as to disturb the balance Congress evidently sought to achieve through the 1986 amendments. Today\u2019s decision risks such a result. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by all appearances <em>more </em>restrictive of <em>qui tarn </em>suits than the pre-1986 regime. Construing \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) to encompass the thousands of state and local government administrative reports produced each year effectively imputes to the Federal Government knowledge of such sources, whether or not the Government is aware of the information or in a position to act on it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Solicitor General specifically warns that while information in federal administrative audits or investigations is \u201creadily available\u201d to attorneys at the Department of Justice, \u201cmany state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22. The Court dismisses this concern as \u201csheer conjecture,\u201d postulating that Government lawyers \u201cmay\u201d in fact learn about \u201cquite a few\u201d state or local reports and investigations, particularly in joint state-federal programs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ante, at 299, 176 L.

The Senate Report also discussed <em>United States ex rel.

S. Rep., at 12-13. Lower courts have observed that the <em>Dean </em>decision was controversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the \u201coriginal source\u2019\u2019 exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, <em>e.g., Wang </em>v. <em>FMC Corp., </em>975 F.2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S.

In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator Grassley described the reform effort as stemming \u201cfrom a realization that the Government needs help\u2014lots of help\u2014to adequately protect taxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.\u2019\u2019 132 Cong.

The amendments also contained a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of provisions facilitating enforcement generally, <em>e.g., </em>lowering the requisite showing of intent by making clear that \u201cknowing\u201d violations require \u201cno proof of specific intent to defraud,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(b)(1) (1988 ed.); lengthening the statute of limitations, \u00a7 3731(b); and authorizing treble damages, \u00a7 3729(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The Court fairly observes that the addition of \u201cnews media\u201d to the jurisdictional bar undercuts attributing to Congress a \u201csingle-minded\u201d intent to expand the availability of <em>qui tam </em>relief. <em>Ante, </em>at 300, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 240. But neither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest possible extent. Moreover, barring suits based on \u201cnews media\u201d disclosures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of existing law. Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge bar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news media. In <em>United States ex rel. Thompson </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>432 F. Supp. 253, 256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence \u201cgleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread public attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],\u201d when the Department of Justice \u201cfirst obtained information regarding the claims ... as a result of [a] <em>Washington Post </em>article.\u201d Similarly, the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burmah Oil Co., </em>558 F.2d 43, 46, n. 1 (CA2 1977) <em>(per curiam) </em>characterized the Government knowledge bar as \u201cdiscourag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of their own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in indictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional investigations.\u201d Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that news media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would naturally\u2014perhaps as a result of the reporting\u2014come to the Government\u2019s attention, and thus would already have been covered under existing law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b334-12\">. In June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill that would have barred <em>qui tam </em>actions based on information \u201cwhich the Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,\u201d \u201cdisclosed during the course of a congressional investigation,\u201d or \u201cdisseminated by any news media.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 99-660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government itself (with a capital \u201cG\u201d) and to \u201ccongressional investigation[s]\u201d connote federal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring actions \u201cbased upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six months of the disclosure of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>information relating to such allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a congressional or [GAO] report or hearing, or from the news media.\u201d S. Rep., at 43. The reference to suits in which the Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term \u201cadministrative\u201d in the bill\u2019s reference to \u201ccongressional or [GAO] \u201d reports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or local government reports. The enacted legislation did differ in several respects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record contains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government sources. See, <em>e.g., </em>132 Cong. Rec. 20535-20537 (statement of Sen. Grassley); <em>id., </em>at 29321-29322 (statements of Reps. Glickman and Berman).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">. Of course, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) speaks of \u201cpublic disclosure,\u201d not notice to the Government. But the requirement of a \u201cpublic\u201d disclosure countenances notice, both to the public and otherwise. Indeed, a number of lower courts look to whether the Federal Government is \u201con notice\u201d of alleged fraud before concluding that a particular source is a \u201cpublic disclosure of allegations or transactions\u201d under \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A).

Brief for Petitioners 31. But the FCA\u2019s first-to-file provision, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(5), reflects Congress\u2019 explicit policy choice to encourage prompt filing and, in turn, prompt recovery of defrauded funds by the United States. <em>Amici </em>States are concerned that relators may interfere with ongoing state and local government investigations by \u201ctrolling state records and reports\u2019\u2019 for evidence of fraud. States Brief 11. But some state freedom-of-information laws exempt materials related to ongoing civil investigations. See, <em>e.g., </em>Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 45 22l(a)( 11) (2008 Cum. Supp.); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, \u00a7 67.708(b)(17) (Purdon Supp. 2009).
