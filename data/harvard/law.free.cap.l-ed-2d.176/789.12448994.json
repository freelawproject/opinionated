I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-11.  The United States is a contracting state to the Convention; and Congress has implemented its provisions through the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102 Stat. 437, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11601 <em>et seq. </em>The Convention provides that a child abducted in violation of \u201crights of custody\u201d must be returned to the child\u2019s country of habitual residence, unless certain exceptions apply. Art. 1, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-11, at 7 (Treaty Doc.). The question is whether a parent has a \u201crigh [t] of custody\u201d by reason of that parent\u2019s <em>ne exeat </em>right: the authority to consent before the other parent may take the child to another country.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Timothy Abbott and Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott married in England in 1992. He is a British citizen, and she is a citizen of the United States. Mr. Abbott\u2019s astronomy profession took the couple to Hawaii, where their son A. J. A. was born in 1995. The Abbotts moved to La Serena, Chile, in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">[560 U.S. 6]</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">There was marital discord, and the parents separated in March 2003. The Chilean courts granted the mother daily care and control of the child, while awarding the father \u201cdirect and regular\u201d visitation rights, including visitation every other weekend and for the whole month of February each year. App. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">Chilean law conferred upon Mr. Abbott what is commonly known as a <em>ne exeat </em>right: a right to consent before Ms. Abbott could take A. J. A. out of Chile. See Minors Law 16,618, Art. 49, App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a (granting a <em>ne exeat </em>right to any parent with visitation rights).  In effect a <em>ne ex-eat </em>right imposes a duty on one parent that is a right in the other. After Mr. Abbott obtained a British passport for A. J. A., Ms. Abbott grew concerned that Mr. Abbott would take the boy to Britain. She sought and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>obtained a <em>\u201cne exeat </em>of the minor\u201d order from the Chilean family court, prohibiting the boy from being taken out of Chile. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a-69a.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">In August 2005, while proceedings before the Chilean court were pending, the mother removed the boy from Chile without permission from either the father or the court. A private investigator located the mother and the child in Texas. In February 2006, the mother filed for divorce in Texas state court. Part of the relief she sought was a modification of the father\u2019s rights, including full power in her to determine the boy\u2019s place of residence and an order limiting the father to supervised visitation in Texas. This litigation remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Mr. Abbott brought an action in Texas state court, asking for visitation rights and an order requiring Ms. Abbott to show cause why the court should not allow Mr. Abbott to return to Chile with A. J. A. In February 2006, the court denied Mr. Abbott\u2019s requested relief but granted him \u201cliberal periods of possession\u201d of A. J. A. throughout February 2006, provided Mr. Abbott remained in Texas. App. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">[560 U.S. 7]</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In May 2006, Mr. Abbott filed the instant action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. He sought an order requiring his son\u2019s return to Chile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provisions of the ICARA. In July 2007, after holding a bench trial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District Court denied relief. The court held that the father\u2019s <em>ne exeat </em>right did not constitute a right of custody under the Convention and, as a result, that the return remedy was not authorized. 495 F.Supp. 2d 635, 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed on the same rationale. The court held the father possessed no rights of custody under the Convention because his <em>ne exeat </em>right was only \u201ca veto right over his son\u2019s departure from Chile.\u201d 542 F.3d 1081, 1087 (2008). The court expressed substantial agreement with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Croll </em>v. <em>Croll, </em>229 F.3d 133 (2000). Relying on American dictionary definitions of \u201ccustody\u201d and noting that <em>ne exeat </em>rights cannot be \u201c \u2018actually exercised\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the Convention, <em>Croll </em>held that <em>ne ex-eat </em>rights are not rights of custody. <em>Id., </em>at 138-141 (quoting Art. <em>3(b)). </em>A dissenting opinion in <em>Croll </em>was filed by then-Judge Sotomayor. The dissent maintained that a <em>ne exeat </em>right is a right of custody because it \u201cprovides a parent with decisionmaking authority regarding a child\u2019s international relocation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits adopted the conclusion of the <em>Croll </em>majority. See <em>Fawcett </em>v. <em>McRoberts, </em>326 F.3d 491, 500 (CA4 2003); <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, </em>311 F.3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has followed the reasoning of the <em>Croll </em>dissent. <em>Furnes </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>362 F.3d 702, 720, n. 15 (2004). Certiorari was granted to resolve the conflict. 557 U.S. 933, 129 S. Ct. 2859, 174 L. Ed. 2d 575 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">[560 U.S. 8]</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">The Convention was adopted in 1980 in response to the problem of international child abductions during domestic disputes.  The Convention seeks \u201cto secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u201cto ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.\u201d Art. 1, Treaty Doc., at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The provisions of the Convention of most relevance at the outset of this discussion are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\u201cArticle 3: The removal or the retention of the child is to be considered wrongful where\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">\u201ca it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-7\"><em>\u201cb </em>at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA7yr\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAmwAAAAsAQAAAADwKdnNAAAAZUlEQVR4nO3WoRGAQAxE0c0pLJ1REuXQBXQCJRwOt6cvMRFxbOTPzNNrROG9rVIDxIkTJ06cOHEzd/kWwpMODdj8L4QjHYxc+/wKAcuXDPWjwnwKAXs+kCfdhXBnQzcNMnHi/swNpe5iIb9bbM8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"620\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-8\">\u201cArticle 5: For the purposes of this Convention\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-9\">\u201ca \u2018rights of custody\u2019 shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-10\"><em>\u201cb </em>\u2018rights of access\u2019 shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s habitual residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAggr\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"46\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAm0AAAAuAQAAAABSIxP4AAAAZklEQVR4nO3VsQ2AMAxE0YsnYzTGYQyGoIcNoITq0vsaF6FAnMtv6clKk0YMnCdGaoA5c+bM/Yk7cpRwVUMAWPJOwlYNAWDOOwlrNbzwdnKMhKkcSO5MI+Eshrv5nzVnzpw5c5/mOrAXXuDqrRxuAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"620\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-11\">\u201cArticle 12: Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 . . . the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7, 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">[560 U.S. 9]</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">The Convention\u2019s central operating feature is the return remedy. When a child under the age of 16 has been wrongfully removed or retained, the country to which the child has been brought must \u201corder the return of the child forthwith,\u201d unless certain exceptions apply. See, <em>e.g., </em>Arts. 4, 12, <em>ibid. </em>A removal is \u201cwrongful\u201d where the child was removed in violation of \u201crights of custody.\u201d The Convention defines \u201crights of custody\u201d to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art. <em>5(a), id., </em>at 7. A return remedy does not alter the preabduction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial decisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence. Art. 19, <em>id., </em>at 11. The Convention also recognizes \u201crights of access,\u201d but offers no return remedy for a breach of those rights. Arts. <em>5(b), </em>21, <em>id., </em>at 7, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">The United States has implemented the Convention through the ICARA. The statute authorizes a person who seeks a child\u2019s return to file a petition in state or federal court and instructs that the court \u201cshall decide the case in accordance with the Convention.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11603(a), (b), (d). If the child in question has been \u201cwrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the Convention,\u201d the child shall be \u201cpromptly returned,\u201d unless an exception is applicable. \u00a7 11601(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">As the parties agree, the Convention applies to this dispute. A. J. A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are contracting states. The question is whether A. J. A. was \u201cwrongfully removed\u201d from Chile, in other words, whether he was removed in violation of a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of custody. This Court\u2019s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Convention; the views of the United States Department of State; decisions addressing the meaning of \u201crights of custody\u201d in courts of</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">[560 U.S. 10]</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">other contracting states; and the purposes of the Convention. After considering these sources, the Court determines that Mr. Abbott\u2019s <em>ne exeat </em>right is a right of custody under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\u201cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text.\u201d <em>Medellin </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>552 U.S. 491, 506, 128 S. Ct. 1346, 170 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2008). This Court consults Chilean law to determine the content of Mr. Abbott\u2019s right, while following the Convention\u2019s text and structure to decide whether the right at issue is a \u201crigh[t] of custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide his child\u2019s country of residence, otherwise known as a <em>ne exeat </em>right.  Minors Law 16,618, Art. 49, App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that \u201c[o]nce the court has decreed\u201d that one of the parents has visitation rights, that parent\u2019s \u201cauthorization . . . shall also be required\u201d before the child may be taken out of the country, subject to court override only where authorization \u201ccannot be granted or is denied without good reason.\u201d Mr. Abbott has \u201cdirect and regular\u201d visitation rights, and it follows from Chilean law that he has a shared right to determine his son\u2019s country of residence under this provision. App. 9. To support the conclusion that Mr. Abbott\u2019s right under Chilean law gives him a joint right to decide his son\u2019s country of residence, it is notable that a Chilean agency has explained that  Minors Law 16,618 is a \u201c \u2018right to authorize the minors\u2019 exit\u2019 \u201d from Chile and that this provision means that neither parent can \u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cestablish the [child\u2019s] place of residence.\u201d Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region Metropolitana, to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in <em>Villegas Duran </em>v. <em>Arribada Beaumont, </em>No. 08-775, pp. 35a-37a, cert. pending [Reporter\u2019s Note: See post, p. 921 [, 130 S. Ct. 3318, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1216]].</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">[560 U.S. 11]</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. <em>3(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7; and Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to determine his son\u2019s country of residence is best classified as a joint right of custody, as the Convention defines that term. The Convention defines \u201crights of custody\u201d to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art. <em>5(a), ibid. </em>Mr. Abbott\u2019s <em>ne exeat </em>right gives him both the joint \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d and joint \u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to decide A. J. A.\u2019s country of residence allows him to \u201cdetermine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d The phrase \u201cplace of residence\u201d encompasses the child\u2019s country of residence, especially in light of the Convention\u2019s explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders. See Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. And even if \u201cplace of residence\u201d refers only to the child\u2019s street address within a country, a <em>ne exeat </em>right still entitles Mr. Abbott to \u201cdetermine\u201d that place. \u201c[D]etermine\u201d can mean \u201c [t] o fix conclusively or authoritatively,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 711 (2d ed. 1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean \u201c[t]o set bounds or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>limits to,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>(1st definition), which is what Mr. Abbott\u2019s <em>ne exeat </em>right allows by ensuring that A. J. A. cannot live at any street addresses outside of Chile. It follows that the Convention\u2019s protection of a parent\u2019s custodial \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d includes a <em>ne exeat </em>right.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to determine A. J. A.\u2019s country of residence also gives him \u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d Art. <em>5(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7. Few decisions are as significant as the language the child speaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb. These factors, so essential to self-definition, are linked in an inextricable way to the child\u2019s country of residence. One need only consider the different childhoods</p>\n<p id=\"aulm-dedup-1\">[560 U.S. 12]</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">an adolescent will experience if he or she grows up in the United States, Chile, Germany, or North Korea, to understand how choosing a child\u2019s country of residence is a right \u201crelating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d The Court of Appeals described Mr. Abbott\u2019s right to take part in making this decision as a mere \u201cveto,\u201d 542 F.3d, at 1087; but even by that truncated description, the father has an essential role in deciding the boy\u2019s country of residence. For example, Mr. Abbott could condition his consent to a change in country on A. J. A.\u2019s moving to a city outside Chile where Mr. Abbott could obtain an astronomy position, thus allowing the father to have continued contact with the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">That a <em>ne exeat </em>right does not fit within traditional notions of physical custody is beside the point.  The Convention defines \u201crights of custody,\u201d and it is that definition that a court must consult. This uniform, text-based approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Convention. It forecloses courts from relying on definitions of custody confined by local law usage, definitions that may undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries or in different legal traditions, including the civil-law tradition. And, in any case, our own legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that accord with the Convention\u2019s broad definition. Joint legal custody, in which one parent cares for the child while the other has joint deci-sionmaking authority concerning the child\u2019s welfare, has become increasingly common. See Singer, Dispute Resolution and the Postdivorce Family: Implications of a Paradigm Shift, 47 Family Ct. Rev. 363, 366 (2009) (\u201c[A] recent study of child custody outcomes in North Carolina indicated that almost 70% of all custody resolutions included joint legal custody, as did over 90% of all mediated custody agreements\u201d); E. Maccoby &amp; R. Mnookin, Dividing the Child: Social and Legal Dilemmas of Custody 107 (1992) (\u201c[F]or 79 percent of our entire sample, the [California] divorce decree provided for joint legal custody\u201d); see generally Elrod, Reforming the System To Protect Children</p>\n<p id=\"A9tQ\">[560 U.S. 13]</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">in High Conflict Custody Cases, 28 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 495, 505-508 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Ms. Abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that a <em>ne exeat </em>right is not a right of custody because the Convention requires that any right of custody must be capable of exercise.  The Convention protects rights of custody when \u201cat the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.\u201d Art. <em>3(b), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7. In cases like this one, a <em>ne exeat </em>right is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>by its nature inchoate and so has no operative force except when the other parent seeks to remove the child from the country. If that occurs, the parent can exercise the <em>ne exeat </em>right by declining consent to the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be in the child\u2019s best interests. When one parent removes the child without seeking the <em>ne exeat </em>holder\u2019s consent, it is an instance where the right would have been \u201cexercised but for the removal or retention.\u201d <em>Ibid-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that a breach of a <em>ne exeat </em>right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.  The Convention provides a return remedy when a parent takes a child across international borders in violation of a right of custody. The Convention provides no return remedy when a parent removes a child in violation of a right of access but requires contracting states \u201cto promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights.\u201d Art. 21, <em>id., </em>at 11. For example, a court may force the custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation, see, <em>e.g., Viragh </em>v. <em>Foldes, </em>415 Mass. 96, 109-111, 612 N.E.2d 241, 249-250 (1993), or make other provisions for the noncustodial parent to visit his or her child, see \u00a7 11603(b) (authorizing petitions to \u201csecur[e] the effective exercise of rights of access to a child\u201d). But unlike rights of access, <em>ne exeat </em>rights can only be honored</p>\n<p id=\"ALL9\">[560 U.S. 14]</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">with a return remedy because these rights depend on the child\u2019s location being the country of habitual residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Any suggestion that a <em>ne exeat </em>right is a \u201crigh [t] of access\u201d is illogical and atextual.  The Convention defines \u201crights of access\u201d as \u201cinclud[ing] the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s habitual residence,\u201d Art. <em>5(b), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7, and the ICARA defines that same term as \u201cvisitation rights,\u201d \u00a7 11602(7). The joint right to decide a child\u2019s country of residence is not even arguably a \u201cright to take a child for a limited period of time\u201d or a \u201cvisitation righ[t].\u201d Reaching the commonsense conclusion that a <em>ne exeat </em>right does not fit these definitions of \u201crights of access\u201d honors the Convention\u2019s distinction between rights of access and rights of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Ms. Abbott argues that the <em>ne exeat </em>order in this case cannot create a right of custody because it merely protects a court\u2019s jurisdiction over the child. Even if this argument were correct, it would not be dispositive. Ms. Abbott contends the Chilean court\u2019s <em>ne exeat </em>order contains no parental consent provision and so awards the father no rights, custodial or otherwise. See Brief for Respondent 22; but see 495 F.Supp. 2d, at 638, n. 3 (the District Court treating the order as containing a consent provision); 542 F.3d, at 1084 (same for the Court of Appeals). Even a <em>ne exeat </em>order issued to protect a court\u2019s jurisdiction pending issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing a parent to object to the child\u2019s removal from the country. This Court need not decide the status of <em>ne exeat </em>orders lacking parental consent provisions, however; for here the father relies on his rights under Minors Law 16,618. Mr. Abbott\u2019s rights derive not from the order but from  Minors Law 16,618. That law requires the father\u2019s consent before the mother can remove the boy from Chile, subject only to the equitable power family courts retain to override any joint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement. Minors Law 16,618; see 1 J. Atkinson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Modern Child Custody Practice \u00a7 6-11, p. 6-21 (2d ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">[560 U.S. 15]</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">2009) (\u201c[T]he court remains the final arbiter and may resolve the [dispute between joint custodians] itself or designate one parent as having final authority on certain issues affecting the child\u201d); <em>Lombardo </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>202 Mich.

This is a right of custody under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">This Court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Abbott possesses a right of custody under the Convention is supported and informed by the State Department\u2019s view on the issue. The United States has endorsed the view that <em>ne exeat </em>rights are rights of custody. In its brief before this Court the United States advises that \u201cthe Department of State, whose Office of Children\u2019s Issues serves as the Central Authority for the United States under the Convention, has long understood the Convention as including <em>ne exeat </em>rights among the protected \u2018rights of custody.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>21; see <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, </em>457 U.S. 176, 184, n. 10, 102 S.

There is no reason to doubt that this well-established canon of deference is appropriate here. The Executive is well informed concerning the diplomatic consequences resulting from this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201crights of custody,\u201d including the likely reaction of other contracting states and the impact on the State Department\u2019s ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">[560 U.S. 16]</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">This Court\u2019s conclusion that <em>ne ex-eat </em>rights are rights of custody is further informed by the views of other contracting states.

In an early decision, the English Court of Appeal explained that a father\u2019s \u201cright to ensure that the child remain [ed] in Australia or live [d] anywhere outside Australia only with his approval\u201d is a right of custody requiring return of the child to Australia. <em>C. </em>v. <em>C., </em>[1989] 1 W.

The Canadian Supreme Court has said <em>ne exeat </em>orders are \u201cusually intended\u201d to protect access rights. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>[1994] 3 S. C. R. 551, 589-590, 119 D. L.

But the Canadian cases are not precisely on point here. <em>Thomson </em>ordered a return remedy based on an interim <em>ne exeat </em>order, and only noted in dicta that it may not order such a remedy pursuant to a permanent <em>ne exeat </em>order. See [1994] 3 S. C. R., at 589-590, 119 D. L. R. (4th), at 281. <em>D.

A French Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe right to accept or refuse the removal of the children\u2019s residence\u201d outside of a region was \u201ca joint exercise of rights of custody.\u201d <em>Minist\u00e8re public </em>v. <em>M.

A trial court in a different region of France rejected this</p>\n<p id=\"affm-dedup-1\">[560 U.S. 18]</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">view, relying on the mother\u2019s \u201cfundamental liberty\u201d to establish her domicile. See <em>Procureur de la R\u00e9publique de P\u00e9rigueux </em>v. <em>Mme S. </em>(TGI, P\u00e9rigueux, Mar. 17, 1992), in 82 Revue Critique de Droit International Priv\u00e9 650, 651-653 (Oct.-Dec. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Scholars agree that there is an emerging international consensus that <em>ne exeat </em>rights are rights of custody, even if that view was not generally formulated when the Convention was drafted in 1980. At that time, joint custodial arrangements were unknown in many of the contracting states, and the status of <em>ne exeat </em>rights was not yet well understood. See 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\u00e9, Enlevement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>d\u2019enfants, morning meeting of Wed., Oct. 8, 1980 (discussion by Messrs. Leal &amp; van Boeschoten), in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\u00e9me Session, pp. 263-266 (1982) (Canadian and Dutch delegates disagreeing whether the Convention protected <em>ne exeat </em>rights, while agreeing that it should protect such rights). Since 1980, however, joint custodial arrangements have become more common. See <em>supra, </em>at 12, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 803. And, within this framework, most contracting states and scholars now recognize that <em>ne exeat </em>rights are rights of custody. See, <em>e.g., </em>Hague Conference on Private International Law: Transfrontier Contact Concerning Children: General Principles and Guide to Good Practice \u00a7 9.3, p. 43 (2008) (\u201c[Preponderance of the case law supports the view\u201d that <em>ne exeat </em>rights are \u201crights of custody\u201d (footnote omitted)); Hague Conference on Private International Law: Overall Conclusions of the Special Commission of Oct. 1989 on the Operation of the Hague Convention of 25 Oct. 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, reprinted in 29 I.

L. 605, 611-616 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">A history of the Convention, known as the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report, has been cited both by the parties and by Courts of Appeals that have considered this issue. See 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\u00e9, Enlevement d\u2019enfants, E. P\u00e9rez-Vera, Explanatory Report (P\u00e9rez-Vera Report or Report), in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quator-zi\u00e9me Session, pp. 425-473 (1982). We need not decide whether this Report should be given greater weight than a scholarly commentary. Compare Hague International Child Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analysis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10503-10506 (1986) (identifying the Report as the \u201cofficial history\u201d of the Convention and \u201ca source of background on the meaning of the provisions of the Convention\u201d), with P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b68, at 427-428 (\u201c[The Report] has not been approved by the Conference, and it is possible that, despite the Rap-porter\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>efforts to remain objective, certain passages reflect a viewpoint which is in part subjective\u201d). It suffices to note that the Report supports the conclusion that <em>ne exeat </em>rights are rights of custody. The Report explains that  rather than defining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws of different nations pertaining to parental rights, the Convention uses the unadorned term \u201crights of custody\u201d to recognize <em>\u201call </em>the ways in which custody of children can be exercised\u201d through \u201ca flexible interpretation of the terms used, which allows the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b667, 71, at 446, 447-448. Thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Report rejects the notion that because <em>ne exeat </em>rights do not encompass the right to make medical or some other important decisions about a child\u2019s life they cannot be rights of custody. Indeed, the Report</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">[560 U.S. 20]</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">is fully consistent with the conclusion that <em>ne exeat </em>rights are just one of the many \u201cways in which custody of children can be exercised.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b671, at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Adopting the view that the Convention provides a return remedy for violations of <em>ne exeat </em>rights accords with its objects and purposes.  The Convention is based on the principle that the best interests of the child are well served when decisions regarding custody rights are made in the country of habitual residence. See Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Ordering a return remedy does not alter the existing allocation of custody rights, Art. 19, <em>id., </em>at 11, but does allow the courts of the home country to decide what is in the child\u2019s best interests. It is the Convention\u2019s premise that courts in contracting states will make this determination in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Custody decisions are often difficult.  Judges must strive always to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own society and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere with objective consideration of all the factors that should be weighed in determining the best interests of the child. This judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of the Convention, which affirms that the contracting states are \u201c[f] irmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody.\u201d Convention Preamble, <em>id., </em>at 7. International law serves a high purpose when it underwrites the determination by nations to rely upon their domestic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other parent holds a <em>ne exeat </em>right, would run counter to the Convention\u2019s purpose of deterring child abductions by parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding custodial disputes. Ms. Abbott removed A. J. A. from Chile while Mr. Abbott\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AGWk\">[560 U.S. 21]</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">request to enhance his relationship with his son was still pending before Chilean courts. After she landed in Texas, the mother asked the state court to diminish or eliminate the father\u2019s custodial and visitation rights.  The Convention should not be interpreted to permit a parent to select which country will adjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a different country, in violation of a <em>ne exeat </em>right. Denying a return remedy for the violation of such rights would \u201clegitimize the very action\u2014removal of the child\u2014that the home country, through its custody order [or other provision of law], sought to prevent\u201d and would allow \u201cparents to undermine the very purpose of the Convention.\u201d <em>Croll, </em>229 F.3d, at 147 (Soto-mayor, J., dissenting). This Court should be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that gives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to avoid a return remedy that is granted, for instance, in the United Kingdom, Israel, Germany, and South Africa. See <em>supra, </em>at 16, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805-806.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps deter child abductions and respects the Convention\u2019s purpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions. An abduction can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>have devastating consequences for a child. \u201cSome child psychologists believe that the trauma children suffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of child abuse.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 103-390, p. 2 (1993). A child abducted by one parent is separated from the second parent and the child\u2019s support system. Studies have shown that separation by abduction can cause psychological problems ranging from depression and acute stress disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity-formation issues. See N. Faulkner, Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse (1999-2006), http://www. prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm (as visited May 13, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A child abducted at an early age can experience loss of community and stability, leading to loneliness, anger, and fear of abandonment. See Huntington, Parental Kidnapping: A New</p>\n<p id=\"a6lp-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 22]</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Form of ChildAbuse (1984), in American Prosecutors Research Institute\u2019s National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse, Parental Abduction Project, Investigation and Prosecution of Parental Abduction (1995) (App. A). Abductions may prevent the child from forming a relationship with the left-behind parent, impairing the child\u2019s ability to mature. See Faulkner, <em>supra, </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">While a parent possessing a <em>ne exeat </em>right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy, a return order is not automatic. Return is not required if the abducting parent can establish that a Convention exception applies. One exception states return of the child is not required when \u201cthere is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\u201d Art. 13/6/, Treaty Doc., at 10. If, for example, Ms. Abbott could demonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own safety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this is sufficient to show that the child too would suffer \u201cpsychological harm\u201d or be placed \u201cin an intolerable situation.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Baran </em>v. <em>Beaty, </em>526 F.3d 1340, 1352-1353 (CA11 2008); <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>221 F.3d 204, 220-221 (CA1 2000). The Convention also allows courts to decline to order removal if the child objects, if the child has reached a sufficient \u201cage and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.\u201d Art. 13/6/, Treaty Doc., at 10. The proper interpretation and application of these and other exceptions are not before this Court. These matters may be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"pA1I5\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"54\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAVMAAAA2AQAAAABSfkeEAAAAoklEQVR4nO2VMQrCUBBEX5bUkgMJejM9jIew8DA/FqljJyiORYqsxUAgBCz+dm/+7DIsC78RS6uPxVao3ur9S+/PvXsIgM85KR62yosk7R+ay0IJQPfca4EAmnGcBQ9T3uuQFA9I0vOQIlooAdAeU7OHABiy4iEALm1SPCBJuz5FtDDtt+tSr4Vp7u2VRlkoSNL7lJ4tlK3urKl/QPVW7yrvF19/8Ibd97A8AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"339\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">[560 U.S. 23]</p>\n<author id=\"b897-12\">Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"AnjT\">with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">Petitioner Timothy Abbott, the father of A.

It is she who received sole custody, or \u201cdaily care and control,\u201d of A. J.

Mr. Abbott possesses only visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">On Ms. Abbott\u2019s custodial rights, Chilean law placed a restriction: She was not to travel with her son outside of Chile without either Mr. Abbott\u2019s or the court\u2019s consent. Put differently, Mr. Abbott had the opportunity to veto Ms. Abbott\u2019s decision to remove A. J. A. from Chile unless a Chilean court overrode that veto. The restriction on A. J. A.\u2019s and Ms. Abbott\u2019s travel was an automatic, default provision of Chilean law operative upon the award of visitation rights under Article 48 of Chile\u2019s Minors Law 16,618. It is this travel restriction\u2014 also known as a <em>ne exeat </em>clause\u2014that the Court today declares is a \u201c high[t] of custody\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention), Oct. 25, 1980, T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-11. <em>Ante, </em>at 5, 176 L.

J. A. from Chile without either Mr. Abbott\u2019s or the court\u2019s permission, Mr. Abbott is now entitled to the return of A. J. A. to Chile under the terms of the Convention. Thus, absent a finding of an exception to the Convention\u2019s powerful return remedy, see <em>ante, </em>at 22, 176 L.

P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b614, at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">The drafters determined that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>a <em>noncustodial </em>parent abducts a child across international borders, the best remedy is return of that child to his or her country of habitual residence\u2014or, in other words, the best remedy is return of the</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">[560 U.S. 25]</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">child to his or her <em>custodial </em>parent. <em>Id., </em>\u00b618, at 430. The drafters concluded that the same remedy should not follow, however, when a <em>custodial </em>parent takes a child from his or her country of habitual residence in breach of the other parent\u2019s visitation rights, or \u201crights of access\u201d in the Convention\u2019s parlance. <em>Id., </em>\u00b665, at 444-445. The distinction between rights of custody and rights of access, therefore, is critically important to the Convention\u2019s scheme and purpose. It defines the scope of the available Convention remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Article 5 defines these rights as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">\u201cFor the purposes of this Convention\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">\u201ca \u2018rights of custody\u2019 shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\"><em>\u201cb </em>\u2018rights of access\u2019 shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s habitual residence.\u201d S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-11, at 7 (hereinafter Treaty Doc.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Article 3 of the Convention provides that the removal or retention of a child is \u201cwrongful,\u201d and thus in violation of the Convention, only when the removal \u201cis in breach of the rights of custody.\u201d Art. <em>3(a), ibid. </em>The fact that a removal may be \u201cwrongful\u201d in the sense that it violates domestic law or violates only \u201crights of access\u201d does not make it \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Only when a removal is \u201cwrongful\u201d under Article 3 may the parent who possesses custody rights force the child\u2019s return to the country of habitual residence under the Convention\u2019s remedial procedures, pursuant to Articles 8 through 20. For those removals that frustrate a noncustodial parent\u2019s \u201crights of access,\u201d the Convention provides that the noncustodial parent may file an application \u201cto make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access\u201d; but he may not force the child\u2019s return. Art. 21, <em>id.., </em>at 11. A parent without \u201crights of custody,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVbM\">[560 U.S. 26]</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">therefore, does not have the power granted by Article 3 to compel the child\u2019s return to his or her country of habitual residence. His rights are limited to those set forth in Article 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Mr. Abbott, claiming \u201crights of custody\u201d by virtue of the travel restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott, seeks the return of A. J. A. to Chile. Such relief is warranted only if A. J. A.\u2019s removal was \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the Convention; as such, it must have been \u201cin breach of [Mr. Abbott\u2019s] rights of custody.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Art. 3, <em>id., </em>at 7. Putting aside the effect of the travel restriction, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>undisputed that Ms. Abbott possesses \u201crights of custody\u201d over A. J. A. while Mr. Abbott would possess \u201crights of access,\u201d as those terms are used in the Convention. Brief for Petitioner 6; Brief for Respondent 6. The only issue in this case, therefore, is whether Mr. Abbott also possesses \u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Convention by virtue of the travel restriction, or <em>ne exeat </em>clause, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Chilean law imposes on</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">[560 U.S. 27]</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Ms. Abbott. In other words, the question is whether the \u201cright\u201d of one parent to veto the other parent\u2019s decision to remove a child from the country, subject to judicial override, belongs in the category of \u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art. <em>5(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7. In my judgment, it clearly does not, and I need look no further than to the Convention\u2019s text to explain why. See <em>Medell\u00edn </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>552 U.S. 491, 506, 128 S. Ct. 1346, 170 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2008) (\u201cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\"><em>Rights relating to the care of the child. </em>The Court concludes that the veto power Mr. Abbott has over Ms. Abbott\u2019s travel plans is equivalent to those rights \u201c \u2018relating to the care of the person of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 11, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 802-803. This is so, the Court tells us, because Mr. Abbott has a limited power to keep A. J. A. within Chile\u2019s bounds and, therefore, indirectly to influence \u201cthe language the child speaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is not nearly as self-evident as the Court assumes that Mr. Abbott\u2019s veto power carries with it any ability to decide the language A. J. A. speaks or the cultural experiences he will have, <em>ante, </em>at 11-12, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 802-803. A. J. A.\u2019s mere presence in Chile does not determine any number of issues, including: whether A. J. A. learns Spanish while there; whether he attends an American school or a British school or a local school; whether he participates in sports; whether he is raised Catholic or Jewish or Buddhist or atheist; whether he eats a vegetarian diet; and on and on. The travel restriction does <em>not </em>confer upon Mr. Abbott affirmative power to make any number of decisions that are vital to A. J. A.\u2019s physical, psychological, and cultural development. To say that a limited power to veto a child\u2019s travel plans confers, also, a right \u201crelating to the care\u201d of that child devalues the great wealth of decisions a custodial parent makes on a daily basis to attend to a child\u2019s needs and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">[560 U.S. 28]</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The Court\u2019s interpretation depends entirely on a broad reading of the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d in the Convention\u2019s definition of \u201crights of custody.\u201d It is, undeniably, broad language. But, as the Court reads the term, it is so broad as to be utterly unhelpful in interpreting what \u201crights of custody\u201d means. We \u201ccannot forget that we ultimately are determining the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>ing of the term\u201d rights of custody in this case, and we should not lose sight of the import of this term in construing the broad words that follow in its wake. <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 11, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004). I suppose it could be said that Mr. Abbott\u2019s ability to decide whether A. J. A. spends the night with one of his friends during a Saturday visit is also a \u201cright relating to the care of the child.\u201d Taken in the abstract\u2014and to its most <em>absurd\u2014any </em>decision on behalf of a child could be construed as a right \u201crelating to\u201d the care of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Such a view of the text obliterates the careful distinction the drafters drew between the rights of custody and the rights of access. Undoubtedly, they were aware of the concept of joint custody. See P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b671, at 447 (\u201c[CJustody rights may have been awarded ... to that person in his own right or jointly. It cannot be otherwise in an era when types of joint custody, regarded as best suited to the general principle of sexual nondiscrimination, are gradually being introduced into internal law\u201d). But just because rights of custody can be shared by two parents, it does not follow that the drafters intended this limited veto power to be a right of custody. And yet this, it seems, is how the Court understands the case: Because the drafters intended to account for joint custodial arrangements, they intended for <em>this </em>travel restriction to be joint custody because it could be said, in some abstract sense, to relate to care of the child. I fail to understand how the Court\u2019s reading is faithful to the Convention\u2019s text and purpose, given that the text expressly contemplates two distinct classes of parental rights. Today\u2019s decision converts every noncustodial parent with access</p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\">[560 U.S. 29]</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">rights\u2014at least in Chile\u2014into a custodial parent for purposes of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">On this point, it is important to observe the effect of the Court\u2019s decision to classify the travel restriction as a right \u201crelating to\u201d A. J. A.\u2019s care. Mr. Abbott possesses no legal authority presently to exercise care or control of A. J. A., or to make decisions on his behalf. The Court would nevertheless read the Convention to require A. J. A.\u2019s return to a parent without such rights merely because the travel restriction, in an abstract sense, could be said to relate to A. J. A.\u2019s care. The Court fails to explain how a parent who otherwise possesses no legal authority to exercise \u201ccharge,\u201d \u201csupervision,\u201d or \u201cmanagement\u201d over a child, see Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 338 (1986) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s 3d) (5th definition of \u201ccare\u201d), can become a joint custodian of a child merely because he can attempt to veto one of the countless decisions the child\u2019s other parent has sole legal authority to make on the child\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\"><em>The right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence. </em>The Court also concludes that Mr. Abbott\u2019s veto power satisfies the Convention\u2019s definition of custodial rights because it is, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art. <em>5(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7. I disagree with the Court\u2019s assessment of the significance and meaning of this phrase, both on its face and within the context of the Convention\u2019s other provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">As an initial matter, the Court\u2019s reading of the Convention depends on isolating the phrase \u201cand, in particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d to refer to a freestanding right separate and apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>from the rights related to the care of the child. I do not agree with this view of the text, nor did the Convention\u2019s drafters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">\u201cThe Convention seeks to be more precise by emphasizing, as an <em>example </em>of the \u2018care\u2019 referred to [in the \u2018 \u201crights of custody\u201d \u2019 clause, Art. <em>5(a)}, </em>the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence. However, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">[560 U.S. 30]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">the child, although still a minor at law, has the right itself to determine its own place of residence, the <em>substance </em>of the custody rights will have to be determined in the context of other rights concerning the person of the child.\u201d P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b684, at 452 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The drafters thus intended the \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d to be an \u201cexample\u201d of what the Convention means by \u201ccare of the person of the child.\u201d It is indicative of the \u201csubstance\u201d of what it means to be a custodial parent. The definition is not, as the Court would have it, one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a singular \u201c \u2018righ[t] of custody,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 5, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 799; rather, it is a shorthand method to assess what types of rights a parent may have. The parent responsible for determining where and with whom a child resides, the drafters assumed, would likely <em>also </em>be the parent who has the responsibility to \u201ccare\u201d for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Yet even assuming, as the Court does, that the \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art. <em>5(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7, is divisible from the \u201ccare\u201d of the child, <em>ibid., </em>I still fail to understand how a travel restriction on one parent\u2019s exercise of her custodial rights is equivalent to an affirmative <em>\u201cright to determine </em>the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Analyzing its text, in the context of the Convention\u2019s focus on distinguishing custodial parents from noncustodial ones, leads me to conclude that the \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d means the power to set or fix the location of the child\u2019s home. It does not refer to the more abstract power to keep a child within one nation\u2019s borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">To \u201cdetermine\u201d means \u201cto fix conclusively or authoritatively\u201d or \u201cto settle a question or controversy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Webster\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"Aj_-\">[560 U.S. 31]</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">3d, at 616. A \u201cplace\u201d is a \u201cphysical environment\u201d or \u201ca building or locality used for a special purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1727. \u201cResidence,\u201d even standing alone, refers to a particular location\u2014 and not, more generally, to a nation or country. In the law, \u201cresidence\u201d can mean: \u201c[t]he act or fact of living in a given place for some time\u201d; \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>place where one actually lives\u201d; or \u201c[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1423 (9th ed. 2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lay definitions of \u201cresidence\u201d similarly describe a specific location: \u201cthe act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some time\u201d; \u201cthe place where one actually lives or has his home\u201d; or \u201ca temporary or permanent dwelling place, abode, or habitation.\u201d Webster\u2019s 3d, at 1931. It follows that a \u201cplace of residence\u201d describes a \u201cphysical\u201d location in which a child \u201cactually lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The Court\u2019s reading of this text depends on its substitution of the word \u201ccountry\u201d for the word \u201cplace.\u201d Such a substitution is not illogical, of course, in light of the Convention\u2019s international focus. See <em>Croll </em>v. <em>Croll, </em>229 F.3d 133, 147, 148 (CA2 2000) (Soto-mayor, J., dissenting) (reading \u201cplace of residence\u201d to mean \u201cauthority over the child\u2019s more specific</p>\n<p id=\"ApeT\">[560 U.S. 32]</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">living arrangements\u201d \u201cignores the basic international character of the Hague Convention\u201d). But it is inconsistent with the Convention\u2019s text and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">When the drafters wanted to refer to country, they did. For example, in Article 3, the drafters explained that rights of custody should be defined by looking to \u201cthe law of the State in which the child was habitually resident.\u201d Art. <em>3(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7. Had the drafters intended the definition of the child\u2019s \u201cplace of residence\u201d in Article 5 to refer to his or her \u201cState\u201d or country of \u201cresidence,\u201d they could have defined the \u201cright\u201d at issue as \u201cthe right to determine the child\u2019s State of habitual residence.\u201d But they did not, even though they used the phrase \u201cState of habitual residence\u201d no fewer than four other times elsewhere within the Convention\u2019s text.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the drafters also explained that \u201creference [s] to habitual residence in [a] State shall be construed as referring to habitual residence in a <em>territorial unit of that State.\u201d </em>Art. 31 <em>(a), id., </em>at 13 (emphasis added). The point is: When the drafters wanted to refer to a particular geographic unit, they did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Instead, the drafters elected the formulation \u201cplace of residence,\u201d which is also utilized similarly in the definition of \u201crights of access.\u201d See Art. <em>5(h), id., </em>at 7 (defining \u201c \u2018rights of access\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cthe right to take a child for a limited</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">[560 U.S. 33]</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">period of time to a <em>place </em>other than the child\u2019s habitual residence\u201d (emphasis added)). And they utilized this phrase only within one particular article, as opposed to their more frequent use of \u201cState of habitual residence\u201d throughout the Convention. In interpreting statutory text, we ordinarily presume that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>use of different words is purposeful and evinces an intention to convey a different meaning. See, <em>e.g., Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) (\u201cWe refrain from concluding here that the differing language in the two subsections has the same meaning in each. We would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship\u201d). There is no reason we should presume otherwise in the context of treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Accordingly, I would give \u201cplace of residence\u201d the location-specific meaning its plain text connotes, irrespective of the fact that this Convention concerns international abduction. The right described by the Convention is the right to decide, conclusively, where a child\u2019s home will be. And this makes a good deal of sense. The child lives with the parent who has custodial rights or, in the language of the Convention, \u201ccare of the person of the child,\u201d Art. <em>5(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7. The child\u2019s home\u2014his or her \u201cplace of residence\u201d\u2014is fixed by the custody arrangement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This comports too with the Convention\u2019s decision to privilege the rights of custodians over the rights of those parents with only visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\"><em>Understanding the effect of a travel restriction. </em>So, the question we confront is whether a travel restriction on one parent\u2019s right to embark on international travel with his or her child creates in the other parent a \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d or the ability \u201cto fix conclusively\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">[560 U.S. 34]</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">the child\u2019s \u201cphysical\u201d \u201chome.\u201d Before answering this question, it is important to understand the nature of the travel restriction we must classify.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The departure of a minor from Chile\u2014including when that child lives in a married, two-parent household\u2014is governed by Article 49 of that country\u2019s Minors Law 16,618. Under Chilean law, no minor is allowed outside of the country without his or her parents\u2019 authorization. Minors Law 16,618, Art. 49, App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a-62a. Ordinarily, if the judge has entrusted custody of a child to only one parent, the child may not leave without that parent\u2019s\u2014the custodial parent\u2019s\u2014permission. See <em>ibid..; </em>see also <em>id., </em>at 61a (\u201cIf the judge has entrusted custody to one of the parents or to a third party, the legitimate child may not leave except under authorization of the person to whom he has been entrusted\u201d). But the statute further provides that if the noncustodial parent has been granted visitation rights, the authorization of the parent with visitation rights shall also be required: \u201cOnce the court has decreed the obligation to allow visits pursuant to the preceding article,[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>^ authorization of the father or mother who has the right to visit a child shall also be required.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The statute provides, also, an important backstop in the event a noncustodial parent denies authorization \u201cwithout good reason\u201d: A Chilean court may grant the minor or his parent permission to leave the country. <em>Id., </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">[560 U.S. 35]</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">62a. Finally, if the custodial parent does not return the child to Chile within the time authorized, \u201cthe judge may decree the suspension of alimony that may have been decreed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Returning, then, to the question at hand: By virtue of the restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott\u2019s movement, Mr. Abbott has no \u201cright to determine [A. J. A.\u2019s] place of residence.\u201d He cannot \u201cconclusively\u201d \u201cfix,\u201d \u201csettle,\u201d or \u201cdetermine\u201d the place where A. J. A. \u201cactually lives or has his home.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 30-31, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 814-815. True, the travel restriction bestows upon the noncustodial parent a limited power to prevent his child from leaving the country without his permission, but it does not grant an affirmative power to fix or set the location of the child\u2019s home. Mr. Abbott has no power whatever to determine where A. J. A. actually lives within the nearly 300,000 square miles that compose Chile. Even more important, Mr. Abbott has no power whatever to select another country in which A. J. A. would live, were Mr. Abbott\u2019s work to take him to another country altogether. In sum, a right to object to a proposed departure gives a parent far less authority than a right to determine where the child shall reside. Moreover, the right to determine where to live within a country, as well as what country to live in, is far broader than the limited right to object to a child\u2019s travel abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">In my view, the \u201cright\u201d Mr. Abbott has by virtue of the travel restriction is therefore best understood as relating to his \u201crights of access,\u201d as the Convention defines that term\u2014and not as a standalone \u201c \u2018righ[t] of custody,\u2019 \u201d as the Court defines it, <em>ante, </em>at 5, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 799. Chile\u2019s statutory travel restriction provision is plainly ancillary to the access rights the Chilean family court granted to him as the noncustodial parent. By its terms, the obligation on the custodial parent to seek the other parent\u2019s permission before removing the child from Chile only operates upon the award of <em>visitation rights; </em>it has nothing to do with <em>custody rights. </em>And it operates automatically</p>\n<p id=\"AJl5\">[560 U.S. 36]</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">to facilitate the noncustodial parent\u2019s ability to access the child and to exercise his visitation rights. In the best of all possible circumstances, Mr. Abbott\u2019s limited veto power assures him relatively easy access to A. J. A. so that he may continue a meaningful relationship with his son. But this power, standing alone, does not transform him into a <em>custodian </em>for purposes of the Convention\u2019s return remedy. Instead, it authorizes him, pursuant to Article 21, to seek assistance from this country in carrying out the Chilean family court\u2019s visitation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Although the Court recognizes, as it must, that \u201c \u2018 [t] lie interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 802 (quoting <em>Medellin, </em>552 U.S., at 506, 128 S. Ct. 1346, 170 L. Ed. 2d 190), the Court\u2019s analysis is atextual\u2014at least as far as the Convention\u2019s text goes. The Court first relies on the text of the Chilean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>law at issue and a single Chilean administrator\u2019s alleged interpretation thereof.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>ante, </em>at 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">[560 U.S. 37]</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">While it is true that the meaning of Chile\u2019s statute matters to our determining whether a parent has taken a child in \u201cbreach of rights of custody . . . under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention,\u201d Art. <em>3(a), </em>Treaty Doc., at 7, it does not and should not inform what the Convention\u2019s definition of \u201crights of custody\u201d means in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The Court also reminds us that the Convention\u2019s terms are to be broadly construed. See <em>ante, </em>at 19-20, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 807-808. To be sure, the Convention\u2019s leading interpretive authority informs us that the Convention\u2019s understanding of what constitutes \u201crights of custody\u201d is broad and flexible. See P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b6\u00b667, 71, 84, at 446, 447, 451-452. And we are to apply its terms to \u201callo[w] the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b667, at 446. But such breadth should not circumvent the Convention\u2019s text in order to sweep a travel restriction under the umbrella of rights of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">A reading as broad and flexible as the Court\u2019s eviscerates the distinction the Convention draws between rights of custody and rights of access. Indeed, the Court\u2019s reading essentially voids the Convention\u2019s Article 21, which provides a separate remedy for breaches of rights of access. If a violation</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">[560 U.S. 38]</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">of this type of provision were not a breach of the rights of access, I find it quite difficult to imagine what the Convention\u2019s drafters had in mind when they created a second, lesser remedy for the breach of access rights. The drafters obviously contemplated that some removals might be in violation of the law of the child\u2019s home nation, but not \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Convention\u2014i.e., </em>not in breach of \u201crights of custody.\u201d This is precisely why Article 5 carefully de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>lineates between the two types of parental rights in the first place. And this is precisely why Article 21 exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Nevertheless, the Court has now decreed that whenever an award of visitation rights triggers a statutory default travel restriction provision, or is accompanied by a travel restriction by judicial order, a parent possesses a right of custody within the meaning of the Convention. Such a bright-line rule surely will not serve the best interests of the child in many cases. See <em>id., </em>\u00b625, at 432. It will also have surprising results. In Chile, for example, as a result of this Court\u2019s decision, <em>all </em>parents\u2014so long as they have the barest of visitation rights\u2014 now also have joint custody within the meaning of the Convention and the right to utilize the return remedy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">[560 U.S. 39]</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">It bears emphasis that such a result\u2014treating the type of travel restriction at issue in this case as part of \u201crights of custody\u201d\u2014will undermine the Convention\u2019s careful balance between the \u201crights of custody and the \u201crights of access\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-7\">\u201cAlthough the problems which can arise from a <em>breach of access rights, </em>especially where the child is taken abroad by its custodian, were raised during the Fourteenth Session, the majority view was that <em>such situations could, not be put in the same category as the wrongful removals which it is sought to prevent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-11\">\u201cThis example, and others like it where breach of access rights profoundly upsets the equilibrium established by a judicial or administrative decision, certainly demonstrate that decisions concerning the custody of children should always be open to review. This problem however defied all efforts of the Hague Conference to coordinate views thereon. <em>A questionable result would, have been attained had the application of the Convention, by granting the same degree of protection to custody and access rights, led. ultimately to the substitution of the holders of one type of right by those who held, the other.\u201d Id.., </em>\u00b665, at 444-445 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">It seems the very same authority on which the Court relies to support its broad, flexible reading of the Convention\u2019s terms also tell us that the drafters <em>expressly rejected </em>the very outcome the Court reaches today. Far from \u201crender[ing] the Convention meaningless,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 13, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 804, a faithful reading of the Convention\u2019s text avoids the very \u201cquestionable result\u201d its drafters foresaw and attempted to preclude</p>\n<p id=\"avh_-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 40]</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">were they to extend \u201cthe same degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>protection\u201d \u201cto custody and access rights.\u201d P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b665, at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Hence, in my view, the Convention\u2019s language is plain and that language precludes the result the Court reaches. See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, </em>457 U.S. 176, 180, 102 S. Ct. 2374, 72 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1982). In these circumstances, the \u201cclear import of treaty language controls\u201d the decision. <em>Ibid. </em>To support its reading of the text, however, the Court turns to authority we utilize to aid us in interpreting ambiguous treaty text: the position of the Executive Branch and authorities from foreign jurisdictions that have confronted the question before the Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>at 15-18, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805-807. Were I to agree with the Court that it is necessary to turn to these sources to resolve the question before us, I would not afford them the weight the Court does in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\"><em>Views of the Department of State. </em>Without discussing precisely why, we have afforded \u201cgreat weight\u201d to \u201cthe meaning given [treaties] by the departments of government particularly charged with their negotiation and <em>enforcement.\u201d Kolovrat </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U.S. 187, 194, 81 S. Ct. 922, 6 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1961); see also <em>Sumitomo, </em>457 U.S., at 184-185, 102 S. Ct. 2374, 72 L. Ed. 2d 765; <em>Factor </em>v. <em>Laubenheimer, </em>290 U.S. 276, 294, 54 S. Ct. 191, 78 L. Ed. 315 (1933). We have awarded \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the views of a particular government department even when the views expressed by the department are newly memorialized, see <em>Sumitomo, </em>457 U.S., at 184, n. 10, 102 S. Ct. 2374, 72 L. Ed. 2d 765, and even when the views appear contrary to those expressed by the department at the time of the treaty\u2019s signing and negotiation, <em>ibid. </em>In this case, it appears that both are true: The</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">[560 U.S. 41]</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Department of State\u2019s position, which supports the Court\u2019s conclusion, is newly memorialized, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>21, n. 13, and is possibly inconsistent with the Department\u2019s earlier position, see Convention Analysis 10504-10505.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Putting aside any concerns arising from the fact that the Department\u2019s views are newly memorialized and changing, I would not in this case abdicate our responsibility to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>pret the Convention\u2019s language. This does not seem to be a matter in which deference to the Executive on matters of foreign policy would avoid international conflict, cf. <em>Itel Containers Int\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>507 U.S. 60, 76, 113 S. Ct. 1095, 122 L. Ed. 2d 421 (1993) (acknowledging that \u201cthe nuances of foreign policy \u2018are much more the province of the Executive Branch and Congress than of this Court\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Container Corp. of America</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5ox\">[560 U.S. 42]</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 196, 103 S. Ct. 2933, 77 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1983))); the State Department has made no such argument. Nor is this a case in which the Executive\u2019s understanding of the treaty\u2019s drafting history is particularly rich or illuminating.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Factor, </em>290 U.S., at 294-295, 54 S. Ct. 191, 78 L. Ed. 315 (observing that \u201cdiplomatic history\u201d\u2014 \u201cnegotiations and diplomatic correspondence of the contracting parties relating to the subject matter\u201d\u2014is entitled to weight). Finally, and significantly, the State Department, as the Central Authority for administering the Convention in the United States, has failed to disclose to the Court whether it has facilitated the return of children to America when the shoe is on the other foot.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>4, n. 3 (describing responsibilities of the Central Authority). Thus, we have no informed basis to assess the Executive\u2019s postratification conduct, or the conduct of other signatories, to aid us in understanding the accepted meaning of potentially ambiguous terms. See <em>Zicherman </em>v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co., </em>516 U.S. 217, 227-228, 116 S. Ct. 629, 133 L. Ed. 2d 596 (1996) (considering \u201cpostratification conduct of the contracting parties\u201d); <em>Charlton </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>229 U.S. 447, 468, 33 S. Ct. 945, 57 L. Ed. 1274 (1913) (affording</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">[560 U.S. 43]</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">\u201cmuch weight\u201d to the fact that the \u201cUnited States has always construed its obligation\u201d under a treaty in a particular way and had acted in accord).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Instead, the Department offers us little more than its own reading of the treaty\u2019s text. Its view is informed by no unique vantage it has, whether as the entity responsible for enforcing the Convention in this country or as a participating drafter. The Court\u2019s perfunctory, one-paragraph treatment of the Department\u2019s judgment of this matter only underscores this point. <em>Ante, </em>at 15, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805. I see no reason, therefore, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>replace our understanding of the Convention\u2019s text with that of the Executive Branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\"><em>Views of foreign jurisdictions. </em>The Court believes that the views of other signatories to the Convention deserve special attention when, in a case like this, \u201cCongress has directed that \u2018uniform international interpretation of the Convention\u2019 is part of the Convention\u2019s framework.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 16, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11601(b)(3)(B)). This may well be correct, but we should not substitute the judgment of other courts for our own. See <em>Olympic Airways </em>v. <em>Husain, </em>540 U.S. 644, 655, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 1221, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1146 (2004). And the handful of foreign decisions the Court cites, see <em>ante, </em>at 16-17, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805-806, provide insufficient reason to depart from my understanding of the meaning of the Convention, an understanding shared by many U. S. Courts of Appeals. See, <em>e.g., </em>542 F.3d 1081 (CA5 2008) (case below); <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, </em>311 F.3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002) (parent\u2019s right to \u201crefuse permission for his children to leave Mexico\u201d \u201chardly amounts to a right of custody, in the plainest sense of the term\u201d); <em>Croll, </em>229 F.3d, at 140 (\u201cIf we were to enforce rights held pursuant to a <em>ne exeat </em>clause by the remedy of mandatory return, the Convention would become unworkable. ... It does not contemplate return of a child to a parent whose sole right\u2014to visit or veto\u2014imposes no duty to give care\u201d); <em>Fawcett </em>v. <em>McRoberts, </em>326 F.3d 491 (CA4 2003). Indeed, the interest in having our courts correctly</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">[560 U.S. 44]</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">interpret the Convention may outweigh the interest in having the <em>ne exeat </em>clause issue resolved in the same way that it is resolved in other countries. Cf. <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>523 U.S. 371, 375, 118 S. Ct. 1352, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529 (1998) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\u201c[W]hile we should give respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such, it has been recognized in international law that, absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">I also fail to see the international consensus\u2014let alone the \u201cbroad acceptance,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 16, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805\u2014that the Court finds among those varied decisions from foreign courts that have considered the effect of a similar travel restriction within the Convention\u2019s remedial scheme. The various decisions of the international courts are, at best, in equipoise. Indeed, the Court recognizes that courts in Canada and France have concluded that travel restrictions are not \u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Convention. <em>Ante, </em>at 17-18, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 806-807.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">And those decisions supportive of the Court\u2019s position do not offer nearly as much support as first meets the eye. For example, the English Court of Appeals decision on which the Court primarily relies, <em>ante, </em>at 16, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 805, appears to have decided a different issue. True, that court considered the effect of a similar travel restriction on both parents following the award of \u201c \u2018custody\u2019 \u201d to the child\u2019s mother. <em>C. </em>v. <em>C., </em>[1989] 1 W. L. R. 654, 656 (C. A.). But the family court had also decreed, at the time it awarded \u201ccustody\u201d to the mother, that both parents would remain \u201c \u2018joint guardians\u2019 \u201d of the child. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, in the time between the mother\u2019s removal of the child and the father\u2019s petitioning for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>his return, the father had returned to the family court in Sydney, obtained an order for the child\u2019s return, and received immediate custody of the child. <em>Ibid. </em>Comparable facts do not exist in this case. Cf. <em>Olympic Airways, </em>540 U.S., at 655, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 1221, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1146 (noting</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">[560 U.S. 45]</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">that \u201cwe are hesitant\u201d to follow decisions of other signatory courts when \u201cthere are substantial factual distinctions between\u201d the cases). Similar factual distinctions\u2014involving, typically, joint guardianship rights or shared decisionmaking rights\u2014are present in other of the foreign cases relied upon by the Court and Mr. Abbott.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Those foreign courts that have reached a position consistent with my own, the Court is right to point out, have also done so in slightly different factual scenarios. <em>Ante, </em>at 17, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 806. The Supreme Court of Canada, for example, first encountered a <em>ne exeat </em>provision as part of an interim custody order in <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>[1994] 3 S. C. R. 551, 589-590, 119 D. L. R. (4th) 253, 281. Although the Canadian high court concluded that a removal in breach of the temporary travel restriction was wrongful, it emphasized the interim nature of the provision, see n. 9, <em>supra, </em>and explained that the case would be different with a permanent order. See <em>Thomson, </em>[1994] 3 S. C. R., at 589, 119 D. L. R. (4th), at 281 (\u201cSuch a [permanent] clause raises quite different issues. It is usually intended to ensure permanent access to the non-custodial parent. The right of access is, of course, important but, as we have seen, it was not intended to be given the</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">[560 U.S. 46]</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">same level of protection by the Convention as custody\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Canadian Supreme Court later affirmed this important distinction in <em>D. S. v. V. W., </em>[1996] 2 S. C. R. 108, 139, 134 D. L. R. (4th) 481, 503 (rejecting argument that \u201cany removal of a child without the consent of the parent having access rights\u201d should authorize return remedy because such a reading of the Convention would \u201cindirectly afford the same protection to access rights as is afforded to custody rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">In sum, the decisions relied upon by the Court and Mr. Abbott from other signatories do not convince me that we should refrain from a straightforward textual analysis in this case in order to make way for a \u201cuniform international interpretation\u201d of the Convention. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11601(b)(3)(B). There is no present uniformity sufficiently substantial to justify departing from our indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>dent judgment on the Convention\u2019s text and purpose and the drafters\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">At bottom, the Convention aims to protect the best interests of the child. P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b625, at 432. Recognizing that not all removals in violation of the laws of the country of habitual residence are contrary to a child\u2019s best interests, the Convention provides a powerful but limited return remedy. The judgment of the Convention\u2019s drafters was that breaches of access rights, while significant (and thus expressly protected by Article 21), are secondary to protecting the child\u2019s interest in maintaining an existing custodial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">[560 U.S. 47]</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Today, the Court has upended the considered judgment of the Convention\u2019s drafters in favor of protecting the rights of noncustodial parents. In my view, the bright-line rule the Court adopts today is particularly unwise in the context of a treaty intended to govern disputes affecting the welfare of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\">.

Unfortunately, I fear the Court\u2019s preoccupation with deterring parental misconduct\u2014even, potentially, at the sake of the best interests of the child\u2014has caused it to minimize this important distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-12\">.

Because differences in statutory provisions, as well as cultural differences and personal predilections, may affect the opinions of local officials, I would attach no weight to the letter from Paula Strap Camus, describing Article 49 of Chile\u2019s Minors Law 16,618 as establishing a shared right to determine the place of residence of a child. Moreover, we have no obligation to defer, on questions of treaty interpretation, to the nonjudicial decisions of another signatory state, let alone a return request\u2014a piece of advocacy\u2014filed on behalf of Chile in another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">In any event, the letter cited offers much less support for the Court\u2019s position than meets the eye. Unlike in this case, in which a Chilean court has already decreed Ms. Abbott to be A. J. A.\u2019s sole custodian, in <em>Villegas Duran </em>v. <em>Arribada Beaumont, </em>\u201cno Judge of the Republic of Chile has granted the custody of the child to her mother Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region Metropolitana to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert, in <em>Villegas Duran </em>v. <em>Arribada Beaumont, </em>O. T. 2008, No. 08-775, p. 36a, cert. pending [Reporter\u2019s Note: See post, p. 921 [, 130 S. Ct. 3318, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1216]]. In other words, Ms. Camus\u2019 letter request for the child\u2019s return in that case depends on a provision of Article 49 not at issue in this case: \u201cIf the custody of a legitimate child has not been entrusted by the judge to any of his parents or to a third party, the child may not leave without authorization of both parents.\u2019\u2019App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The travel restriction that bound Ms. Abbott in this case, however, arose \u201c[o]nce the court. . . decreed the obligation to allow visits\u2019\u2019 by Mr. Abbott. <em>Ibid. </em>Although not before us, there may be a sound basis for distinguishing the legal effect and significance of a travel restriction in effect <em>prior to </em>an award of custody to either or both parents, from one that occurs ancillary to the award of visitation rights to a parent who has no custodial rights. Moreover, the U. S. Department of State, at the time the Convention was ratified, believed that the Convention would require return in these circumstances: \u201cChildren who are wrongfully removed or retained prior to the entry of a custody order are protected by the Convention. There need not be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the Convention\u2019s return provisions.\u2019\u2019 Convention Analysis 10505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b907-15\">. In 2003, the latest year for which statistics appear available, Chile\u2019s Central Authority, which is the entity responsible for administering its obligations under the Hague Convention, made five outgoing \u201caccess applications\u2019\u2019 under Article 21.

Were the Court correct\u2014and were the view the Court ascribes to Chile\u2019s interpretation of its own law also correct, see <em>ante, </em>at 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 802\u2014all of Chile\u2019s outgoing applications under the Convention almost certainly should have been \u201creturn applications\u2019\u2019 because any person with rights of access under Chilean law, also has a right of custody by virtue of the statutory <em>ne exeat </em>provision. It is plain that even Chilean officials have not thought correct the Court\u2019s interpretation of the intersection of the travel restriction in Article 49 of its Minors Law 16,618 and the Convention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\">.

The State Department explained to the Senate at the time it sought ratification of the Convention that the \u201cfundamental purpose of the Hague Convention\u2019\u2019 was \u201cto protect children from wrongful international removals or retentions by persons bent on obtaining their physical and/or legal custody.\u2019\u2019 Convention Analysis 10504. I find it quite unlikely, in light of its framing of the \u201cfundamental purpose\u2019\u2019 of the Convention, that the State Department would have agreed at the time that a removal was \u201cwrongful\u2019\u2019 within the meaning of the Convention when a parent <em>with physical custody </em>of a child took that child to another country, even when that removal was in violation of a restriction on the custodial parent\u2019s travel rights. See also Brief for Eleven Law Professors as <em>Amici Curiae </em>4-5, n. 7. Even more telling, however, is the fact that, in a response to a questionnaire used by the Convention\u2019s drafters in preparing the treaty, the United States characterized a <em>ne exeat </em>right as one with \u201cthe purpose of preserving the jurisdiction of the state in the custody matter and of safeguarding the visitation rights of the other parent.\u2019\u2019 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\u00e9, Enlevement d\u2019enfants, Replies of the Governments to the Questionnaire, in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\u00e9me Session, pp. 85, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>(1982). Such a description is inconsistent with the Department\u2019s current position that a <em>ne exeat </em>clause is a freestanding right of custody within the meaning of the Convention. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b909-10\">. This only underscores what seems quite clear: Whatever contemporary international consensus the Court claims has now emerged, \u201cthat view was not generally formulated when the Convention was drafted in 1980.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 18, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 806. I understand the Court\u2019s reference to contemporary consensus to depend on the views of contemporary scholars and individual signatory states developed postratification, including the views of the Special Commission, a voluntary <em>post hoc </em>collective body with no treaty-making authority, see <em>ibid. </em>Even assuming that the Court is correct that consensus has emerged after the Convention was written and ratified that <em>ne exeat </em>rights <em>should </em>be \u201crights of custody,\u2019\u2019 in my view this provides no support at all for the position that the Convention\u2019s drafters had these types of rights in mind and intended for the Convention to treat them as rights of custody. To the contrary, I think it tends to prove the opposite point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\">.
