When we granted certiorari, we rephrased the question presented to focus on that issue: \u201cWhether an action for criminal contempt in a congressionally created court may constitutionally be brought in the name and pursuant to the power of a private person, rather than in the name and pursuant to the power of the United States.\u201d 558 U.S. 1090-1091, 130 S. Ct. 1011, 175 L. Ed. 2d 617 (2009). The answer to that question is no. The terrifying force of the criminal justice system may only be brought to bear against an individual by society as a whole, through a prosecution brought on behalf of the government. The court below held otherwise, relying on a <em>dissenting </em>opinion in one of our cases, and on the litigating position of the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>which the Solicitor General has properly abandoned in this Court. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12-13, n. 3. We should correct the lower court\u2019s error and return the case to that court to resolve the remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">In March 1999, Wykenna Watson was assaulted by her then-boyfriend, John Robertson. App. 40. Watson sought and secured a civil protective order against Robertson, prohibiting him from approaching within 100 feet of her and from assaulting, threatening, harassing, physically abusing, or contacting her. <em>Id., </em>at 20. At the same time, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) was independently pursuing criminal charges against Robertson arising from the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">On June 26, Robertson violated the protective order by again violently assaulting Watson. On July 8, he was indicted for the previous March incident; shortly thereafter, the USAO offered, and Robertson accepted, a plea agreement resolving those charges. <em>Id., </em>at 26-30. At the top of</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">[560 U.S. 274]</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">the boilerplate plea form, the assistant U. S. attorney added in longhand: \u201cIn exchange for Mr. Robertson\u2019s plea of guilty to attempt[ed] aggravated assault, the gov\u2019t agrees to: DISMISS the [remaining] charges [,] [and] [n]ot pursue any charges concerning an incident on 6-26-99.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 28. The Superior Court accepted Robertson\u2019s plea and sentenced him to one to three years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id., </em>at 30, 46, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">A few months later, Watson filed a motion to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Robertson for violating the civil protective order, based on the June 26 assault. See D. C. Code \u00a7 16-1005(f) (2009 Supp.); D. C. Super. Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (Lexis 2010); <em>In re Robertson, </em>940 A.2d 1050, 1053 (D. C. 2008). After a 2-day bench trial, the court found Robertson guilty on three counts of criminal contempt and sentenced him to three consecutive 180-day terms of imprisonment, suspending execution of the last in favor of five years\u2019 probation. The court also ordered Robertson to pay Watson roughly $10,000 in restitution. App. 2, 63-64. Robertson filed a motion to vacate the judgment, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-12\">Robertson appealed. Criminal contempt prosecutions, he argued, \u201care between the public and the defendant,\u201d and thus could \u201conly be brought in the name of the relevant sovereign, . . . the United States.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 8, 10 (quoting Brief for Appellant in No. 00-FM-925 etc. (D. C.), pp. 20-21, and 940 A.2d, at 1057; internal quotation marks omitted). So viewed, the prosecution based on the June 26 incident could not be brought, because the plea agreement barred the \u201cgov[ernmen]t\u201d from pursuing any charges arising from that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-13\">The Court of Appeals rejected Robertson\u2019s arguments, in a two-step holding. Step one: \u201cthe criminal contempt prosecution in this case was conducted as a private action brought in the name and interest of Ms. Watson, not as a public action brought in the name and interest of the United States or any other governmental entity.\u201d 940 A.2d, at 1057-1058 (internal</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-14\">[560 U.S. 275]</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-15\">quotation marks and brackets omitted). Step two: because the criminal contempt prosecution was brought as an exercise of private power, that prosecution did not implicate a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>agreement that bound only the Government. <em>Id., </em>at 1059-1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">We granted certiorari to review the first step of that holding. 558 U.S. 1090, 130 S. Ct. 1011, 175 L. Ed. 2d 617 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1993), provides the answer to the question presented here. The question in <em>Dixon </em>was one of double jeopardy\u2014whether a private party\u2019s prosecution for criminal contempt barred the Government\u2019s subsequent prosecution for the \u201csame criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 696, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556. The private prosecution in that case was brought under the same D. C. contempt law at issue here. <em>Id., </em>at 692, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (citing D. C. Code \u00a7 16-1005 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">We thought it \u201cobvious\u201d in <em>Dixon </em>that double jeopardy protections barred the Government\u2019s subsequent prosecution. 509 U.S., at 696, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556. The Double Jeopardy Clause, of course, bars the second prosecution for the same offense only if that prosecution is brought by the same sovereign as the first. See <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>474 U.S. 82, 88-89, 106 S. Ct. 433, 88 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1985). Thus, the only possible way the Government\u2019s <em>second </em>prosecution could have offended the Double Jeopardy Clause is if the Court understood the criminal contempt prosecution to be the Government\u2019s <em>first prosecution\u2014i.e., </em>one brought <em>on behalf of the Government. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 451, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1989) (\u201cThe protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not triggered by litigation between private parties\u201d), overruled on other grounds by <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 118 S. Ct. 488, 139 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">That we treated the criminal contempt prosecution in <em>Dixon </em>as an exercise of government power should not be surprising. More than two centuries ago, Blackstone wrote</p>\n<p id=\"A5ao\">[560 U.S. 276]</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">that the king is \u201cthe proper person to prosecute for all public offences and breaches of the peace, being the person injured in the eye of the law.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *268. Blackstone repeated that principle throughout his fourth book. See, <em>e.g., </em>4 <em>id., </em>at *2, *8, *177. Not long after Blackstone, then-Representative John Marshall agreed, stating on the House floor that \u201cadminister [ing] criminal judgment... is a duty to be performed at the demand of the nation, and with which the nation has a right to dispense. If judgment... is to be pronounced, it must be at the prosecution of the nation.\u201d 10 Annals of Cong. 615 (1800).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-13\">This principle has deep historical roots. See, <em>e.g., </em>1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law \u00a7 10, p. 11 (9th ed. 1885) (\u201cPenal justice ... is a distinctive prerogative of the State, to be exercised in the service [of] the State\u201d); see also J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7 88, pp. 43-44 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (\u201c[E]very man who has entered into civil society, and is become a member of any commonwealth, has thereby quitted his power to punish offences against the law of nature in prosecution of his own private judgment^] . . . [H]e has given a right to the commonwealth to employ his force for the execution of the judgments of the commonwealth\u201d (footnote omitted)). As this Court has said before, \u201c[c]rimes and offences against the laws of any State can only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>defined, prosecuted and pardoned by the sovereign authority of that State.\u201d <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, </em>146 U.S. 657, 669, 13 S. Ct. 224, 36 L. Ed. 1123 (1892); see also <em>Heath, supra, </em>at 88, 106 S. Ct. 433, 88 L. Ed. 2d 387 (\u201cThe dual sovereignty doctrine [of the Double Jeopardy Clause] is founded on the common-law conception of crime as an offense against the sovereignty of the government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">These core principles are embodied in the Constitution. The protections our Bill of Rights affords those facing criminal prosecution apply to <em>\u201cany </em>person,\u201d <em>\u201cany </em>criminal case,\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>criminal prosecutions.\u201d Arndts. 5, 6 (emphasis added). But those protections apply only against <em>thegovernment; </em>\u201c[individual invasion of individual rights\u201d is not</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">[560 U.S. 277]</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">covered. <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3, 11, 3 S. Ct. 18, 27 L. Ed. 835 (1883) (Fourteenth Amendment). If the safeguards of the Bill of Rights are to be available in \u201call criminal prosecutions,\u201d then any such prosecution must be considered to be one on behalf of the government\u2014otherwise the constitutional limits do not apply. \u201cThe Constitution constrains governmental action \u2018by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken,\u2019 \u201d <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation, </em>513 U.S. 374, 392, 115 S. Ct. 961, 130 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1995) (quoting <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 339, 346-347, 25 L. Ed. 676 (1880)), but the action still must be <em>governmental </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">The court below, however, rejected this understanding, concluding that Watson\u2019s \u201ccriminal contempt prosecution\u201d was not \u201ca public action\u201d but \u201ca private action,\u201d such that it was not covered by an agreement binding the Government. 940 A.2d, at 1057-1058 (internal quotation marks omitted). But as we have explained, \u201c [t]he purpose of a criminal court is not to provide a forum for the ascertainment of private rights. Rather it is to vindicate the public interest in the enforcement of the criminal law while at the same time safeguarding the rights of the individual defendant.\u201d <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 25, 100 S. Ct. 1999, 64 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">The holding below gives rise to a broad array of unsettling questions. Take the Due Process Clause. It guarantees particular rights in criminal prosecutions because the prosecutor is a state actor, carrying out a \u201cduty <em>on the paH of the Government.\u201d Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995) (emphasis added). But if the criminal prosecution is instead viewed as \u201ca private action,\u201d not an exercise of sovereign power, how would those rights attach? Cf. <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 195-196, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1989). What about <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)? The private prosecutor is likely to have evidence pertinent to the proceeding\u2014particularly if, as here, the private prosecutor is also the victim of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">[560 U.S. 278]</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">But if the prosecutor is not exercising governmental authority, what would be the constitutional basis for any <em>Brady </em>obligations? May the private prosecutor interview the defendant without <em>Miranda </em>warnings, since she is not acting on behalf of any sovereign but only in a private capacity? See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the notion that a criminal prosecution pits the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>against the governed, not one private citizen against another. The ruling below is a startling repudiation of that basic understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Despite the foregoing, the Court of Appeals determined that Watson brought this criminal prosecution under her authority as a private citizen. 940 A.2d, at 1058. To reach that conclusion, the court relied on Justice Blackmun\u2019s separate opinion in <em>Dixon. </em>See 940 A.2d, at 1057 (\u201cAs Justice Blackmun said in <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>criminal contempt is \u2018a special situation.\u2019 <em>[Dixon, </em>509 U.S., at 742, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)]. . . . \u2018[T]he purpose of contempt is not to punish an offense against the community at large but rather to punish the specific offense of disobeying a court order.\u2019 <em>[Ibid..]\u201d </em>(citation omitted)). In fact, the court quoted from Justice Blackmun\u2019s separate opinion no fewer than four times. <em>Id., </em>at 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion, however, was a partial concurrence in the judgment and partial dissent, and it garnered only one vote. Moreover, the portion of the opinion relied upon by the court below was the <em>dissenting </em>part. A majority of the Court squarely rejected Justice Blackmun\u2019s view, and did so in plain terms. See <em>Dixon, </em>509 U.S., at 699-701, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (opinion of Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy, J.); see <em>id., </em>at 720, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (White, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Before this Court, Watson understandably retreats from Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissenting opinion. Instead, she argues</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">[560 U.S. 279]</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">that \u201c[i]n England and in America at the time of the Founding, prosecutions by victims of crime and their families were the rule, not the exception.\u201d Brief for Respondent 38-39. But such prosecutions, though brought by a private party, were commonly understood as an exercise of sovereign power\u2014the private party acting on behalf of the sovereign, seeking to vindicate a public wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">In England, for example, private parties could initiate criminal prosecutions, but the Crown\u2014entrusted with the constitutional responsibility for law enforcement\u2014could enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to halt the prosecution. See, <em>e.g., King </em>v. <em>Guerchy, </em>1 Black W. 545, 96 Eng. Rep. 315 (K. B. 1765); <em>King </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>2 Burr. 719, 720, 97 Eng. Rep. 531 (K. B. 1759); see also <em>King </em>v. <em>State, </em>43 Fla. 211, 223, 31 So. 254, 257 (1901) (Private prosecutions in England were understood to be \u201cconducted on behalf of the crown by the privately retained counsel of private prosecutors\u201d); P. Devlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 21 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">Watson\u2019s arguments based on American precedent fail largely for the same reason: To say that private parties could (and still can, in some places) exercise some control over criminal prosecutions says nothing to rebut the widely accepted principle that those private parties necessarily acted (and now act) on behalf of the sovereign. See, <em>e.g., Cronan ex rel. State </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>774 A.2d 866, 877 (R. I. 2001) (\u201c[A]ttorneys conducting private prosecutions stand in the shoes of the state\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Westbrook, </em>279 N.C. 18, 36, 181 S.E.2d 572, 583 (1971) (\u201cThe prosecuting attorney, whether the solicitor or privately employed counsel, represents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>the State\u201d); Sidman, The Outmoded Concept of Private Prosecution, 25 Am. U. L. Rev. 754, 774 (1976) (\u201c[T]he privately retained attorney becomes, in effect, a temporary public prosecutor\u201d). Indeed, many of the state court authorities Watson herself cites expressly recognize this fundamental point. See, <em>e.g., Katz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 305, 312, 399 N.E.2d 1055, 1060 (1979) (\u201c[I]t is clear with respect to the</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">[560 U.S. 280]</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">criminal aspects of the present case that the Commonwealth ... is the adverse party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">We have no need to take issue with that proposition, but this case is different. The whole point of the ruling below was that this was not a \u201cpublic action\u201d that happened to be litigated by a private party, but \u201ca private action brought in the name and interest of [Ms.] Watson.\u201d 940 A.2d, at 1057-1058 (internal quotation marks omitted). That holding was critical in explaining why Watson\u2019s criminal action was not barred by a plea agreement that bound the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Moving beyond criminal prosecutions generally, Watson next contends that contempt prosecutions are unique, and thus should be exempt from the general rule. See Brief for Respondent 24. If Watson means to argue that modern criminal con-tempts are not \u201ccrimes,\u201d that view was squarely rejected by this Court in <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 88 S. Ct. 1477, 20 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1968). See <em>id.., </em>at 199-200, 88 S. Ct. 1477, 20 L. Ed. 2d 522 (holding that a criminal contempt prosecution is a criminal prosecution for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment); see also <em>id., </em>at 201, 88 S. Ct. 1477, 20 L. Ed. 2d 522 (\u201cCriminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Providence Journal Co., </em>485 U.S. 693, 700, 108 S. Ct. 1502, 99 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1988) (\u201cThe fact that the allegedly criminal conduct concerns the violation of a court order instead of common law or a statutory prohibition does not render the prosecution any less an exercise of the sovereign power of the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">In any event, even if contempt prosecutions might not always count as \u201ccrimes,\u201d this one undoubtedly does, as Watson herself concedes. Brief for Respondent 34 (\u201c[T]his case was clearly a criminal contempt proceeding from beginning to end\u201d). That concession is well taken, given that whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is \u201ca matter of statutory construction,\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S., at 99, 118 S. Ct. 488, 139 L. Ed. 2d 450, and that the relevant provisions here make clear that contempt proceedings like this one are criminal, see D. C. Code \u00a7 16-1005(f) (2009 Supp.) (\u201c[C]riminal contempt shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for not more</p>\n<p id=\"As6T\">[560 U.S. 281]</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">than 180 days, or both\u201d); see also D. C. Super. Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (labeled \u201cMotion to adjudicate criminal contempt,\u201d and describing the violation as \u201ccriminal contempt\u201d). As Justice Holmes put it for the Court: \u201cThese contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech.\u201d <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>233 U.S. 604, 610, 34 S. Ct. 693, 58 L. Ed. 1115 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">The United States bears some responsibility for leading the court below astray. In that court, the Government argued that the criminal contempt prosecution was \u201c \u2018a private action brought in the name and interest of [Ms.] Watson, not ... a public action brought in the name and inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>est of the United States or any other governmental entity.\u2019 \u201d 940 A.2d, at 1056 (quoting Brief for United States in No. 00-FM-925 etc. (D. C.), p. 6). The court below quoted that precise language in stating its conclusion. See 940 A.2d, at 1057-1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Before this Court, the Solicitor General has properly abandoned that position, and does not defend the lower court\u2019s decision on this issue. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12-13, n. 3 (\u201c[T]he United States no longer believes the contempt prosecution at issue can be understood as a purely \u2018private action\u2019 \u201d). We should do our part and correct the ruling of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The ultimate issue in this case, of course, is whether the criminal contempt prosecution Watson initiated in January 2000 violated the plea agreement Robertson signed with the USAO in July 1999. The Court of Appeals said \u201cno,\u201d based solely on its determination that Watson was exercising private\u2014not sovereign\u2014power. With that determination in hand, the ultimate plea agreement question was straightforward: If Watson was wielding purely private power, a plea</p>\n<p id=\"AkTQv\">[560 U.S. 282]</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">agreement that by its terms bound only the \u201cgov[ernmen]t\u201d would not bind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">With a proper view of Watson\u2019s role in this case, however, the plea agreement question becomes significantly more difficult. The Solicitor General argues that the agreement does not bar the contempt prosecution, even if that prosecution is correctly viewed as on behalf of the sovereign. <em>Id., </em>at 29-32. The difficult aspects of that legal issue, however, should not cause us to shy away from answering the fundamental threshold question whether a criminal prosecution may be brought on behalf and in the interest of a private party. Having decided that threshold question in favor of Robertson, I would remand to the court below to consider the plea agreement from the proper starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">In light of all the foregoing, it is worth stressing that the majority\u2019s determination not to decide that question \u201ccarries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court\u2019s views on the merits <em>.\u2019\u2019 Maryland </em>v. <em>Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., </em>338 U.S. 912, 919, 70 S. Ct. 252, 94 L. Ed. 562 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., respecting denial of certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"pAobp\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAREAAAAlAQAAAABNc+AsAAAAlklEQVR4nOXTsQlCQRAE0LnBwMzfgNiIWNvaga2Y/dDAAixBzYzEUBDH0AEHfvIDxc3esHvcwl0ThmrNwRbg33t2HiRIWsjqEzXifQ7zejuBQG9pBIHlw+II6ba1TQIK0nNmcUARaJ0dn0DgvrE4gcClWZxA4Dy1fRMI7Cc2GiFdV7ZKQBHoTjaaMOY7PHoQ8I1/59d6XlAqo6yNCdfbAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"273\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">Allegorical depictions of the law frequently show a figure wielding a sword\u2014the sword of justice, to be used to smite those who violate the criminal laws. Indeed, outside our own courthouse you will find a statue of more than 30 tons, Authority of Law, which portrays a male figure with such a sword. According to the sculptor, James Earle Fraser (who also designed the buffalo nickel), the figure sits \u201c \u2018waiting] with concentrated attention, holding in his left hand the tablet of laws, backed by the sheathed sword, symbolic of enforcement through law.\u2019 \u201d Supreme Court of the United States, Office of the Curator, Contemplation of Justice and Authority of Law Information Sheet 2 (2009) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A basic step in organizing a civilized society is to take that sword out of private hands and turn it over to an organized government, acting on behalf of</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">[560 U.S. 283]</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-13\">all the people. Indeed, \u201c[t]he . . . power a man has in the state of nature is the power to punish the crimes committed against that law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>[But this] he gives up when he joins [a] . . . political society, and incorporates into [a] commonwealth.\u201d Locke, Second Treatise \u00a7 128, at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">The ruling below contravenes that fundamental proposition, and should not be allowed to stand. At the very least, we should do what we decided to do when we granted certiorari, and took the unusual step of rephrasing the question presented: answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s belated determination not to answer that question.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1119-6\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"a5cb-dedup-0\">with whom Justice Kennedy joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The Chief Justice would hold that criminal prosecutions, including criminal contempt proceedings, must be brought on behalf of the government. I join his opinion with the understanding that the narrow holding it proposes does not address civil contempt proceedings or consider more generally the legitimacy of existing regimes for the enforcement of restraining orders.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
