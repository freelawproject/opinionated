Their purpose and intent was to honor American soldiers</p>\n<p id=\"a-cz-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 706]</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">who fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated over time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same place. It is on federal land.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">The Court is asked to consider a challenge, not to the first placement of the cross or its continued presence on federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to a private party. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108-87, \u00a7 8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. The District Court permanently enjoined the Government from implementing the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We conclude that its judgment was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">The Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) spans approximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern California. The Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose picturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square miles, exceeding in size the combined area of the Nation\u2019s five smallest States. See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Geographical Dictionary 755, 1228-1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90 percent of the land in the Preserve is federally owned, with the rest owned either by the State of California or by private parties. The National Park Service, a division of the Department of the Interior, administers the Preserve as part of the National Park System. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 410aaa-41 and 410aaa-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">Sunrise Rock is a granite outcropping located within the Preserve. Sunrise Rock and the area in its immediate vicinity are federal land, but two private ranches are located less than two miles away. The record does not indicate whether fencing is used to mark the boundary of these ranches. In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin cross on the rock as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War I. A Latin cross consists of two</p>\n<p id=\"b729-16\">[559 U.S. 707]</p>\n<p id=\"b729-17\">bars\u2014a vertical one and a shorter, horizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at various times over the years, most recently in 1998 by Henry Sandoz. Sandoz is a private citizen who owns land elsewhere in the Preserve, a portion of which he is prepared to transfer to the Government in return for its conveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross stands, all pursuant to the statute now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of 4-inch diameter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less than eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest highway, which lies more than 10 miles away. It is visible, however, from Cima Road, a narrow stretch of blacktop that comes within 100 feet of Sunrise Rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">The cross has been a gathering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>place for Easter services since it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock and its immediate area continue to be used as a campsite. At one time the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating \u201c \u2018The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,\u2019 and \u2018Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic] Wars, Death Valley post 2884.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Kempthorne, </em>527 F.3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since disappeared, and the cross now stands unmarked.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Frank Buono, respondent here, is a retired Park Service employee who makes regular visits to the Preserve. Buono claims to be offended by the presence of a religious symbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. He alleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and sought an injunction requiring the Government to remove the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The litigation proceeded in what can be described as four stages. In the first, the District Court ruled in Buo-no\u2019s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment. <em>Buono</em></p>\n<p id=\"a5tz-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 708]</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">v. <em>Norton, </em>212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (2002) <em>(Buono I). </em>As an initial matter, the court found that Buono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause challenge. <em>Id., </em>at 1210-1214. On the merits, the parties agreed that the dispute should be governed by the so-called <em>Lemon </em>test, which the District Court formulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u201cA government religious practice or symbol will survive an Establishment Clause challenge when it (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) does not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.\u201d <em>Buono I, supra, </em>at 1214-1215 (citing <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 91 S. Ct. 2105, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1971)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The court expressly declined to consider whether the Government\u2019s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214-1215, or whether they caused excessive entanglement with religion, <em>id., </em>at 1217, n. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the cross by asking how it would be viewed by a \u201creasonable observer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1216. Concluding that presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, the court granted Buono\u2019s request for injunc-tive relief. The court\u2019s order in <em>Buono I </em>(2002 injunction) permanently forbade the Government \u201cfrom permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it required the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not forbid alternative methods of complying with the order. The Government covered the cross, first with a tarpaulin and later with a plywood box.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">On appeal, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono\u2019s Establishment Clause challenge. <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>371 F.3d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">[559 U.S. 709]</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">543 (CA9 2004) <em>(Buono II). </em>Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the Government\u2019s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had been motivated by a secular purpose. <em>Id., </em>at 550. Its ruling was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>based instead on the conclusion that a reasonable observer would perceive a cross on federal land as governmental endorsement of religion. <em>Id., </em>at 549-550. The Government did not seek review by this Court, so that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Buono II </em>became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">During the relevant proceedings, Congress enacted certain statutes related to the cross:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">(1) Before <em>Buono I </em>was filed, Congress passed an appropriations bill that included a provision forbidding the use of governmental funds to remove the cross. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106-554, \u00a7 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">(2) While <em>Buono I </em>was pending before the District Court, Congress designated the cross and its adjoining land \u201cas a national memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.\u201d Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L. 107-117, \u00a7 8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The Secretary of the Interior was directed to expend up to $10,000 to acquire a replica of the original cross and its memorial plaque and to install the plaque at a suitable nearby location. \u00a7 8137(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">(3) Three months after <em>Buono I </em>was decided, Congress again prohibited the spending of governmental funds to remove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. 107-248, \u00a7 8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">(4) While the Government\u2019s appeal in <em>Buono II </em>was pending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer statute) directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the VFW the Government\u2019s interest in the land that had been designated a</p>\n<p id=\"Aiaul\">[559 U.S. 710]</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">national memorial. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, \u00a7 8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. In exchange, the Government was to receive land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry Sandoz and his wife. <em>Ibid. </em>Any difference in value between the two parcels would be equalized through a cash payment. \u00a7\u00a7 8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the property would revert to the Government if not maintained \u201cas a memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.\u201d \u00a7 8121(e). The statute presents a central issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Buono II </em>did not address the effect on the suit of a potential land transfer under the statute. The court noted that the transfer might \u201ctake as long as two years to complete,\u201d 371 F.3d, at 545, and that its effect was not yet known, <em>id., </em>at 545-546. The court thus \u201cexpress [ed] no view as to whether a transfer completed under [the statute] would pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">After the Court of Appeals affirmed in <em>Buono II, </em>Buono returned to the District Court seeking to prevent the land transfer. He sought injunctive relief against the transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court described the relevant question as whether the land transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as the Government claimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the cross in place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>(as Buono claimed). <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) <em>(Buono III). </em>In <em>Buono III, </em>the court did not consider whether the transfer itself was an \u201cindependent violation of the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless concluded that the transfer was an attempt by the Government to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was invalid. The court granted Buono\u2019s motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as</p>\n<p id=\"AjoJ\">[559 U.S. 711]</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">moot his motion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute. <em>Id., </em>at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Court of Appeals again affirmed, largely following the reasoning of the District Court. <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Kempthorne, </em>502 F.3d 1069 (CA9 2007). The Government\u2019s motion for rehearing en banc was denied over a dissent by Judge O\u2019Scannlain, 527 F.3d 758, and this Court granted certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1313, 173 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Before considering the District Court\u2019s order on the merits, the first inquiry must be with respect to Buo-no\u2019s standing to maintain this action.  To demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must have \u201calleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant <em>his </em>invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>557 U.S. 433, 445, 129 S. Ct. 2579, 174 L. Ed. 2d 406 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that Buono\u2019s asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not confer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does not find the cross itself objectionable but instead takes offense at the presence of a religious symbol on federal land. Buono does not claim that, as a personal matter, he has been made to feel excluded or coerced, and so, the Government contends, he cannot object to the presence of the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Whatever the validity of the objection to Buono\u2019s standing, that argument is not available to the Government at this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved the District Court in <em>Buono I </em>for an injunction requiring the removal of the cross, the Government raised the same standing objections it proffers now. Rejecting the Government\u2019s position, the District Court entered a judgment in Buono\u2019s favor, which the Court of Appeals affirmed in <em>Buono II. </em>The Government did not seek review in this Court. The judgment became final and unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c) for filing a petition</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">[559 U.S. 712]</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">for certiorari. <em>Toledo Scale Co. </em>v. <em>Computing Scale Co., </em>261 U.S. 399, 418, 43 S. Ct. 458, 67 L. Ed. 719 (1923); see <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>495 U.S. 33, 45, 110 S. Ct. 1651, 109 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1990) (90-day deadline is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d). The Government cannot now contest Buono\u2019s standing to obtain the final judgment in <em>Buono I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Of course, even though the Court may not reconsider whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction, it is still necessary to evaluate his standing in <em>Buono III </em>to seek application of the injunction against the land-transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the judgment upon which we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">This was a measure of relief that Buono had standing to seek.  A party that obtains a judgment in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>favor acquires a \u201cjudicially cognizable\u201d interest in ensuring compliance with that judgment. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 763, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1984) (plaintiffs\u2019 right to enforce a desegregation decree to which they were parties is \u201ca personal interest, created by law, in having the State refrain from taking specific actions\u201d). Having obtained a final judgment granting relief on his claims, Buono had standing to seek its vindication.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The Government does not deny this proposition as a general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not seeking to vindicate\u2014but rather to extend\u2014the 2002 injunction. The first injunction prohibited the Government from maintaining the cross on Sunrise Rock; yet in <em>Buono III </em>he sought to preclude the land transfer, a different governmental action. The Government contends that Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief. Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The Government\u2019s argument, however, is properly addressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not to Buono\u2019s standing to seek that relief. The Government has challenged whether appropriate relief was granted in <em>Buono III </em>in light of the relevant considerations and legal principles, and we shall consider these questions. The standing inquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury that</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">[559 U.S. 713]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">prompted the plaintiff to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction in the first place. Buono\u2019s entitlement to an injunction having been established in <em>Buono I </em>and <em>II, </em>he sought in <em>Buono III </em>to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that injunction. Based on the rights he obtained under the earlier decree\u2014against the same party, regarding the same cross and the same land\u2014his interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing. Although Buono also argued that the land transfer should be prohibited as an \u201cindependent\u201d Establishment Clause violation, the District Court did not address or order relief on that claim, which is not before us. <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a case in which a party seeks to import a previous standing determination into a wholly different dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence contends that the injunction did not provide a basis for the District Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is not an argument about standing but about the merits of the District Court\u2019s order. Those points now must be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">The procedural history of this litigation must be considered to identify the issues now subject to review. The District Court granted the 2002 injunction after concluding that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment Clause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that conclusion on appeal, and the judgment became final upon completion of direct review. At that point, the judgment \u201cbecame res judicata to the parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.\u201d <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>557 U.S. 137, 152, 129 S. Ct. 2195, 174 L. Ed. 2d 99 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government</p>\n<p id=\"Aec9\">[559 U.S. 714]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">therefore does not\u2014and could not\u2014 ask this Court to reconsider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>propriety of the 2002 injunction or the District Court\u2019s reasons for granting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The question now before the Court is whether the District Court properly enjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court did not consider whether the statute, in isolation, would have violated the Establishment Clause, and it did not forbid the land transfer as an independent constitutional violation. <em>Buono III, supra, </em>at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the court enjoined compliance with the statute on the premise that the relief was necessary to protect the rights Buono had secured through the 2002 injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">An injunction is an exercise of a court\u2019s equitable authority, to be ordered only after taking into account all of the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective relief. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U.S. 106, 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999 (1932). See also <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. 305, 312, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1982); <em>Hecht Co. </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S. Ct. 587, 88 L. Ed. 754 (1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, <em>&amp; </em>M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2942, pp. 39-42 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). Equitable relief is not granted as a matter of course, see <em>Weinberger, </em>456 U.S., at 311-312, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91, and a court should be particularly cautious when contemplating relief that implicates public interests, see <em>id., </em>at 312 (\u201cIn exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction\u201d); <em>Harrisonville </em>v. <em>W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., </em>289 U.S. 334, 338, 53 S. Ct. 602, 77 L. Ed. 1208 (1933) (\u201cWhere an important public interest would be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunction may be compelling\u201d). Because injunctive relief \u201cis drafted in light of what the court believes will be the future course of events, ... a court must never ignore significant changes in the law or circumstances underlying an injunction lest the decree be turned into an \u2018instrument of</p>\n<p id=\"Agd-\">[559 U.S. 715]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">wrong.\u2019 \u201d Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 2961, at 393-394 (quoting <em>Swift &amp; Co., supra, </em>at 115, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested relief. The court, however, did not acknowledge the statute\u2019s significance. It examined the events that led to the statute\u2019s enactment and found an intent to prevent removal of the cross. Deeming this intent illegitimate, the court concluded that nothing of moment had changed. This was error. Even assuming that the land-transfer statute was an attempt to prevent removal of the cross, it does not follow that an injunction against its implementation was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">By dismissing Congress\u2019 motives as illicit, the District Court took insufficient account of the context in which the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage. Private citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to commemorate American servicemen who had died in World War I. Although certainly a Christian symbol, the cross was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian message. Cf. <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, </em>492 U.S. 573, 661, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids a city to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the roof of city hah . . . because such an obtrusive year-round religious display would place the government\u2019s weight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion\u201d). Placement of the cross on Government-owned land was not an attempt to set the <em>imprimatur </em>of the state on a particular creed. Rather, those who erected the cross intended simply to honor our Nation\u2019s fallen soldiers. See Brief for VFW et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>15 (noting that the plaque accompanying the cross \u201cwas decorated with VFW decals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">[559 U.S. 716]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Time also has played its role. The cross had stood on Sunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness. See <em>ibid. </em>Members of the public gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay their respects. Rather than let the cross deteriorate, community members repeatedly took it upon themselves to replace it. Congress ultimately designated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it among those monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that constitute our national heritage. See note following 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 431 (listing officially designated national memorials, including the National D-Day Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial). Research discloses no other national memorial honoring American soldiers\u2014more than 300,000 of them\u2014who were killed or wounded in World War I. See generally A. Leland &amp; M. Oboroceanu, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists and Statistics 2 (2009). It is reasonable to interpret the congressional designation as giving recognition to the historical meaning that the cross had attained. Cf. <em>Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>545 U.S. 677, 702-703, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201c40 years\u201d without legal challenge to a Ten Commandments display \u201csuggest that the public visiting the [surrounding] grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets\u2019 message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma. It could not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as honoring. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 704, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (to invalidate a longstanding Ten Commandments display might \u201ccreate the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">[559 U.S. 717]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">seeks to avoid\u201d). Deeming neither alternative to be satisfactory, Congress enacted the statute here at issue.  Congress, of course, may not use its legislative powers to reopen final judgments. See <em>Plaut </em>v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 211, 225-226, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995). That principle, however, was not a bar to this statute. The Government\u2019s right to transfer the land was not adjudicated in <em>Buono I </em>or compromised by the 2002 injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">In belittling the Government\u2019s efforts as an attempt to \u201cevade\u201d the injunction, <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, the District Court had things backwards. Congress\u2019 prerogative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>balance opposing interests and its institutional competence to do so provide one of the principal reasons for deference to its policy determinations. See <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of Fla., </em>457 U.S. 496, 513, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982). Here, Congress adopted a policy with respect to land it now owns in order to resolve a specific controversy.  Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary all have a duty to support and defend the Constitution. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 703, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974) (\u201cIn the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others\u201d). The land-transfer statute embodies Congress\u2019 legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a framework and policy of accommodation for a symbol that, while challenged under the Establishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the expression of religious views. That judgment should not have been dismissed as an evasion, for the statute brought about a change of law and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Buono maintains that any governmental interest in keeping the cross up must cede to the constitutional concerns on which the 2002 injunction was based. He argues that the land transfer would be \u201can incomplete remedy\u201d to the constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"Aehj\">[559 U.S. 718]</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">violation underlying the injunction and that the transfer would make achieving a proper remedy more difficult. Brief for Respondent 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy to the wrong or injury that has been established. See <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U.S., at 114, 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999 (\u201cA continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>391 U.S. 244, 249, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1968). Where legislative action has undermined the basis upon which relief has previously been granted, a court must consider whether the original finding of wrongdoing continues to justify the court\u2019s intervention. See <em>Railway Employees </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>364 U.S. 642, 648-649, 81 S. Ct. 368, 5 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1961); <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>18 How. 421, 430-432, 15 L. Ed. 435 (1856). The relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the court\u2019s equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances have rendered prospective relief inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based solely on its conclusion that presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion. The court expressly disavowed any inquiry into whether the Government\u2019s actions had a secular purpose or caused excessive entanglement. <em>Buono I, </em>212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1215, 1217, n. 9. The Court of Appeals affirmed the injunction on the same grounds, similarly eschewing any scrutiny of governmental purpose. <em>Buono II, </em>371 F.3d, at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Although, for purposes of the opinion, the propriety of the 2002 injunction may be assumed, the following discussion should not be read to suggest this Court\u2019s agreement with that judgment, some aspects of which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>be questionable.  The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the public realm. A cross by the side of a public highway marking, for instance,</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">[559 U.S. 719]</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">the place where a state trooper perished need not be taken as a statement of governmental support for sectarian beliefs. The Constitution does not oblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of religion\u2019s role in society. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Weisman, </em>505 U.S. 577, 598, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1992) (\u201cA relentless and all-pervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public life could itself become inconsistent with the Constitution\u201d). See also <em>Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>483 U.S. 327, 334, 107 S. Ct. 2862, 97 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1987) (\u201cThis Court has long recognized that the government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the Establishment Clause\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Rather, it leaves room to accommodate divergent values within a constitutionally permissible framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Even assuming the propriety of the original relief, however, the question before the District Court in <em>Buono III </em>was whether to invalidate the land transfer. Given the sole reliance on perception as a basis for the 2002 injunction, one would expect that any relief grounded on that decree would have rested on the same basis. But the District Court enjoined the land transfer on an entirely different basis: its suspicion of an illicit governmental purpose. See <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. The court made no inquiry into the effect that knowledge of the transfer of the land to private ownership would have had on any perceived governmental endorsement of religion, the harm to which the 2002 injunction was addressed. The District Court thus used an injunction granted for one reason as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason. Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper\u2014absent a finding that the relief was necessary to address an independent wrong. See <em>ibid., </em>n. 8 (noting that the court \u201cneed not consider [Buono\u2019s] other contention that the land transfer itself is an independent violation of the Establishment Clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">[559 U.S. 720]</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The District Court should have evaluated Buono\u2019s modification request in light of the objectives of the 2002 injunction. The injunction was issued to address the impression conveyed by the cross on federal, not private, land. Even if its purpose were characterized more generally as avoiding the perception of governmental endorsement, that purpose would favor\u2014or at least not oppose\u2014 ownership of the cross by a private party rather than by the Government. Cf. <em>Pleasant Grove City </em>v. <em>Summum, </em>555 U.S. 460, 471, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2009) (\u201c[Piersons who observe donated monuments routinely\u2014and reasonably\u2014interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner\u2019s behalf\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Buono argues that the cross would continue to stand on Sunrise Rock, which has no visual differentiation from the rest of the primarily federally owned Preserve. He also points to the reversionary clause in the land-transfer statute requiring that the land be returned to the Government if not maintained as a World War I memorial. Finally, he notes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>cross remains designated a national memorial by an Act of Congress, which arguably would prevent the VFW from dismantling the cross even if it wanted to do so. Brief for Respondent 37-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The District Court failed to consider whether, in light of the change in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute, the \u201creasonable observer\u201d standard continued to be the appropriate framework through which to consider the Establishment Clause concerns invoked to justify the requested relief.  As a general matter, courts considering Establishment Clause challenges do not inquire into \u201creasonable observer\u201d perceptions with respect to objects on private land. Even if, however, this standard were the appropriate one, but see <em>County of Allegheny, </em>492 U.S., at 668, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing the \u201creasonable observer\u201d test); <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. </em>v. <em>Pinette, </em>515 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">[559 U.S. 721]</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">753, 763-768, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1995) (plurality opinion) (criticizing reliance on \u201cperceived endorsement\u201d), it is not clear that Buo-no\u2019s claim is meritorious.  That test requires the hypothetical construct of an objective observer who knows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the symbol and its placement. See <em>id., </em>at 780, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But see <em>id., </em>at 767-768, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (plurality opinion) (doubting the workability of the reasonable observer test). Applying this test here, the message conveyed by the cross would be assessed in the context of all relevant factors. See <em>Van Orden, </em>545 U.S., at 700, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (the  Establishment Clause inquiry \u201cmust take account of context and consequences\u201d); <em>Lee, </em>505 U.S., at 597, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467 (\u201cOur Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains a delicate and fact-sensitive one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The District Court did not attempt to reassess the findings in <em>Buono I </em>in light of the policy of accommodation that Congress had embraced. Rather, the District Court concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, divorced from its background and context. But a Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It is a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose heroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help secure an honored place in history for this Nation and its people. Here, one Latin cross in the desert evokes far more than religion. It evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell in battles, battles whose tragedies are compounded if the fallen are forgotten.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Respect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 607, 120 S. Ct. 1740, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000); <em>El Paso &amp; Northeastern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, </em>215 U.S. 87, 96, 30 S. Ct. 21, 54 L. Ed. 106 (1909). The same respect requires that a congressional command be given effect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional</p>\n<p id=\"AOMd\">[559 U.S. 722]</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the earlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent upon the District Court to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>sider less drastic relief than complete invalidation of the land-transfer statute. See <em>Ayotte </em>v. <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., </em>546 U.S. 320, 329, 126 S. Ct. 961, 163 L. Ed. 2d 812 (2006) (in granting relief, \u201cwe try not to nullify more of a legislature\u2019s work than is necessary, for we know that [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)); <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>480 U.S. 678, 684, 107 S. Ct. 1476, 94 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1987). For instance, if there is to be a conveyance, the question might arise regarding the necessity of further action, such as signs to indicate the VFW\u2019s ownership of the land. As we have noted, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to install near the cross a replica of its original memorial plaque. One of the signs that appears in early photographs of the cross specifically identifies the VFW as the group that erected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Noting the possibility of specific remedies, however, is not an indication of agreement about the continued necessity for injunctive relief. The land-transfer statute\u2019s bearing on this dispute must first be determined. To date, this Court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area has refrained from making sweeping pronouncements, and this case is ill suited for announcing categorical rules. In light of the finding of unconstitutionality in <em>Buono I, </em>and the highly fact-specific nature of the inquiry, it is best left to the District Court to undertake the analysis in the first instance. On remand, if Buono continues to challenge implementation of the statute, the District Court should conduct a proper inquiry as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"pAU-y\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"52\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAUoAAAA1AQAAAAAPUZ8IAAAAo0lEQVR4nO2UKw4CQRBE33YQOG7AKTjA3gyL4yocYXAcYQWCoJDg1kAhIJk2laxZAZl2r6o66fl2YmIdY2oSWvT3opcsOfhED9l1MOOst1VfFQsBcE6mhwBYv5LrQZLGQbUclE4AyzE1G/i+rV1eqYMAeJ6S6UGS7sO2juegBMBjUWqvhQC45jOzEACbY18VD5KkfdpKB2Wem9W1n7BFW/Q/o2//oqK5TZfLlgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"329\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">[559 U.S. 723]</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b739-8\">Chief Justice Roberts,</author>\n<p id=\"AkGW\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">At oral argument, respondent\u2019s counsel stated that it \u201clikely would be consistent with the injunction\u201d for the Government to tear down the cross, sell the land to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and return the cross to them, with the VFW immediately raising the cross again.

In brief, the situation that Congress faced was as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">After service in the First World War, a group of veterans moved to the Mojave Desert, in some cases for health reasons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW),</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">[559 U.S. 724]</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Death Valley Post 2884, and in 1934, they raised a simple white cross on an outcropping called Sunrise Rock to honor fallen American soldiers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These veterans selected Sunrise Rock \u201cin part because they believed there was a color shading on the Rock in the shape of an American soldier or \u2018doughboy.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">One of these men was John Riley Bembry, a miner who had served as a medic and had thus presumably witnessed the carnage of the war firsthand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is said that Mr. Bembry was not a particularly religious man, but he nevertheless agreed to look after the cross and did so for some years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The Sunrise Rock monument was located on land belonging to the Federal Government, but in this part of the country, where much of the land is federally owned, boundaries between Government and private land are often not marked,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and private citizens are permitted to go on and to use federal land for a variety of purposes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Sunrise Rock was federally owned, Mr. Bembry and his fellow</p>\n<p id=\"adrv-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 725]</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">veterans took it upon themselves to place their monument on that spot, apparently without obtaining approval from any federal officials, and this use of federal land seems to have gone largely unnoticed for many years, in all likelihood due to the spot\u2019s remote and rugged location.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Sunrise Rock is situated far from any major population center; temperatures often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer; and visitors are warned of the dangers of traveling in the area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result, at least until this litigation, it is likely that the cross was seen by more rattlesnakes than humans.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">Those humans who made the trip to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>see the monument appear to have viewed it as conveying at least two significantly different messages. See <em>Pleasant Grove City </em>v. <em>Summum, </em>555 U.S. 460, 474, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2009) (\u201cThe meaning conveyed by a monument is generally not a simple one,\u201d and a monument may be \u201cinterpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways\u201d). The cross is of course the preeminent symbol of Christianity, and Easter services have long been held on Sunrise Rock, <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 548 (CA9 2004). But, as noted, the original reason for the placement of the cross was to commemorate American war dead and, particularly for those with searing memories of the Great War, the symbol that was selected, a plain unadorned white cross, no doubt evoked the unforgettable image of the white crosses, row on row, that marked the final resting places of so many American soldiers who fell in that conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">This is roughly how things stood until the plaintiff in this case, an employee of the National Park Service who sometimes viewed the cross during the performance of his duties and claims to have been offended by its presence on federally owned land, brought this suit and obtained an injunction restraining</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">[559 U.S. 726]</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">the Federal Government from \u201cpermitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. After the Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision, and the Government elected not to seek review by this Court, Congress faced a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">If Congress had done nothing, the Government would have been required to take down the cross, which had stood on Sunrise Rock for nearly 70 years, and this removal would have been viewed by many as a sign of disrespect for the brave soldiers whom the cross was meant to honor. The demolition of this venerable, if unsophisticated, monument would also have been interpreted by some as an arresting symbol of a Government that is not neutral but hostile on matters of religion and is bent on eliminating from all public places and symbols any trace of our country\u2019s religious heritage. Cf. <em>Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>545 U.S. 677, 704, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">One possible solution would have been to supplement the monument on Sunrise Rock so that it appropriately recognized the religious diversity of the American soldiers who gave their lives in the First World War. In American military cemeteries overseas, the graves of soldiers who perished in that war were marked with either a white cross or a white Star of David.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> More than 3,500 Jewish soldiers gave their lives for the United States in World War I,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">[559 U.S. 727]</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">and Congress might have chosen to place a Star of David on Sunrise Rock so that the monument would duplicate those two types of headstones. But Congress may well have thought\u2014not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>without reason\u2014that the addition of yet another religious symbol would have been unlikely to satisfy the plaintiff, his attorneys, or the lower courts that had found the existing monument to be unconstitutional on the ground that it impermissibly endorsed religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Congress chose an alternative approach that was designed to eliminate any perception of religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on federally owned land, while at the same time avoiding the disturbing symbolism associated with the destruction of the historic monument. The mechanism that Congress selected is one that is quite common in the West, a \u201cland exchange.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress enacted a law under which ownership of the parcel of land on which Sunrise Rock is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby parcel of equal value. Congress required that the Sunrise Rock parcel be used for a war memorial, \u00a7 8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100, but Congress did not prevent the VFW from supplementing the existing monument or replacing it with a war memorial of a different design. Although Justice Stevens characterizes this land exchange as one that endorses \u201ca particular religious view,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 760, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 674 (dissenting opinion), it is noteworthy that Congress, in which our country\u2019s religious diversity is well represented, passed this law by overwhelming majorities: 95-0 in the Senate and 407-15 in the House. See 149 Cong. Rec. 23110 (2003); <em>id., </em>at 23306. In my view, there is no legal ground for blocking the implementation of this law.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">[559 U.S. 728]</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Justice Stevens contends that the land transfer would violate the District Court injunction, but that argument, for the reasons explained in Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion, see <em>ante, </em>at 730, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 655-656 (concurring in judgment), is plainly unsound. The obvious meaning of the injunction was simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain on <em>federal </em>land.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">There is also no merit in Justice Stevens\u2019 contention that implementation of the statute would constitute an endorsement of Christianity and would thus violate the Establishment Clause. Assuming that it is appropriate to apply the so-called \u201cendorsement test,\u201d this test would not be violated by the land exchange. The endorsement test views a challenged display through the eyes of a hypothetical reasonable observer who is deemed to be aware of the history and all other pertinent facts relating to a challenged display. See <em>ante, </em>at 720-721, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 649-650 (plurality opinion). Here, therefore, this observer would be familiar with the origin and history of the monument and would also know both that the land on which the monument is located is privately owned and that the new owner is under no obligation to preserve the monument\u2019s present design. With this knowledge, a reasonable observer would not view the land exchange as the equivalent of the construction of an official World War I memorial on the National Mall. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Cf. <em>post, </em>at 759, 176 L.

Rather, a well-informed observer would appreciate that the transfer represents an effort by Congress to address a unique situation and to find a solution that best accommodates conflicting concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Finally, I reject Justice Stevens\u2019 suggestion that the enactment of the land-transfer law was motivated by an illicit purpose. <em>Post. </em>at 757, 176 L.

My reason, however, is quite different: In my view we need not\u2014indeed, <em>can</em>not\u2014decide the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute, because Frank Buono lacks Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks. The District Court had no power to award the requested relief, and our authority is limited to \u201c \u2018announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (quoting <em>Ex parte McCardle, </em>7 Wall. 506, 514, 19 L. Ed. 264 (1869)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">The plurality is correct that Buono\u2019s standing to obtain the <em>original </em>injunction is not before us. See <em>ante, </em>at 711-712, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">[559 U.S. 730]</p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">Nor is Buono\u2019s standing to request enforcement of the original injunction at issue. If he sought only to compel compliance with the existing order, Article III would not stand in his way.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">As the plurality all but admits, however, the relief Buono requests and the District Court awarded in <em>this </em>proceeding is not enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the original injunction but expansion of it. See <em>ante, </em>at 719, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 649. The only reasonable reading of the original injunction, in context, is that it proscribed the cross\u2019s display on federal land. Buono\u2019s alleged injuries arose from the cross\u2019s presence on public property, see App. 50, 59, and the injunction accordingly prohibited the Government, its \u201cemployees, agents, and those in active concert with [them] . . . from permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. Barring the Government from \u201cpermitting\u201d the cross\u2019s display at a particular location makes sense only if the Government owns the location. As the proprietor, it can remove the cross that private parties have erected and deny permission to erect another. But if the land is privately owned, the Government can prevent the cross\u2019s display only by making it <em>illegal. </em>Prohibitory legislation does not consist of a mere refusal to \u201cper-mi[t],\u201d nor is the enactment of legislation what the injunction commanded (a command that would raise serious First Amendment and separation-of-powers questions).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">[559 U.S. 731]</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The District Court\u2019s 2005 order purporting to \u201cenforce\u201d the earlier injunction went well beyond barring the display of the cross on public property. <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1182 (CD Cal. 2005). At Buono\u2019s request, the court enjoined certain Government officials and \u201canyone acting in concert with them . . . from implementing the provisions of Section 8121 of Public Law 108-87,\u201d the statutory provision enacted after the original injunction that directs the Executive Branch to transfer the memorial to the VFW. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Because Buono seeks new relief, he must show (and the District Court should have ensured) that he has standing to pursue it. As the party invoking federal-court jurisdiction, Buono \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief sought,\u201d <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Earth Island Institute, </em>555 U.S. 488, 493, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2009); see <em>Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 105, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983). A plaintiff cannot sidestep Article Ill\u2019s requirements by combining a request for injunctive relief for which he <em>has </em>standing with a request for injunctive relief for which he <em>lacks </em>standing. And for the same reason, a plaintiff cannot ask a court to expand an existing injunction unless he has standing to seek the additional relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Buono must therefore demonstrate that the additional relief he sought\u2014 blocking the transfer of the memorial to a private party\u2014will \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>dress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or official violation of law.\u201d <em>Summers, supra, </em>at 492, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1. He has failed, however,</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">[559 U.S. 732]</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">to allege any actual or imminent injury. To begin with, the predicate for any injury he might assert\u2014 that the VFW, after taking possession of the land, will continue to display the cross\u2014is at this stage merely speculative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nothing in the statutes compels the VFW (or any future proprietor) to keep it up. The land reverts to the Government only if \u201cthe conveyed property is no longer being maintained as a war memorial,\u201d Pub. L. 108-87, \u00a7 8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100, which does not depend on whether the cross remains.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Moreover, Buono has not alleged, much less established, that he will be harmed if the VFW does decide to keep the cross. To the contrary, his amended complaint averred that \u201che is deeply offended by the display of a Latin Cross on government-owned property\u201d but \u201chas no objection to Christian symbols on private property.\u201d App. 50. In a subsequent deposition he agreed with the statement that \u201c [t]he only thing that\u2019s offensive about this cross is that [he has] discovered that it\u2019s located on federal land.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 85. And in a signed declaration several months later, he reiterated that although the \u201cpresence of the cross on federally owned land in the Preserve deeply offends [him] and impairs</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">[559 U.S. 733]</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">[his] enjoyment of the Preserve,\u201d he \u201cha[s] no objection to Christian symbols on private property.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 64-65. In short, even assuming that being \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by a religious display (and taking steps to avoid seeing it) constitutes a cognizable injury, Buono has made clear that <em>he </em>will not be offended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">These same considerations bear upon the plurality\u2019s assertion that Buono has standing to \u201cprevent the Government from frustrating or evading\u201d the original injunction, <em>ante, </em>at 713, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 645. If this refers to frustration or evasion in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>narrow sense, the injunction is in no need of\u2014indeed, is insusceptible of\u2014 protection. It was issued to remedy the sole complaint that Buono had brought forward: erection of a cross on public land. And it was entirely effective in remedying that complaint, having induced Congress to abandon public ownership of the land. If meant in this narrow sense, the plurality\u2019s assertion of a need to prevent frustration or evasion by the Government ignores the reality that the District Court\u2019s 2005 order awarded new relief beyond the scope of the original injunction. The revised injunction is directed at Buono\u2019s <em>new </em>complaint that the manner of abandoning public ownership and the nature of the new private ownership violate the Establishment Clause. Now it may be that a court has subject-matter jurisdiction to prevent frustration or evasion</p>\n<p id=\"anqt-dedup-1\">[559 U.S. 734]</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">of its prior injunction in a broader sense\u2014that is, to eliminate an unconstitutional manner of satisfying that prior injunction. But it surely cannot do so unless it has before it someone who has standing to complain of that unconstitutional manner. If preventing frustration or evasion of an injunction includes expanding it to cover additional actions that produce no concrete harm to the original plaintiff, our standing law in this area will make no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">It is no answer that a district court has discretion to expand an injunction it has issued if it finds the existing terms are not fulfilling the original purpose. Doubtless it can do that, and is in that sense the master of its own injunctions. But whether the District Court abused that discretion by enlarging the injunction is beside the point. What matters is that it granted relief beyond the existing order, and that Buono must have had standing to seek the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">It also makes no difference that the District Court <em>said </em>it was merely enforcing its original injunction. The question is whether <em>in fact </em>the new order goes beyond the old one. If so, the court must satisfy itself of jurisdiction to award the additional relief\u2014which includes making certain the plaintiff has standing. See <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U.S., at 94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210. That is true whether the court revisits the injunction at a party\u2019s request or on its own initiative; Article Ill\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement is not merely a prerequisite to relief, but a restraint on judicial power. See <em>Summers, </em>555 U.S., at 492-493, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">[559 U.S. 735]</p>\n<p id=\"pAOju\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"52\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAR4AAAA0AQAAAAB08mqfAAAAoUlEQVR4nO2UIQ7CQBBFXycIHDfgFBygN8PiuApHAMcRKhAEhQRX0fIRiJ2EnxTRBLPj3sufZHYy2UZM1hjTGaihv4Su2RgIgEP2Buad6b5qi3AQwCVpCwGsX8lbkNR3KmVgaAQs+9T9DZ8b3+WnGAhgPCdtQdKj25YxDAwBPBfH0uwggFteu4MANqe2eAuStE+rMTDMdwVN/VVqqIZ+DL0ByW2SMYqXdqYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"286\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Keeping within the bounds of our constitutional authority often comes at a cost. Here, the litigants have lost considerable time and money disputing the merits, and we are forced to forgo an opportunity to clarify the law. But adhering to Article Ill\u2019s limits upon our jurisdiction respects the authority of those whom the people have chosen to make and carry out the laws. In this case Congress has determined that transferring the memorial to private hands best serves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the public interest and complies with the Constitution, and the Executive defends that decision and seeks to carry it out. Federal courts have no warrant to revisit that decision\u2014and to risk replacing the people\u2019s judgment with their own\u2014unless and until a proper case has been brought before them. This is not it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-16\">. The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Buono had standing to seek the original injunction does not, however, control our decision here under the law-of-the-case doctrine. That doctrine comes into play only if an issue we are asked to resolve has already been decided in the same litigation. See <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 347, n. 18, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979). In its earlier decision, the Ninth Circuit addressed only Buono\u2019s standing to seek the original injunction barring the display of the cross on public land. See <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 546-548 (2004). It had no occasion to address his standing to seek an expansion of the injunction to bar a transfer enabling the cross\u2019s display on private property. Moreover, Buono failed to raise the issue in his brief in opposition to certiorari, and we may deem it waived. See this Court\u2019s Rule 15.2; cf. <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>525 U.S. 113, 116, n. 2, 119 S. Ct. 484, 142 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">. The principal dissent does not dispute that the original injunction did not require the Government to ban the cross\u2019s display on private land, yet it insists that the injunction nonetheless forbade transferring the land to a private party who could keep the cross in place. <em>Post, </em>at 740-741, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 662 (opinion of Stevens, J.). But there is no basis in the injunction\u2019s text for treating a sale of the land to a private purchaser who does not promise to take the cross down as \u201cpermitting\u201d the cross\u2019s display, when failing to forbid the cross\u2019s presence on already-private land within the Mojave National Preserve would not be treated as such. The latter no less involves \u201callow[ing] the act or existence of\u2019 or \u201ctolerat[ing]\u201d the display of the cross. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1824 (2d ed. 1954). The principal dissent responds that in determining whether the transfer complies with the original injunction we \u201ccannot start from a baseline in which the cross has <em>already </em>been transferred.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 741, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 662. But the effect of transferring the land to a private party free to keep the cross standing is identical, so far as the original injunction is concerned, to allowing a party who already owned the land to leave the cross in place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\">. Buono argues that the Government\u2019s continued supervision of the site, its reversionary interest in the property, and the memorial\u2019s ongoing designation as a national memorial add to the Establishment Clause violation. Brief for Respondent 37-48. But those aspects would be irrelevant if the cross were no longer displayed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b745-12\">. The principal dissent insists, <em>post, </em>at 738-739, n. 2, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 660-661, that it is clear the cross will remain because the VFW asserted in an <em>amicus </em>brief that it \u201cintends to maintain and preserve the Veterans Memorial as a memorial to United States veterans,\u2019\u2019 and elsewhere referred to \u201cthe seven-foot-tall cross and plaque that comprise the Veterans Memorial,\u2019\u2019 Brief for VFW of the United States et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>4, 7. But the group\u2019s stated intentions do not prove that the cross will stay put. The VFW might not follow through on its plans (this VFW post already became \u201cdefunct\u201d once during this litigation, <em>id., </em>at 34); it might move the cross to another private parcel and substitute a different monument on Sunrise Rock; or it might sell the land to someone else who decides to honor the dead without the cross.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b745-13\">. The principal dissent argues that despite these disclaimers in Buono\u2019s complaint, deposition, and declaration, his real injury is his inability \u201cto freely use the area of the Preserve around the cross because the Government\u2019s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will induce him to avoid the Sunrise Rock area.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 739, n. 2, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 661 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But the only \u201cendorsement\u201d of which Buono complained was \u201c[t]he placement of the Cross on federally-owned land,\u201d App. 59, which \u201coffend[s]\u201d him only because the property \u201cis not open to groups and individuals to erect other freestanding, permanent displays,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 50. Nothing in Buono\u2019s complaint, deposition, or declaration establishes that he will be unable \u201cto freely use the area of the Preserve\u201d if Sunrise Rock is made private property and its new proprietor displays the cross.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\">.

Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Weisman, </em>505 U.S. 577, 641, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). A Latin cross necessarily symbolizes one of the most important tenets upon which believers in a benevolent Creator, as well as nonbelievers, are known to differ. In my view, the District Court was right to enforce its prior judgment by enjoining Congress\u2019 proposed remedy\u2014a remedy that was engineered to leave the cross intact and that did not alter its basic meaning. I certainly agree that the Nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died in World War I, but it cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a starkly sectarian message.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">As the history recounted by the plurality indicates, this case comes to us in a procedural posture that significantly narrows the question presented to the Court. In the first stage of this litigation, the District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled that the Government violated the Establishment Clause by permitting the display of a single white Latin cross at Sunrise Rock. Those courts further ruled that the appropriate remedy was an injunction prohibiting the Government from \u201cpermitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.\u201d App. 39. The Government declined to seek a writ of certiorari following those rulings. Accordingly, for the purpose of this case, it is settled that \u201cthe Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of government endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable observer,\u201d <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 549 (CA9 2004) <em>(Buono II), </em>and that the District Court\u2019s remedy for that endorsement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">We are, however, faced with an additional fact: Congress has enacted a statute directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer a 1-acre parcel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>land containing the cross to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), subject to certain conditions, in exchange for a 5-acre parcel of land elsewhere in the</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">[559 U.S. 737]</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Preserve. See Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108-87, \u00a7 8121, 117 Stat. 1100. The District Court found that the land transfer under \u00a7 8121 \u201cviolate [d] [the] court\u2019s judgment ordering a permanent injunction\u201d and did not \u201cactually cur[e] the continuing Establishment Clause violation.\u201d <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1182 (CD Cal. 2005) <em>(Buono III). </em>The District Court therefore enforced its 2002 judgment by enjoining the transfer, without considering whether \u201cthe land transfer itself is an independent violation of the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>n. 8. Because the District Court did not base its decision upon an independent Establishment Clause violation, the constitutionality of the land-transfer statute is not before us. See <em>ante, </em>at 714, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 646. Instead, the question we confront is whether the District Court properly enforced its 2002 judgment by enjoining the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In answering that question we, like the District Court, must first consider whether the transfer would violate the 2002 injunction. We must then consider whether changed circumstances nonetheless rendered enforcement of that judgment inappropriate; or conversely whether they made it necessary for the District Court to bar the transfer, even if the transfer is not expressly prohibited by the prior injunction, in order to achieve the intended objective of the injunction. The plurality correctly notes that \u201c \u2018a court must never ignore significant changes in the law or circumstances underlying an injunction,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid, </em>(quoting 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, <em>&amp; </em>M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2961, pp. 393-394 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller)), and \u201c \u2018[a] continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 718, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U.S. 106, 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999 (1932)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the same time,</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">[559 U.S. 738]</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">it is axiomatic that when a party seeks to enforce or modify an injunction, the only circumstances that matter are <em>changed </em>circumstances. See <em>Swift, </em>286 U.S., at 119, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999 (\u201cThe injunction, whether right or wrong, is not subject to impeachment in its application to the conditions that existed at its making\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">I further accept that the District Court\u2019s task was to evaluate the changed circumstances \u201cin light of the objectives of the 2002 injunction.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 720, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>This case does not simply pit a plaintiffs \u201cprior showing of illegality\u201d against a defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cchanged circumstances have rendered prospective relief inappropriate.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 718, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648. That formulation implies that the changed circumstances all cut in one direction, against prospective relief, and that the defendant has asked the court to alleviate its obligations. But it is important to note that in this case, the Government did not move to \u201calleviate or eliminate conditions or restrictions imposed by the original decree\u201d so as to permit the transfer. Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 2961, at 397. Rather, it was the <em>beneficiary </em>of the original injunction who went back into court seeking its enforcement or modification in light of the transfer. Plainly, respondent had standing to seek enforcement of a decree in his favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">[559 U.S. 739]</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Respondent argued that such action was necessary, either to enforce the plain terms of the 2002 injunction or to \u201cachieve the purposes of the provisions of the decree,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>391 U.S. 244, 249, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1968); see Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 2961, at 393 (\u201c[A] court must continually be willing to redraft the order at the request of the party who obtained equitable relief in order to insure that the decree accomplishes its intended result\u201d). Only at that point did the Government argue that changed circumstances made prospective relief unnecessary. This difference in focus is a subtle one, but it is important to emphasize that the question that was before the District Court\u2014and that is now before us\u2014is whether enjoining the transfer was necessary to effectuate the letter or logic of the 2002 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Although I agree with the plurality\u2019s basic framework, I disagree with its decision to remand the case to the District Court. The District Court already \u201cengage [d] in the appropriate inquiry,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 715, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 646, and it was well within its rights to enforce the 2002 judgment. First, the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">[559 U.S. 740]</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">properly recognized that the transfer was a means of \u201cpermitting\u201d\u2014indeed, encouraging\u2014the display of the cross. The transfer therefore would violate the terms of the court\u2019s original injunction. Second, even if the transfer would not violate the terms of the 2002 injunction, the District Court properly took into account events that transpired since 2002 and determined that barring the transfer was neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>sary to achieve the intended result of the 2002 decree, as the transfer would not eliminate government endorsement of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The first step in the analysis is straightforward: The District Court had to ask whether the transfer of the property would violate the extant injunction. Under the terms of that injunction, the answer was yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The 2002 injunction barred the Government from \u201cpermitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.\u201d App. 39. The land-transfer statute mandated transfer of the land to an organization that has announced its intention to maintain the cross on Sunrise Rock. That action surely \u201cpermit[s]\u201d the display of the cross. See 11 Oxford English Dictionary 578 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \u201cpermit\u201d as \u201c [t] o admit or allow the doing or occurrence of; to give leave or opportunity for\u201d). True, the Government would no longer exert direct control over the cross. But the transfer itself would be an act permitting its display.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">I therefore disagree with Justice Scalia that the \u201conly reasonable reading of the original injunction ... is that it proscribed the cross\u2019s display on federal land.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 730, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 655-656. If the land were already privately owned, Justice Scalia may be correct that the cross\u2019 display on Sunrise Rock would not violate the injunction because the Government would not have to do anything to allow the cross to stand, and the Government could try to prevent its display only by making such</p>\n<p id=\"acxb-dedup-1\">[559 U.S. 741]</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">a display illegal. But the Government does own this land, and the transfer statute requires the Executive Branch to take an affirmative act (transfer to private ownership) designed to keep the cross in place. In evaluating a claim that the Government would impermissibly \u201cpermit\u201d the cross\u2019 display by effecting a transfer, a court cannot start from a baseline in which the cross has <em>already </em>been transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Moreover, \u00a7 8121 was designed specifically to foster the display of the cross. Regardless of why the Government wanted to \u201caccommodat[e]\u201d the interests associated with its display, <em>ante, </em>at 717, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648 (plurality opinion), it was not only foreseeable but also intended that the cross would remain standing. Indeed, so far as the record indicates, the Government had no other purpose for turning over this land to private hands. It was therefore proper for the District Court to find that the transfer would violate its 2002 injunction and to enforce that injunction against the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">As already noted, it was respondent, the beneficiary of the injunction, who moved the District Court for relief. When the beneficiary of an injunction seeks relief \u201cto achieve the purposes of the provisions of the decree,\u201d Un<em>ited Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>391 U.S., at 249, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562, a district court has the authority to \u201cmodify the decree so as to achieve the required result with all appropriate expedition,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 252, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562. Thus, regardless of whether the transfer was prohibited by the plain terms of the 2002 judgment, the District Court properly inquired into whether enjoining the transfer was necessary to achieve the objective of that judgment. The Government faces a high burden in arguing the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>exceeded its authority. A decree \u201cmay not be changed in the interests of the defendants if the purposes of the litigation . . . have not been fully achieved.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 248, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562 (emphasis deleted). And contrary to the Government\u2019s position,</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">[559 U.S. 742]</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">the changed circumstances in this case support, rather than count against, the District Court\u2019s enforcement decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The objective of the 2002 judgment, as the plurality grudgingly allows, was to \u201cavoi[d] the perception of governmental endorsement\u201d of religion. <em>Ante, </em>at 720, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 649; see <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1178 (analyzing \u201c \u2018whether government action endorsing religion has actually ceased\u2019 \u201d in light of the transfer). The parties do not disagree on this point; rather, they dispute whether the transfer would end government endorsement of the cross. Compare Brief for Petitioners 21 (\u201cCongress\u2019s transfer of the land . . . ends any governmental endorsement of the cross\u201d) with Brief for Respondent 34 (\u201c[T]he government\u2019s endorsement of the Christian cross is not remedied\u201d by the land transfer). The District Court rightly found that the transfer would not end government endorsement of the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">A government practice violates the Establishment Clause if it \u201ceither has the purpose or effect of \u2018endorsing\u2019 religion.\u201d <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, </em>492 U.S. 573, 592, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1989). \u201cWhether the key word is \u2018endorsement,\u2019 \u2018favoritism,\u2019 or \u2018promotion,\u2019 the essential principle remains the same. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from \u2018making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person\u2019s standing in the political community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 593-594 (quoting <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>465 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 1355, 79 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1984) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The 2002 injunction was based on a finding that display of the cross had the effect of endorsing religion. That is, \u201cthe Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a message of government endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable observer.\u201d <em>Buono II, </em>371 F.3d, at 549. The determination that the Government had endorsed religion necessarily rested on two premises: first, that the Government endorsed the cross, and</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">[559 U.S. 743]</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">second, that the cross \u201ctake[s] a position on questions of religious belief\u2019 or \u201c \u2018mak[es] adherence to a religion relevant ... to a person\u2019s standing in the political community,\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Allegheny, </em>492 U.S., at 594, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472. Taking the District Court\u2019s 2002 finding of an Establishment Clause violation as res judicata, as we must, the land transfer has the potential to dislodge only the first of those premises, in that the transfer might change the Government\u2019s endorsing relationship with the cross. As I explain below, I disagree that the transfer ordered by \u00a7 8121 would in fact have this result. But it is also worth noting at the outset that the transfer statute could not (and does not) dislodge the second premise\u2014 that the cross conveys a religious message. Continuing government endorsement of the cross is thus continuing government endorsement of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">In my view, the transfer ordered by \u00a78121 would not end government endorsement of the cross for two independently sufficient reasons. First, af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ter the transfer it would continue to appear to any reasonable observer that the Government has endorsed the cross, notwithstanding that the name has changed on the title to a small patch of underlying land. This is particularly true because the Government has designated the cross as a national memorial, and that endorsement continues regardless of whether the cross sits on public or private land. Second, the transfer continues the existing Government endorsement of the cross because the purpose of the transfer is to preserve its display. Congress\u2019 intent to preserve the display of the cross maintains the Government\u2019s endorsement of the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The plurality does not conclude to the contrary; that is, it does not decide that the transfer would end government endorsement of the cross and the religious message it conveys. Rather, the plurality concludes that the District Court did not conduct an appropriate analysis, and it remands the case for a do-over. I take up each of the purported faults the plurality finds in the District Court\u2019s analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AqXd\">[559 U.S. 744]</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">in my examination of the reasons why the transfer does not cure the existing Establishment Clause violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\n<em>Perception of the Cross Post-Transfer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The 2002 injunction was based upon a finding of impermissible effect: The \u201cSunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a message of government endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable observer.\u201d <em>Buono II, </em>371 F.3d, at 549. The transfer would not end that impermissible state of affairs because the cross, post-transfer, would still have \u201cthe effect of communicating a message of government endorsement . . . of religion.\u201d <em>Lynch, </em>465 U.S., at 692, 104 S. Ct. 1355, 79 L. Ed. 2d 604 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). As the Court of Appeals correctly found, \u201c[n]othing in the present posture of the case alters\u201d the conclusion that a \u201creasonable observer would perceive governmental endorsement of the message\u201d the cross conveys. <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Kempthorne, </em>527 F.3d 758, 783 (CA9 2008) <em>(Buono IV).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">[559 U.S. 745]</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">In its original judgment, the Court of Appeals found that a well-informed reasonable observer would perceive government endorsement of religion, notwithstanding the cross\u2019 initial \u201cplacement by private individuals,\u201d based upon the following facts: \u201cthat the cross rests on public land[,] . . . that Congress has designated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>cross as a war memorial and prohibited the use of funds to remove it, and that the Park Service has denied similar access for expression by an adherent of the . . . Buddhist faith.\u201d <em>Buono II, </em>371 F.3d, at 550. After the transfer, a well-informed observer would know that the cross was no longer on public land, but would additionally be aware of the following facts: The cross was once on public land, the Government was enjoined from permitting its display, Congress transferred it to a specific purchaser in order to preserve its display in the same location, and the Government maintained a reversionary interest in the land. From this chain of events, in addition to the factors that remain the same after the transfer, he would perceive government endorsement of the cross.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Particularly important to this analysis is that although the transfer might remove the implicit endorsement that presence on public land signifies, see <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. </em>v. <em>Pinette, </em>515 U.S. 753, 801, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe very fact that a sign is installed on public property implies official recognition and reinforcement of its message\u201d), it would not change the fact that the Government has taken several explicit actions to endorse this cross. In its decision upholding the initial entry of the injunction, the Court of Appeals found those actions contributed to a</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">[559 U.S. 746]</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">reasonable observer\u2019s perception of government endorsement. <em>Buono II, </em>371 F.3d, at 550. Their significance does not depend upon the ownership of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In 2000, and again after the District Court had entered its initial injunction, Congress passed legislation prohibiting the use of any federal funds to remove the cross from its location on federal property. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106-554, \u00a7 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230; Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. 107-248, \u00a7 8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551. Thus, beyond merely acquiescing in the continued presence of a cross on federal property, Congress singled out that cross for special treatment, and it affirmatively commanded that the cross must remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Congress also made a more dramatic intervention. Without the benefit of any committee hearings or floor debate in either the Senate or the House of Representatives\u2014indeed, without a moment of discussion in any official forum\u2014Congress passed legislation officially designating the \u201cfive-foot-tall white cross\u201d in the Mojave Desert \u201cas a national memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.\u201d \u00a7 8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. Thereafter, the cross was no longer just a local artifact; it acquired a formal national status of the highest order. Once that momentous step was taken, changing the identity of the owner of the underlying land could no longer change the public or private character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>of the cross. The Government has expressly adopted the cross as its own.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">[559 U.S. 747]</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Even though Congress recognized this cross for its military associations, the solitary cross conveys an inescapably sectarian message. See <em>Separation of Church and State Comm. </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>93 F.3d 617, 626 (CA9 1996) (O\u2019Scannlain, J., concurring in result) (\u201c[T]he City\u2019s use of a cross to memorialize the war dead may lead observers to believe that the City has chosen to honor only Christian veterans\u201d). As the District Court observed, it is undisputed that the \u201c[L]atin cross is the preeminent symbol of Christianity. It is exclusively a Christian symbol, and not a symbol of any other religion.\u201d <em>Buono I, </em>212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1205. We have recognized the significance of the Latin cross as a sectarian symbol,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and no participant in this litigation denies that the cross bears that social meaning. Making a plain, unadorned Latin cross a war memorial does not make the cross secular. It makes the war memorial sectarian.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">[559 U.S. 748]</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">More fundamentally, however, the message conveyed by the cross is not open to reconsideration given the posture of this case. The plurality employs a revealing turn of phrase when it characterizes the cross as \u201ca symbol that, while challenged under the Establishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the expression of religious views <em>.\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 717, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648. The days of considering the cross itself as <em>challenged </em>un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>der the Establishment Clause are over; it is settled that the government is not permitted to endorse the cross. However complex the meaning of the cross, the Court of Appeals in 2004 considered and rejected the argument that its dual symbolism as a war memorial meant that government endorsement of the cross did not amount to endorsement of religion. See <em>Buono II, </em>371 F.3d, at 549, n. 5. All we are debating at this juncture is whether the shift from public to private ownership of the land sufficiently distanced the Government from the cross; we are no longer debating the message the cross conveys to a reasonable observer. In arguing that Congress can legitimately favor the cross because of its purported double meaning, the plurality implicitly tries to reopen what is closed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">[559 U.S. 749]</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The plurality also poses a different objection to consideration of whether the transfer would change a reasonable observer\u2019s perception of the cross. The plurality suggests that the \u201c \u2018reasonable observer\u2019 standard\u201d may not \u201cbe the appropriate framework\u201d because \u201ccourts considering Establishment Clause challenges do not,\u201d as a general matter, \u201cinquire into \u2018reasonable observer\u2019 perceptions with respect to objects on private land <em>.\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 720, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 650. Once again, the plurality\u2019s approach fails to pay heed to the posture of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">At the risk of stating the obvious, respondent is not simply challenging a private object on private land. Although \u201can Establishment Clause violation must be moored in government action of some sort,\u201d <em>Pinette, </em>515 U.S., at 779, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), respondent\u2019s objection to the transfer easily meets that test for two reasons. First, he is currently challenging official legislation, taken in response to an identified Establishment Clause violation. That legislation would transfer public land to a particular private party, with the proviso that the transferee must use the land to fulfill a specific public function or else the land reverts to the Government. Second, even once the transfer is complete, the cross would remain a national memorial. The cross is therefore not a purely \u201cprivate\u201d object in any meaningful sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Notwithstanding these facts, the plurality appears to conclude that the transfer might render the cross purely private speech. It relies in part on the plurality opinion in <em>Pinette </em>for its suggestion that the reasonable observer standard may</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">[559 U.S. 750]</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">not be apposite, and <em>Pinette </em>addressed a privately owned cross displayed in a public forum. The <em>Pinette </em>plurality would have rejected the idea that \u201ca neutrally behaving government\u201d can ever en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>dorse <em>\u201cprivate </em>religious expression,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 764, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650, even if a reasonable observer would perceive government endorsement, <em>id., </em>at 768, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650. But the <em>Pinette </em>plurality acknowledged that government favoritism of private religious speech is unconstitutional, as when a government \u201cgiv[es] sectarian religious speech preferential access to a forum close to the seat of government (or anywhere else for that matter).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 766, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650. And in this case, the Government is not acting neutrally: The transfer statute and the Government actions preceding it have all favored the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Furthermore, even assuming (wrongly) that the cross would be purely private speech after the transfer, and even assuming (quite implausibly) that the transfer statute is neutral with respect to the cross, it would still be appropriate for the District Court to apply the reasonable observer standard. The majority of the <em>Pinette </em>Court rejected the <em>per se </em>rule proposed by the plurality. Instead, the relevant standard provides that the Establishment Clause is violated whenever \u201cthe State\u2019s own actions . . . , and their relationship to the private speech at issue, <em>actually convey </em>a message of endorsement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 777, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). Moreover, the Establishment Clause \u201cimposes affirmative obligations that may require a State, in some situations, to take steps to avoid being perceived as supporting or endorsing a private religious message.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is particularly appropriate in this context\u2014 when the issue is whether the transfer cures an already identified Establishment Clause violation\u2014for the District Court to consider whether the Government, by complying with \u00a7 8121, would have taken sufficient steps to avoid being perceived as endorsing the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">As I explained at the outset of this section, the answer to that inquiry is surely no. The reasonable observer \u201cwho</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">[559 U.S. 751]</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">knows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the symbol and its placement,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 721, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 650, would perceive that the Government has endorsed the cross: It prohibited the use of federal funds to take down the cross, designated the cross as a national memorial, and engaged in \u201cherculean efforts to preserve the Latin Cross\u201d following the District Court\u2019s initial injunction, <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. Those efforts include a transfer statute designed to keep the cross in place. Changing the ownership status of the underlying land in the manner required by \u00a7 8121 would not change the fact that the cross conveys a message of government endorsement of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">\n<em>Purpose in Enacting the Ti'ansfer Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Even setting aside that the effect of the post-transfer cross would still be to convey a message of government endorsement of religion, the District Court was correct to conclude that \u00a7 8121 would not cure the Establishment Clause violation because the very purpose of the transfer was to preserve the display of the cross. That evident purpose maintains government endorsement of the cross. The plurality does not really contest that this was Congress\u2019 purpose, <em>ante, </em>at 715, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 646-647, so I need not review the evidence in great detail. Suffice it to say that the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>provides ample support. The land-transfer statute authorizes a conveyance to the particular recipient that has expressed an intent to preserve the cross. See Brief for VFW et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>4 (transfer recipient \u201cintends to maintain and preserve the Veterans Memorial\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 7 (identifying Veterans Memorial as the \u201ccross and plaque\u201d). And it conveys the particular land that has already been designated \u201cas a national memorial\u201d commemorating the veterans of World War I, \u00a7 8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100, subject to a reversionary clause requiring that a memorial \u201ccommemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war\u201d be</p>\n<p id=\"alze-dedup-1\">[559 U.S. 752]</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">maintained, \u00a7 8121(e), <em>ibid. </em>If it does not categorically require the new owner of the property to display the existing memorial meeting that description (the cross), see \u00a7 8137, 115 Stat. 2278, the statute most certainly encourages this result. Indeed, the Government concedes that Congress sought to <em>\u201cpreserve </em>a longstanding war memorial\u201d at the site, Brief for Petitioners 28 (emphasis added), and the only memorial that could be \u201cpreserved\u201d at Sunrise Rock is the cross itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The plurality insists, however, that even assuming the purpose of the land transfer was to preserve the display of the cross, enjoining the transfer was not necessarily appropriate. It contends the District Court failed to give adequate consideration to \u201cthe context in which the [land-transfer] statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 715, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 646, and it directs the District Court\u2019s attention to three factors: the message intended by the private citizens who first erected the cross, <em>ibid..; </em>the time the cross stood on Sunrise Rock and its historical meaning, <em>ante, </em>at 716, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 646-647; and Congress\u2019 balancing of \u201copposing interests\u201d and selection of a \u201cpolicy of accommodation,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 716-717, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 647-648; see also <em>ante, </em>at 721, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The first two of these factors are red herrings. The District Court, in its enforcement decision, had no occasion to consider anew either the private message intended by those who erected the cross or how long the cross had stood atop Sunrise Rock. Neither of these factors constituted a novel or changed circumstance since the entry of the 2002 injunction. Whatever message those who initially erected the cross intended\u2014and I think we have to presume it was a Christian one, at least in part, for the simple reason that those who erected the cross chose to commemorate American veterans in an explicitly Christian manner\u2014 that historical fact did not change between 2002 and 2005. I grant that the amount of time the cross had stood on Sunrise Rock did change, from 68 years to 71 years, but no one can seriously maintain that \u201cthe historical meaning that the cross had attained,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">[559 U.S. 753]</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\"><em>ante, </em>at 716, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 647, was materially transformed in that 3-year increment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">This brings us to the final factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>identified by the plurality: Congress\u2019 \u201cpolicy of accommodation\u201d for the cross.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Of course, the District Court did consider Congress\u2019 \u201cpolicy\u201d in the sense that it considered the result Congress was trying to achieve with respect to the cross, <em>i.e., </em>to keep it in place. See <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (\u201c[T]he proposed transfer of the subject property can only be viewed as an attempt to keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise Rock without actually curing the continuing Establishment Clause violation\u201d). But I understand the plurality to be faulting the</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">[559 U.S. 754]</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">District Court for failing to inquire into a deeper level of motivation: If the purpose of the transfer was to keep the cross in place, what was the purpose of keeping the cross in place?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I do not see why it was incumbent upon the District Court to examine this second-order purpose when determining whether the transfer violated the 2002 injunction. As discussed in Part II, <em>supra, </em>the injunction barred the Government from permitting the display of the cross, which fairly encompasses any act providing an opportunity for the cross\u2019 display. It was entirely appropriate for the District Court to characterize a transfer with the purpose of preserving the cross as an attempt to evade that injunction, and to find that the Government\u2019s purpose to preserve the cross maintains government endorsement of the cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The plurality would have the District Court revise its entire analysis of whether the transfer would end government endorsement, in light of the plurality\u2019s view of the land-transfer statute\u2019s putative second-order purpose. That analysis ignores the procedural posture of the case. If the question before the Court were whether \u00a7 8121 itself violated the Establishment Clause, then this argument might have merit. But we are instead examining whether action taken with the purpose of preserving the display of the cross cures or continues government endorsement. In my view, that purpose continues the impermissible endorsement of\u2014indeed, favoritism toward\u2014the cross, regardless of <em>why </em>Congress chose to intervene as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">In any event, Congress\u2019 second-order purpose does little for the plurality\u2019s position. Without relying on any legislative history or findings\u2014 there are none\u2014the plurality opines that Congress wanted to keep the cross in place in order to accommodate those who might view removal as \u201cconveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as honoring,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 716, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 647, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>and it suggests that this decision was an acceptable method of \u201cbalanc[ing] opposing interests\u201d because</p>\n<p id=\"ALqoJ\">[559 U.S. 755]</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">the cross \u201chas complex meaning beyond the expression of religious views,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 717, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648. As I have already explained, the meaning of the cross (complex or otherwise) is no longer before us, and the plurality\u2019s reliance on a \u201ccongressional statement of policy,\u201d ibid., as negating any government endorsement of religion finds no support in logic or precedent. The cross cannot take on a nonsectarian character by congressional (or judicial) fiat, and the plurality\u2019s evaluation of Congress\u2019 actions is divorced from the methodology prescribed by our doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Our precedent provides that we evaluate purpose based upon what the objective indicia of intent would reveal to a reasonable observer. See <em>McCreary County </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., </em>545 U.S. 844, 862, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 162 L. Ed. 2d 729 (2005) (\u201cThe eyes that look to purpose belong to an objective observer, one who takes account of the traditional external signs that show up in the text, legislative history, and implementation of the statute, or comparable official act\u201d (internal quotation</p>\n<p id=\"AU2V\">[559 U.S. 756]</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">marks omitted)). \u201c[Reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and our precedents sensibly forbid an observer \u2018to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 866, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 162 L. Ed. 2d 729 (quoting <em>Santa Fe Independent School Dist. </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>530 U.S. 290, 315, 120 S. Ct. 2266, 147 L. Ed. 2d 295 (2000)). The plurality nowhere engages with how a reasonable observer would view Congress\u2019 \u201cpolicy of accommodation\u201d for this cross. Instead, the plurality insists that deference is owed because of \u201cCongress\u2019 prerogative to balance opposing interests and its institutional competence to do so.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 717, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 647-648.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The proper remedy for an Establishment Clause violation is a legal judgment, which is not the sort of issue for which Congress \u201c \u2018has both wisdom and experience . . . that is far superior to ours.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>558 U.S. 310, 461, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L.

Ct. 2309, 135 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting)). Moreover, the inference that Congress has exercised its institutional competence\u2014or even its considered judgment\u2014is significantly weaker in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>a case such as this, when the legislative action was \u201cburied in a defense appropriations bill,\u201d <em>Buono III, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1181, and, so far as the record shows, undertaken without any deliberation whatsoever. I am not dismissive of Congress, see <em>ante, </em>at 728, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 655 (opinion of Alito, J.), but \u00a7 8121 presents no factual findings, reasoning, or long history of \u201c \u2018careful legislative adjustment,\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S., at 461, 130 S.

Ed. 2d 179 (2003)), to which I could possibly defer. Congress did not devote \u201cyears of careful study\u201d to \u00a7 8121, <em>Citizens United, </em>558 U.S., at 463, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (opinion of Stevens, J.), nor did it develop a record of any kind, much less an exhaustive one, see <em>id., </em>at 411-412, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (noting the legislative record for the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 spanned 100,000</p>\n<p id=\"afng-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 757]</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">pages). The concurrence\u2019s attempt to draw an equivalence between a provision tucked silently into an appropriations bill and a major statute debated and developed over many years is, to say the least, not persuasive. All legislative acts are not fungible.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Furthermore, in the Establishment Clause context, we do not accord any special deference to the legislature on account of its generic advantages as a policymaking body, and the purpose test is not \u201csatisfied so long as <em>any </em>secular purpose for the government action is apparent,\u201d <em>McCreary County, </em>545 U.S., at 865, n. 13, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 162 L. Ed. 2d 729 (emphasis added). Nor can the government pursue a secular aim through religious means. See <em>Van Orden, </em>545 U.S., at 715, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cThough the State of Texas may genuinely wish to combat juvenile delinquency, and may rightly want to honor the Eagles for their efforts, it cannot effectuate these admirable purposes through an explicitly religious medium\u201d). It is odd that the plurality ignores all of these well-settled principles in exalting this particular legislative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">A reasonable observer, considering the nature of this symbol, the timing and the substance of Congress\u2019 efforts, and the history of the Sunrise Rock site, could conclude that Congress chose to preserve the cross primarily because of its salience as a cross. Cf. <em>McCreary County, </em>545 U.S., at 873, 125 S. Ct. 2722, 162 L. Ed. 2d 729 (\u201cIf the observer had not thrown up his hands, he would probably suspect that the Counties were simply reaching for any way to keep a religious document on the walls . . . \u201d). But no such conclusion is necessary to find for respondent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">[559 U.S. 758]</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">The religious meaning of the cross was settled by the 2002 judgment; the only question before us is whether the Government has sufficiently distanced itself from the cross to end government endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ment of it. At the least, I stress again, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Government\u2019s purpose in transferring the underlying land did not sufficiently distance the Government from the cross. Indeed, \u00a7 8121 evidenced concern for whether the cross would be displayed. The District Court was therefore correct to find that the transfer would not end government endorsement of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In sum, I conclude that the transfer ordered by \u00a7 8121 will not end the pre-existing Government endorsement of the cross, and to the contrary may accentuate the problem in some respects. Because the transfer would perpetuate the Establishment Clause violation at issue in the 2002 injunction, I further conclude that enjoining the transfer was necessary to secure relief. Given the transfer statute\u2019s fundamental inadequacy as a remedy, there was\u2014and is\u2014no need for the District Court to consider \u201cless drastic relief than complete invalidation of the . . . statute.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 722, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 651. Allowing the transfer to go forward would interfere with the District Court\u2019s authority to enforce its judgment and deprive the District Court of the ability to ensure a complete remedy. Nor could allowing the transfer to go forward be made a complete remedy with add-on measures, such as signs or fences indicating the ownership of the land. Such measures would not completely end the government endorsement of this cross, as the land would have been transferred in a manner favoring the cross and the cross would remain designated as a national memorial. Enjoining compliance</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">[559 U.S. 759]</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">with \u00a7 8121 was therefore a proper exercise of the District Court\u2019s authority to enforce the 2002 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"pasex-dedup-0\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"40\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAWsAAAAnAQAAAADh0FR2AAAAm0lEQVR4nO2UsRGAIAxFg0ev1lo4igM4mCu4jaVj4BBaIVhoTJrvnYXakO69+0AuB5hID2rOnqSJUjzFr7jXEgPHVy0xfNL7lk3iMHDc98ph4LgdR3EYyJxvtbZOJISZ4lEuqoLgeDKl7hADxwctMZzNhCqXIzE4eywKTSc7YLjm3rbiMPAg4+IL6Q8Cf3omiLuBl2+kSR/2L/EddOyLc5dT5c8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"363\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Congressional action, taken after due deliberation, that honors our fallen soldiers merits our highest respect. As far as I can tell, however, it is unprecedented in the Nation\u2019s history to designate a bare, unadorned cross as the national war memorial for a particular group of veterans. Neither the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam War Memorial, nor the World War II Memorial commemorates our veterans\u2019 sacrifice in sectarian or predominantly religious ways. Each of these impressive structures pays equal respect to all members of the Armed Forces who perished in the service of our country in those conflicts. In this case, by contrast, a sectarian symbol <em>is </em>the memorial. And because Congress has established no other national monument to the veterans of the Great War, this solitary cross in the middle of the desert is <em>the </em>national World War I memorial. The sequence of legislative decisions made to designate and preserve a solitary Latin cross at an isolated location in the desert as a memorial for those who fought and died in World War I not only failed to cure the Establishment Clause violation but also, in my view, resulted in a dramatically inadequate and inappropriate tribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">I believe that most judges would find it to be a clear Establishment Clause violation if Congress had simply directed that a solitary Latin cross be erected on the Mall in the Nation\u2019s Capital to serve as a World War I memorial. Congress did not erect this cross, but it commanded that the cross remain in place, and it gave the cross the imprimatur of Government. Transferring the land pursuant to \u00a78121 would perpetuate rather than cure that unambiguous endorsement of a sectarian message.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The Mojave Desert is a remote location, far from the seat of our Government.

One point of contention: I accept as a general matter that a court must consider whether \u201clegislative action has undermined the basis upon which relief has previously been granted.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 718, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 648. But the effect of the legislative action in this case is different from its effect in our cases espousing that principle, which stand for the proposition that if a <em>statutory </em>\u201cright has been modified by the competent authority\u2019 since the decree, then an injunction enforcing the prior version of that right must be modified to conform to the change in the law. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>18 How. 421, 432, 15 L. Ed. 435 (1856); see also <em>Railway Employees </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>364 U.S. 642, 651, 81 S. Ct. 368, 5 L.

[I]t [must] be free to modify the terms of a consent decree when a change in law brings those terms in conflict with statutory objectives\u2019\u2019). In a constitutional case such as this, legislative action may modify the facts, but it cannot change the applicable law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\">. To the extent the Government challenges respondent\u2019s standing to seek the initial injunction, that issue is not before the Court for the reasons the plurality states. See <em>ante, </em>at 711-712, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645. Moreover, in my view respondent has standing even under the analysis that Justice Scalia undertakes. It is not at all \u201cspeculative,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 732, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 657 (opinion concurring in judgment), that the VFW will continue to display the cross. VFW Post 385, the beneficiary of the land transfer, has filed an <em>amici </em>brief in this case indicating it \u201cintends to maintain and preserve the Veterans Memorial,\u201d Brief for VFW et al. 4, by which it means the cross, <em>id., </em>at 7 (identifying the Veterans Memorial as the \u201ccross and plaque\u201d). Respondent did, in his amended complaint, aver that he was offended specifically \u201cby the display of a Latin Cross on government-owned property.\u201d App. 50. But his claimed injury is that he is \u201cunable to freely use the area of the Preserve around the cross,\u201d <em>Buono </em>77, 371 F.3d 543, 547 (CA9 2004) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), because the Government\u2019s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will induce him to avoid the Sunrise Rock area, even though it offers the most convenient route to the Preserve, App. 65. That endorsement and respondent\u2019s resulting injury not only persist, but have been aggravated by the Government\u2019s actions since the complaint was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">. The plurality faults the District Court for not engaging in this analysis, but the District Court did implicitly consider how a reasonable observer would perceive the cross post-transfer when it analyzed the terms of the transfer, the Government\u2019s continuing property rights in the conveyed land, and the history of the Government\u2019s efforts to preserve the cross. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s order on the express ground that a reasonable observer would still perceive government endorsement of the cross. See <em>Buono IV, </em>527 F.3d, at 782-783.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">The Chief Justice suggests this is much ado about nothing because respondent\u2019s counsel conceded that the injunction would not be violated were the Government to have gone through an \u201cempty ritual\u2019\u2019 of taking down the cross before transferring the land. <em>Ante, </em>at 723, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 651 (concurring opinion). But in the colloquy to which The Chief Justice refers, counsel assumed that the Government would not retain a reversionary interest in the land, and that the cross would not retain its designation as a national memorial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-45. Even under The Chief Justice\u2019s revised version of the hypothetical, I would not so quickly decide that taking down the cross makes no material difference. And counsel\u2019s statement takes no position as to whether the hypothetical poses any constitutional problem independent of the injunction. Regardless, we must deal with the substance of the case before us, which involves much more than Congress directing the Government to execute a simple land transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\">.

Context is critical to the Establishment Clause inquiry, and not every use of a religious symbol in a war memorial would indicate government endorsement of a religious message. See, <em>e.g., Van Orden </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>545 U.S. 677, 701, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L.

But this cross is not merely one part of a more elaborate monument that, taken as a whole, may be understood to convey a primarily nonreligious message. Rather, the cross is the only symbol conveying any message at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">. The plurality\u2019s assertions regarding the meaning of the cross are therefore beside the point. For the record, however, I cannot agree that a bare cross such as this conveys a nonsectarian meaning simply because crosses are often used to commemorate \u201cheroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving\u2019\u2019 and to honor fallen soldiers. <em>Ante, </em>at 721, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 650. The cross is not a universal symbol of sacrifice. It is the symbol of one particular sacrifice, and that sacrifice carries deeply significant meaning for those who adhere to the Christian faith. The cross has sometimes been used, it is true, to represent the sacrifice of an individual, as when it marks the grave of a fallen soldier or recognizes a state trooper who perished in the line of duty. Even then, the cross carries a religious meaning. But the use of the cross in such circumstances is linked to, and shows respect for, the individual honoree\u2019s faith and beliefs. I, too, would consider it tragic if the Nation\u2019s fallen veterans were to be forgotten. See <em>ibid. </em>But there are countless different ways, consistent with the Constitution, that such an outcome may be averted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\">. I also disagree with the plurality\u2019s factual premise that \u201cthe cross and the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness\u2019\u2019 in a secular manner, <em>ante, </em>at 716, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 647. Although some members of the community knew that the cross had been originally erected as a war memorial, there is no support in the record for the idea that members of the public \u201cgathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay their respects,\u2019\u2019 <em>ibid., </em>to the fallen of World War I or any other veterans. The study conducted by a National Park Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>historian indicates that a group of veterans gathered at the cross as early as 1935 for Easter sunrise services. Memorandum from Mark Luellen to Superintendent, Mojave National Preserve (Jan. 31, 2000), Decl. of Peter J. Eliasberg in <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>No. EDCV 01-216-RT (SGLx) (CD Cal., Mar. 13, 2002), p. 20 (Exh. 7). But there is no evidence that gatherings were ever held for Armistice Day or Veterans Day. The study further reveals that a local club organized social events for the community at the cross from 1950 to 1975 and that after a local veteran passed away in 1984, the \u201cmemory and associations of the white cross ... as a war memorial\u201d faded but locals were \u201cinspired ... to reinstate the Easter sunrise services\u201d at the cross. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b758-11\">. Although the plurality uses the term \u201caccommodation,\u201d I do not read its opinion to suggest that Congress\u2019 policy vis-\u00e1-vis the cross has anything to do with accommodating any individual\u2019s religious practice. Cf. <em>County of Allegheny, </em>492 U.S., at 601, n. 51, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (\u201cNor can the display of the crche be justified as an \u2018accommodation\u2019 of religion. . . . To be sure, prohibiting the display . . . deprives Christians of the satisfaction of seeing the government adopt their religious message as their own, but this kind of government affiliation with particular religious messages is precisely what the Establishment Clause precludes\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\">. Justice Alito similarly affords great weight to Congress\u2019 purported interest in \u201cavoiding the disturbing symbolism associated with the destruction of the historic monument.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 727, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 654 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But we surely all can agree that once the government has violated the Establishment Clause, as has been adjudged in this case and is now beyond question, a plaintiff must be afforded a complete remedy. That remedy may sometimes require removing a religious symbol, and regrettably some number of people may perceive the remedy as evidence that the government \u201cis bent on eliminating from all public places and symbols any trace of our country\u2019s religious heritage,\u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 726, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 653. But it does not follow that the government can decline to cure an Establishment Clause violation in order to avoid offense. It may be the case that taking down the symbol is not the only remedy. The proper remedy, like the determination of the violation itself, is necessarily context specific, and even if it involves moving the cross, it need not involve the \u201cdemolition\u2019\u2019 or \u201cdestruction\u2019\u2019 of the cross, see <em>ante, </em>at 726, 727, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 653, 654. Regardless, in this case the only question before us is whether this particular transfer provided a complete remedy. We have no way of knowing whether Congress\u2019 motivation was to minimize offense, but in any event that interest does not ameliorate the remedial ineffectiveness of \u00a7 8121.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b760-11\">. I have not \u201cjump[ed] to the conclusion that Congress\u2019 aim in enacting the land-transfer law was to embrace the religious message of the cross.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 729, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 655 (opinion of Alito, J.). I think a reasonable observer could come to that conclusion, but my point is that so long as we agree that Congress\u2019 aim was to preserve the cross (which Justice Alito does not dispute), Congress\u2019 reason for preserving the cross does not matter. But if we were debating whether Congress had a religious purpose in passing the transfer statute, I would contest the relevance of the vote count to that inquiry, see <em>ante, </em>at 727, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 654, and particularly so in this case. One cannot infer much of anything about the land-transfer provision from the fact that an appropriations bill passed by an overwhelming majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b762-7\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"Ady0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The District Court in this case entered a permanent injunction forbidding the Government to \u201cpermi[t] the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.\u201d App. 39. Subsequently, Government authorities covered the cross with a plywood box so that it could not be seen. Congress then enacted a statute directing the Secretary of the Interior to convey to a private entity approximately one acre of land upon which the cross stood, presumably so that the cross could be displayed uncovered. The plaintiff, returning to the District Court, asked that court to \u201c \u2018hold that the transfer violates the . . . injunction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1177 (CD Cal. 2005) (quoting plaintiff\u2019s motion). The court held that it did. <em>Id., </em>at 1182. And the question before us is whether the law permits the District Court so to interpret its injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">To answer this question we need not address any significant issue of Establishment Clause law. Because the Government has already lost the case, taken an appeal, and lost the appeal, we must take as a given the lower court\u2019s resolution of the Establishment Clause question before the land transfer. That is to say, as the plurality points out, <em>ante, </em>at 713-714, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 645-646, we must here assume that the original display of the cross violated the Constitution because \u201cthe presence of the cross on federal land conveys a message\u201d to a \u201creasonable observer\u201d of governmental \u201cendorsement of religion.\u201d <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>212 F. Supp. 2d 1202, 1216-1217 (CD Cal. 2002). See <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>557 U.S. 137, 152, 129 S. Ct. 2195, 174 L. Ed. 2d 99 (2009) (once orders become final on direct review, they</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">[559 U.S. 761]</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">are res judicata to the parties). For the same reason, we must here assume that the plaintiff originally had standing to bring the lawsuit. <em>Ante, </em>at 711-712, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645; see also <em>ante, </em>at 729, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 655 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Travelers, supra, </em>at 152, 129 S. Ct. 2195, 174 L. Ed. 2d 99 (orders are no less preclu-sive when the collateral attack is jurisdictional). And, as the plurality also points out, the plaintiff consequently has standing now to seek enforcement of the injunction. <em>Ante, </em>at 712-713, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645; see also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 763, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">Moreover, we are not faced with the question whether changed circumstances require modification of the injunction. The Government did not ask the District Court to modify it. In fact, the Government did not ask the District Court for any relief at all. Rather, it was the plaintiff who asked the District Court either (1) to \u201c \u2018hold that the [land] transfer violates the current injunction,\u2019 \u201d or (2) to \u201c \u2018modify that injunction to prohibit the land transfer because it violates the Establishment Clause.\u2019 \u201d 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1177 (quoting plaintiffs motion). The District Court did the former, <em>i.e., </em>it interpreted the injunction as prohibiting the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>from transferring the land for purposes of displaying the cross. And having granted the plaintiffs request to enforce the injunction, it dismissed the plaintiffs alternative request to modify the injunction as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Thus, as I said at the outset, the only question before us is whether the law permits the District Court to hold that the land transfer (presumably along with the subsequent public display of the cross) falls within the scope of its original injunctive order, an order that says the Government must not \u201cpermi[t] the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.\u201d App. 39. In my view the law authorizes the District Court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The legal principles that answer the question presented are found not in the Constitution but in cases that concern the law of injunctions. First, the law of injunctions grants a district court considerable leeway to interpret the meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">[559 U.S. 762]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">and application of its own injunctive order. Members of this Court have written that the \u201cconstruction given to\u201d an \u201cinjunction by the issuing judge ... is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., </em>512 U.S. 753, 795, 114 S. Ct. 2516, 129 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). And the Courts of Appeals have consistently held that district courts have considerable discretion in interpreting and applying their own in-junctive decrees. See, <em>e.g., JTH Tax, Inc. </em>v. <em>H &amp; R Block Eastern Tax Servs., Inc., </em>359 F.3d 699, 705 (CA4 2004); <em>Alabama Nursing Home Assn. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>617 F.2d 385, 388 (CA5 1980). This principle is longstanding and well established, as reflected in a prominent treatise writer\u2019s summary of the case law: \u201cThe court granting the injunction is necessarily invested with large discretion in enforcing obedience to its mandate, and . . . courts of appellate powers are exceedingly averse to interfering with the exercise of such judgment and discretion.\u201d 2 J. High, Law of Injunctions \u00a7 1458, pp. 1467-1468 (4th ed. 1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Second, a court should construe the scope of an injunction in light of its purpose and history, in other words, \u201cwhat the decree was really designed to accomplish.\u201d <em>Mayor of Vicksburg </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>231 U.S. 259, 273, 34 S. Ct. 95, 58 L. Ed. 209 (1913). Courts have long looked to \u201cthe objects for which the [injunctive] relief was granted, as well as the circumstances attending it,\u201d in deciding whether an enjoined party has complied with an injunction. 2 High, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1446, at 1455, and n. 68 (citing cases); see also <em>John B. Stetson Co. </em>v. <em>Stephen L. Stetson Co., </em>128 F.2d 981, 983 (CA2 1942). And they have long refused to \u201cpermit defendants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction, by doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms a violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing substantially that which they were enjoined from doing.\u201d <em>Stodder </em>v. <em>Rosen Talking Mach. Co., </em>247 Mass. 60, 68, 141 N.E. 569, 571 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">[559 U.S. 763]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">These two principles adequately support the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the injunc-tive language at issue here. As an initial matter, the plain text of the injunction is reasonably read to prohibit the transfer. Right now, the cross is covered with a plywood box; after the transfer, the box will be removed and the cross will be displayed. The transfer thus \u201cpermits\u201d the public \u201cdisplay\u201d of the cross. Indeed, that is the statute\u2019s objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Consideration of the injunction\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>purpose points in the same direction. The injunction rested upon the District Court\u2019s determination that the display of the cross \u201cconveys a message of endorsement of religion\u201d to \u201ca reasonable observer\u201d in violation of the Establishment Clause. 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1216-1217. (As I have said, for present purposes we must assume that this is so.) The purpose of the injunction is to prevent the conveyance of such a message to the reasonable observer.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">With that purpose in mind, consider the following facts that confronted the District Court when the plaintiff asked it to enforce the decree:</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u2022 The Government had designated the \u201cwhite cross ... as well as a limited amount of adjoining [land]\u201d as a national memorial. Pub. L. 107-117, \u00a7 8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\u2022 The new statute directed the transfer of the \u201cproperty . . . designated . . . as a national memorial\u201d to a private entity with an interest in maintaining the cross in its current location, in exchange for a parcel of land located elsewhere in the preserve owned by private individuals who have taken a similar interest in the cross. Pub. L. 108-87, \u00a7\u00a7 8121(a) and (b), 117 Stat. 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">\u2022 The transfer was made \u201csubject to the condition that the recipient maintain the conveyed property as a memorial,\u201d and the property reverts to the United States if the Secretary determines that the recipient has failed to do so. \u00a7 8121(e), <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">[559 U.S. 764]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">\u2022 After the transfer, the cross would sit on 1 acre of privately owned land in a 1.6 million acre national preserve, over 90% of which is federally owned. 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">\u2022 Congress had previously prevented the use of federal funds to remove the cross from its present location. Pub. L. 107-248, \u00a7 8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551; Pub. L. 106-554, \u00a7 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">The District Court considered the facts before it through the lens of the injunction\u2019s original purpose. See 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1180 (explaining that the \u201c[G]overnment\u2019s continuing control over the Latin cross\u201d and the involvement of private parties who \u201cdesir[e] its continued presence in the Preserve\u201d \u201cdemonstrate]\u201d that the transfer would not end \u201cthe [G]overnment\u2019s apparent endorsement of a particular religion\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 1182 (considering the historical context of the transfer statute); see also <em>Buono </em>v. <em>Kempthorne, </em>527 F.3d 758, 783 (CA9 2008) (\u201ccarving out a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Preserve . . . will do nothing to minimize the impermissible governmental endorsement\u201d perceived by the reasonable observer). And it concluded that the land transfer would frustrate that purpose. See 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (the transfer would \u201ckeep the Latin cross atop Sunrise Rock without actually curing the continuing Establishment Clause violation\u201d); see also 527 F.3d, at 783 (finding that \u201cNothing in the present posture of the case alters . . . earlier conclusions\u201d regarding what a reasonable observer would perceive). In my view, this is a reasonable conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">The injunction forbids the Government to permit the display of the cross on Sunrise Rock, and its basic purpose was to prevent a reasonable observer from believing that the Government had endorsed the cross. Under the circumstances presented to the District Court, the transfer would have resulted in such a display and might well have conveyed</p>\n<p id=\"Ai3b\">[559 U.S. 765]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">such a message. Consequently, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Court\u2019s decision that the land transfer violated the injunction as written and intended was not an abuse of discretion. And that is what the Ninth Circuit properly held on appeal. What the Establishment Clause implications of the changed circumstances may be is a matter not before us. Cf. <em>Frew </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>540 U.S. 431, 442, 124 S. Ct. 899, 157 L. Ed. 2d 855 (2004) (\u201cIf the [enjoined defendant] establishes reason to modify the decree, the court should make the necessary changes; where it has not done so, however, the decree should be enforced according to its terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Because my conclusion rests primarily upon the law of injunctions, because that law is fairly clear, and because we cannot properly reach beyond that law to consider the underlying Establishment Clause and standing questions, I can find no federal question of general significance in this case. I believe we should not have granted the petition for certiorari. Having granted it, the Court should now dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Since the Court has not done so, however, I believe that we should simply affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
