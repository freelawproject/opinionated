Padilla served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>this Nation with honor as a member of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the transportation of a large amount of marijuana in his tractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence prior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he \u201c \u2018did not have to worry about immigration status since he had been in the country so long.\u2019 \u201d 253 S.W.3d 482, 483 (Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel\u2019s erroneous advice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made his deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he would have insisted on going to trial if he had not received incorrect advice from his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme Court of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant from erroneous advice about deportation because it is merely a \u201ccollateral\u201d consequence</p>\n<p id=\"Aair\">[559 U.S. 360]</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">of his conviction. <em>Id., </em>at 485. In its view, neither counsel\u2019s failure to advise petitioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel\u2019s incorrect advice, could provide a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">We granted certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1317, 173 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009), to decide whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla\u2019s counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that we do not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">The landscape of federal immigration law has changed dramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was only a narrow class of de-portable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms over time have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation. The \u201cdrastic measure\u201d of deportation or removal, <em>Fong Haw Tan </em>v. <em>Phelan, </em>333 U.S. 6, 10, 68 S. Ct. 374, 92 L. Ed. 433 (1948), is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">The Nation\u2019s first 100 years was \u201ca period of unimpeded immigration.\u201d C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 1.2a, p. 5 (1959). An early effort to empower the President to order the deportation of those immigrants he \u201cjudge [d] dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\u201d Act of June 25, 1798, ch. 58, 1 Stat. 571, was short lived and unpopular. Gordon \u00a7 1.2, at 5. It was not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute barring convicts and prostitutes from entering the country, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477. Gordon \u00a7 1.2b, at 6. In 1891, Congress added to the list of excludable persons those \u201cwho have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>convicted of a felony or other infamous</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">[559 U.S. 361]</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Immigration Act of 1917 (1917 Act) brought \u201cradical changes\u201d to our law. S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 54-55 (1950). For the first time in our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens deportable based on conduct committed on American soil. <em>Id., </em>at 55. Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the deportation of \u201cany alien who is hereafter sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed within five years after the entry of the alien to the United States . . . .\u201d 39 Stat. 889. And \u00a7 19 also rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who commit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time after entry. <em>Ibid. </em>Congress did not, however, define the term \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">While the 1917 Act was \u201cradical\u201d because it authorized deportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the Act also included a critically important procedural protection to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the time of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sentencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had the power to make a recommendation \u201cthat such alien shall not be deported.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 890.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This procedure, known as a judicial recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">[559 U.S. 362]</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">against deportation, or JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to prevent deportation; the statute was \u201cconsistently . . . interpreted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority to decide whether a particular conviction should be disregarded as a basis for deportation,\u201d <em>Janvier </em>v. <em>United States, </em>793 F.2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917 forward, there was no such creature as an automatically deportable offense. Even as the class of deportable offenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate unjust results on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Although narcotics offenses\u2014such as the offense at issue in this case\u2014provided a distinct basis for deportation as early as 1922,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the JRAD procedure was generally avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>able to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>213 F.2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954). Except for \u201ctechnical, inadvertent and insignificant violations of the laws relating to narcotics,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>it appears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes involving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act\u2019s broad JRAD provision. See <em>ibid. </em>(recognizing that until 1952 a JRAD in a narcotics</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">[559 U.S. 363]</p>\n<p id=\"AdRa\">case \u201cwas effective to prevent deportation\u201d (citing <em>Dang Nam </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>74 F.2d 379, 380-381 (CA9 1934))).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In light of both the steady expansion of deportable offenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD, it is unsurprising that, in the wake of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the Second Circuit held that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see <em>Janvier, </em>793 F.2d 449. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>26 F.3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was \u201cpart of the sentencing\u201d process, <em>Janvier, </em>793 F.2d, at 452, even if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a non-citizen\u2019s ability to remain in the country was a central issue to be resolved during the sentencing process\u2014not merely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel\u2019s duty to provide effective representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our law. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in 1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In 1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General\u2019s authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation, 110 Stat. 3009-596, an authority that had been exercised to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens during the 5-year period prior to 1996, <em>INS </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 296, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001). Under contemporary law,  if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of these amendments,</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">[559 U.S. 364]</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">his removal is practically inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. Subject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is not available for an offense related to trafficking in a controlled substance. See \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); \u00a7 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">These changes to our immigration law have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal conviction. The importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>crimes has never been more important. These changes confirm our view that,  as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part\u2014indeed, sometimes the most important part<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is entitled to \u201cthe effective assistance of competent counsel.\u201d <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected Padilla\u2019s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he sought about the risk of deportation concerned only collateral matters, <em>i.e., </em>those matters not within the sentencing authority of the state trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 253 S.W.3d,</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">[559 U.S. 365]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">at 483-484 (citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuartado, </em>170 S.W.3d 384 (2005)). In its view, \u201ccollateral consequences are outside the scope of representation required by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and, therefore, the \u201cfailure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of possible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d 253 S.W.3d, at 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this view.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">We, however, have never applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d required under <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Whether that distinction is appropriate is a question we need not consider in this case because of the unique nature of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">We have long recognized that  deportation is a particularly severe \u201cpenalty,\u201d <em>Fong Yue Ting </em>v. <em>United States, </em>149 U.S. 698, 740, 13 S. Ct. 1016, 37 L. Ed. 905 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil in nature, see <em>INS </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1038, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal convictions and</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">[559 U.S. 366]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">the penalty of depor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tation for nearly a century, see Part I, <em>supra, </em>at 360-364, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 290-293. And, importantly, recent changes in our immigration law have made removal nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders. Thus, we find it \u201cmost difficult\u201d to divorce the penalty from the conviction in the deportation context. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>686 F.2d 35, 38 (CADC 1982). Moreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defendants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense find it even more difficult. See <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S., at 322, 121 S. Ct. 2268, 150 L. Ed. 2d 392 (\u201cThere can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is, because of its close connection to the criminal process, uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence. The collateral versus direct distinction is thus ill suited to evaluating a <em>Strickland </em>claim concerning the specific risk of deportation. We conclude that advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Strickland, </em>applies to Padilla\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Under <em>Strickland, </em>we first determine whether counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Then we ask whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The first prong\u2014 constitutional deficiency\u2014is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community: \u201cThe proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional <em>norms.\u201dId., </em>at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. We long have recognized that \u201c [p] rev ailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like . . . are guides to determining what is reasonable . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid,;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">[559 U.S. 367]</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\"><em>Bobby </em>v. <em>Van Hook, </em>558 U.S. 4, 7, 130 S. Ct. 13, 175 L. Ed. 2d 255 (2009) <em>(per curiam); Florida </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>543 U.S. 175, 191, and n. 6, 125 S. Ct. 551, 160 L.

Ed. 2d 389 (2000). Although they are \u201conly guides,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, and not \u201cinexorable commands,\u201d <em>Bobby, </em>558 U.S., at 8, 130 S. Ct. 13, 175 L. Ed. 2d 255, these standards may be valuable measures of the prevailing professional norms of effective representation, especially as these standards have been adapted to deal with the intersection of modern criminal prosecutions and immigration law.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">The weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that  counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation.

Likewise, we have recognized that \u201cpreserving the possibility of\u2019 discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the 1952 INA, 66 Stat. 187, repealed by Congress in 1996, \u201cwould have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S., at 323, 121 S. Ct. 2268, 150 L. Ed. 2d 392. We expected that counsel who were unaware of the discretionary relief measures would \u201cfolio [w] the advice of numerous practice guides\u201d to advise themselves of the importance of this particular form of discretionary relief. <em>Ibid., </em>n. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence for Padilla\u2019s conviction. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)  \u201cAny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance . . . , other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable\u201d). Padilla\u2019s counsel could have easily determined that his plea would make him eligible for deportation simply from reading the text of the statute, which addresses not some broad classification of crimes but specifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses. Instead, Padilla\u2019s counsel provided him false assurance that his conviction would not result in his removal from this country. This is not a hard case in which to find deficiency:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">[559 U.S. 369]</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The consequences of Padilla\u2019s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Immigration law can be complex, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>and it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it. There will, therefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner in such cases is more limited.  When the law is not succinct and straightforward (as it is in many of the scenarios posited by Justice Alito), a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has sufficiently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Whether Padilla is entitled to relief on his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that <em>Strickland </em>applies to Padilla\u2019s claim only to the extent that he has alleged affirmative misadvice. In the United States\u2019 view, \u201ccounsel is not constitutionally required to provide advice on matters that will not be decided in the criminal case . . . ,\u201d though counsel is required to provide accurate advice if she</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">[559 U.S. 370]</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">chooses to discuss these matters. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support among the lower courts. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Couto, </em>311 F.3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kwan, </em>407 F.3d 1005 (CA9 2005); <em>Sparks </em>v. <em>Sowders, </em>852 F.2d 882 (CA6 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>686 F.2d 35 (CADC 1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rojas-Martinez, </em>2005 UT 86, 125 P.3d 930, 935; <em>In re Resendiz, 25 </em>Cal. 4th 230, 19 P.3d 1171 (2001). Kentucky describes these decisions isolating an affirmative misadvice claim as \u201cresult-driven, incestuous . . . [, and] completely lacking in legal or rational bases.\u201d Brief for Respondent 31. We do not share that view, but we agree that there is no relevant difference \u201cbetween an act of commission and an act of omission\u201d in this context. <em>Id., </em>at 30; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 690, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (\u201cThe court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredez, </em>2004-NMSC-036, 136 N.M. 533, 538-539.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite two absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incentive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even when answers are readily available. Silence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of \u201cthe advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\u201d <em>Li</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>bretti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 50-51, 116 S. Ct. 356, 133 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1995). When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile from this country and separation from their families, they should not be encouraged to say nothing at all.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, it would deny a</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">[559 U.S. 371]</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available.  It is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation, and the failure to do so \u201cclearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 62, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985) (White, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We have given serious consideration to the concerns that the Solicitor General, respondent, and <em>amici </em>have stressed regarding the importance of protecting the finality of convictions obtained through guilty pleas. We confronted a similar \u201cfloodgates\u201d concern in <em>Hill, </em>see <em>id., </em>at 58, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203, but nevertheless applied <em>Strickland </em>to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">A flood did not follow in that decision\u2019s wake. Surmounting <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>high bar is never an easy task. See, <em>e.g., </em>466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674  \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (observing that \u201c[a]ttorney errors . . . are as likely to be utterly harmless in a</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">[559 U.S. 372]</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">particular case as they are to be prejudicial\u201d). Moreover,  to obtain relief on this type of claim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 480, 486, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2000). There is no reason to doubt that lower courts\u2014now quite experienced with applying Strickland\u2014can effectively and efficiently use its framework to separate specious claims from those with substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">It seems unlikely that our decision today will have a significant effect on those convictions already obtained as the result of plea bargains. For at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client\u2019s plea. See <em>supra, </em>at 368-371, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 295-296. We should, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their obligation to render competent advice at the time their clients considered pleading guilty. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Likewise, although we must be especially careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of guilty pleas, in the 25 years since we first applied <em>Strickland </em>to claims of ineffective assistance at the plea stage, practice has shown that pleas are less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions obtained after a trial. Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal convictions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But they account for only approximately 30% of the habeas petitions filed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The nature of relief secured by a successful collateral</p>\n<p id=\"AR21\">[559 U.S. 373]</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">challenge to a guilty plea\u2014an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to trial\u2014imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those who collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of the bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a different calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a guilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately, the challenge may result in a <em>less favorable </em>outcome for the defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a conviction obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Finally, informed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deportation consequences into this process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a criminal episode may provide the basis for multiple charges, of which only a subset mandate deportation following conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the threat of deportation may provide the defendant with a powerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does not mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a charge that does.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In sum, we have long recognized that  the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S., at 57, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203; see also <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S., at 770-771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763.

Ct. 10, 92 L. Ed. 17 (1947)\u2014only underscores how critical it is for counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">[559 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">to inform her noncitizen client that he faces a risk of deportation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">It is our responsibility under the Constitution to ensure that no criminal defendant\u2014whether a citizen or not\u2014is left to the \u201cmercies of incompetent counsel.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S., at 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763. To satisfy this responsibility, we now hold that counsel must inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation. Our longstanding Sixth Amendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as a consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant impact of deportation on families living lawfully in this country demand no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Taking as true the basis for his motion for postconviction relief, we have little difficulty concluding that Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient.

See <em>Weedin </em>v. <em>May Fat, </em>8 F.2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an individual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because offense did not involve moral turpitude).

See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>202 F.3d 20, 28 (CA1 2000) (ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails if \u201cbased on an attorney\u2019s failure to advise a client of his plea\u2019s immigration consequences\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 355 (CA5 1993) (holding that \u201can attorney\u2019s failure to advise a client that deportation is a possible consequence of a guilty plea does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d); see generally Chin &amp; Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 697, 699 (2002) (hereinafter Chin <em>&amp; </em>Holmes) (noting that \u201cvirtually all jurisdictions\u201d\u2014including \u201celeven federal circuits, more than thirty states, and the District of Columbia\u201d\u2014\u201chold that defense counsel need not discuss with their clients the collateral consequences of a conviction,\u201d including deportation). While the line between \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201ccollateral\u201d consequences is not always clear, see <em>ante, </em>at 364, n. 8, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 293, the collateral-consequences rule expresses an important truth: Criminal defense attorneys have expertise regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings. They are not expected to possess\u2014and very often do not possess\u2014expertise in other areas of the law, and it is unrealistic to expect them to provide expert advice on matters that he outside their area of training and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">This case happens to involve removal, but criminal convictions can carry a wide variety of consequences other than conviction and sentencing, including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits, ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or professional licenses. Chin &amp; Holmes 705-706. A criminal conviction may also severely damage a defendant\u2019s reputation and thus impair the defendant\u2019s ability to obtain future employment or business opportunities. All of those consequences are \u201cseriou[s],\u201d see <em>ante, </em>at 374, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 299, but this Court has</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">[559 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">never held that a criminal defense attorney\u2019s Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing advice about such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">The Court tries to justify its dramatic departure from precedent by pointing to the views of various professional organizations. See <em>ante, </em>at 367, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 294 (\u201cThe weight of prevailing professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation\u201d). However, ascertaining the level of professional competence required by the Sixth Amendment is ultimately a task for the courts. <em>E.g., Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2000). Although we may appropriately consult standards promulgated by private bar groups, we cannot delegate to these groups our task of determining what the Constitution commands. See <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (explaining that \u201c[prevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards . . . are guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides\u201d). And we must recognize that such standards may represent only the aspirations of a bar group rather than an empirical assessment of actual practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Even if the only relevant consideration were \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d it is hard to see how those norms can support the duty the Court today imposes on defense counsel. Because many criminal defense attorneys have little understanding of immigration law, see <em>ante, </em>at 369, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 295-296, it should follow that a criminal defense attorney who refrains from providing immigration advice does not violate prevailing professional norms. But the Court\u2019s opinion would not just require defense counsel to warn the client of a general <em>risk </em>of removal; it would also require counsel, in at least some cases, to specify what the removal <em>consequences </em>of a conviction would be. See <em>ante, </em>at 368-369, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 295-296.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Court\u2019s new approach is particularly problematic because providing advice on whether a conviction for a particular offense will make an alien removable is often quite complex. \u201cMost crimes affecting immigration status are not</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">[559 U.S. 378]</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)], but instead fall under a broad category of crimes, such as <em>crimes involving moral turpitude </em>or <em>aggravated, </em>felonies.\u201d M. Garcia &amp; L. Eig, CRS Report for Congress, Immigration Consequences of Criminal Activity (Sept. 20, 2006) (summary) (emphasis in original). As has been widely acknowledged, determining whether a particular crime is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude [(CIMT)]\u201d is not an easy task. See R. McWhirter, ABA, The Criminal Lawyer\u2019s Guide to Immigration Law: Questions and Answers 128 (2d ed. 2006) (hereinafter ABA Guidebook) (\u201cBecause of the increased complexity of aggravated felony law, this edition devotes a new [30-page] chapter to the subject\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5.2, at 146 (stating that the aggravated felony list at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) is not clear with respect to several of the listed categories, that \u201cthe term \u2018aggravated felonies\u2019 can include misdemeanors,\u201d and that the determination of whether a crime is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d is made \u201ceven more difficult\u201d because \u201cseveral agencies and courts interpret the statute,\u201d including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and Federal Circuit and District Courts considering immigration-law and criminal-law issues); ABA Guidebook \u00a7 4.65, at 130 (\u201cBecause nothing is ever simple with immigration law, the terms \u2018conviction,\u2019 \u2018moral turpitude,\u2019 and \u2018single scheme of criminal misconduct\u2019 are terms of art\u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 4.67, at 130 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018moral turpitude\u2019 evades precise definition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Defense counsel who consults a guidebook on whether a particular crime is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d will often find that the answer is not \u201ceasily ascertained.\u201d For example, the ABA Guidebook answers the question \u201cDoes simple possession count as an aggravated felony?\u201d as follows: \u201cYes, <em>at least in the Ninth </em>Circuit.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5.35, at 160 (emphasis added). After a dizzying paragraph that attempts to explain the evolution of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, the ABA Guidebook continues: \u201cAdding to the confusion, however, is that the Ninth</p>\n<p id=\"A1_8\">[559 U.S. 379]</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Circuit has conflicting opinions depending on the context on whether simple drug possession constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5.35, at 161 (citing cases distinguishing between whether a simple possession offense is an aggravated felony \u201cfor immigration purposes\u201d or for \u201csentencing purposes\u201d). The ABA Guidebook then proceeds to explain that <em>\u201cattempted, </em>possession,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5.36, at 161 (emphasis added), of a controlled substance <em>is </em>an aggravated felony, while \u201c[Conviction under the federal <em>accessory </em>after the fact statute is <em>probably not </em>an aggravated felony, but a conviction for accessory after the fact to the manufacture of methamphetamine <em>is </em>an aggravated felony,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a75.37, at 161 (emphasis added). Conspiracy or attempt to commit drug trafficking are aggravated felonies, but \u201c[s]olicitation is not a drug-trafficking offense because a generic solicitation offense is not an offense related to a controlled substance and therefore not an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5.41, at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Determining whether a particular crime is one involving moral turpitude is no easier. See <em>id., </em>at 134 (\u201cWriting bad checks <em>may or may not </em>be a CIMT\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[RJeckless assault coupled with an element of injury, but not serious injury, is <em>probably </em>not a CIMT\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id., </em>at 135 (misdemeanor driving under the influence is generally not a CIMT, but may be a CIMT if the DUI results in injury or if the driver knew that his license had been suspended or revoked); <em>id., </em>at 136 (\u201cIf there is no element of actual injury, the endangerment offense <em>may </em>not be a CIMT\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cWhether [a child abuse] conviction involves moral turpitude <em>may </em>depend on the subsection under which the individual is convicted. Child abuse done with criminal negligence <em>probably </em>is not a CIMT\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Many other terms of the INA are similarly ambiguous or may be confusing to practitioners not versed in the intricacies of immigration law. To take just a few examples, it may</p>\n<p id=\"AfBz\">[559 U.S. 380]</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">be hard, in some cases, for defense counsel even to determine whether a client is an alien,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or whether a particular state disposition will result in a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of federal immigration law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The task of offering advice about the immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>consequences of a criminal conviction is further complicated by other problems, including significant variations among Circuit interpretations of federal immigration statutes; the frequency with which immigration law changes; different rules governing the immigration consequences of juvenile, first-offender, and foreign convictions; and the relationship between the \u201clength and type of sentence\u201d and the determination \u201cwhether [an alien] is subject to removal, eligible for relief from removal, or qualified to become a naturalized citizen,\u201d Immigration Law and Crimes \u00a7 2:1, at 2-2 to 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In short, the professional organizations and guidebooks on which the Court so heavily relies are right to say that \u201cnothing</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">[559 U.S. 381]</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">is ever simple with immigration law\u201d\u2014including the determination whether immigration law clearly makes a particular offense removable. ABA Guidebook \u00a7 4.65, at 130; Immigration Law and Crimes \u00a72:1. I therefore cannot agree with the Court\u2019s apparent view that the Sixth Amendment requires criminal defense attorneys to provide immigration advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The Court tries to downplay the severity of the burden it imposes on defense counsel by suggesting that the scope of counsel\u2019s duty to offer advice concerning deportation consequences may turn on how hard it is to determine those consequences. Where \u201cthe terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence[s]\u201d of a conviction, the Court says, counsel has an affirmative duty to advise the client that he will be subject to deportation as a result of the plea. <em>Ante, </em>at 368, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 295. But \u201c[w]hen the law is not succinct and straightforward . . . , a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 369, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 296. This approach is problematic for at least four reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">First, it will not always be easy to tell whether a particular statutory provision is \u201csuccinct, clear, and explicit.\u201d How can an attorney who lacks general immigration-law expertise be sure that a seemingly clear statutory provision actually means what it seems to say when read in isolation? What if the application of the provision to a particular case is not clear but a cursory examination of case law or administrative decisions would provide a definitive answer? See Immigration Law and Crimes \u00a7 2:1, at 2-2 (\u201cUnfortunately, a practitioner or respondent cannot tell easily whether a conviction is for a removable offense. . . . [T]he cautious practitioner or apprehensive respondent will not know conclusively the future immigration consequences of a guilty plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Second, if defense counsel must provide advice regarding only one of the many collateral consequences of a criminal</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">[559 U.S. 382]</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">conviction, many defendants are likely to be misled. To take just one example, a conviction for a particular offense may render an alien excludable but not removable. If an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>alien charged with such an offense is advised only that pleading guilty to such an offense will not result in removal, the alien may be induced to enter a guilty plea without realizing that a consequence of the plea is that the alien will be unable to reenter the United States if the alien returns to his or her home country for any reason, such as to visit an elderly parent or to attend a funeral. See ABA Guidebook \u00a7 4.14, at 111 (\u201cOften the alien is both <em>excludable </em>and <em>removable. </em>At times, however, the lists are different. Thus, the oddity of an alien that is inadmissible but not deportable. This alien should not leave the United States because the government will not let him back in\u201d (emphasis in original)). Incomplete legal advice may be worse than no advice at all because it may mislead and may dissuade the client from seeking advice from a more knowledgeable source.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Third, the Court\u2019s rigid constitutional rule could inadvertently head off more promising ways of addressing the underlying problem\u2014such as statutory or administrative reforms requiring trial judges to inform a defendant on the record that a guilty plea may carry adverse immigration consequences. As <em>amici </em>point out, \u201c28 states and the District of Columbia have <em>already </em>adopted rules, plea forms, or statutes requiring courts to advise criminal defendants of the possible immigration consequences of their pleas.\u201d Brief for State of Louisiana et al. 25; accord, Chin &amp; Holmes 708 (\u201cA growing number of states require advice about deportation by statute or court rule\u201d). A nonconstitu-tional rule requiring trial judges to inform defendants on the record of the risk of adverse immigration consequences can ensure that a defendant receives needed information without putting a large number of criminal convictions at risk; and because such a warning would be given on the record, courts would not later have to determine whether the defendant was misrepresenting the</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">[559 U.S. 383]</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">advice of counsel. Likewise, flexible statutory procedures for withdrawing guilty pleas might give courts appropriate discretion to determine whether the interests of justice would be served by allowing a particular defendant to withdraw a plea entered into on the basis of incomplete information. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>686 F.2d 35, 39-40 (CADC 1982) (explaining that a district court\u2019s discretion to set aside a guilty plea under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be guided by, among other considerations, \u201cthe possible existence of prejudice to the government\u2019s case as a result of the defendant\u2019s untimely request to stand trial\u201d and \u201cthe strength of the defendant\u2019s reason for withdrawing the plea, including whether the defendant asserts his innocence of the charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Fourth, the Court\u2019s decision marks a major upheaval in Sixth Amendment law. This Court decided <em>Strickland </em>in 1984, but the majority does not cite a single case, from this or any other federal court, holding that criminal defense counsel\u2019s failure to provide advice concerning the removal consequences of a criminal conviction violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As noted above, the Court\u2019s view has been rejected by every Federal Court of Appeals to have considered the issue thus far. See, <em>e.g., Gonzalez, </em>202 F.3d, at 28; <em>Banda, </em>1 F.3d, at 355; Chin &amp; Holmes 697, 699. The majority appropriately acknowledges that the lower courts are \u201cnow quite experienced with applying <em>Strickland,\u201d ante, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>372, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 297, but it casually dismisses the longstanding and unanimous position of the lower federal courts with respect to the scope of criminal defense counsel\u2019s duty to advise on collateral consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The majority seeks to downplay its dramatic expansion of the scope of criminal defense counsel\u2019s duties under the Sixth Amendment by claiming that this Court in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985), similarly \u201capplied <em>Strickland </em>to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.\u201d Ante, at 371, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 297. That</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">[559 U.S. 384]</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">characterization of <em>Hill </em>obscures much more than it reveals. The issue in <em>Hill </em>was whether a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated where counsel misinformed the client about his eligibility for parole. The Court found it \u201cunnecessary to determine whether there may be circumstances under which erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility may be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, because in the present case we conclude that petitioner\u2019s allegations are insufficient to satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>requirement of \u2018prejudice.\u2019 \u201d 474 U.S., at 60, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203. Given that <em>Hill </em>expressly and unambiguously refused to decide whether criminal defense counsel must <em>avoid misinforming </em>his or her client as to <em>one </em>consequence of a criminal conviction (parole eligibility), that case plainly provides no support whatsoever for the proposition that counsel must <em>affirmatively advise </em>his or her client as to <em>another </em>collateral consequence (removal). By the Court\u2019s strange logic, <em>Hill </em>would support its decision here even if the Court had held that mis-advice concerning parole eligibility does <em>not </em>make counsel\u2019s performance objectively unreasonable. After all, the Court still would have \u201capplied Strickland\u201d to the facts of the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">While mastery of immigration law is not required by <em>Strickland, </em>several considerations support the conclusion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal consequences of a conviction may constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">First, a rule prohibiting affirmative misadvice regarding a matter as crucial to the defendant\u2019s plea decision as deportation appears faithful to the scope and nature of the Sixth Amendment duty this Court has recognized in its past cases. In particular, we have explained that \u201ca guilty plea cannot be attacked as based on inadequate legal advice unless counsel was not \u2018a reasonably competent attorney\u2019 and the advice was not \u2018within the range of competence demanded of attorneys</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">[559 U.S. 385]</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\"><em>in criminal cases.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (quoting <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 770, 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); emphasis added). As the Court appears to acknowledge, thorough understanding of the intricacies of immigration law is not \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys <em>in criminal cases.\u201d See ante, </em>at 369, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 295-296 (\u201cImmigration law can be complex, and it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it\u201d). By contrast, reasonably competent attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>should know that it is not appropriate or responsible to hold themselves out as authorities on a difficult and complicated subject matter with which they are not familiar. Candor concerning the limits of one\u2019s professional expertise, in other words, is within the range of duties reasonably expected of defense attorneys in criminal cases. As the dissenting judge on the Kentucky Supreme Court put it, \u201cI do not believe it is too much of a burden to place on our defense bar the duty to say, \u2018I do not know.\u2019 \u201d 253 S.W.3d 482, 485 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant\u2019s decisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and integrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (\u201cIn giving meaning to the requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we must take its purpose\u2014to ensure a fair trial\u2014as the guide\u201d). When a defendant opts to plead guilty without definitive information concerning the likely effects of the plea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk that the conviction may carry indirect consequences of which he or she is not aware. That is not the case when a defendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel\u2019s express misrepresentation that the defendant will not be removable. In the latter case, it seems hard to say that the plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally competent counsel\u2014or that it embodies a voluntary and intelligent decision to forsake constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">[559 U.S. 386]</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">rights. See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice regarding exceptionally important collateral matters would not deter or interfere with ongoing political and administrative efforts to devise fair and reasonable solutions to the difficult problem posed by defendants who plead guilty without knowing of certain important collateral consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal consequences of a conviction can give rise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court\u2019s approach, not require any upheaval in the law. As the Solicitor General points out, \u201c[t]he vast majority of the lower courts considering claims of ineffective assistance in the plea context have [distinguished] between defense counsel who remain silent and defense counsel who give affirmative misadvice.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>8 (citing cases). At least three Courts of Appeals have held that affirmative misadvice on immigration matters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel, at least in some circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And several other Circuits have held that affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>misadvice concerning nonimmigration consequences of a conviction can violate the Sixth Amendment even if those consequences</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">[559 U.S. 387]</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">might be deemed \u201ccollateral.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By contrast, it appears that no court of appeals holds that affirmative misadvice concerning collateral consequences in general and removal in particular can <em>never </em>give rise to ineffective assistance. In short, the considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower federal courts charged with administering <em>Strickland </em>clearly supports the conclusion that the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s position goes too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In concluding that affirmative mis-advice regarding the removal consequences of a criminal conviction may constitute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinformation. When a criminal defense attorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney should advise the client that a criminal conviction may have adverse consequences under the immigration laws and that the client should consult an immigration specialist if the client wants advice on that subject. By putting the client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice would significantly reduce the chance that the client would plead guilty under a mistaken premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be required to provide advice on immigration law, a complex specialty</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">[559 U.S. 388]</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal defense attorney\u2019s expertise. On the other hand, any competent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the extraordinary importance that the risk of removal might have in the client\u2019s determination whether to enter a guilty plea. Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect information concerning the risk of removal can give rise to an ineffectiveness claim. In addition, silence alone is not enough to satisfy counsel\u2019s duty to assist the client. Instead, an alien defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client that a conviction may have immigration consequences, that immigration law is a specialized field, that the attorney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client should consult an immigration specialist if the client wants advice on that subject.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\">.

For example, state law may define the term \u201cconviction\u201d not to include a deferred adjudication, but such an adjudication would be deemed a conviction for purposes of federal immigration law.

The Constitution, however, is not an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world; and when we ignore its text in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>order to make it that, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a tack hammer is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a lawyer \u201cfor his defence\u201d against a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d\u2014 not for sound advice about the collateral consequences of conviction. For that reason, and for the practical reasons set forth in Part I of Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence, I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea. For the same reasons, but unlike the concurrence, I do not believe that affirmative misadvice about those consequences renders an attorney\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">[559 U.S. 389]</p>\n<p id=\"A2a-\">assistance in defending against the prosecution constitutionally inadequate; or that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to warn immigrant defendants that a conviction may render them removable. Statutory provisions can remedy these concerns in a more targeted fashion, and without producing permanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.</p>\n<p id=\"pAmou\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAVEAAAAlAQAAAADTyeeMAAAAu0lEQVR4nGP8z0AsaGQiWikDw6haeqhFibx/uDgQtf8akIR+M+Dg0Na9DkUIkf+NT3BwmBgYGBj+P0LS/e8ILg4TAwMDA+OHD0giDx7g4jAwMDAw7HiGEGEsOIODA1FrVIFkVfIHXJz///////+n/j8C/PiPndMAMfeZA5Lusw04OBC1S1iQpD04cHAgajvkkBwlYIODAwlfAQGEyD8FBRwcSPjO40KIMNuI4OCQHg7EAVLUMo6WZ4NGLQCsiYIYy/nlYQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"337\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and ratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ counsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Duzee, </em>140 U.S. 169, 173, 11 S. Ct. 758, 35 L. Ed. 399 (1891); W. Beaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28-29 (1955). We have held, however, that the Sixth Amendment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at government expense, <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 344-345, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963), and that the right to \u201cthe assistance of counsel\u201d includes the right to <em>effective </em>assistance, <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). Even assuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the significant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser extent the concurrence, would create. We have until today at least retained the Sixth Amendment\u2019s textual limitation to criminal prosecutions. \u201c[W]e have held that \u2018defence\u2019 means defense at trial, not defense in relation to other objectives that may be important to the accused.\u201d <em>Rothgery </em>v. <em>Gillespie County, </em>554 U.S. 191, 216, 128 S. Ct. 2578, 171 L. Ed. 2d 366 (2008) (Alito, J., concurring) (summarizing cases). We have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice directly related to defense against prosecution of the charged offense\u2014advice at trial, of course, but also advice at postindictment interrogations and lineups, <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 205-206, 84 S. Ct. 1199, 12 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1964); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 236-238, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (1967), and in general advice at all phases of the prosecution where the defendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone against the legally trained agents of the state, see <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">[559 U.S. 390]</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">412, 430, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986). Not only have we not required advice of counsel regarding consequences collateral to prosecution, we have not even required counsel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be present when the defendant is interrogated in connection with another possible prosecution arising from the same event. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. 162, 164, 121 S. Ct. 1335, 149 L. Ed. 2d 321 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">There is no basis in text or in prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ciple to extend the constitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas beyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution at hand\u2014to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce, the higher sentence that conviction after trial might entail, and the chances of such a conviction. Such matters fall within \u201cthe range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,\u201d <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970). See <em>id., </em>at 769-770, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (describing the matters counsel and client must consider in connection with a contemplated guilty plea). We have never held, as the logic of the Court\u2019s opinion assumes, that once counsel is appointed all professional responsibilities of counsel\u2014even those extending beyond defense against the prosecution\u2014become constitutional commands. Cf. <em>Cobb, supra, </em>at 171, n. 2, 121 S. Ct. 1335, 149 L. Ed. 2d 321; <em>Moran, supra, </em>at 430, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410. Because the subject of the misadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose Padilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Adding to counsel\u2019s duties an obligation to advise about a conviction\u2019s collateral consequences has no logical stopping point. As the concurrence observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201c[A] criminal convictio[n] can carry a wide variety of consequences other than conviction and sentencing, including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits, ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are \u2018seri-ou[s]\u2019. . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 376, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 300 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">[559 U.S. 391]</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">But it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the same defect. The same indeterminacy, the same inability to know what areas of advice are relevant, attaches to misadvice. And the concurrence\u2019s suggestion that counsel must warn defendants of potential removal consequences, see <em>ante, </em>at 387, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 307\u2014 what would come to be known as the <em>\u201cPadilla </em>warning\u201d\u2014cannot be limited to those consequences except by judicial caprice. It is difficult to believe that the warning requirement would not be extended, for example, to the risk of heightened sentences in later federal prosecutions pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We could expect years of elaboration upon these new issues in the lower courts, prompted by the defense bar\u2019s devising of ever-expanding categories of plea-invalidating misadvice and failures to warn\u2014not to mention innumerable evidentiary hearings to determine whether misadvice really occurred or whether the warning was really given.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The concurrence\u2019s treatment of mis-advice seems driven by concern about the voluntariness of Padilla\u2019s guilty plea. See <em>ante, </em>at 385-386, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 306. But that concern properly relates to the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, not to the Sixth Amendment. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1970). Padilla has not argued before us that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. If that is, however, the true substance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>his claim (and if he has properly preserved it) the state court can address it on remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">[559 U.S. 392]</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">But we should not smuggle the claim into the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Court\u2019s holding prevents legislation that could solve the problems addressed by today\u2019s opinions in a more precise and targeted fashion. If the subject had not been constitution-alized, legislation could specify which categories of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecution invalidate plea agreements, what collateral consequences counsel must bring to a defendant\u2019s attention, and what warnings must be given.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, legislation could provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice, or failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal conviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for retrial have disappeared. Federal immigration law might provide, for example, that the near-automatic removal which follows from certain criminal convictions will not apply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea induced by counsel\u2019s mis-advice regarding removal consequences. Or legislation might put the government to a choice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant or forgo the removal. But all that has been precluded in favor of today\u2019s sledge hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate assistance of counsel in defending against a pending criminal prosecution. We should limit both the constitutional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of bad advice to that well defined area.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\">. I do not mean to suggest that the Due Process Clause would surely provide relief. We have indicated that awareness of \u201cdirect consequences\u2019\u2019 suffices for the validity of a guilty plea. See <em>Brady, </em>397 U.S., at 755, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the required colloquy between a federal district court and a defendant required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) (formerly Rule 11(c)), which we have said approximates the due process requirements for a valid plea, see <em>Libretti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 49-50, 116 S. Ct. 356, 133 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1995), does not mention collateral consequences. Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of misadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty plea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\">. As the Court\u2019s opinion notes, <em>ante, </em>at 374, n. 15, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 299, many States\u2014including Kentucky\u2014already require that criminal defendants be warned of potential removal consequences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
