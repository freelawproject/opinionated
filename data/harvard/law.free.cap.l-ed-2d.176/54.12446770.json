The Act, however, excludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain enumerated events. \u00a7 3161(h) (2006 ed. and Supp. II). As relevant here, \u201cdelay resulting from . . . proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d is automatically excludable from a Speedy Trial Act calculation. \u00a7 3161(h)(1) (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance\u201d granted by the district court may be excluded if the district court makes the findings required by \u00a7 3161(h)(7) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (hereinafter subsection (h)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">This case requires us to decide the narrow question whether time granted to a party to <em>prepare </em>pretrial motions is automatically excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1), or whether such time may be excluded only if a court makes case-specific findings under subsection (h)(7). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that pretrial motion preparation time is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). 534 F.3d 893, 898 (2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted certiorari, 556 U.S. 1181, 129 S.

After observing petitioner commit several traffic violations, the officers stopped the vehicle. They approached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine on petitioner\u2019s lap. After the officers read petitioner his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, petitioner made inculpatory statements. See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Petitioner denied any association with the apartment building where the car had been parked, but his girlfriend admitted that she lived there and consented to a search of her residence. The officers who conducted the search uncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, including an identification card, cocaine, three firearms, ammunition, and a bulletproof vest. The police arrested petitioner the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The August 24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day clock. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). After petitioner\u2019s arraignment on September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling order requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>that the parties file pretrial motions by September 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the deadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to September 21. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion and extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond petitioner\u2019s request, to September 25. On September 25, however, petitioner filed a \u201cWaiver of Pretrial Motions\u201d advising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">[559 U.S. 201]</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to consider petitioner\u2019s \u201cwaiver,\u201d at which petitioner confirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial motions. After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found that petitioner\u2019s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial was delayed for several reasons. Though these delays are not directly relevant to the question presented here, we recount them to explain the full context in which that question arises. On November 8, petitioner moved to continue the trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional time to prepare for trial. The District Court granted the motion and reset the trial for December 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The parties then met informally and prepared a plea agreement, which they provided to the court. The District Court scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20. At the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement the agreement and requested a new attorney. The District Court rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s subsequent motion to withdraw, and appointed new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">On February 19, 2007\u2014179 days after petitioner was indicted\u2014peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tioner moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. The District Court denied the motion. In calculating how many of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the District Judge excluded the period from September 7 through October 4 as \u201cwithin the extension of time granted to file pretrial motions.\u201d Order in No. 4:06CR518-SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">[559 U.S. 202]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on the District Court\u2019s docket, which required the court to reschedule petitioner\u2019s trial. After obtaining the consent of the parties and finding that a continuance would serve the public interest, the District Court continued petitioner\u2019s trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007. Petitioner\u2019s 2-day trial began on that date. The jury found petitioner guilty on both counts, and the District Court later sentenced him to concurrent 30-year terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the Eighth Circuit, which affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation. As relevant, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the time from September 7 (the original deadline for filing pretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court held a hearing on petitioner\u2019s decision to waive the right to file pretrial motions) was ex-cludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day limit. Although the District Court did not identify which provision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cpretrial motion preparation time\u201d is automatically ex-cludable under subsection (h)(1)\u2014 which covers \u201cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d\u2014as long as \u201cthe [district] court specifically grants time for that purpose.\u201d 534 F.3d, at 897.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion,</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">[559 U.S. 203]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">the Eighth Circuit joined seven other Courts of Appeals that interpret subsection (h)(1) the same way.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two Courts of Appeals, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits, interpret subsection (h)(1) differently, holding that time for prepar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ing pretrial motions is outside subsection (h)(l)\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We granted certio-rari to resolve this conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal defendant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days of a defendant\u2019s initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from the 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay. Section 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are excludable from the calculation. Some of these delays are excludable only if the district court makes certain findings enumerated in the statute. See \u00a7 3161(h)(7). Other delays are automatically excludable, <em>i.e., </em>they may be excluded without district court findings. As relevant here, subsection (h)(1) requires the automatic exclusion of \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to\u201d periods of delay resulting from eight enumerated subcategories of proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Government contends</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">[559 U.S. 204]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">that the time the District Court granted petitioner to prepare his pretrial motions is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). We disagree, and conclude that such time may be excluded only when a district court enters appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The eight subparagraphs in subsection (h)(1) address the automatic ex-cludability of delay generated for certain enumerated purposes. Thus, we first consider whether the delay at issue in this case is governed by one of these subparagraphs. It is.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">[559 U.S. 205]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">The delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner sufficient time to file pretrial motions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   Subsection (h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)) renders automatically excludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d Read, as it must be, in the context of subsection (h), this text governs the automatic excludability of delays \u201cresulting\u201d from a specific category of \u201cproceedings concerning the defendant,\u201d namely, proceedings involving pretrial motions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the delay at issue here results from a decision</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">[559 U.S. 206]</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">granting time to prepare pretrial motions, if not from a pretrial motion itself (the defendant\u2019s request for additional time), it is governed by subparagraph (D). But that does not make the delay at issue here automatically excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Subparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay to automatic exclusion. Instead, it renders automatically excludable only the delay that occurs <em>\u201cfrom the filing </em>of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of\u2019 the motion. (Emphasis added.) In so doing, the provision communicates Congress\u2019 judgment that delay resulting from pretrial motions is automatically ex-cludable, <em>i.e., </em>excludable without district court findings, <em>only </em>from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point specified in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pretrial motion-related delay are excludable only when accompanied by district court findings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">This limitation is significant because Congress knew how to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion broadly when it so desired. Subsection (h)(1)(A) (2006 ed.) (hereinafter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the automatic exclusion of \u201cdelay resulting from any proceeding, <em>including </em>any examinations, to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) With the word \u201cincluding,\u201d Congress indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>other competency-related proceedings besides \u201cexaminations\u201d might fall within subparagraph (A)\u2019s automatic exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">[559 U.S. 207]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In subparagraph (D), by contrast, Congress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term such as \u201cincluding,\u201d and provided instead that only pretrial motion-related delay \u201cfrom the filing\u201d of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically ex-cludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Thus, although the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay may be automatically excluded. The result is that the pretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is not automatically excludable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into automatic excludability because \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here, subparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s] of more general application\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). <em>Gozlon-Peretz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 395, 407, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919 (1991). In arguing that this principle applies, but requires a result different from the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government and several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">There is no question that sub-paragraph (D) is more specific than the \u201cgeneral\u201d language in subsection (h)(1), <em>post, </em>at 218, 222, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72, 74, or that  \u201c[g]eneral language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment,\u201d <em>D. Ginsberg &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Popkin, </em>285 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">[559 U.S. 208]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">204, 208, 52 S. Ct. 322, 76 L. Ed. 704 (1932). We part company with the dissent because we conclude that sub-paragraph (D) governs the period of delay at issue in this case. The dissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground that it is foreclosed by the statute. See <em>post, </em>at 221, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 73-74 (asserting that the delay at issue in this case is \u201cnot necessarily\u201d covered by subparagraph (D)). Instead, it joins the Government in asserting that the Act is amenable to another interpretation that would avoid the \u201cstrange result\u201d that \u201cpetitioner may be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because his attorney persuaded a Magistrate Judge to give the defense additional time to prepare pretrial motions and thus delayed the commencement of his trial.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 217, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 71. This argument takes aim at an exaggerated target. Because we conclude that the type of delay at issue here is excludable under subsection (h)(7), courts can in future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries, a result that is not certain even in this case. See <em>infra, </em>at 214-215, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 69-70. And even if dismissal is ultimately required on remand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify reading subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to \u201cother proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d) to permit automatic exclusion of delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>resulting from virtually any decision to continue a deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because the provision\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclusion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated sub-paragraphs. See <em>post, </em>at 219, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oberoi, </em>547 F.3d 436, 450 (CA2 2008). This argument confuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s list of categories of excludable delay (each of which is represented by a subpara-graph) with the contents of the categories themselves. That the list of categories is illustrative rather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclusion that a delay that falls <em>within </em>the category of delay addressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits in that subpara-graph. The \u201cincluding</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">[559 U.S. 209]</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">but not limited to\u201d clause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to modify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list itself. As noted, such a reading would violate settled principles of statutory construction because it would ignore the structure and grammar of subsection (h)(1), and in so doing render even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous. See <em>Gozlon-Peretz, supra, </em>at 410, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2001) (  \u201c[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Our reading avoids these problems by treating the list as illustrative, but construing each of the eight subparagraphs in (h)(1) to govern, conclusively unless the sub-paragraph itself indicates otherwise, see, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A); <em>supra, </em>at 206-207, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64-65, the automatic excludability of the delay resulting from the category of proceedings it addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The dissent responds that, even if subparagraph (D)\u2019s limits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative, we should automatically exclude the delay at issue here under subsection (h)(l)\u2019s opening clause, see <em>post, </em>at 218, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72, because it is not \u201cclear\u201d that the delay is governed by the more specific (and restrictive) language in subparagraph (D). <em>Post, </em>at 222, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 74. We decline this invitation to use the alleged uncertainty in subparagraph (D)\u2019s scope as a justification for disregarding its limits and instead expanding, through liberal interpretation of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s generic opening clause,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> what the</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">[559 U.S. 210]</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">dissent itself describes as the automatic exclusion \u201cexceptio[n]\u201d to the Act\u2019s 70-day period and the Act\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d requiring \u201cends-of-justice findings for continuances.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 227, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>On the dissent\u2019s reading of subsection (h)(1), a court could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that the incursion on the Act\u2019s timeliness guarantee is justified, the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the Act sets a default limit of 70 days. The problem with this reading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection (h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the definition of a \u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defendant,\u201d and thus threatens the Act\u2019s manifest purpose of ensuring speedy trials by construing the Act\u2019s automatic exclusion exceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day rule. This approach is not justified, much less compelled, by the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon which the dissent relies. Nor is it justified by the prospect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in this case. Hence our conclusion that the text and structure of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion of the delay at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Our conclusion is further supported by subsection (h)(l)\u2019s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7).  Subsection (h)(7) provides that delays \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by any judge\u201d <em>may </em>be excluded, but only if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial\u201d and records those findings. In setting forth the statutory factors that justify a continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time. See  \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court to consider whether the \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d nature of a case makes it \u201cunreasonable to expect</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">[559 U.S. 211]</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\"><em>adequate preparation </em>for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv) (requiring a district court to consider in other cases \u201c[w]hether the failure to grant such a continuance . . . would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the <em>reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, </em>taking into account the exercise of due diligence\u201d (emphasis added)). Our determination that the delay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>post, </em>at 227, 176 L.

We recently explained that the Act serves not only to protect defendants, but also to vindicate the public interest in the swift administration of justice. We thus held that a defendant may not opt out of the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>even if he believes it would be in his interest; \u201c[a]Rowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine the Act because there are many cases . . . in which the prosecution, the defense, and the court would all be happy to opt out of the Act,</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">[559 U.S. 212]</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">to the detriment of the public interest.\u201d <em>Zedner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>547 U.S. 489, 502, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749 (2006).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to provide defendants adequate time to build their defense. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Mobile Materials, Inc., </em>871 F.2d 902, 913 <em>(per curiam), </em>opinion supplemented on other grounds on rehearing, 881 F.2d 866 (CA10 1989) <em>(per curiam). </em>Yet these same courts have recognized that reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude <em>all </em>time for preparing pretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a speedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have recognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or both parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it. See <em>Zedner, supra, </em>at 502, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749. To avoid a result so inconsistent with the statute\u2019s <em>purpose\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cto avoid creating a big loophole in the statute,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tibboel, </em>753 F.2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985)\u2014these courts have found it necessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion for pretrial motion preparation time that their interpretation of subsection (h)(1) otherwise would allow. See, <em>e.g., ibid, </em>(stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be automatically excluded under subsection (h)(1) only when <em>\u201cthe judge has expressly granted, a party time for that </em>purpose\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Oberoi, </em>547 F.3d, at 450 (\u201cThis . . . qualification prevents abuse. Without it, either party \u2018could</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">[559 U.S. 213]</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">delay trial indefinitely merely by working on pretrial motions right up to the eve of trial\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The fact that courts reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on excludability to avoid \u201ccreating a big loophole in the statute,\u201d <em>Tibboel, supra, </em>at 610, underscores the extent to which their interpretation\u2014and the dissent\u2019s\u2014strays from the Act\u2019s text and purpose. As noted, subsection (h)(7) expressly accounts for the possibility that a district court would need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate preparation time. An exclusion under subsection (h)(7) is not automatic, however, and requires specific findings. Allowing district courts to exclude automatically such delays would redesign this statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">We also note that some of the Courts of Appeals that have interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a contrary reading of that provision would lay \u201ca trap for trial judges\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>forcing them to risk a Speedy Trial Act violation if they wish to grant a defendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare a pretrial motion, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>835 F.2d 1440, 1444 (CADC 1987); see also <em>Oberoi, supra, </em>at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to interpret the Speedy Trial Act to \u201ctrap\u201d district courts for accommodating a defendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions, particularly in a case like this. Petitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for the final continuance from February 26 to March 5. And the record clearly shows that the Magistrate Judge and the District Court diligently endeavored to accommodate petitioner\u2019s requests\u2014granting his motion for an extension of time to decide whether to file pretrial motions, his motion for a continuance, and his motion for a new attorney and for time to allow this new attorney to become familiar with the case. Fortunately, we can abide by the limitations Congress imposed</p>\n<p id=\"AE-8\">[559 U.S. 214]</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">on the statutory rights at issue here without interpreting the Act in a manner that would trap trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">For the reasons we explained above, neither subparagraph (D) nor subsection (h)(1) automatically excludes time granted to prepare pretrial motions. This conclusion does not lay a \u201ctrap for trial judges\u201d because it limits (in a way the statute requires) only automatic exclusions. In considering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of time will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to devote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay are justified, given both the statutory and constitutional requirement of speedy trials. Placing these reasons in the record does not add an appreciable burden on these judges. Neither are district courts forced to choose between rejecting a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial. Instead, a district court may exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it grants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings \u201cthat the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d Subsection (h)(7) provides \u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d <em>Zedner, </em>547 U.S., at 498, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749, and gives district courts \u201cdiscretion\u2014within limits and subject to specific procedures\u2014to accommodate limited delays for case-specific needs,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 499, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749. The statutory scheme thus ensures that district courts may grant necessary pretrial motion preparation time without risking dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a district court may fail to make the findings necessary for an exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act\u2019s 70-day limit. Dismissal, however, need not represent a windfall. [10] A district court may dismiss the charges <em>without prejudice, </em>thus allowing the Government to refile charges or reindict the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(1). In ruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district court should consider,</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">[559 U.S. 215]</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">among other factors, the party responsible for the delay. See <em>ibid. </em>(  \u201cIn determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the [district] court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>seriousness of the offense; <em>the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the </em>dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice\u201d (emphasis added)); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>487 U.S. 326, 343, 108 S. Ct. 2413, 101 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1988) (\u201cSeemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respondent, as well as respondent\u2019s own illicit contribution to the delay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period from September 7 through October 4, which includes the additional time granted by the District Court for pretrial motion preparation, is not automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address whether any portion of that time might have been otherwise excludable. Nor did the Government assert in its merits brief that another provision of the Act could support exclusion, presenting the argument that September 25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in its brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argument. We therefore do not consider whether any other exclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period. Instead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-18\">. The excludability of delay \u201cresulting from . . . proceedings\u2019\u2019 under subsection (h)(1) is \u201cautomatic\u2019\u2019 in the sense that a district court must exclude such delay from a Speedy Trial Act calculation without any further analysis as to whether the benefit of the delay outweighs its cost. For delays resulting from proceedings under subsection (h)(1), Congress already has determined that the benefit of such delay outweighs its cost to a speedy trial, regardless of the specifics of the case. The word \u201cautomatic\u201d serves as a useful shorthand. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Lucky, </em>569 F.3d 101, 106 (CA2 2009) (\u201cSome exclusions are automatic. Other exclusions require judicial action\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-19\">. After the Eighth Circuit issued its decision below, Congress passed the Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 4291, which made technical changes to the Speedy Trial Act, including the renumbering of several provisions.

Accordingly, in this opinion, including our discussions of the orders and decisions under review, we refer only to the current version of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\">.

The dissent argues that this conclusion lacks \u201cforce\u201d because \u201c[i]t is at least doubtful. . .that the delay at issue in the present case is delay \u2018resulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 220, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 73 (opinion of Alito, J.). According to the dissent, \u201cdelay \u2018resulting from\u2019 a pretrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion,\u201d which the \u201ctype of delay involved in the present case . . . does not.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 221, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 73 (arguing that the delay in this case instead \u201coccurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s granting of a defense request for an extension of time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The dissent\u2019s position, which rests upon a dictionary definition of two isolated words, does not account for the governing statutory context. For the reasons we explain, the text and structure of subsection (h) support our conclusion that subparagraph (D) governs the automatic excludability of delays \u201cresulting from\u201d proceedings involving pretrial motions. As the dissent concedes, defining \u201cresulting from\u201d to mean \u201cas a consequence of\u2019 does not foreclose our interpretation. That is because the dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cresulting from\u201d leaves ample room to conclude that the delay at issue here is \u201ca consequence of\u2019 the category of proceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay \u201cas a consequence of\u2019 a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or \u201cas a consequence of\u2019 a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for additional time). At bottom, the dissent\u2019s position is not that our interpretation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent\u2019s interpretation is preferable. We disagree because the dissent\u2019s interpretation, among other things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsection (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)\u2019s text, but also from its structure. As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the 70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d In this case, the comma after the first phrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of excludable delay referred to in the first. Thus, subparagraph (D)\u2019s automatic exclusion for delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion is limited to delay that occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identified in the provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b153-15\">. Whether the defendant actually files a pretrial motion for which he requests additional time is irrelevant to this analysis. Even if he files such a motion, that filing may not be used to bootstrap into the period of automatically excludable delay pre-filing preparation time that subparagraph (D) does not render automatically excludable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b154-11\">. The dissent argues that the relevant \u201cproceeding\u201d in this case is the District Court\u2019s disposition of petitioner\u2019s motion for additional time to file pretrial motions. See <em>post, </em>at 218, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72. If that were correct, any order disposing of a motion\u2014including a pretrial motion under subparagraph (D)\u2014would be a separate \u201cproceeding,\u201d and any resulting delay would be automatically excludable. The dissent\u2019s reading renders superfluous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the exclusion of time necessary for \u201cadequate preparation for pretrial proceedings,\u201d \u00a7 316 1(h)(7)(B)(ii), and \u201ceffective preparation,\u201d \u00a7 316 1(h)(7)(B)(iv).

Had Congress wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation time automatically, it could have said so. As noted, subsection (h)(7) twice refers to preparation time to explain the kinds of continuances that a court may grant in the interests of justice. See \u00a7\u00a7 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii), (h)(7)(B)(iv). Congress easily could have referred to preparation time similarly in subsection (h)(1). See, <em>e.g., </em>Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, H.

Our interpretation of the Act accords with this and other precedents in a way the dissent\u2019s interpretation does not. In <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>476 U.S. 321, 322, 106 S. Ct. 1871, 90 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1986), for example, we carefully examined the text of \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) (now codified as subparagraph (D)) to determine whether certain periods of pretrial motion-related delay were automatically excludable. Such careful parsing would seem unnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not conclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the category of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay may simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b158-7\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"AAp\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In its brief in opposition to Bloate\u2019s petition for certiorari, the Government argued that the indictment against Bloate need not be dismissed even if, as the Court today holds, the additional time Bloate gained to prepare pretrial motions</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">[559 U.S. 216]</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">does not qualify for automatic exclusion from the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day limit.

Eight Courts of Appeals have held<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014and I agree\u2014that a delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for additional time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to complete pretrial motions is a delay \u201cresulting from [a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant\u201d and is thus automatically excluded under \u00a7 3161(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In considering the question presented here, I begin with the general language of \u00a7 3161(h)(1), which, as noted, automatically excludes any \u201cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant.\u201d (For convenience, I will refer to this portion of the statute as \u201csubsection (h)(1).\u201d) The delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial motions falls comfortably within the terms of subsection (h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">First, the granting of such a defense request qualifies as a \u201cproceeding.\u201d A court proceeding is defined as \u201c[a]n act or step that is part of a larger action\u201d and \u201can act done by the</p>\n<p id=\"AOC\">[559 U.S. 219]</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">authority or direction of the court.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1324 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s Law) (internal quotation marks omitted). The granting of a defense request for an extension of time to prepare pretrial motions constitutes both \u201c[a]n act or step that is part of [the] larger [criminal case]\u201d and \u201can act done by the authority or direction of the court.\u201d Second, delay caused by the granting of such an extension is obviously \u201cdelay resulting from\u201d the successful extension request.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The Court does not contend that the granting of a defense request for time to prepare pretrial motions falls outside the plain meaning of subsection (h)(1), but the Court holds that \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)) narrows the meaning of subsection (h)(1). Subparagraph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that are specifically identified as \u201cdelay resulting from [a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant,\u201d but as noted, this list is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to.\u201d \u201cWhen \u2018include\u2019 is utilized, it is generally improper to conclude that entities not specifically enumerated are excluded.\u201d 2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.23, p. 417 (7th ed. 2007). See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 569, 577, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994); <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>470 U.S. 414, 423, n. 9, 105 S. Ct. 1421, 84 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1985); <em>Federal Land Bank of St. Paul </em>v. <em>Bismarck Lumber Co., </em>314 U.S. 95, 100, 62 S. Ct. 1, 86 L. Ed. 65 (1941); Black\u2019s Law 831 (\u201cThe participle <em>including </em>typically indicates a partial list\u201d). And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the additional phrase \u201cnot limited to\u201d reinforces this point. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tibboel, </em>753 F.2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to show that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the general rule set out in subsection (h)(1). The Court\u2019s argument is that subpara-graph (D) governs not just \u201cdelay resulting</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">[559 U.S. 220]</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">from any pretrial motion,\u201d \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(D), but also delay resulting from \u201cproceedings <em>involving </em>pretrial motions,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 205, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64, and n. 9 (emphasis added), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>and \u201call pretrial <em>motion-related, </em>delay,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 206, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64 (emphasis added). In the Court\u2019s view, Congress has expressed a judgment that if a period of \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d does not fall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it is \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district court findings.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, since subparagraph (D) does not provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for more time to prepare pretrial motions, the Court holds that such delay is not excluded from the 70-day calculation. The Court\u2019s analysis, however, is not supported by either the text of subparagraph (D) or the circumstances that gave rise to its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Court\u2019s argument would have some force if it were clear that the delay involved in the present case is \u201cdelay resulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u201d \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(D). It could then be argued that subparagraph (D) reflects a legislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion of delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay occurs during the period \u201cfrom the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d <em>Ibid..</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">It is at least doubtful, however, that the delay at issue in the present case is delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u201d <em>Ibid..</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d means \u201cproceed[ing],</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">[559 U.S. 221]</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">spring[ing], or arising] as a consequence, effect, or conclusion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1937 (1971). Thus, delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion. The type of delay involved in the present case, however, does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial motion; rather, it occurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s granting of a defense request for an extension of time. The particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this point because petitioner never filed pretrial motions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">It is telling that the Court elides the statutory phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d and substitutes a broader phrase of its own invention. The Court writes that \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d that is not captured by subparagraph (D)\u2019s text is \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district court findings.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 206, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64. See also <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cSubparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay to automatic exclusion\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 207, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 65 (\u201c[0]nly pretrial motion-related delay \u2018from the filing\u2019 of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically excludable\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 212, n. 14, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 68 (\u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d); <em>ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>(\u201cpretrial motion-related proceedings\u201d). But \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d is not necessarily delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d to mean \u201crelated [to],\u201d see <em>ante, </em>at 206, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64, there are at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading. First, because subpara-graphs (A)-(H) are meant to be illustrative, those provisions should not be interpreted as limiting unless</p>\n<p id=\"AJT\">[559 U.S. 222]</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">the limitation is very clear. Second, the Court\u2019s interpretation of subpara-graph (D) leads to an anomalous result that Congress is unlikely to have intended. Because subparagraph (D) automatically excludes \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion,\u201d it is clear that subparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting from the granting of <em>a prosecution request </em>for additional time to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial motions. The Court has not identified any reason why Congress might have wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay resulting from the granting of a prosecution request for additional time to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial motions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the defendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare those very motions. Since there is nothing to suggest that Congress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the Court\u2019s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should be rejected. Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply only to delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial motion,\u201d and because the delay involved here does not result from a pretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that subparagraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the scope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the current version of sub-paragraph (D) in 1979 point to the same conclusion. That language was adopted to <em>expand </em>the reach of the exclusion. As originally enacted, the relevant provision of the Act excluded only \u201cdelay resulting from hearings on pretrial motions,\u201d 88 Stat. 2078, and courts had interpreted this language literally to exclude only time actually devoted to hearings. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>425 F. Supp. 1166, 1171 (Conn. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>No. 77 Cr. 670 (CHT), 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19296, *4 (SDNY, Mar. 1,</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">[559 U.S. 223]</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">1978); accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>508 F. Supp. 1175, 1177-1178 (WD La. 1979). The House Judiciary Committee stated that the language on which the Court now relies was added \u201cto avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation of the exclusion as extending only to the actual time consumed in a pretrial hearing.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 96-390, p. 10 (1979). Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed frustration with what it described as the courts\u2019 \u201cunnecessarily inflexible\u201d interpretation of the Act. S. Rep. No. 96-212, p. 18 (1979) (hereinafter S. Rep.). See also <em>id., </em>at 26. Congress\u2019 expansion of the exclusion set out in subparagraph (D) so that it covers, not just the time taken up by hearings on pretrial motions, but all delay resulting from pretrial motions does not support the inference that Congress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to count against the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Contending that Congress could have been more explicit if it \u201cwished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation time automatically,\u201d the Court cites as an example a legislative proposal by the Department of Justice to provide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pretrial motions. <em>Ante, </em>at 211, n. 13, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 67. The Court is correct that Congress did not choose this option, but the Court\u2019s argument misses the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">First, it bears emphasizing that the Justice Department\u2019s proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a successful defense request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions. That is the delay in dispute here. Instead, the Justice Department\u2019s proposal excluded all \u201cdelay resulting from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses and from hearings thereon.\u201d S. 961, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 5 (1979) (as introduced).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Second, the reasons given in the Senate Judiciary Committee Report for rejecting the Justice Department proposal do not apply when the delay results from the granting of a defense request such as the one at issue here. The Senate</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">[559 U.S. 224]</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Committee Report noted that, when excluding time for the preparation of pretrial motions, it will be \u201cquite difficult to determine a point at which preparation actually begins.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. But when a district court grants a defendant\u2019s motion for time to prepare pretrial motions, that concern is not present. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oberoi, </em>547 F.3d 436, 451 (CA2 2008) (noting the importance of the District Court\u2019s expressly stopping the speedy trial clock to create a point from which to measure preparation time).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the Committee expressed the view that \u201cin routine cases, preparation time should not be excluded.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. However, cases in which a district court accedes to a defense request for more than the usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial motions are by definition not routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Third, there is no reason why Congress should have supposed that the language that Congress and the President enacted did not reach delay resulting from the granting of the defendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions. As explained above, <em>supra, </em>at 219, 220-222, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72, 73-74, such delay results from a proceeding concerning the defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">In sum, (1) delay resulting from the granting of a defense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial motions falls within the general rule, set out in subsection (h)(1), that automatically excludes delay \u201cresulting from [a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant\u201d; (2) the subparagraphs that follow, which are preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d are illustrative, not exhaustive; and (3) neither the text</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">[559 U.S. 225]</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">of subparagraph (D) nor the circumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an intent to narrow the scope of the general rule set out in subsection (h)(1). For these reasons, I would hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the delay in question here is automatically excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Court advances several additional arguments in support of its analysis, but none is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Two of these arguments hinge on the Court\u2019s unjustifiably broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), <em>i.e., </em>that it covers all \u201cpretrial motion-related delay.\u201d First, the Court reasons that under a contrary interpretation, \u201ca court could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that the incursion on the Act\u2019s timeliness guarantee is justified, the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the Act sets a default limit of 70 days.\u201d Ante, at 210, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 67. But the same is true of the Court\u2019s interpretation. Even under an interpretation that automatically excludes delay <em>\u201conly </em>from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 206, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64, there appears to be no reason why a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the automatically excludable period of time under sub-paragraph (D) through any number of means, including: (1) extending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Latham, </em>No. 82-CR-890, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14219, *1-*3 (ND Ill., Aug. 30, 1983); (3) allowing prehear-ing supplemental briefing, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Faison, </em>No. 06-4332, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 23298, *6-*9 (CA4, Oct. 4, 2007) <em>(per curiam); </em>(4) deferring the hearing on a pretrial motion, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>991 F.2d 120, 124 (CA4 1993); (5) conducting multiple hearings on the motion or motions, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>Crim. No. 00-3 (JBS), 2002 WL 31761364, *20, n. 12 (D NJ, Dec. 6, 2002); or (6) allowing the filing of</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">[559 U.S. 226]</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">posthearing submissions, see <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>476 U.S. 321, 324, 106 S. Ct. 1871, 90 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1986). Indeed, in <em>Henderson </em>we held that 295 days of delay resulting from the filing of a pretrial motion were automatically excludable, and we noted that \u201cCongress was aware of the breadth of the exclusion it was enacting.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 327, 106 S. Ct. 1871, 90 L. Ed. 2d 299.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary to protect the Act\u2019s \u201ctimeliness guarantee,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 210, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 67, is illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">For a similar reason, the Court\u2019s interpretation is not supported by the rule of construction that \u201c \u2018[a] specific provision\u2019. . . \u2018controls one[s] of more general application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 207, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 65. This rule applies only when specific and general statutory provisions conflict. <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gulf Power Co., </em>534 U.S. 327, 335-336, 122 S. Ct. 782, 151 L. Ed. 2d 794 (2002). Here, there is no conflict because, even if subparagraph (D) governs \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion,\u201d there is no basis for concluding that subparagraph (D) governs all \u201cpretrial motion-related delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">Contrary to the Court\u2019s claim, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>decision is not supported by \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. II), which excludes \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance\u201d provided that the trial court \u201csets forth, in the record of the case, ... its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d One might argue that a trial judge grants a \u201ccontinuance\u201d whenever the judge postpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the direct result of a proceeding that falls squarely within the language of subsection (h)(1) or one of the specific illustrative</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">[559 U.S. 227]</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">subparagraphs that follow. See \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) (\u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from a continuance\u201d). But such a reading would render subsection (h)(1) and subpara-graphs (A)-(H) meaningless if it were true that all continuances required ends-of-justice findings. The plain terms of subsection (h)(1) refute this interpretation and show that Congress intended for some periods of delay that postpone the trial date to be automatically excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Viewed in their proper context, subsection (h)(1) and its subparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) requiring ends-of-justice findings for continuances. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Aviles-Alvarez, </em>868 F.2d 1108, 1112 (CA9 1989) (noting that when pretrial motion delay is automatically excluded, the District Court \u201cdoes not have to make findings or consider any factors\u201d). A period of delay resulting from a continuance requires ends-of-justice findings only when it does not also fall within the subset of automatically ex-cludable delay defined by subsection (h)(1). When a period of delay resulting from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclusion, a court ordinarily should give effect to the more specific provisions of subsection (h)(1). See <em>Gozlon-Peretz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 395, 407, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919 (1991) (\u201cA specific provision controls one of more general application\u201d). Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 207-208, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">For the reasons discussed, see <em>supra, </em>at 218-219, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 71-72, the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial motions is a \u201cproceed-in[g] concerning the defendant\u201d within the meaning of subsection (h)(1). It may also qualify as a \u201ccontinuance\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) if the delay has the effect of pushing back the trial date. But a court should resolve the conflict by applying the more specific provision of subsection (h)(1). This result is faithful not only to the plain language of the statute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of exceptions to the general rule that continuances require ends-of-justice findings. And it also recognizes that when defense counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">[559 U.S. 228]</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">argues that adequate pretrial motions cannot be completed within the time allotted and is granted an extension, it will generally go without saying that the judge has considered whether the ends of justice will be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to recite this determination on the record will often be an empty exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">The Court does not believe that its interpretation will have serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by making the on-the-record findings required under \u00a7 3161(h)(7) (2006 ed., Supp. II), may exclude delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial motions. As this case illustrates, however, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>will be cases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges will fail to make those findings, and indictments will be dismissed for no good reason. If requiring findings on the record were cost and risk free, Congress would not have provided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category of delay encompassed by \u00a7 3161(h)(1) (2006 ed. and Supp. II).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation occurs because of delay caused by an extension requested by the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment without prejudice. But as we have recognized, even when a new indictment may be obtained, \u201csubstantial delay well may make reprosecution . . . unlikely.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>487 U.S. 326, 342, 108 S.

The Court hints that the defense\u2019s request for additional time might itself be a pretrial motion within the meaning of \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(D). Neither party relies on this theory. The Court of Appeals found that \u201cBloate never filed a pretrial motion.\u2019\u2019 534 F.3d, at 897.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b161-13\">. This much is clear from the Court\u2019s own language. The Court writes that \u201calthough the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case <em>results from a proceeding </em>governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that <em>such delay </em>may be automatically excluded.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 207, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 65 (emphasis added). Subpara-graph (D) does not speak of delay that results from a \u201cproceeding,\u2019\u2019 <em>ibid.; </em>subsection (h)( 1), however, does, see \u00a7 3161(h)(1) (2006 ed. and Supp. II).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-14\">.

The Court incorrectly states that the Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time for pretrial motions have found it necessary to \u201cimpos[e] extratextual limitations on excludability,\u201d namely, that the trial judge must expressly grant an extension of the time for the completion of pretrial motions. See <em>ante, </em>at 213, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 68. This requirement, however, springs from the language of subsection (h)(1), for it is the granting of the extension request that constitutes the \u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defendant\u201d that triggers the exclusion under subsection (h)(1).
