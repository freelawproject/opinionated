The question whether an arrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is different from and antecedent to the question whether it unreasonably restrains trade. This case raises that antecedent question about the business of the 32 teams in the National Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity that they formed to manage their intellectual property. We conclude that the NFL\u2019s licensing activities constitute concerted action that is not categorically beyond the coverage of \u00a7 1. The legality of that concerted action must be judged under the Rule of Reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">[560 U.S. 187]</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">Originally organized in 1920, the NFL is an unincorporated association that now includes 32 separately owned professional football teams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each team has its own name, colors, and logo, and owns related intellectual property. Like each of the other teams in the league, the New Orleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts, for example, have their own distinctive names, colors, and marks that are well known to millions of sports fans.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">Prior to 1963, the teams made their own arrangements for licensing their intellectual property and marketing trademarked items such as caps and jerseys. In 1963, the teams formed National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license, and market their intellectual property. Most, but not all, of the substantial revenues generated by NFLP have either been given to charity or shared equally among the teams. However, the teams are able to and have at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">Between 1963 and 2000, NFLP granted nonexclusive licenses to a number of vendors, permitting them to manufacture and sell apparel bearing team insignias. Petitioner, American Needle, Inc., was one of those licensees. In December 2000, the teams voted to authorize NFLP to grant exclusive licenses, and NFLP granted Reebok International Ltd. an exclusive 10-year license to manufacture and sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams. It thereafter declined to renew American Needle\u2019s nonexclusive license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">American Needle filed this action in the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the agreements between the NFL, its teams, NFLP, and Reebok violated \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. In their answer to the complaint, the defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">[560 U.S. 188]</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">averred that the teams, the NFL, and NFLP were incapable of conspiring within the meaning of \u00a7 1 \u201cbecause they are a single economic enterprise, at least with respect to the conduct challenged.\u201d App. 99. After limited discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment on the question \u201cwhether, with regard to the facet of their operations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>respecting exploitation of intellectual property rights, the NFL and its 32 teams are, in the jargon of antitrust law, acting as a single entity.\u201d <em>American Needle, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Orleans La. Saints, </em>496 F. Supp. 2d 941, 943 (2007). The court concluded \u201cthat in that facet of their operations they have so integrated their operations that they should be deemed a single entity rather than joint ventures cooperating for a common purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The panel observed that \u201cin some contexts, a league seems more aptly described as a single entity immune from antitrust scrutiny, while in others a league appears to be a joint venture between independently owned teams that is subject to review under \u00a7 1.\u201d 538 F.3d 736, 741 (2008). Relying on Circuit precedent, the court limited its inquiry to the particular conduct at issue, licensing of teams\u2019 intellectual property. The panel agreed with petitioner that \u201cwhen making a single-entity determination, courts must examine whether the conduct in question deprives the marketplace of the independent sources of economic control that competition assumes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 742. The court, however, discounted the significance of potential competition among the teams regarding the use of their intellectual property because the teams \u201ccan function only as one source of economic power when collectively producing NFL football.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 743. The court noted that football itself can only be carried out jointly. See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cAsserting that a single football team could produce a football game ... is a Zen riddle: Who wins when a football team plays itself\u201d). Moreover, \u201cNFL teams share a vital economic interest in collectively promoting</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">[560 U.S. 189]</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">NFL football . . . [to] compet[e] with other forms of entertainment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIt thus follows,\u201d the court found, \u201cthat only one source of economic power controls the promotion of NFL football,\u201d and \u201cit makes little sense to assert that each individual team has the authority, if not the responsibility, to promote the jointly produced NFL football.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Recognizing that NFL teams have \u201clicense [d] their intellectual property collectively\u201d since 1963, the court held that \u00a7 1 did not apply. <em>Id., </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 933, 129 S. Ct. 2859, 174 L. Ed. 2d 575 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">As the case comes to us, we have only a narrow issue to decide: whether the NFL respondents are capable of engaging in a \u201ccontract, combination ..., or conspiracy\u201d as defined by \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, or, as we have sometimes phrased it, whether the alleged activity by the NFL respondents \u201cmust be viewed as that of a single enterprise for purposes of \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Copperweld Corp. </em>v. <em>Independence Tube Corp., </em>467 U.S. 752, 771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Taken literally, the applicability of \u00a7 1 to \u201cevery contract, combination .. . , or conspiracy\u201d could be understood to cover every conceivable agreement, whether it be a group of competing firms fixing prices or a single firm\u2019s chief executive telling her subordinate how to price their company\u2019s product. But  even though, \u201cread literally,\u201d \u00a7 1 would address \u201cthe entire body of private contract,\u201d that is not what the statute means. <em>National Soc. of Professional Engineers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 688, 98 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978); see also <em>Texaco Inc. </em>v. <em>Dagher, </em>547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (\u201cThis Court has not taken a literal approach to this language\u201d); cf. <em>Board of Trade of Chicago </em>v. <em>United States, </em>246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918) (reasoning that the term \u201crestraint of trade\u201d in \u00a7 1 cannot possibly refer to any restraint on competition because \u201c[e]very agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence\u201d). Not every instance</p>\n<p id=\"amtj-dedup-2\">[560 U.S. 190]</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">of cooperation between two people is a potential \u201ccontract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The meaning of the term \u201ccontract, combination . . . , or conspiracy\u201d is informed by the \u201c \u2018basic distinction\u2019 \u201d in the Sherman Act \u201c \u2018between concerted and independent action\u2019 \u201d that distinguishes \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act from \u00a7 2. <em>Copperweld, </em>467 U.S., at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (quoting <em>Monsanto Co. </em>v. <em>Spray-Rite Service Corp., </em>465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984)). Section 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains trade. Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and independent action, but only if that action \u201cmonopolize [s],\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, or \u201cthreatens actual monopolization,\u201d <em>Copperweld, </em>467 U.S., at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, a category that is narrower than restraint of trade. Monopoly power may be equally harmful whether it is the product of joint action or individual action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Congress used this distinction between concerted and independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and compensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competition through ordinary business operations. The distinction also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal business decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Thus,  in \u00a7 1 Congress \u201ctreated concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. This is so because unlike independent action, \u201c[c]oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk\u201d insofar as it \u201cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of decision-making that competition assumes and <em>demands.\u201dId., </em>at 768-769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. And because concerted action is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct. As a result, there is less risk of deterring a firm\u2019s necessary conduct; courts need only examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may be remedied simply through prohibition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">[560 U.S. 191]</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">\u00b6 1464c, at 206. Concerted activity is thus \u201cjudged more sternly than unilateral activity under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>\u00a72,\u201d <em>Copperweld, </em>467 U.S., at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. For these reasons, \u00a7 1 prohibits any concerted action \u201cin restraint of trade or commerce,\u201d even if the action does not \u201cthreate[n] monopolization,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>And therefore, an arrangement must embody concerted action in order to be a \u201ccontract, combination . . . , or conspiracy\u201d under \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">We have long held that  concerted action under \u00a7 1 does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities. Instead, we have eschewed such formalistic distinctions in favor of a functional consideration of how the parties involved in the alleged anticompetitive conduct actually operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">As a result, we have repeatedly found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated \u00a7 1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sealy, Inc., </em>388 U.S. 350, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967), for example, a group of mattress manufacturers operated and controlled Sealy, Inc., a company that licensed the Sealy trademark to the manufacturers, and dictated that each operate within a specific geographic area. <em>Id., </em>at 352-353, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. The Government alleged that the licensees and Sealy were conspiring in violation of \u00a7 1, and we agreed. <em>Id., </em>at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. We explained that \u201c[w]e seek the central substance of the situation\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">[560 U.S. 192]</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">therefore \u201cwe are moved by the identity of the persons who act, rather than the label of their hats.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 353, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. We thus held that Sealy was not a \u201cseparate entity, but ... an instrumentality of the individual manufacturers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 356, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. In similar circumstances, we have found other formally distinct business organizations covered by \u00a7 1. See, <em>e.g., Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co., </em>472 U.S. 284, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985); <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., </em>468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984) <em>(NCAA); United States </em>v. <em>Topco Associates, Inc., </em>405 U.S. 596, 609, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 <em>(1972); Associated Press </em>v. <em>United States, </em>326 U.S. 1, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945); <em>id., </em>at 26, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Terminal Railroad Assn. of St. Louis, </em>224 U.S. 383, 32 S. Ct. 507, 56 L. Ed. 810 (1912); see also Rock, Corporate Law Through an Antitrust Lens, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 497, 506-510 (1992) (discussing cases). We have similarly looked past the form of a legally \u201csingle entity\u201d when competitors were part of professional organization<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or trade groups.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Conversely,  there is not necessarily concerted action simply because more than one legally distinct entity is involved. Although, under a now-defunct doctrine known as the \u201cintraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,\u201d we once treated cooperation between legally separate entities as necessarily covered by \u00a7 1, we now embark on a more functional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">The roots of this functional analysis can be found in the very decision that established the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., </em>332 U.S. 218, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010 (1947), we observed that \u201ccorporate interrelationships . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">[560 U.S. 193]</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act\u201d because the Act \u201cis aimed at substance rather than form.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 227, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010. We nonetheless held that cooperation between legally separate entities was necessarily covered by \u00a7 1 because an unreasonable restraint of trade \u201cmay result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Kiefer-Stewart Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 211, 215, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 L. Ed. 219 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">The decline of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine began in <em>Sunkist Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Products Co., </em>370 U.S. 19, 82 S. Ct. 1130, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1962). In that case, several agricultural cooperatives that were owned by the same farmers were sued for violations of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. <em>Id., </em>at 24-25, 82 S. Ct. 1130, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305. Applying a specific immunity provision for agricultural cooperatives, we held that the three cooperatives were \u201cin practical effect\u201d one \u201corganization,\u201d even though the controlling farmers \u201chave formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 29, 82 S. Ct. 1130, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305. \u201cTo hold otherwise,\u201d we explained, \u201cwould be to impose grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions that are of <em>de minimis </em>meaning and effect\u201d insofar as \u201cuse of separate corporations had [no] economic significance.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Next, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank, </em>422 U.S. 86, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1975), a large bank, Citizens and Southern (C&amp;S), formed a holding company that operated <em>de facto </em>suburban branch banks in the Atlanta area through ownership of the maximum amount of stock in each local branch that was allowed by law, \u201cownership of much of the remaining stock by parties friendly to C, use by the suburban banks of the C logogram and all of C\u2019s banking services, and close C oversight of the operation and governance of the suburban banks.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 89, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41 (footnote omitted). The Government challenged the cooperation between the banks. In our analysis, we observed that \u201c \u2018corporate interrelationships</p>\n<p id=\"Ac3C\">[560 U.S. 194]</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">. . . are not determinative,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 116, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, \u201clooked to economic substance,\u201d and observed that \u201cbecause the sponsored banks were not set up to be competitors, \u00a7 1 did not compel them to compete.\u201d Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \u00b61463g, at 200-201; see also <em>Citizens &amp; Southern, </em>422 U.S., at 119-120, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41; Areeda, In-traenterprise Conspiracy in Decline, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 451, 461 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">We finally reexamined the intraen-terprise conspiracy doctrine in <em>Copperweld Corp. </em>v. <em>Independence Tube </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number><em>Corp., </em>467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984), and concluded that it was inconsistent with the \u201c \u2018basic distinction between concerted and independent action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. Considering it \u201cperfectly plain that  an internal agreement to implement a single, unitary firm\u2019s policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that \u00a7 1 was designed to police,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, we held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary \u201care incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 777, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. We explained that although a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are \u201cseparate\u201d for the purposes of incorporation or formal title, they are controlled by a single center of deci-sionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power. Joint conduct by two such entities does not \u201cdepriv[e] the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, and as a result, an agreement between them does not constitute a \u201ccontract, combination . . . , or conspiracy\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">[560 U.S. 195]</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">As <em>Copperweld </em>exemplifies,  \u201csubstance, not form, should determine whether a[n] . . . entity is capable of conspiring under \u00a7 1.\u201d 467 U.S., at 773, n. 21, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. This inquiry is sometimes described as asking whether the alleged conspirators are a single entity. That is perhaps a misdescription, however, because the question is not whether the defendant is a legally single entity or has a single name; nor is the question whether the parties involved \u201cseem\u201d like one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The key is whether the alleged \u201ccontract, combination ... , or conspiracy\u201d is concerted action\u2014that is, whether it joins together separate de-cisionmakers. The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether there is a \u201ccontract, combination ... , or conspiracy\u201d amongst \u201cseparate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L.

To a firm making hats, the Saints and the Colts are two potentially competing suppliers of valuable trademarks. When each NFL team licenses its intellectual property, it is not pursuing the \u201ccommon interests of the whole\u201d league but is instead pursuing interests of each \u201ccorporation itself,\u201d <em>Copperweld, </em>467 U.S., at 770, 104 S.

Decisions by NFL teams to license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that \u201cdepriv[e] the marketplace of independent centers of deci-sionmaking,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and therefore of actual or potential competition. See <em>NCAA, </em>468 U.S., at 109, n. 39, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L.

But it is not dispositive that the teams have organized and own a legally separate entity that centralizes the management of their intellectual property.  An ongoing \u00a7 1 violation cannot evade \u00a7 1 scrutiny simply by giving the ongoing violation a name and label. \u201cPerhaps every agreement and combination in restraint of trade could be so labeled.\u201d <em>Timken Roller Bearing Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 593, 598, 71 S.

Although NFL teams have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned. See generally Hovenkamp, Exclusive Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev. 1, 52-61 (1995); Shishido, Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Duties in the Operation of a Joint Venture, 39 Hastings L. J. 63, 69-81 (1987). Common interests in the NFL brand <em>\u201cpartially </em>unit[e] the economic interests of the parent firms,\u201d Broadley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1521, 1526 (1982) (emphasis added), but the teams still have distinct, potentially competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">It may be, as respondents argue, that NFLP \u201chas served as the \u2018single driver\u2019 \u201d of the teams\u2019 \u201cpromotional vehicle, \u2018pursuing] the common interests of the whole.\u2019 \u201d Brief for NFL Respondents 28 (quoting <em>Copperweld, </em>467 U.S., at 770-771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628; brackets in original). But illegal restraints often are in the common interests of the parties to the restraint, at the expense of those who are not parties. It is true, as respondents describe, that they have for some time marketed their trademarks jointly. But  a history of concerted activity does not immunize conduct from \u00a7 1 scrutiny. \u201cAbsence of actual competition may simply be a manifestation of the anticompetitive agreement itself.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>322 F.3d, at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Respondents argue that nonetheless, as the Court of Appeals held, they constitute a single entity because without their cooperation, there would be no NFL football. It is true that \u201cthe clubs that make up a professional sports league are not completely independent economic competitors, as they depend upon a degree of cooperation for economic survival.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>518 U.S., at 248, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521. But the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">[560 U.S. 199]</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">The justification for cooperation is not relevant to whether that coop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>eration is concerted or independent action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201ccontract, combination . . . , or conspiracy,\u201d \u00a7 1, that is necessary or useful to a joint venture is still a \u201ccontract, combination . . . , or conspiracy\u201d if it \u201cdeprives the marketplace of independent centers of deci-sionmaking,\u201d <em>Copperweld, </em>467 U.S., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. See NCAA, 468 U.S., at 113, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (\u201c[J]oint ventures have no immunity from antitrust laws\u201d). Any joint venture involves multiple sources of economic power cooperating to produce a product. And for many such ventures, the participation of others is necessary. But that does not mean that necessity of cooperation transforms concerted action into independent action; a nut and a bolt can only operate together, but an agreement between nut and bolt manufacturers is still subject to \u00a7 1 analysis. Nor does it mean that once a group of firms agree to produce a joint product, cooperation amongst those firms must be treated as independent conduct. The mere fact that the teams operate jointly in some sense does not mean that they are immune.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">[560 U.S. 200]</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The question whether NFLP decisions can constitute concerted activity covered by \u00a7 1 is closer than whether decisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by \u00a7 1. This is so both because NFLP is a separate corporation with its own management and because the record indicates that most of the revenues generated by NFLP are shared by the teams on an equal basis. Nevertheless we think it clear that for the same reasons the 32 teams\u2019 conduct is covered by \u00a7 1, NFLP\u2019s actions also are subject to \u00a7 1, at least with regards to its marketing of property owned by the separate teams. NFLP\u2019s licensing decisions are made by the 32 potential competitors, and each of them actually owns its share of the jointly managed assets. Cf. <em>Sealy, </em>388 U.S., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. Apart from their agreement to cooperate in exploiting those assets, including their decisions as the NFLP, there would be nothing to prevent each of the teams from making its own market decisions relating to purchases of apparel and headwear, to the sale of such items, and to the granting of licenses to use its trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">We generally treat agreements within a single firm as independent action on the presumption that the components of the firm will act to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>maximize the firm\u2019s profits. But in rare cases, that presumption does not hold. Agreements made within a firm can constitute concerted action covered by \u00a7 1 when the parties to the agreement act on interests separate from those of the firm itself,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the intrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for ongoing concerted action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">[560 U.S. 201]</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">See, <em>e.g., Topco Associates, Inc., </em>405 U.S., at 609, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515; <em>Sealy, </em>388 U.S., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">For that reason, decisions by NFLP regarding the teams\u2019 separately owned intellectual property constitute concerted action. Thirty-two teams operating independently through the vehicle of NFLP are not like the components of a single firm that act to maximize the firm\u2019s profits. The teams remain separately controlled, potential competitors with economic interests that are distinct from NFLP\u2019s financial well-being. See generally Hovenkamp, 1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev., at 52-61. Unlike typical decisions by corporate shareholders, NFLP licensing decisions effectively require the assent of more than a mere majority of shareholders. And each team\u2019s decision reflects not only an interest in NFLP\u2019s profits but also an interest in the team\u2019s individual profits. See generally Shusido, 39 Hastings L. J., at 69-71. The 32 teams capture individual economic benefits separate and apart from NFLP profits as a result of the decisions they make for NFLP. NFLP\u2019s decisions thus affect each team\u2019s profits from licensing its own intellectual property. \u201cAlthough the business interests of\u2019 the teams \u201cwill <em>often </em>coincide with those of\u2019 NFLP \u201cas an entity in itself, that commonality of interest exists in every cartel.\u201d <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>NFL, </em>726 F.2d 1381, 1389 (CA9 1984) (emphasis added). In making the relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is therefore \u201can instrumentality\u201d of the teams. <em>Sealy, </em>388 U.S., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238; see also <em>Topco Associates, Inc., </em>405 U.S., at 609, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">If the fact that potential competitors shared in profits or losses from a venture meant that the venture was immune from \u00a7 1, then any cartel \u201ccould evade the antitrust laws simply by creating a joint venture\u2019 to serve as the exclusive seller of their competing products.\u201d <em>Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Salvino, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 290, 335 (CA2 2008) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment). \u201cSo long as no agreement,\u201d other than one made by the cartelists sitting</p>\n<p id=\"auph-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 202]</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">on the board of the joint venture, \u201cexplicitly listed the prices to be charged, the companies could act as monopolies through the joint venture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(Indeed, a joint venture with a single management structure is generally a better way to operate a cartel because it decreases the risks of a party to an illegal agreement defecting from that agreement.) However,  competitors \u201ccannot simply get around\u201d antitrust liability by acting \u201cthrough a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>third-party intermediary or \u2018joint venture\u2019.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 336.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law. \u201c[T]he special characteristics of this industry may provide a justification\u201d for many kinds of agreements. <em>Brown, </em>518 U.S., at 252, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The fact that NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions. But the conduct at issue in this case is still concerted</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">[560 U.S. 203]</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">activity under the Sherman Act that is subject to \u00a7 1 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">When \u201crestraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,\u201d <em>per se </em>rules of illegality are inapplicable, and instead the restraint must be judged according to the flexible Rule of Reason.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>NCAA, </em>468 U.S., at 101, 104 S.

Ed. 2d 70 (1984) (holding that NCAA restrictions on televising college football games are subject to Rule of Reason analysis for the \u201ccritical\u201d reason that \u201chorizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">. In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged conduct was necessary at all. Although two teams are needed to play a football game, not all aspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are necessary to produce a game. Moreover, even if leaguewide agreements are necessary to produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity in marketing intellectual property is necessary to produce football.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity for conduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning that coordinated team trademark sales are necessary to produce \u201cNFL football,\u201d a single NFL brand that competes against other forms of entertainment. But defining the product as \u201cNFL football\u201d puts the cart before the horse: Of course the NFL produces NFL football; but that does not mean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from \u00a7 1 scrutiny. Members of any cartel could insist that their cooperation is necessary to produce the \u201ccartel product\u201d and compete with other products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">.

For the purposes of resolving this case, there is no need to pass upon the Government\u2019s position that entities are incapable of conspiring under \u00a7 1 if they \u201chave effectively merged the relevant aspect of their operations, thereby eliminating actual and potential competition ... in that operational sphere\u2019\u2019 and \u201cthe challenged restraint [does] not significantly affect actual or potential competition . . . outside their merged operations.\u2019\u2019 Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>17. The Government urges that the choices \u201cto offer only a blanket license\u2019\u2019 and \u201cto have only a single headwear licensee\u2019\u2019 might not constitute concerted action under its test. <em>Id., </em>at 32. However, because the teams still own their own trademarks and are free to market those trademarks as they see fit, even those two choices were agreements amongst potential competitors and would constitute concerted action under the Government\u2019s own standard. At any point, the teams could decide to license their own trademarks. It is significant, moreover, that the teams here control NFLP. The two choices that the Government might treat as independent action, although nominally made by NFLP, are for all functional purposes choices made by the 32 entities with potentially competing interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">. Justice Brand\u00e9is provided the classic formulation of the Rule of Reason in <em>Board of Trade of Chicago </em>v. <em>United States, </em>246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918):</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">\u201cThe true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">See also <em>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>PSKS, Inc., </em>551 U.S. 877, 885-887, 127 S.
