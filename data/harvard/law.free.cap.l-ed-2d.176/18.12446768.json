In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a copyright holder\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright infringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim that does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The Constitution grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . . their . . . Writings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. Exercising this power, Congress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the existence and scope of \u201c[c]opyright protection\u201d for \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) (2006 ed.). This scheme gives copyright owners \u201cthe exclusive rights\u201d (with specified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or publicly perform their works. \u00a7 106. \u201cAnyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided\u201d in the Act \u201cis an infringer of the copyright.\u201d \u00a7 501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright owner \u201cis entitled, <em>subject to the requirements of section 411, </em>to institute an action\u201d for copyright infringement. \u00a7 501(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>This case concerns \u201cthe requirements of section 411\u201d to which \u00a7 501(b) refers.  Section 411(a) provides, <em>inter alia </em>and with certain exceptions, that \u201cno civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright</p>\n<p id=\"A91\">[559 U.S. 158]</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">claim has been made in accordance with this title.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision is part of the Act\u2019s remedial scheme.  It establishes a condition\u2014copyright registration\u2014that plaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringement claim and invoking the Act\u2019s remedial provisions. We address whether \u00a7 411(a) also deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The relevant proceedings in this case began after we issued our opinion in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Tasini, </em>533 U.S. 483, 121 S. Ct. 2381, 150 L. Ed. 2d 500 (2001). In <em>Tasini, </em>we agreed with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of online databases and print publishers had infringed the copyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the authors\u2019 works electronically without first securing their permission. See <em>id., </em>at 493, 121 S. Ct. 2381, 150 L. Ed. 2d 500. In so holding, we affirmed the principal theory of liability underlying copyright infringement suits that other freelance authors had filed after the Court of Appeals had issued its opinion in <em>Tasini. </em>These other suits, which were stayed pending our decision in <em>Tasini, </em>resumed after we issued our opinion and were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The consolidated complaint alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine, that they had registered in accordance with \u00a7 411(a). The class, however, included both authors who had registered their copyrighted works and authors who had not. See App. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Because of the growing size and complexity of the lawsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation. For</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">[559 U.S. 159]</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">more than three years, the freelance authors, the publishers (and their insurers), and the electronic databases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March 2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the parties intended \u201cto achieve a global peace in the publishing industry.\u201d <em>In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases Copyright Litigation, </em>509 F.3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">The parties moved the District Court to certify a class for settlement and to approve the settlement agreement. Ten freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (hereinafter Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court overruled the objections; certified a settlement class of freelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final judgment. At no time did the Muchnick respondents or any other party urge the District Court to dismiss the case, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>to refuse to certify the class or approve the settlement, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their objections to the settlement on procedural and substantive grounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Appeals <em>sua sponte </em>ordered briefing on the question whether \u00a7 411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights. All parties filed briefs asserting that the District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve the settlement agreement even though it included unregistered works.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F.3d, at 121 (citing <em>Well-Made Toy Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Goffa Int\u2019l Corp., </em>354 F.3d 112, 114-115 (CA2 2003); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Business Concepts, Inc., </em>259 F.3d 65, 72-73 (CA2 2001)), the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the infringement of unregistered works, and also lacked jurisdiction to approve a settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">[559 U.S. 160]</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">with respect to those claims, 509 F.3d, at 121 (citing \u201cwidespread agreement among the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Judge Walker dissented. He concluded \u201cthat \u00a7 411(a) is more like the [nonjurisdictional] employee-num-erosity requirement in <em>Arbaugh </em>[v. <em>Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006),]\u201d than the jurisdictional statutory time limit in <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007). 509 F.3d, at 129. Accordingly, he reasoned that \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement does not limit federal subject-matter jurisdiction over infringement suits involving unregistered works. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">We granted the owners\u2019 and publishers\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari, and formulated the question presented to ask whether \u00a7 411(a) restricts the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts over copyright infringement actions. 555 U.S. 1211, 129 S. Ct. 1523, 173 L. Ed. 2d 655 (2009). Because no party supports the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdictional holding, we appointed an <em>amicus curiae </em>to defend the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 556 U.S. 1161, 129 S. Ct. 1693, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1053 (2009). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">\u201cJurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201ca court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004). Accordingly, the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d properly applies only to \u201cprescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">[559 U.S. 161]</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">and the persons (personal jurisdiction)\u201d implicating that authority. <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (\u201csubject-matter jurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201cthe courts\u2019 statutory or constitutional <em>power </em>to adjudicate the case\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Landgraf v. USI Film, Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 274, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994) (\u201c[J]u-risdictional statutes \u2018speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Republic Nat. Bank of Miami </em>v. <em>United States, </em>506 U.S. 80, 100, 113 S. Ct. 554, 121 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring))).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">While perhaps clear in theory, the distinction between jurisdictional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in practice. Courts\u2014 including this Court\u2014have sometimes mischaracterized claim-processing rules or elements of a cause of action as jurisdictional limitations, particularly when that characterization was not central to the case, and thus did not require close analysis. <em>See Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 511-512, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (citing examples); <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U.S., at 91, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (same). Our recent cases evince a marked desire to curtail such \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings,\u201d <em>ibid,., </em>which too easily can miss the \u201ccritical difference [s]\u201d between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional limitations on causes of action, <em>Kontrick, supra, </em>at 456, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867; see also <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In light of the important distinctions between jurisdictional prescriptions and claim-processing rules, see, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 514, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097, we have encouraged federal courts and litigants to \u201cfacili-tat[e]\u201d clarity by using the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d only when it is apposite, <em>Kontrick, supra, </em>at 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867. In <em>Arbaugh, </em>we described the general approach to distinguish \u201cjurisdictional\u201d conditions from claim-processing requirements or elements of a claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue. But when Congress</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">[559 U.S. 162]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtF\">does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d 546 U.S., at 515-516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (citation and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The plaintiff in <em>Arbaugh </em>brought a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer ... to discriminate,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>on the basis of sex. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). But employees can bring Title VII claims only against employers that have \u201cfifteen or more employees.\u201d \u00a7 2000e(b). <em>Arbaugh </em>addressed whether that employee numerosity requirement \u201caffects federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or, instead, delineates a substantive ingredient of a Title VII claim for relief.\u201d 546 U.S., at 503, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. We held that it does the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Our holding turned principally on our examination of the text of \u00a7 2000e(b), the section in which Title VIPs numerosity requirement appears. Section 2000e(b) does not \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the employee nu-merosity threshold on Title VIPs scope \u201ccount[s] as jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 515-516, and n. 11, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. And nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>our prior Title VII cases compelled the conclusion that even though the numerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it nonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See <em>id., </em>at 511-513, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. Similarly, \u00a7 2000e(b)\u2019s text and structure did not demonstrate that Congress \u201crank[ed]\u201d that requirement as jurisdictional. See <em>id., </em>at 513-516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. As we observed, the employee numerosity requirement is located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from \u00a7 2000e\u20145(f)(3), Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction-granting section, distinguishing it from the \u201camount-in-controversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter jurisdiction in . . . diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\u201d <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 514-515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. Accordingly, the numerosity requirement could not fairly be read to \u201c \u2018speak in jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (quoting <em>Zipes </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 394, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982)). We thus \u201crefrain [ed] from\u201d construing the numer-osity</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">[559 U.S. 163]</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">requirement to \u201cconstric[t] \u00a7 1331 or Title VII\u2019s jurisdictional provision.\u201d <em>Arbaugh, supra, </em>at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">We now apply this same approach to \u00a7 411(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Section 411(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\u201cExcept for an action brought for a violation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a), and subject to the provisions of subsection (b), no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title. In any case, however, where the deposit, application, and fee required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may, at his or her option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service, but the Register\u2019s failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">We must consider whether \u00a7 411(a) \u201cclearly states\u201d that its registration requirement is \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d <em>Arbaugh, supra, </em>at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097. It does not. <em>Am-icus </em>disagrees, pointing to the presence of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the last sentence of \u00a7 411(a) and contending that the use of the term there indicates the jurisdictional cast of \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s first sentence as well. Brief for Court-Appointed <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in Support of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter <em>Amicus </em>Brief). But this reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d cannot bear the weight that <em>amicus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">[559 U.S. 164]</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">places upon it. The sentence upon which <em>amicus </em>relies states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">\u201cThe Register [of Copyrights] may, at his or her option, become a party to the [copyright infringement] action with respect to <em>the issue of registrability of the copyright claim </em>by entering an appearance within sixty days after such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>service, but the Register\u2019s failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine <em>that issue.\u201d </em>\u00a7 411(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Congress added this sentence to the Act in 1976, 90 Stat. 2583, to clarify that  a federal court can determine \u201cthe issue of registrability of the copyright claim\u201d even if the Register does not appear in the infringement suit. That clarification was necessary because courts had interpreted \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s precursor provision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which imposed a similar registration requirement, as prohibiting copyright owners who had been <em>refused </em>registration by the Register of Copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners <em>first </em>sought mandamus against the Register. See <em>Vacheron &amp; Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. </em>v. <em>Benrus Watch Co., </em>260 F.2d 637, 640-641 (CA2 1958) (construing \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear that  a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to determine <em>\u201cthat </em>issue,\u201d \u00a7 411(a) (emphasis <em>added)\u2014i.e., </em>the issue of <em>regis-</em>trability\u2014regardless of whether the Register is a party to the <em>infringement </em>suit. The word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d as used here, thus says nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Moreover, \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title VII\u2019s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See <em>Arbaugli, supra, </em>at 514-515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.  Federal district courts have subject-matter</p>\n<p id=\"A9K\">[559 U.S. 165]</p>\n<p id=\"As\">jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1338. But neither \u00a7 1331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over questions of federal law, nor \u00a7 1338(a), which is specific to copyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on whether copyright holders have registered their works before suing for infringement. Cf. <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (\u201cTitle VIPs jurisdictional provision\u201d does not \u201cspecifiy] any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\u2019s monetary floor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbaugh, supra, </em>at 515, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (quoting <em>Zipes, </em>455 U.S., at 394, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234). First, and most significantly,  \u00a7 411(a) expressly <em>allows </em>courts to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works in three circumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where the infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and integrity under \u00a7 106A, or where the holder attempted to register the work and registration was refused. Separately, \u00a7 411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement actions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the author \u201cdeclare [s] an intention to secure copyright in the work\u201d and \u201cmakes registration for the work, if required by subsection (a), within three months after [the work\u2019s] first transmission.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 411(c)( 1)\u2014(2).

See 455 U.S., at 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) (establishing specific time periods within which a discrimination claimant must file a lawsuit after filing a charge with the EEOC).  A statutory condition that requires a party to take some action before filing a lawsuit is not automatically \u201ca <em>jurisdictional </em>prerequisite to suit.\u201d <em>Zipes, </em>455 U.S., at 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional analysis must focus on the \u201clegal character\u201d of the requirement, <em>id., </em>at 395, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234, which we discerned by looking to the condition\u2019s text, context, and relevant historical treatment, <em>id., </em>at 393-395, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234; see also <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 119-121, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). We similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types of threshold requirements that claimants must complete, or exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The registration requirement in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) fits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to filing a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is not located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions. See \u00a7\u00a7 411(a)-(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of precondition to suit that supports nonjuris-dictional treatment under our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">[559 U.S. 167]</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\"><em>Amicus </em>insists that our decision in <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach today. <em>Amicus </em>cites <em>Bowles </em>for the proposition that where Congress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as jurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such if that is how the condition consistently has been interpreted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpretation. <em>Amicus </em>Brief 26. Specifically, <em>amicus </em>relies on a footnote in <em>Bowles </em>to argue that here, as in <em>Bowles, </em>it would be improper to characterize the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>condition as nonjurisdictional because doing so would override \u201c \u2018a century\u2019s worth of precedent\u2019 \u201d treating \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement as jurisdictional. <em>Amicus </em>Brief 26 (quoting <em>Bowles, supra, </em>at 209, n. 2, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96). This argument focuses on the result in <em>Bowles, </em>rather than on the analysis we employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><em>Bowles </em>did not hold that any statutory condition devoid of an express jurisdictional label should be treated as jurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as such. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions imposing a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather,</p>\n<p id=\"Aji\">[559 U.S. 168]</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Bowles </em>stands for the proposition that  context, including this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>Bowles, </em>we considered 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107, which requires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which \u201ccarries \u00a7 2107 into practice.\u201d 551 U.S., at 208, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96. After analyzing \u00a7 2107\u2019s specific language and this Court\u2019s historical treatment of the type of limitation \u00a72107 imposes <em>(i.e., </em>statutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that Congress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdictional. Our focus in <em>Bowles </em>on the historical treatment of statutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consistent with <em>the Arbaugh </em>framework. Indeed, <em>Bowles </em>emphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions as jurisdictional, including in statutes <em>other </em>than \u00a7 2107, and specifically in statutes that predated the creation of the courts of appeals. See 551 U.S., at 209-210, and n. 2, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\"><em>Bowles </em>therefore demonstrates that the relevant question here is not (as <em>amicus </em>puts it) whether \u00a7 411(a) itself has long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type of limitation that \u00a7 411(a) imposes is one that is properly ranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation. The statutory limitation in <em>Bowles </em>was of a type that we had long held <em>did </em>\u201cspeak in jurisdictional terms\u201d even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>absent a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d label, and nothing about \u00a7 2107\u2019s text or context, or the historical treatment of that type of limitation, justified a departure from this view. That was not the case, however, for the types of conditions in <em>Zipes </em>and <em>Arbaugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">[559 U.S. 169]</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that  \u00a7 411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts. Although \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s historical treatment as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is a factor in the analysis, it is not dispositive. The other factors discussed above demonstrate that \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is more analogous to the non-jurisdictional conditions we considered in <em>Zipes and Arbaugh </em>than to the statutory time limit at issue in <em>Bowles.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We thus conclude that \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding its prior jurisdictional treatment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\"><em>Amicus </em>argues that even if \u00a7 411(a) is nonjurisdictional, we should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment vacating the District Court\u2019s order approving the settlement and dismissing the case. According to <em>amicus, </em>petitioners asserted previously in these proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdictional, and this assertion should estop them from now asserting a right to waive objections to the authors\u2019 failure to register. <em>Amicus </em>urges us to prevent the parties \u201cfrom \u2018playing fast and loose with the courts\u2019 by \u2018deliberately changing positions according</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">[559 U.S. 170]</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">to the exigencies of the moment.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Amicus </em>Brief 58 (quoting <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750, 121 S.

But we decline to apply judicial estoppel. As we explained in <em>New Hampshire, </em> that doctrine typically applies when, among other things, a \u201cparty has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons. First, the parties made their prior statements when negotiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not fault the parties\u2019 lawyers for invoking in the negotiations binding Circuit precedent that supported their clients\u2019 positions. Perhaps more impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tantly, in approving the settlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when the Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether \u00a7 411(a) restricted the District Court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of Appeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 3a-5a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners\u2019 arguments here thus cannot create \u201cinconsistent court determinations\u201d in their favor. <em>New Hampshire, supra, </em>at 751, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L.

Ed. 2d 96 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Bowles </em>mentioned <em>Arbaugh </em>only to distinguish it as involving a statute setting \u201can employee-numerosity requirement, not a time limit.\u201d 551 U.S., at 211, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96. Section 2107\u2019s time limits were \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d <em>Bowles </em>explained,</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">[559 U.S. 173]</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">because they were contained in a statute, not merely a rule, <em>id., </em>at 210-213, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96, and because \u201c[tjhis Court ha[d] long held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 209, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96. Fidelity to <em>Arbaugh </em>and similarly reasoned decisions,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the dissent in <em>Bowles </em>observed, would have yielded the conclusion that statutory time limits \u201care only jurisdictional if Congress says so.\u201d 551 U.S., at 217, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (opinion of Souter, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\"><em>Bowles </em>and <em>Arbaugh </em>can be reconciled without distorting either decision, however, on the ground that <em>Bowles </em>\u201crel[ied] on a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress.\u201d <em>Union Pacific R. Co. </em>v. <em>Locomotive Engineers, </em>558 U.S. 67, 82, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2009) (citing <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S., at 209-211, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96). The same is true of our decision, subsequent to <em>Bowles, </em>in <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 130, 128 S. Ct. 750, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008). There the Court concluded, largely on <em>stare decisis </em>grounds, that the Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires <em>sua sponte </em>consideration of a lawsuit\u2019s timeliness. <em>Id., </em>at 136, 128 S. Ct. 750, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (\u201c[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that this Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn, its earlier precedent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Plainly read, <em>Arbaugh </em>and <em>Bowles </em>both point to the conclusion that \u00a7 411(a) is nonjurisdictional. Section 411(a) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d <em>Zipes, </em>455 U.S., at 394, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234. Arbaugh\u2019s \u201creadily administrable bright line\u201d is therefore controlling. 546 U.S., at 516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Bowles </em>does not detract from that determination. <em>Amicus, </em>reading <em>Bowles </em>as I do, urges on its authority that we hold \u00a7 411(a) jurisdictional lest we disregard \u201c \u2018a century\u2019s worth of precedent.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Court-Appointed <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in Support of Judgment Below 26 (quoting <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S., at 209, n. 2, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96); see <em>ante, </em>at 167, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 31. But in <em>Bowles </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">[559 U.S. 174]</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\"><em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>as just explained, we relied on longstanding decisions of <em>this Court </em>typing the relevant prescriptions \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d <em>Bowles, </em>551 U.S., at 209-210, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (citing, <em>inter alia, Scarborough </em>v. <em>Pargoud, </em>108 U.S. 567, 2 S. Ct. 877, 27 L.

Ed. 2d 591. <em>Amicus </em>cites well over 200 opinions that characterize \u00a7 411(a) as jurisdictional, but not one is from this Court, and most are \u201c \u2018drive-by jurisdictional rulings\u2019 that should be accorded \u2018no precedential effect,\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S., at 511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (quoting <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 91, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L.
