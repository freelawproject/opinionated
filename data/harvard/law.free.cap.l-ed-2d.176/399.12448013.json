For this reason and because of the decision\u2019s important practical implications, I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-27\">At the time of the events at issue, petitioner, Kathryn Nurre, was a high school senior and a member of her school\u2019s wind ensemble. In keeping with a school tradition, the school\u2019s band director told the seniors in the ensemble that they could select a piece from their musical repertoire to be performed during their graduation ceremony. The 2006 graduates, including petitioner, chose Franz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Biebl\u2019s \u201cAve Maria,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a piece that they had previously performed and that \u201cthey believed showcased their talent and the culmination of their instrumental work.\u201d 580 F.3d 1087, 1091 (CA9 2009). At the prior year\u2019s graduation ceremony, the student choir had performed \u201c \u2018Up Above My Head,\u2019 a vocal piece which included express references to \u2018God,\u2019 \u2018heaven,\u2019 and \u2018angels,\u2019 \u201d and the school district claimed that this had resulted in \u201ccomplaints from graduation attendees\u201d and at least one angry letter to the editor of a local newspaper. <em>Ibid.; id., </em>at 1101 (M. Smith, J., dissenting in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting lyrics); see also Brief in Opposition 7, and n. 28. Fearful that the performance of Biebl\u2019s \u201cAve Maria\u201d would cause a similar reaction, even though the performance would not include the lyrics of the piece, school district officials vetoed the ensemble members\u2019 choice \u201cbecause the title and meaning of the piece had religious connotations\u2014and would be easily identified as such by attendees merely by the title alone.\u201d 580 F.3d, at 1091. The associate superintendant sent an e-mail to all the principals in the district instructing them that \u201cmusical selections for all graduations within the District should be purely secular in nature.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>As a result of the district\u2019s decision, the members of the wind ensemble \u201creluctantly elected to perform the fourth movement of Gustav Holst\u2019s \u2018Second Suite in F for Military Band.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Petitioner then brought this action against the school superintendant in her official and individual capacities, claiming, among other things, that the district\u2019s decision had violated her right to freedom of speech. The District Court granted summary judgment for the superinten-dant, and a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 580 F.3d 1087. The majority acknowledged that the performance of \u201can entirely instrumental\u201d musical piece \u201cis speech as contemplated by the First Amendment,\u201d and assumed, as the school district had conceded, that the school had created a \u201c \u2018limited public forum\u2019 \u201d when it allowed the members of the wind ensemble to choose the piece that they wished to play. <em>Id., </em>at 1093-1094. Nevertheless, the majority held that the vetoing of the ensemble members\u2019 selection had not violated their free speech rights because \u201cit is reasonable for a school official to prohibit the performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>of an obviously religious piece\u201d \u201cwhen there is a captive audience at a graduation ceremony, which spans a finite amount of time, and during which the demand for equal time is so great that comparable non-religious musical works might not be presented.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1095. Dissenting on the free speech issue, Judge Smith expressed concern that the panel\u2019s decision would encourage public school administrators to ban \u201cmusical and artistic presentations by their students in school-sponsored limited public fora where those presentations contain any trace of religious inspiration, for fear of criticism by a member of the public, however extreme that person\u2019s views may be.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">When a public school administration speaks for itself and takes public responsibility for its speech, it may say what it wishes without violating the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech. <em>Pleasant Grove City </em>v. <em>Summum, </em>555 U.S. 460, 467-468, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2009). But when a public school purports to allow students to express themselves, it must respect the students\u2019 free speech rights. School administrators may not behave like puppeteers who create the illusion that students are engaging in personal expression when in fact the school administration is pulling the strings.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Our cases use the term \u201climited public forum\u201d to describe a situation in which a public school purports to allow students to express their own views or sentiments. See <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em>515 U.S. 819, 829-830, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995); <em>Widmar </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 272-273, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1981); see also <em>Perry Ed. Assn. </em>v. <em>Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 45-48, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983). In such a forum, we have held, the State \u201cmust not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint.\u201d <em>Good News Club </em>v. <em>Milford Central School, </em>533 U.S. 98, 106, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151 (2001); see also <em>Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. Our cases also make it perfectly clear that discrimination against religious, as opposed to secular, expression is viewpoint discrimination. <em>Good News Club, supra, </em>at 107, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151; <em>Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 830, 831, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700; <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel </em>v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., </em>508 U.S. 384, 393-394, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 124 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1993). And our cases categorically reject the proposition that speech may be censored simply because some in the audience may find that speech distasteful. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 814-816, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2000); <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. 377, 382, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1992); <em>Board of Ed., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 </em>v. <em>Pico, </em>457 U.S. 853, 871-872, 102 S. Ct. 2799, 73 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1982) (plurality opinion); <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 508-509, 89 S. Ct. 733, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In this case, however, the Court of Appeals held that a public school did not violate the free speech rights of a student when the school, after creating a limited public forum, banned the performance of \u201can obviously religious piece\u201d because the piece might offend some members of the \u201ccaptive audience at a graduation ceremony.\u201d 580 F.3d, at 1095. The tension between this reasoning and the fundamental free speech principles noted above is unmistakable.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The Court of Appeals, in a footnote, acknowledged that the district\u2019s decision would have been impermissible if it had constituted viewpoint discrimination, but the court concluded that \u201cthis is not a case involving viewpoint discrimination\u201d because petitioner \u201cconcede [d] that she was not attempting to express any specific religious viewpoint\u201d but instead \u201csought only to \u2018play a pretty piece.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1095, n. 6. This reasoning is questionable at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">First, the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding, as set out in the body of its opinion, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>appear to depend in any way on petitioner\u2019s motivation in helping to select the Biebl piece. The court phrased its holding as follows: \u201c[T]he District\u2019s action in keeping all musical performances at graduation \u2018entirely secular\u2019 in nature was reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding a high school graduation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1095. Nothing in the body of the court\u2019s opinion suggests that its decision would have come out the other way if petitioner had favored the Biebl piece for religious rather than artistic reasons. Second, the school district did not veto the Biebl piece on viewpoint-neutral grounds. On the contrary, the district banned that piece precisely because of its perceived religious message\u2014that is, because the district feared that members of the audience would view the performance of the piece as the district\u2019s sponsorship of a religious message. See Pet. for Cert. 7 (quoting letter to the editor criticizing 2005 graduation program). Banning speech because of the view that the speech is likely to be perceived as expressing seems to me to constitute viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The decision below will have important implications for the nearly 10 million public school students in the Ninth Circuit. Even if the decision is read narrowly, it will restrict what is purportedly personal student expression at public school graduation ceremonies. And as Judge Smith noted, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning may be applied to almost all public school artistic performances. 580 F.3d, at 1099 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in judgment). The audience at such events, which generally consists overwhelmingly of relatives and friends of the performers, may be regarded as no less \u201ccaptive\u201d than graduation attendees. If the decision is applied to such performances, school administrators in some communities may choose to avoid \u201ccontroversy\u201d by banishing all musical pieces with \u201creligious connotations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1095, 1091 (majority opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The logic of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision has even broader implications. Why, for example, should the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning apply only to musical performances and not to other forms of student expression, including student speeches at graduation ceremonies and other comparable school events? Moreover, unless discrimination against speech expressing a religious viewpoint is less objectionable than other forms of viewpoint discrimination, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision may provide the basis for wide-ranging censorship of student speech that expresses controversial ideas. A reasonable reading of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision is that it authorizes school administrators to ban any controversial student expression at any school event attended by parents and others who feel obligated to be present because of the importance of the event for the participating students. A decision with such potentially broad and troubling implications merits our review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\">. Many composers, including Schubert, Gounod, Verdi, Mozart, Elgar, Saint-Sa\u00e9ns, Rossini, Brahms, Stravinsky, Bruckner, and Rachmaninoff, composed music for the Ave Maria.

It is not clear that this e-mail accurately reflected either the district\u2019s past or then-current practice.

This song, which not only includes the term \u201chymn\u201d in its title, is an arrangement of Philip Bliss\u2019 hymn \u201cIt is Well with My Soul\u201d that has fervently religious lyrics, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">Let this blest assurance control,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">And hath shed His own blood for my soul.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">Spafford and Bliss, It is Well with My Soul, in Gospel Hymns No. 2, p. 78 (P.
