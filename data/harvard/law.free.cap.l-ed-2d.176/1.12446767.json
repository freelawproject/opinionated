Stat. \u00a7 784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physical force against the person of another,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">[559 U.S. 136]</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The Government sought an enhanced penalty under  \u00a7 924(e), which provides that a person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and who \u201chas three previous convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony\u201d \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-16\">\u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-17\">\u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Johnson\u2019s indictment specified five prior felony convictions. The Government contended that three of those convictions\u2014for aggravated battery and for burglary of a dwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003\u2014rendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under \u00a7 924(e)(1). At the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that the two 1986 convictions were for \u201cviolent felon [ies],\u201d but he objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That conviction was for  simple battery under Florida law, which ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant who (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even simple battery) before, \u00a7 784.03(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Under \u00a7 784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person either \u201c1. [a]c-tually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other,\u201d or \u201c2. [intentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d Because the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can prove that the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">[559 U.S. 137]</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily harm,\u201d that he \u201cintentionally str[uck]\u201d the victim, or that he merely \u201c[ajctually and intentionally touche [d]\u201d the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Since nothing in the record of Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery conviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it rested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005) (plurality opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act only if \u201c[ajctually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another person constitutes the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it does, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under \u00a7 924(e)(1) to a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F.3d 1318 (2008). We granted certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1315, 173 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career Criminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences upon \u201cviolent career criminal[s],\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.084(4)(d) (2007), defined to mean persons who have three convictions for certain felonies, including any \u201cforcible felony,\u201d \u00a7 775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). \u201c[F]orcible felony\u201d is defined to include a list of enumerated felonies\u2014including murder, manslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated assault, and aggravated battery\u2014and also \u201cany other felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\u201d \u00a7 776.08. In <em>Hearns, </em>the Florida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of battery on a law enforcement officer, \u00a7 784.07(2)(b)\u2014which requires the same conduct (directed against a law enforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under \u00a7 784.03(1)(a)\u2014was not a forcible felony. See 961 So.2d, at 219. It said that since \u00a7 784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only the slightest unwanted physical touch,</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">[559 U.S. 138]</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">\u201cthe use ... of physical force\u201d was not an element of the offense. <em>Id., </em>at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted physical touching constitutes \u201cphysical force\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Hearns </em>that it does not constitute \u201cphysical force.\u201d That is not so. The meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not state law. And in answering that question we are not bound by a state court\u2019s interpretation of a similar\u2014or even identical\u2014 state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(2). See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fankell, </em>520 U.S. 911, 916, 117 S. Ct. 1800, 138 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1997).  The Florida Supreme Court has held that the element of \u201cactually and intentionally touching\u201d under Florida\u2019s battery law is satisfied by <em>any </em>intentional physical contact, \u201cno matter how slight.\u201d <em>Hearns, </em>961 So.2d, at 218. The most \u201cnominal contact,\u201d such as a \u201cta[p] . . . on the shoulder without consent,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 219, establishes a violation. We apply \u201cth [is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, n. 16, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979), in determining whether a felony conviction for battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(2) meets the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 144-145, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1995). The adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear in meaning but not of much help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted by and through concrete bodies\u2014distinguishing physical force from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; \u201cforce\u201d has a number of meanings. For present purposes we can exclude its specialized</p>\n<p id=\"ag-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 139]</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">meaning in the field of physics: a cause of the acceleration of mass. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Second). In more general usage it means \u201c [strength or energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of strength or energy,\u201d \u201cIplower to affect strongly in physical relations,\u201d or \u201c[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon a person.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 985. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) defines \u201cforce\u201d as \u201c[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.\u201d And it defines \u201cphysical force\u201d as \u201c[floree consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>All of these definitions suggest a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the word \u201cforce\u201d: its use in describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another. See 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003); accord, Black\u2019s 173. The common law held this element of \u201cforce\u201d to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S.E. 427, 428 (1921); see also 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.15(a). The question is whether the term \u201cforce\u201d in 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in the common-law definition of battery. The Government asserts that it does. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Although a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turley, </em>352 U.S. 407, 411, 77 S. Ct. 397, 1 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1957), we do not assume that a statutory word is used as a term of art where that meaning does not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning, <em>Jarecki </em>v. <em>G. D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1961), and we \u201cdo not force term-of-art definitions into contexts where they plainly</p>\n<p id=\"ATx\">[559 U.S. 140]</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">do not fit and produce nonsense,\u201d <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 282, 126 S. Ct. 904, 163 L. Ed. 2d 748 (2006) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d as used in defining not the crime of battery, but rather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). In <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004), we interpreted the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. That provision is very similar to \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense which \u201chas as an element the use ... of physical force against the person or property of another,\u201d \u00a7 16(a). We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cIn construing both parts of \u00a7 16, we cannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 The ordinary meaning of this term, combined with \u00a7 16\u2019s emphasis on the use of physical force against another person (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .\u201d 543 U.S., at 11, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Just so here. We think it clear that  in the context of a statutory definition of <em>\u201cviolent </em>felony,\u201d the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d means <em>violent </em>force\u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. See <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easterbrook, J.). Even by itself, the word \u201cviolent\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Webster\u2019s Second 2846 (defining \u201cviolent\u201d as \u201c[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement . . . \u201d); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength\u201d); Black\u2019s 1706 (\u201c [o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force\u201d). When the adjective \u201cviolent\u201d is attached to the noun \u201cfelony,\u201d its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer. See <em>id., </em>at 1188 (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201c[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 141]</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\u201d); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>960 F.2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.) (\u201c[T]he term to be defined, \u2018violent felony,\u2019 . . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related, active violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d the Government would seek to import into this definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a meaning derived from a common-law <em>misdemeanor. </em>At common law, bat<em>tery\u2014all </em>battery, and not merely battery by the merest touching\u2014was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216-218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.1(b), at 90; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980). As the dissent points out, <em>post, </em>at 149-150, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 15-16 (opinion of Alito, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and felonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple battery\u2014 whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury variety\u2014generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., </em>2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 16.1(b) (2d ed. 2003 and Supp. 2009-2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(1 (b); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a7 5/12-3(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(b) (West Supp. 2009). It is unlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course \u201cphysical force\u201d <em>can </em>be given its common-law misdemeanor meaning by artful language, but here the only text that can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase \u201cphysical</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">[559 U.S. 142]</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">force\u201d itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily (indeed, much more readily) taken to describe <em>violent </em>force, there is no reason to define \u201cviolent felony\u201d by reference to a nonviolent misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The Government argues that we cannot construe 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as an element the use of <em>violent </em>force, because there is no modifier in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of \u201cphysical force\u201d required. As we have discussed, however, the term \u201cphysical force\u201d itself normally connotes force strong enough to constitute \u201cpower\u201d\u2014and all the more so when it is contained in a definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Nor is there any merit to the dissent\u2019s contention, <em>post, </em>at 148-149, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 14-15, that the term \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to require violent force, because Congress specifically named \u201cburglary\u201d and \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cviolent felon [ies]\u201d in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can be committed without violence. The point would have force (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d In fact, however, they are listed in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) as examples of felonies that \u201cpresen [t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The Government has not argued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies under this latter provision. What the dissent\u2019s argument comes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies that create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as violent felonies under sub-paragraph (BXii), felonies that involve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of physical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>paragraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">[559 U.S. 143]</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The Government also asks us to draw a negative inference from the presence of the \u201cbodily injury\u201d specification added to the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7 922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  That provision forbids the possession of firearms by a person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The absence of such language in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government contends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a matter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that \u201cphysical force\u201d must rise to the level of bodily injury does not suggest that without the qualification \u201cphysical force\u201d would consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for example, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict pain\u2014a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is not a case where Congress has \u201cinclude [d] particular language in one section of a statute but omitfted] it in another section of <em>the same Act,\u201d Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into law in 1994\u2014eight years after enactment of the language in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103-322, \u00a7 110401, 108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99-570, \u00a7 1402, 100 Stat. 3207-39 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The Government contends that interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its ability to enforce the firearm disability in \u00a7 922(g)(9) for persons who previously have been convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d which is defined to include certain misdemeanor offenses that have, \u201cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,\u201d \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have interpreted the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d only in the context of a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d We do not decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the context of defining a</p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 144]</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\"><em>misdemeanor </em>crime of domestic violence. The issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our interpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d That phrase is defined to mean \u201cany crime of violence (as defined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16])\u201d committed by certain persons, including spouses, former spouses, and parents. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Government contends it will be harder to obtain removal based upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida, do not require the use of violent physical force. The dissent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identified, <em>post, </em>at 151-152, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 16-17, and n. 3, as having generic felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact, our decision will render convictions under those statutes \u201cout<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>side the scope of [the Armed Career Criminal Act],\u201d <em>post, </em>at 152, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.  When the law under which the defendant has been convicted contains statutory phrases that cover several different generic crimes, some of which require violent force and some of which do not, the \u201c \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019 \u201d that we have approved, <em>Nijhawan </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 41, 129 S. Ct. 2294, 174 L. Ed. 2d 22 (2009), permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record\u2014 including charging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 126, 129 S. Ct. 687, 172 L. Ed. 2d 484 (2009); <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S., at 26, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (plurality opinion); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990). Indeed, the Government has in the past obtained convictions under the Armed Career Criminal Act in precisely this manner. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>441 F.3d 313, 316-317 (CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robledo-Leyva, </em>307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida battery), cert. denied,</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">[559 U.S. 145]</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">558 U.S. 831, 130 S. Ct. 64, 175 L.

Appx. 521, 524-525 (CA7 2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">It may well be true, as the Government contends, that in many cases state and local records from battery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of records will often frustrate application of the modified categorical approach\u2014not just to battery but to many other crimes as well. See, <em>e.g., Shepard, supra, </em>at 22-23, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common-enough consequence with respect to the single crime of battery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career Criminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art that is a comical misfit with the defined term \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pAo\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"60\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAXkAAAA8AQAAAACrmvf7AAAAr0lEQVR4nO2UMQrCQBBFf0Kw1dIihXoC8QaeyjbeIDcSryMWdi4SHQvj/mm+kMJoMdMs77Nvhg1kCsOg2pfD7gMhfFdIPtVA4exTDSO+4Va1DDVQuM5cqAGAvSrtppZLgzXvCZPDmk00cIIdXZsPkCdg5bto4Gfd+FRDFu7LBUMNFLrthaEGoOrP1MwZagCKfs08TomTNXDNlJ1LNYz6x9U+1fDXWyOEEEIIIYTfCU+6bonFztlidQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"377\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh Circuit for its consideration of whether Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We decline to do so. The Government did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause. App. 44-45. Moreover, the parties briefed the \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) issue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned that if Johnson\u2019s conviction under Fla.

That would be relevant for determining whether a conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a \u201cfelony\u201d conviction. But it has no bearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses\u2014making unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of individuals\u2014 involves the use of \u201cforce\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">.

The classic definition of the crime of battery is the \u201cintentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 139, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 8 (citing 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 7.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed. 2009)). Thus, the crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls squarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I believe that ACCA was meant to incorporate this traditional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The Court starts out in the right direction by noting that the critical statutory language\u2014\u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014 may mean either (1) the use of violent force or (2) the use of force that is sufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery. See <em>ante, </em>at 138-139, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 8-9. The Court veers off course, however, by concluding that the statutory language reaches only violent force.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The term \u201cforce,\u201d as the Court correctly notes, had a well-established meaning at common law that included even the \u201cslightest offensive touching.\u201d Ante, at 139, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 8. See also <em>Respublica </em>v. <em>De Longchamps, </em>1 Dall. 111, 114, 1 L. Ed. 59 (O. T. Phila. 1784) (\u201c[TJhough no great bodily pain is suffered by a blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet these are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault and Battery . . . \u201d); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone). This approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent touching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be even more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient to inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap in the face).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">[559 U.S. 147]</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">When Congress selects statutory language with a well-known common-law meaning, we generally presume that Congress intended to adopt that meaning. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Turley, </em>352 U.S. 407, 411, 77 S. Ct. 397, 1 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1957) (\u201cWe recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a common-law term of established meaning without otherwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term its common-law meaning\u201d); <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carll, </em>105 U.S. 611, 612-613, 26 L. Ed. 1135 (1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest that Congress meant the phrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d in ACCA to depart from that phrase\u2019s meaning at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory interpretation point to the same conclusion. \u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d <em>Russello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). In 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2014the clause immediately following the clause at issue in this case\u2014the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as including any crime that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents <em>a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not include a similar limitation in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should presume that it did not intend for such a limitation to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The language used by Congress in \u00a7 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) further illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes, among other things, the possession of a firearm by a person who is subject to a court order that \u201cexplicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate partner or child <em>that would, reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although \u00a7 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until eight years after \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), see <em>ante, </em>at 143, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 11, the former provision</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">[559 U.S. 148]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had wanted to include in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to those in \u00a7\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress could have easily done so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the common-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The Court first argues that \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read to refer to \u201cviolent\u201d force because that provision defines the term \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 140, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 9. But it is apparent that ACCA uses \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a term of art with a wider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary usage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and extortion are \u201cviolent felon [ies],\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and we have held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted burglary, <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S. Ct. 1586, 167 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2007). All of these offenses may be committed without violent force,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">[559 U.S. 149]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">clear that the use of such force is not a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies crimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies because they often lead to violence. As we have put it, these crimes create \u201csignificant risks of. . . confrontation that might result in bodily injury,\u201d <em>id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>at 199, 127 S. Ct. 1586, 167 L. Ed. 2d 532, and offensive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when one bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely consequence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 422 (CA5 1996) (\u201cIf burglary, with its tendency to cause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is considered a violent crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), then surely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that occurs when a child is sexually molested\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>52 F.3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The Court\u2019s only other reason for rejecting the common-law definition is the fact that battery at common law was a misdemeanor. The Court reasons that \u201c[i]t is unlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining Violent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 141, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 10 (citing 4 Blackstone 216-218 (1769), and ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court does not spell out why Congress\u2019 selection of this term would be unlikely, but I assume that the Court\u2019s point is that Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a violent felony an offense that was regarded at common law as a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the significance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the subsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limitation imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">At common law, the terms \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d did not have the same meaning as they do today. At that time, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 480, n. 7, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000); most</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">[559 U.S. 150]</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">felonies were punishable by death, see <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 13, 105 S. Ct. 1694, 85 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985); and many very serious crimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to murder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 439-440, 96 S. Ct. 820, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the term \u201cfelony\u201d has come to mean any offense punishable by a lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one year, see <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 130, 128 S. Ct. 1572, 170 L. Ed. 2d 478 (2008)); the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d has been reserved for minor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors at common law have been reclassified as felonies. And when the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a few States had felony battery statutes that retained the common-law definition of \u201cforce.\u201d See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police officer a felony); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-915(c) (Lexis 1987) (same); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \u00a7 12-4(b)(6) (West 1987) (same); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 14:33, 14:43.1 (West 1986) (sexual battery punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40A-22-23 (1972) (battery of a police officer a felony); see also Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-3413(b) (Supp. 1994) (simple battery of corrections officers a felony).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">ACCA\u2019s mechanism for identifying the battery convictions that merit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>treatment as \u201cviolent felon [ies]\u201d is contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), which provides that an offense committed by an adult is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d unless it is \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d Consequently, while all convictions under battery statutes that track the common-law definition of the offense satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014because they have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4\">[559 U.S. 151]</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">physical force against the person of another\u201d\u2014not all battery convictions qualify as convictions for a violent felony because \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) excludes any battery conviction that was not regarded by the jurisdiction of conviction as being sufficiently serious to be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. There is nothing extraordinary or unlikely about this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Court\u2019s interpretation will have untoward consequences. Almost half of the States have statutes that reach both the use of violent force and force that is not violent but is unlawful and offensive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Many of the States classify these</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">[559 U.S. 152]</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">batteries as felonies or make them punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the great majority of convictions under these statutes are, no doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the Court\u2019s decision will be to take all these convictions outside the scope of ACCA\u2014unless the Government is able to produce documents that may properly be consulted under the modified categorical approach and that conclusively show that the offender\u2019s conduct involved the use of violent force, see <em>ante, </em>at 144-145, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 11-12. As the Government notes, however, this will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>often be impossible because, in those States in which the same battery provision governs both the use of violent force and offensive touching, charging documents frequently simply track the language of the statute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to draw distinctions based on the type of force that the defendant employed. See Brief for United States 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In addition, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cphysical force\u201d may hobble at least two federal statutes that contain this identical term. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), a person convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d may not lawfully possess a firearm, and the term \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is defined as applying only to crimes that \u201cha[ve], as an element, the use or attempted use of <em>physical force, </em>or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\u201d \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recognized that \u201c \u2018many people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies,\u2019 \u201d and Congress therefore enacted this provision to keep firearms out of the</p>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">[559 U.S. 153]</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">hands of such abusers. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>555 U.S. 415, 426, 129 S. Ct. 1079, 172 L. Ed. 2d 816 (2009). Cases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted under generally applicable assault and battery statutes, <em>id.., </em>at 427, 129 S. Ct. 1079, 172 L. Ed. 2d 816, and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of almost half the States apply both to cases involving the use of violent force and cases involving offensive touching. As a result, if the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cphysical force\u201d in ACCAis applied to \u00a7 922(g)(9), a great many persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse will be allowed to possess firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is subject to removal, and the term \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is defined as an offense that, among other things, has \u201cas an element the use [or] attempted use ... of physical force.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).
