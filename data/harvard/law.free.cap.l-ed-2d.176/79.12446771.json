Among the reform measures the Act implemented are a number of provisions that regulate the conduct of \u201cdebt relief agen-<em>ches]\u201d\u2014Le., </em>professionals who provide bankruptcy assistance to consumer debtors. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101(3), (12A). These consolidated cases present the threshold question whether attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying services. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that they are, we must also consider whether the Act\u2019s provisions governing debt relief agencies\u2019 advice to clients, \u00a7 526(a)(4), and requiring them to make certain disclosures in their advertisements, \u00a7\u00a7 528(a) and (b)(2), violate the First Amendment rights of attorneys. Concluding that the Court of Appeals construed \u00a7 526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment that the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad. Like the Court of Appeals, we uphold \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements as applied in these consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">In order to improve bankruptcy law and practice, Congress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of provisions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals. Some of these measures apply to the broad class of bankruptcy professionals termed \u201cdebt relief agencies].\u201d  That category includes, with limited exceptions, \u201cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for . . . payment . . . , or who is a bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>petition preparer.\u201d \u00a7 10K12A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cBankruptcy assistance' goods or services \u2019 refers to</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">[559 U.S. 233]</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u201cprovided to an assisted person with the express or implied purpose of providing information, advice, counsel, document preparation, or filing, or attendance at a creditors\u2019 meeting or appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding\u201d in bankruptcy. \u00a7 10K4A). An \u201cassisted person\u201d is someone with limited nonexempt property whose debts consist primarily of consumer debts. \u00a7 101(3). The BAPCPA subjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions and requirements, as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 526, 527, and 528. As relevant here, \u00a7 526(a) establishes several rules of professional conduct for persons qualifying as debt relief agencies. Among them, \u00a7 526(a)(4) states that a debt relief agency shall not \u201cadvise an assisted person ... to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services performed as part of preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Section 528 requires qualifying professionals to include certain disclosures in their advertisements. Subsection (a) provides that debt relief agencies must \u201cclearly and conspicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy assistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy directed to the general public . . . that the services or benefits are with respect to bankruptcy relief under this title.\u201d \u00a7 528(a)(3). It also requires them to include the following, \u201cor a substantially similar statement\u201d: \u201cWe are a debt relief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d \u00a7 528(a)(4). Subsection (b) requires essentially the same disclosures in advertisements \u201cindicating that the debt relief agency provides assistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage foreclosures, eviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collection pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt.\u201d \u00a7 528(b)(2). Debt relief agencies advertising such services must disclose \u201cthat the assistance may involve bankruptcy relief,\u201d \u00a7 528(b)(2)(A), and must</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">[559 U.S. 234]</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">identify themselves as \u201cdebt relief agencies]\u201d as required by \u00a7 528(a)(4), see \u00a7 528(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">The plaintiffs in this litigation\u2014the law firm Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P. A.; the firm\u2019s president, Robert J. Milavetz; a bankruptcy attorney at the firm, Barbara Nilva Nevin; and two of the firm\u2019s clients (collectively Milavetz)\u2014filed a preenforcement suit in Federal District Court seeking declaratory relief with respect to the Act\u2019s debt-relief-agency provisions. Milavetz asked the court to hold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not identify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">Milavetz first argued that attorneys are not \u201cdebt relief agencies]\u201d as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>term is used in the BAPCPA. In the alternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that \u00a7\u00a7 526(a)(4) and 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as applied to attorneys. The District Court agreed with Milavetz that the term \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d does not include attorneys, App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 08-1119, p. A-15, but only after finding that \u00a7\u00a7 526 and 528\u2014provisions expressly applicable only to debt relief agencies\u2014are unconstitutional as applied to this class of professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 541 F.3d 785 (2008). Relying on the Act\u2019s plain language, the court unanimously rejected the District Court\u2019s conclusion that attorneys are not \u201cdebt relief agencies]\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The Court of Appeals also parted ways with the District Court concerning the constitutionality of \u00a7 528. Concluding that the disclosures are intended to prevent consumer deception and are \u201creasonably related\u201d to that interest, the court upheld the application of \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements to attorneys. <em>Id., </em>at 796-797 (citing <em>Zauderer </em>v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, </em>471 U.S. 626, 651, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">[559 U.S. 235]</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel, however, agreed with the District Court that \u00a7 526(a)(4) is invalid. Determining that \u00a7 526(a)(4) \u201cbroadly prohibits a debt relief agency from advising an assisted person ... to incur <em>any </em>additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating bankruptcy,\u201d even when that advice constitutes prudent prebankruptcy planning not intended to abuse the bankruptcy laws, 541 F.3d, at 793, the majority held that \u00a7 526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermediate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that \u00a7 526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice to abuse the bankruptcy system, noting that this construction would avoid most constitutional difficulties. See <em>id., </em>at 799 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In light of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we granted certio-rari to resolve the question of \u00a7 526(a)(4)\u2019s scope. 556 U.S. 1281, 129 S. Ct. 2769, 174 L. Ed. 2d 269 (2009). We also agreed to consider the threshold question whether attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are \u201cdebt relief agencies]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10K12A) and the related question whether \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">We first consider whether the term \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d includes attorneys. If it does not, we need not reach the other questions presented, as \u00a7\u00a7 526 and 528 govern only the conduct of debt relief agencies, and Mi-lavetz challenges the validity of those provisions based on their application to attorneys. The Government contends that \u201cdebt relief</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">[559 U.S. 236]</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">agency\u201d plainly includes attorneys, while Mi-lavetz urges that it does not. We conclude that the Government has the better view.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>As already noted,  a debt relief agency is \u201cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person\u201d in return for payment. \u00a7 10K12A). By definition, \u201cbankruptcy assistance\u201d includes several services commonly performed by attorneys. Indeed, some forms of bankruptcy assistance, including the \u201cprovision of] legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 10K4A), may be provided only by attorneys. See \u00a7 110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition preparers from providing legal advice). Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress gave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys. See \u00a7\u00a7 101(12A)(A)-(E). Thus, as the Government contends,  the statutory text clearly indicates that attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying services to assisted persons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In advocating a narrower understanding of that term, Milavetz relies heavily on the fact that \u00a7 10K12A) does not expressly include attorneys. That omission stands in contrast, it argues, to the provision\u2019s explicit inclusion of \u201cbankruptcy petition pre-p\u00e1reos]\u201d\u2014a category of professionals that excludes attorneys and their staff, see \u00a7 110(a)(1). But Milavetz</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">[559 U.S. 237]</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">does not contend, nor could it credibly, that only professionals expressly included in the definition are debt relief agencies. On that reading, no professional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer would qualify\u2014an implausible reading given that the statute defines \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d as \u201cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person ... o/' who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.\u201d \u00a7 10K12A) (emphasis added). The provision\u2019s silence regarding attorneys thus avails Mi-lavetz little. Cf. <em>Heintz </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>514 U.S. 291, 294, 115 S. Ct. 1489, 131 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1995) (holding that \u201cdebt collector\u201d as used in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the definition\u2019s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Milavetz\u2019s other arguments for excluding attorneys similarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute\u2019s plain language. Milavetz contends that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 526(d)(2)\u2019s instruction that \u00a7\u00a7 526, 527, and 528 should not \u201cbe deemed to limit or curtail\u201d States\u2019 authority to \u201cdetermine and enforce qualifications for the practice of law\u201d counsels against reading \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d to include attorneys, as the surest way to protect the States\u2019 role in regulating the legal profession is to make the BAPCPA\u2019s professional conduct rules inapplicable to lawyers. We find that \u00a7 526(d)(2) supports the opposite conclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact that provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>attorneys. Milavetz\u2019s broader claim that reading \u00a7 10K12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on an area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit. Congress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen aspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial federal concern. See, <em>e.g., Conrad, Rubin &amp; Lesser </em>v. <em>Pender, </em>289 U.S. 472, 477-479, 53 S. Ct. 703, 77 L. Ed. 1327(1933) (finding broad authorization in former \u00a7 96(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978) for courts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor\u2019s prepetition attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">[559 U.S. 238]</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Milavetz next argues that \u00a7 101(12A)\u2019s exception for any \u201cofficer, director, employee, or agent of a person who provides\u201d bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its failure to include \u201cpartners.\u201d \u00a7 10K12AXA). In light of that omission, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies will obligate entire law firms to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 526, 527, and 528 based on the conduct of a single partner, while the agents and employees of debt relief agencies not typically organized as partnerships are shielded from those requirements. Given that the partnership structure is not unique to law firms, however, it is unclear why the exclusion would be revealing of Congress\u2019 intent only with respect to attorneys. In any event, partnerships are themselves \u201cperson[s]\u201d under the BAPCPA, see \u00a7 101(41), and can qualify as \u201cdebt relief agencies]\u201d when they meet the criteria set forth in \u00a7 10K12A). Moreover, a partnership\u2019s employees and agents are exempted from \u00a7 10K12A) in the same way as the employees and agents of other organizations. To the extent that partners may be subject to the debt-relief-agency provisions by association, that result is consistent with the joint responsibilities that typically flow from the partnership structure, cf. <em>Strang </em>v. <em>Bradner, </em>114 U.S. 555, 561, 5 S. Ct. 1038, 29 L. Ed. 248 (1885). Accordingly, we decline to attribute the significance Milavetz suggests to \u00a7 101(12A)(A)\u2019s failure to include partners among the exempted actors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">[559 U.S. 239]</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">All else failing, Milavetz urges that the canon of constitutional avoidance requires us to read \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d to exclude attorneys in order to forestall serious doubts as to the validity of \u00a7\u00a7 526 and 528.  The avoidance canon, however, \u201cis a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 381, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005). In applying that tool, we will consider only those constructions of a statute that are \u201c \u2018fairly possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Security Industrial Bank, </em>459 U.S. 70, 78, 103 S. Ct. 407, 74 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1982). For the reasons already discussed, the text and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>statutory context of \u00a7 10K12A) foreclose a reading of \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d that excludes attorneys. Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying services, we next address the scope and validity of \u00a7 526(a)(4). Characterizing the statute as a broad, content-based restriction on attorney-client communications that is not adequately tailored to constrain only speech the Government has a substantial interest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule substantially overbroad. 541 F.3d, at 793-794, and n. 10. For the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from \u201cadvis [ing] an assisted person\u201d either \u201cto incur more debt in contemplation of\u2019 filing for bankruptcy \u201cor to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services\u201d performed in preparation for filing. Only the first of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the correctness of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the parties first dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">[559 U.S. 240]</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">the provision\u2019s scope. The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c\u00a7 526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief agency from advising an assisted person ... to incur <em>any </em>additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 793. Under that reading, an attorney is prohibited from providing all manner of \u201cbeneficial advice\u2014even if the advice could help the assisted person avoid filing for bankruptcy altogether.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, Milavetz contends that \u00a7 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from advising a client to incur any new debt while considering whether to file for bankruptcy. Construing the provision more broadly still, Milavetz contends that \u00a7 526(a)(4) forbids not only affirmative advice but also any discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more debt. Like the panel majority\u2019s, Mi-lavetz\u2019s reading rests primarily on its view that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy encompasses any advice given to a debtor with the awareness that he might soon file for bankruptcy, even if the advice seeks to obviate the need to file. Milavetz also maintains that if \u00a7 526(a)(4) were construed more narrowly, as urged by the Government and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to inevitably chill some protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The Government continues to advocate a narrower construction of the statute, urging that Milavetz\u2019s reading is untenable and that its vagueness concerns are misplaced. The Government contends that \u00a7 526(a)(4)\u2019s restriction on advice to incur more debt \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy is most naturally read to forbid only advice to undertake actions to abuse the bankruptcy system. Focusing first on the provision\u2019s text, the Government points to sources indicating that the phrase \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy has long been, and continues to be, associated with abusive conduct. For instance, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) defines \u201ccontemplation of bankruptcy\u201d as \u201c [t]he</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">[559 U.S. 241]</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">thought of declaring bankruptcy because of the inability to continue current financial operations, often coupled with action designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>thwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d Use of the phrase by Members of Congress illustrates that traditional coupling. See, <em>e.g., </em>S. Rep. No. 98-65, p. 9 (1983) (discussing the practice of \u201c \u2018loading up\u2019 [on debt] in contemplation of bankruptcy\u201d); Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H. R. Doc. No. 93-137, pt. I, p. 11 (1973) (\u201c[T]he most serious abuse of consumer bankruptcy is the number of instances in which individuals have purchased a sizable quantity of goods and services on credit on the eve of bankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge\u201d). The Government also points to early American and English judicial decisions to corroborate its contention that \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy signifies abusive conduct. See, <em>e.g., In re Pearce, </em>19 F. Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D Vt. 1843); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Brundrett, </em>5 B. &amp; Ad. 288, 296-297, 110 Eng. Rep. 798, 801 (K. B. 1833) (Parke, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on \u00a7 526(a)(4)\u2019s immediate context. According to the Government, the other three subsections of \u00a7 526(a) are designed to protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief agencies: Section 526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to perform all promised services; \u00a7 526(a)(2) prohibits them from making or advising debtors to make false or misleading statements in bankruptcy; and \u00a7 526(a)(3) prohibits them from misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of bankruptcy. When \u00a7 526(a)(4) is read in context of these debtor-protective provisions, the Government argues, construing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving advice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors seems particularly nonsensical.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA\u2019s remedies for violations of \u00a7 526(a)(4) similarly corroborate its narrow reading. Section 526(c) provides remedies for a debt</p>\n<p id=\"AmT\">[559 U.S. 242]</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">relief agency\u2019s violation of \u00a7 526, \u00a7 527, or \u00a7 528. Among the actions authorized, a debtor may sue the attorney for remittal of fees, actual damages, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs; a state attorney general may sue for a resident\u2019s actual damages; and a court finding intentional abuse may impose an appropriate civil penalty. \u00a7 526(c). The Government also relies on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Hersh </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 743 (2008), and Judge Colloton\u2019s dissent below for the observation that \u201cCongress\u2019s emphasis on actual damages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly suggests that Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to debtors which if followed would have a significant risk of harming the debtor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 760; see 541 F.3d, at 800 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). By contrast, \u201clegal and appropriate advice that would be protected by the First Amendment, yet prohibited by a broad reading of \u00a7 526(a)(4), should cause no damage at all.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see <em>Hersh, </em>553 F.3d, at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Milavetz contends that the Government\u2019s sources actually undermine its claim that the phrase \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive conduct. Specifically, Mi-lavetz argues that these authorities illustrate that \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy is a neutral phrase that only implies abusive conduct when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>attached to an additional, proscriptive term. As Black\u2019s states, the phrase is <em>\u201coften coupled with </em>action designed to thwart the distribution of assets\u201d in bankruptcy, Black\u2019s 336 (emphasis added), but it carries no independent connotation of abuse. In support of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on our decision in <em>Pender, </em>289 U.S. 472, 53 S. Ct. 703, 77 L. Ed. 1327, contending that we construed \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy in that case to describe \u201cconduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy filing and nothing more.\u201d Brief for Milavetz 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">After reviewing these competing claims, we are persuaded that a narrower reading of \u00a7 526(a)(4) is sounder, although we do not adopt precisely the view the Government advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">[559 U.S. 243]</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The Government\u2019s sources show that the phrase \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 bankruptcy has so commonly been associated with abusive conduct that it may readily be understood to prefigure abuse. As used in \u00a7 526(a)(4), however, we think the phrase refers to a specific type of misconduct designed to manipulate the protections of the bankruptcy system. In light of our decision in <em>Pender, </em>and in context of other sections of the Code, we conclude that  \u00a7 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\"><em>Pender </em>addressed the meaning of former \u00a7 96(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor\u2019s payment of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin contemplation of the filing of a petition.\u201d Recognizing \u201c \u2018the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in employing counsel to protect him,\u2019 \u201d 289 U.S., at 478, 53 S. Ct. 703, 77 L. Ed. 1327 (quoting <em>In re Wood &amp; Henderson, </em>210 U.S. 246, 253, 28 S. Ct. 621, 52 L. Ed. 1046 (1908)), we read \u201cin contemplation of . . . filing\u201d in that context to require that the portended bankruptcy have \u201cinduce [d]\u201d the transfer at issue, 289 U.S., at 477, 53 S. Ct. 703, 77 L. Ed. 1327, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse. In so construing the statute, we identified the \u201ccontrolling question\u201d as \u201cwhether the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Given the substantial similarities between \u00a7\u00a7 96(d) and 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the latter provision is likewise whether the impelling reason for \u201cad-vis [ing] an assisted person ... to incur more debt\u201d was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">To be sure, there are relevant differences between the provision at issue in <em>Pender </em>and the one now under review. Most notably, the inquiry in <em>Pender </em>was as to payments made on the eve of bankruptcy, whereas \u00a7 526(a)(4) regards advice to incur additional debts. Consistent with that difference, under \u00a7 96(d) a finding that a payment was made \u201cin contemplation of\u2019 filing resolved only a threshold inquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness of the payment;</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">[559 U.S. 244]</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">the finding thus supported an inference of abuse but did not conclusively establish it. By contrast, advice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy, as prohibited by \u00a7 526(a)(4), will generally consist of advice to \u201cload up\u201d on debt with the expectation of obtaining its dis<em>charge\u2014i.e., </em>conduct that is abusive <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The statutory context supports the conclusion that \u00a7 526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition primarily targets this type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>abuse. Code provisions predating the BAPCPA already sought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior to filing. Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the attendant risk of manipulation by preventing the discharge of debts obtained by false pretenses and making debts for purchases of luxury goods or services presumptively nondischargeable. See \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2000 ed.). The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse, however, by providing a new mechanism for determining a debtor\u2019s ability to repay. Pursuant to the \u201cmeans tes[t],\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(D) (2006 ed.), a debtor\u2019s petition for Chapter 7 relief is presumed abusive (and may therefore be dismissed or converted to a structured repayment plan under Chapter 13) if the debtor\u2019s current monthly income exceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including payments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed amount. See \u00a7\u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(i)-(iv). The test promotes debtor accountability but also enhances incentives to incur additional debt prior to filing, as payments on secured debts offset a debtor\u2019s monthly income under the formula. Other amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a concern with this practice. For instance, Congress amended \u00a7 523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge by lowering the threshold amount of new debt a debtor must assume to trigger the presumption of abuse under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the relevant prefiling window. See \u00a7 310, 119 Stat. 84. In context, \u00a7 526(a)(4) is best understood to provide an additional safeguard against the practice of loading up on debt prior to filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">[559 U.S. 245]</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The Government\u2019s contextual arguments provide additional support for the view that \u00a7 526(a)(4) was meant to prevent this type of conduct. The companion rules of professional conduct in \u00a7\u00a7 526(a)(l)-(3) and the remedies for their violation in \u00a7 526(c) indicate that Congress was concerned with actions that threaten to harm debtors or creditors. Unlike the reasonable financial advice the Eighth Circuit\u2019s broad reading would proscribe, advice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy presents a substantial risk of injury to both debtors and creditors. See <em>Hersh, </em>553 F.3d, at 760-761. Specifically, the incurrence of such debt stands to harm a debtor if his prepetition conduct leads a court to hold his debts nondischargeable, see \u00a7 523(a)(2), convert his case to another chapter, or dismiss it altogether, see \u00a7 707(b), thereby defeating his effort to obtain bankruptcy relief. If a debt, although manipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abusive and therefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm as a result of the discharge and the consequent dilution of the bankruptcy estate. By contrast, the prudent advice that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s view of the statute forbids would likely benefit both debtors and creditors and at the very least should cause no harm. See <em>id., </em>at 760; 541 F.3d, at 800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). For all of these reasons, we conclude that  \u00a7 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an assisted person to incur more debt when the impelling reason for the advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">That \u201c[n]o other solution yields as sensible a\u201d result further persuades us of the correctness of this narrow reading. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Granderson, </em>511 U.S. 39, 55, 114 S. Ct. 1259, 127 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1994). It would make scant sense to prevent attorneys and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>other debt relief agencies from advising individuals thinking of filing for bankruptcy about options that would be beneficial to both those individuals and their creditors. That construction serves none of the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code or the amendments enacted through the BAPCPA. Mi-lavetz itself</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">[559 U.S. 246]</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">acknowledges that its expansive view of \u00a7 526(a)(4) would produce absurd results; that is one of its bases for arguing that \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d should be construed to exclude attorneys. Because the language and context of \u00a7 526(a)(4) evidence a more targeted purpose, we can avoid the absurdity of which Mi-lavetz complains without reaching the result it advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">For the same reason, we reject Mi-lavetz\u2019s suggestion that \u00a7 526(a)(4) broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from discussing covered subjects instead of merely proscribing affirmative advice to undertake a particular action. Section 526(a)(4) by its terms prevents debt relief agencies only from \u201cadvis[ing]\u201d assisted persons \u201cto incur\u201d more debt. Covered professionals remain free to \u201ctal[k] fully and candidly <em>about </em>the incurrence of debt in contemplation of filing a bankruptcy case.\u201d Brief for Milavetz 73. Section 526(a)(4) requires professionals only to avoid instructing or encouraging assisted persons to take on more debt in that circumstance. Cf. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(d) (2009) (\u201cAlawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law\u201d). Even if the statute were not clear in this regard, we would reach the same conclusion about its scope because the inhibition of frank discussion serves no conceivable purpose within the statutory scheme. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 706, n. 9, 120 S. Ct. 1795, 146 L. Ed. 2d 727 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">[559 U.S. 247]</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Finally, we reject Milavetz\u2019s contention that, narrowly construed, \u00a7 526(a)(4) is impermissibly vague. Milavetz urges that the concept of abusive prefiling conduct is too indefinite to withstand constitutional scrutiny and that uncertainty regarding the scope of the prohibition will chill protected speech. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Under our reading of the statute, of course, the prohibited advice is not defined in terms of abusive prefiling conduct but rather the incurrence of additional debt when the impelling reason is the anticipation of bankruptcy. Even if the test depended upon the notion of abuse, however, Milavetz\u2019s claim would be fatally undermined by other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to which that concept is no stranger. As discussed above, the Code authorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge fraudulent debts, see \u00a7 523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or convert it to a case under another chapter if it finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>granting relief would constitute abuse, see \u00a7 707(b)(1). Attorneys and other professionals who give debtors bankruptcy advice must know of these provisions and their consequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs additional debt prior to filing. Indeed, \u00a7 707(b)(4)(C) states that an attorney\u2019s signature on bankruptcy filings \u201cshall constitute a certification that the attorney has\u201d determined that the filing \u201cdoes not constitute an abuse under [\u00a7 707(b)(1)].\u201d Against this backdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that narrowly prohibits an attorney from affirmatively advising a client to commit this type of abusive prefiling conduct could chill attorney speech or inhibit the attorney-client relationship. Our construction of \u00a7 526(a)(4) to prevent only advice principally motivated by the prospect of bankruptcy further ensures that professionals cannot unknowingly run afoul of</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">[559 U.S. 248]</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">its proscription.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the scope of the prohibition is adequately defined, both on its own terms and by reference to the Code\u2019s other provisions, we reject Milavetz\u2019s vagueness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">As the foregoing shows, the language of the statute, together with other evidence of its purpose, makes this narrow reading of \u00a7 526(a)(4) not merely a plausible interpretation but the more natural one. Accordingly, we reject the Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion and hold that  a debt relief agency violates \u00a7 526(a)(4) only when the impetus of the advice to incur more debt is the expectation of filing for bankruptcy and obtaining the attendant relief. Because our reading of the statute supplies a sufficient ground for reversing the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, and because Milavetz challenges the constitutionality of the statute, as narrowed, only on vagueness grounds, we need not further consider whether the statute so construed withstands First Amendment scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Finally, we address the validity of \u00a7 528\u2019s challenged disclosure requirements. Our first task in resolving this question is to determine the contours of Milavetz\u2019s claim. Although</p>\n<p id=\"A0D\">[559 U.S. 249]</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">the nature of its challenge is not entirely clear from the briefing or decisions below, counsel for Milavetz insisted at oral argument that this is \u201cnot a facial challenge; it\u2019s an as-applied challenge.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. We will approach the question consistent with Milavetz\u2019s characterization.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">We next consider the standard of scrutiny applicable to \u00a7 528\u2019s disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>sure requirements. The parties agree, as do we, that the challenged provisions regulate only commercial speech. Milavetz contends that our decision in <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., </em>447 U.S. 557, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980), supplies the proper standard for reviewing these requirements. The Court in that case held that restrictions on nonmislead-ing commercial speech regarding lawful activity must withstand intermediate scrutiny\u2014that is, they must \u201cdirectly advanc[e]\u201d a substantial governmental interest and be \u201cn[o] more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 566, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341. Contesting Milavetz\u2019s premise, the Government maintains that \u00a7 528 is directed at <em>misleading </em>commercial speech. For that reason, and because the challenged provisions impose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the Government contends that the less exacting scrutiny described in <em>Zauderer </em>governs our review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><em>Zauderer </em>addressed the validity of a rule of professional conduct that required attorneys who advertised contingency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that a losing client might still be responsible for certain litigation fees and costs. Noting that First Amendment protection for commercial speech is justified in large part by the information\u2019s value to consumers, the Court concluded that an attorney\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">[559 U.S. 250]</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">constitutionally protected interest in <em>not </em>providing the required factual information is \u201cminimal.\u201d 471 U.S., at 651, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652. Unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements offend the First Amendment by chilling protected speech, but \u201can advertiser\u2019s rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State\u2019s interest in preventing deception of consumers.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The challenged provisions of \u00a7 528 share the essential features of the rule at issue in <em>Zauderer. </em>As in that case, \u00a7 528\u2019s required disclosures are intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial advertisements\u2014specifically, the promise of debt relief without any reference to the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which has inherent costs. Additionally, the disclosures entail only an accurate statement identifying the advertiser\u2019s legal status and the character of the assistance provided, and they do not prevent debt relief agencies like Milavetz from conveying any additional information.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The same characteristics of \u00a7 528 that make it analogous to the rule in <em>Zauderer </em>serve to distinguish it from those at issue in <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1982), to which the Court applied the intermediate scrutiny of <em>Central Hudson. </em>The ethical rules addressed in <em>R.M.J. </em>prohibited attorneys from advertising their practice areas in terms other than those prescribed by the State Supreme Court and from announcing the courts in which they were admitted to practice. See 455 U.S., at 197-198, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64. Finding that the restricted statements were not inherently misleading and that the State had failed to show that the appellant\u2019s advertisements were themselves likely to mislead consumers, see <em>id., </em>at 205, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64, the Court applied <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>intermediate scrutiny and invalidated the restrictions as insufficiently tailored to any substantial state interest, 455 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>U.S., at 205-206, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64. In so holding, the Court emphasized that States retain authority to regulate inherently misleading advertisements, particularly</p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 251]</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">through disclosure requirements, and it noted that advertisements for professional services pose a special risk of deception. See <em>id., </em>at 203, 207, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government in these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that its advertisements are misleading. <em>Zauderer </em>forecloses that argument: \u201cWhen the possibility of deception is as self-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the State to \u2018conduct a survey of the . . . public before it [may] determine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to mislead.\u2019 \u201d 471 U.S., at 652-653, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652 (quoting <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>380 U.S. 374, 391-392, 85 S. Ct. 1035, 13 L. Ed. 2d 904 (1965)). Evidence in the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of advertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief without alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998 Hearings, pt. III, at 86, 90-94, is adequate to establish that the likelihood of deception in these cases \u201cis hardly a speculative one,\u201d 471 U.S., at 652, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Milavetz alternatively argues that the term \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d is confusing and misleading and that requiring its inclusion in advertisements cannot be \u201creasonably related\u201d to the Government\u2019s interest in preventing consumer deception, as <em>Zauderer </em>requires. <em>Id., </em>at 651, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652. This contention amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz\u2019s part for referring to itself as something other than a \u201cdebt relief <em>agency\u201d\u2014e.g., </em>an attorney or a law firm. For several reasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any constitutional basis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to support its claim that the label is confusing. Because \u00a7 528 by its terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclosures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt relief agencies must identify themselves as such in their advertisements. This statement provides interested observers with pertinent information about the advertiser\u2019s services and client obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Other information that Milavetz must or may include in its advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services provides</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">[559 U.S. 252]</p>\n<p id=\"AjQp\">additional assurance that consumers will not misunderstand the term. The required statement that the advertiser \u201c \u2018help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief\u2019 \u201d gives meaningful context to the term \u201cdebt relief agency.\u201d And Milavetz may further identify itself as a law firm or attorney. Section 528 also gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor the disclosures to its individual circumstances, as long as the resulting statements are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the statutory examples. \u00a7\u00a7 528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Finally, we reject Milavetz\u2019s argument that \u00a7 528 is not reasonably related to any governmental interest because it applies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as Milavetz sometimes does. The required disclosures, Milavetz contends, would be counterfactual and misleading in that context. This claim is premised on an untenable reading of the statute. We think it evident from the definition of \u201cassisted person\u201d\u2014which is stated in terms of the person\u2019s debts, see \u00a7 101(3)\u2014and from the text and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>structure of the debt-relief-agency provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 526, 527, and 528 that those provisions, including \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements, govern only professionals who offer bankruptcy-related services to consumer debtors. Section 528 is itself expressly concerned with advertisements pertaining to \u201cbankruptcy assistance services,\u201d \u201cthe benefits of bankruptcy,\u201d \u201cexcessive debt, debt collection pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 528(a)(3) and (b)(2). Moreover, like the other debt-rebef-agency provisions, that section is codified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code entitled \u201cDEBTOR\u2019S DUTIES AND BENEFITS.\u201d 11 U.S.C., ch. 5, subch. II. In context, reading \u00a7 528 to govern advertisements aimed at creditors would be as anomalous as the result of which Mi-lavetz complains. Once again, we decline Milavetz\u2019s invitation to adopt a view of the statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would produce an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Because \u00a7 528\u2019s requirements that Milavetz identify itself as a debt relief agency and include certain information about</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">[559 U.S. 253]</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">its bankruptcy-assistance and related services are \u201creasonably related to the [Government\u2019s] interest in preventing deception of consumers,\u201d <em>Zauderer, </em>471 U.S., at 651, 105 S.

Statements in a Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary regarding the Act\u2019s purpose indicate concern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys as well as other bankruptcy professionals. See, <em>e.g., </em>H. R. Rep. No. 109-31, pt. 1, p. 5 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). And the legislative record elsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys. See, <em>e.g., </em>Hearings on H. R. 3150 before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. III, p. 95 (1998) (hereinafter 1998 Hearings). (While the 1998 Hearings preceded the BAPCPA\u2019s enactment by several years, they form part of the record cited by the 2005 House Report. See H. R. Rep., at 7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\">. Reviving an argument that Milavetz abandoned, <em>amici </em>contend that \u00a7 527(b) undermines the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7 101(12A) because it requires a debt relief agency to inform an assisted person of his right to hire an attorney, and it would be nonsensical to require attorneys to provide such notice. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>34. This argument fails on its own terms. Even if \u00a7 101(12A) excluded attorneys, as Milavetz contends, \u00a7 527(b) would still produce the result of which its <em>amici </em>complain, as that provision also requires a debt relief agency to inform assisted persons that they \u201c \u2018can get help in some localities from a bankruptcy petition preparer,\u2019 \u201d and there is no question that bankruptcy petition preparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to that requirement. It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief agencies\u2014whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers\u2014to inform prospective clients of their options for obtaining bankruptcy-assistance services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b181-11\">. If read as Milavetz advocates, \u00a7 526(a)(4) would seriously undermine the attorney-client relationship. Earlier this Term, we acknowledged the importance of the attorney-client privilege as a means of protecting that relationship and fostering robust discussion. See <em>Mohawk Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>558 U.S. 100, 108, 130 S. Ct. 599, 175 L. Ed. 2d 458 (2009). Reiterating the significance of such dialogue, we note that \u00a7 526(a)(4), as narrowly construed, presents no impediment to \u201c \u2018full and frank\u2019 \u201d discussions. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1981)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b182-12\">. The hypothetical questions Milavetz posits regarding the permissibility of advice to incur debt in certain circumstances, see Brief for Milavetz 48-51, are easily answered by reference to whether the expectation of filing for bankruptcy (and obtaining a discharge) impelled the advice. We emphasize that awareness of the possibility of bankruptcy is insufficient to trigger \u00a7 526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition. Instead, that provision proscribes only advice to incur more debt that is principally motivated by that likelihood. Thus, advice to refinance a mortgage or purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will reduce the debtor\u2019s interest rates or improve his ability to repay is not prohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects, rather than the anticipated filing, is the impelling cause. Advice to incur additional debt to buy groceries, pay medical bills, or make other purchases \u201creasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor,\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 523(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), is similarly permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b182-13\">. In so doing, we note that our ability to evaluate \u00a7 528\u2019s validity as applied to Milavetz is constrained by the lack of a developed record. Because the parties have introduced no exhibits or other evidence to ground our analysis, we are guided in this preenforcement challenge only by Milavetz\u2019s <em>status\u2014i.e., </em>as a law firm or attorney\u2014and its general claims about the nature of its advertisements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b185-4\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b185-5\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">I join the opinion of the Court, except for footnote 3, which notes that the legislative history supports what the statute unambiguously says. The Court first notes that statements in the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary \u201cindicate concern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys.\u201d Ante, at 236, n. 3, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 87. Perhaps, but only the concern of the author of the Report. Such statements tell us nothing about what the statute means, since (1) we do not know that the members of the Committee read the Report, (2) it is almost certain that they did not vote on the Report (that is not the practice), and (3) even if they did read and vote on it, they were not, after all, those who made this law. The statute before us is a law because its text was approved by a majority vote of the House and the Senate, and was signed by the President. Even indulging the extravagant assumption that Members of the House other than members of its Committee on the Judiciary read the Report (and the further extravagant assumption that they agreed with it), the Members of the Senate could not possibly have read it, since it did not exist when the Senate passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. And the President surely had more important things to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">[559 U.S. 254]</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">The footnote\u2019s other source of legislative history is truly mystifying. For the proposition that \u201cthe legislative record elsewhere documents miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>duct by attorneys\u201d which was presumably the concern of <em>Congress, </em>the Court cites a reproduction of a tasteless advertisement that was (1) an attachment to the written statement of a <em>witness, </em>(2) in a hearing held seven years prior to this statute\u2019s passage, (3) before a Subcommittee of the House considering a <em>different </em>consumer bankruptcy reform bill that never passed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201cElsewhere\u201d indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The Court acknowledges that nothing can be gained by this superfluous citation (it admits the footnote is \u201cunnecessary in light of the statute\u2019s unambiguous language,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 236, n. 3, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 87). But much can be lost. Our cases have said that legislative history is irrelevant when the statutory text is clear. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. 1, 6, 117 S. Ct. 1032, 137 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1997); <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 254, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 117 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1992). The footnote advises conscientious attorneys that this is not true, and that they must spend time and their clients\u2019 treasure combing the annals of legislative history in <em>all </em>cases: to buttress their case where the statutory text is unambiguously in their favor; and to attack an unambiguous text that is against them. If legislative history is relevant to confirm that a clear text means what it says, it is presumably relevant to show that an apparently clear text does not mean what it seems to say. Even for those who believe in the legal fiction that committee reports reflect congressional intent, footnote 3 is a bridge too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">[559 U.S. 255]</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\"> The Court protests that the earlier hearing was \u201cpart of the record cited by the 2005 House Report,\u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 236, n. 3, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 87. The page it cites, however, does nothing more than note that the earlier hearing took place, see H. R. Rep. No. 109-31, pt. 1, p. 7 (2005). Are we to believe that this brought to the attention of the Committee (much less of the whole Congress) an attachment to the testimony of one of the witnesses at that long-ago hearing? Of course not. That legislative history shows what \u201cCongress\u201d intended is a fiction requiring no support in reality.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b186-7\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"A6q\">concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">I concur in the judgment and join all but Part III\u2014C of the Court\u2019s opinion. I agree with the Court that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528\u2019s advertising disclosure requirements survive First Amendment scrutiny on the record before us. I write separately because different reasons lead me to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">I have never been persuaded that there is any basis in the First Amendment for the relaxed scrutiny this Court applies to laws that suppress nonmisleading commercial speech. See <em>44 </em>Liquormart, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>517 U.S. 484, 522-523, 116 S. Ct. 1495, 134 L.

Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980)). In this case, the Court applies a still lower standard of scrutiny to review a law that compels the disclosure of commercial <em>speech\u2014i.e., </em>the rule articulated in <em>Zauderer </em>v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, </em>471 U.S. 626, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1985), that laws that require the disclosure of factual information in commercial advertising may be upheld so long as they are \u201creasonably related\u201d to the government\u2019s interest in preventing consumer deception, <em>id., </em>at 651, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>I am skeptical of the premise on which <em>Zauderer </em>rests\u2014that, in the commercial-speech context, \u201cthe First Amendment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is actually suppressed,\u201d <em>id.., </em>at 652, n. 14, 105 S.

We have refused in other contexts to attach any \u201cconstitutional significance\u201d to the difference between regulations that compel protected speech and regulations that restrict it. See, <em>e.g., Riley </em>v. <em>National Federation of Blind. of N. C., Inc., </em>487 U.S. 781, 796-797, 108 S. Ct. 2667, 101 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1988). I see no reason why that difference should acquire constitutional significance merely because the regulations at issue involve commercial speech. See <em>Glickman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">[559 U.S. 256]</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">v. <em>Wileman Brothers &amp; Elliott, Inc., </em>521 U.S. 457, 480-481, 117 S. Ct. 2130, 138 L.

See <em>Borgner </em>v. <em>Florida Bd. of Dentistry, </em>537 U.S. 1080, 1082, 123 S. Ct. 688, 154 L. Ed. 2d 580 (2002) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). <em>Zauderer </em>upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attorney under a rule of professional conduct that required advertisements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>for contingency-fee services to disclose that losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees and costs. See 471 U.S., at 650-653, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652. Importantly, however, Zauderer\u2019s advertisement was found to be misleading on its face, and the regulation in that case did not mandate the specific form or text of the disclosure. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, <em>Zauderer </em>does not stand for the proposition that the government can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted disclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in preventing consumer deception might plausibly be at stake. In other words, a bare assertion by the government that a disclosure requirement is \u201cintended\u201d to prevent consumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to uphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls within its sweep. See <em>ante, </em>at 250, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations aimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissible only where \u201cthe particular advertising is <em>inherently likely </em>to deceive or where the record indicates that a particular form or method of advertising has <em>in fact </em>been deceptive.\u201d <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 202, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1982) (emphasis added); see <em>Zauderer, supra, </em>at 651, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652 (\u201crecogniz[ing] that unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the First Amendment\u201d). Therefore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional muster only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements that, by their nature, possess these traits. See <em>R.M.J., supra, </em>at 202, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64; <em>Ibanez </em>v. <em>Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, </em>512 U.S. 136, 143, 146-147, 114 S. Ct. 2084, 129 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">I do not read the Court\u2019s opinion to hold otherwise. See <em>ante, </em>at 250, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 95. Accordingly, and with that understanding,</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">[559 U.S. 258]</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">I turn to the question whether Milavetz\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements survives <em>Zauderer </em>scrutiny on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz\u2019s challenge inhibits our review of its First Amendment claim. See <em>ante, </em>at 249, n. 7, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 94. Milavetz challenged \u00a7 528\u2019s constitutionality before the statute had ever been enforced against any of the firm\u2019s advertisements. Although Milavetz purports to challenge \u00a7 528 only \u201c \u2018as-applied\u2019 \u201d to its own advertising, see <em>ante, </em>at 248-249, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 94, it did not introduce any evidence or exhibits to substantiate its claim. Thus, no court has seen a sampling of Milavetz\u2019s advertisements or even a declaration describing their contents and the media through which Milavetz seeks to transmit them. As a consequence, Mi-lavetz\u2019s nominal \u201cas-applied\u201d challenge appears strikingly similar to a facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We generally disapprove of such challenges because they \u201coften rest on speculation\u201d and require courts to engage in \u201c \u2018premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually bare-bones records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington State Grange </em>v. <em>Washington State Republican Party, </em>552 U.S. 442, 450, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 170 L. Ed. 2d 151 (2008) (quoting <em>Sabri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>541 U.S. 600, 609, 124 S. Ct. 1941, 158 L. Ed. 2d 891 (2004)). Milavetz\u2019s claim invites the same problems. Milavetz alleges that \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements are unconstitutional as applied to its advertisements because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>its advertisements are not misleading and because the disclaimer required by \u00a7 528 will create, rather than reduce, confusion for Milavetz\u2019s potential clients. That may well be true. But because no record evidence of Milavetz\u2019s advertisements exists to guide our review, we can only speculate about the ways in which the statute might be applied to Milavetz\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">When forced to determine the constitutionality of a statute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the law if there is any \u201cconceivabl[e]\u201d manner in which it can be enforced consistent with the First Amendment. <em>Washington</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">[559 U.S. 259]</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\"><em>State Grange, supra, </em>at 456, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 170 L. Ed. 2d 151. In this case, both parties agree that \u00a7 528\u2019s disclosure requirements cover, at a minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to \u201c \u2018wipe out\u2019 \u201d debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the means of accomplishing this goal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brief for Milavetz 82, 86; Brief for United States 60-62. As a result, there is at least one set of facts on which the statute could be constitutionally applied. Thus, I agree with the Court that Milavetz\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 528 must fail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-12\">. I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are false or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be proscribed. See <em>44 Liquormart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>517 U.S. 484, 520, 116 S. Ct. 1495, 134 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Furthermore, I acknowledge this Court\u2019s longstanding assumption that a consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain factual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on First Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all advertisements that have the potential to mislead. See, <em>e.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 771-772, 96 S. Ct. 1817, 48 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1976); <em>Zauderer </em>v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, </em>471 U.S. 626, 651-652, n. 14, 105 S. Ct. 2265, 85 L.

But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt that it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations that compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. At oral argument, Milavetz\u2019s counsel declined to describe Milavetz\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26, and Milavetz\u2019s briefs make no such contention. But even viewing Milavetz\u2019s argument as a claim that \u00a7 528 is facially overbroad because it applies to nonmisleading advertisements for bankruptcy-related services, such an argument must fail. First, as noted, Milavetz acknowledges that \u00a7 528 can be constitutionally applied to deceptive bankruptcy-related advertisements and, thus, at least one \u201cset of circumstances exists under which [\u00a7 528] would be valid.\u2019\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.

Second, Milavetz does not attempt to argue that \u00a7 528\u2019s unconstitutional applications are \u201csubstantial\u2019\u2019 in number when judged in relation to this \u201cplainly legitimate sweep.\u2019\u2019 <em>Washington State Grange </em>v. <em>Washington State Republican Party, </em>552 U.S. 442, 449-450, and n. 6, 128 S.
