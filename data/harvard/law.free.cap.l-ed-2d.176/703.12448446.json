Narcotics Agents, </em>U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971), against U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) personnel for constitutional violations arising out of their official duties.  When federal employees are sued for damages for harms caused in the course of their employment, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671-2680, generally authorizes substitution of the United States as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-18\">[559 U.S. 802]</p>\n<p id=\"b796-19\">Section 233(a) makes the FTCA remedy against the United States \u201cexclusive of any other civil action or proceeding\u201d for any personal injury caused by a PHS officer or employee performing a medical or related function \u201cwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d Based on the plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>guage of \u00a7 233(a), we conclude that PHS officers and employees are not personally subject to <em>Bivens </em>actions for harms arising out of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Francisco Castaneda was detained by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the San Diego Correctional Facility (SDCF) beginning in March 2006. According to the complaint later filed in the District Court, when Castaneda arrived at SDCF he had on his penis an irregular, raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters square.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Castaneda promptly brought his condition to the attention of medical personnel working for the Division of Immigration Health Services, reporting that the lesion was growing in size and becoming more painful and that it frequently bled and emitted a discharge. Petitioner Dr. Esther Hui, a civilian PHS employee, was the physician responsible for Castaneda\u2019s medical care during his detention at SDCF. Petitioner Commander Stephen Gonsalves, a commissioned PHS officer, was a health services administrator at SDCF during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Between March 2006 and January 2007, Castaneda persistently sought treatment for his condition. As his disease progressed, the lesion became increasingly painful and interfered with his urination, defecation, and sleep. In December 2006, Castaneda additionally reported a lump in his groin. A PHS physician\u2019s assistant and three outside specialists</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">[559 U.S. 803]</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">repeatedly advised that Castaneda needed a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer. Petitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recommended procedures as \u201celective.\u201d App. 244, 249-251. Instead, Castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and antibiotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">After a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in January 2007, the procedure was finally authorized. Instead of providing treatment, however, ICE released Castaneda from custody on February 5. A week later, biopsy results confirmed that Castaneda was suffering from penile cancer. The next day, Castaneda had his penis amputated, and he began chemotherapy after tests confirmed that the cancer had metastasized to his groin. The treatment was unsuccessful, and Castaneda died in February 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Three months before his death, Castaneda filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As relevant, Castaneda raised medical negligence claims against the United States under the FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>claims against petitioners for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Castaneda\u2019s death, respondents\u2014 Castaneda\u2019s sister, Yanira Castaneda, and his daughter, Vanessa Castaneda (by and through her mother, Lucia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Pelayo)\u2014amended the complaint to substitute themselves as plaintiffs. Yanira and Vanessa Castaneda are respectively the representative of and heir to Castaneda\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">[559 U.S. 804]</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them, contending that \u00a7 233(a) gives them absolute immunity from <em>Bivens </em>actions by making a suit against the United States under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for harms caused by PHS personnel in the course of their medical or related duties. The District Court denied the motion, concluding that \u00a7 233(a)\u2019s text and history evidence a congressional intent to preserve <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>United States, </em>538 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1288-1295 (2008). Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment that \u00a7 233(a) does not preclude respondents\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>claims. <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>United States, </em>546 F.3d 682 (2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court cited <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980), for the proposition that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is both expressly declared to be a substitute and can be viewed as equally effective, or when special factors militate against direct recovery. Looking to the statute\u2019s text and history, the court noted that \u00a7 233(a) does not mention the Constitution or recovery thereunder and found it significant that \u00a7 233 was enacted prior to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bivens. </em>Drawing further support for its view from the statute\u2019s legislative history and from subsequent congressional enactments, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7 233(a) does not expressly make the remedy under the FTCA a substitute for relief under <em>Bivens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">[559 U.S. 805]</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">For essentially the reasons given in <em>Carlson, </em>446 U.S., at 20-23, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15, the Court of Appeals also determined that the FTCA remedy is not equally effective as a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. Unlike the remedy under the FTCA, the court reasoned, a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is awarded against individual defendants and may include punitive damages. Additionally, <em>Bivens </em>cases may be tried before a jury, and liability is governed by uniform federal rules rather than the law of the State in which the violation occurred. After further concluding that no special factors militate against finding a remedy available in these circumstances, the court held that respondents\u2019 <em>Bivens </em>action could proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">As the Ninth Circuit recognized, its holding conflicts with the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Cuoco </em>v. <em>Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99 (2000), which construed \u00a7 233(a) to foreclose <em>Bivens </em>actions against PHS personnel. We granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>certiorari to resolve this conflict. 557 U.S. 966, 130 S. Ct. 49, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Our inquiry in this case begins and ends with the text of \u00a7 233(a). See <em>Harris Trust and Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Salomon Smith Barney Inc., </em>530 U.S. 238, 254, 120 S. Ct. 2180, 147 L. Ed. 2d 187 (2000). The statute provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201c[t]he remedy <em>against the United. States </em>provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28 . . . for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions, including the conduct of clinical studies or investigation, by any commissioned officer or employee of the Public Health Service while acting within the scope of his office or employment, <em>shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject-matter against the officer or employee </em>(or his estate) whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\u201d \u00a7 233(a) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">[559 U.S. 806]</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Section 233(a) grants absolute immunity to PHS officers and employees for actions arising out of the performance of medical or related functions within the scope of their employment by barring all actions against them for such conduct. By its terms, \u00a7 233(a) limits recovery for such conduct to suits against the United States. The breadth of the words \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cany\u201d supports this reading, as does the provision\u2019s inclusive reference to all civil proceedings arising out of \u201cthe same subject-matter.\u201d We have previously cited \u00a7 233(a) to support the contention that \u201cCongress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it means to make FTCA an exclusive remedy.\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>446 U.S., at 20, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15. The meaning of \u00a7 233(a) has become no less explicit since we last made that observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Our reading of \u00a7 233(a)\u2019s text is not undermined by the fact that the provision preceded our decision in <em>Biv-ens. </em>Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy had not yet been recognized when \u00a7 233(a) was enacted does not support the conclusion that Congress, in making the remedy provided by the FTCA \u201cexclusive of any other civil action,\u201d did not mean what it said. Language that broad easily accommodates both known and unknown causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">The later enacted Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act), 102 Stat. 4563, further supports this understanding of \u00a7 233(a). The West-fall Act amended the FTCA to make its remedy against the United States the exclusive remedy for most claims against Government employees arising out of their official conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In providing this official immunity, Congress used</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">[559 U.S. 807]</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">essentially the same language as it did in \u00a7 233(a), stating that the remedy against the United States is \u201cexclusive of any other civil action or proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2679(b)(1). Notably, Congress also provided an exception for constitutional viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>tions. Pursuant to \u00a7 2679(b)(2), the immunity granted by \u00a7 2679(b)(1) \u201cdoes not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government . . . brought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A). The Westfall Act\u2019s explicit exception for <em>Bivens </em>claims is powerful evidence that Congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by \u00a7 2679(b)(1)\u2014or the substantially similar \u00a7 233(a)\u2014to imply such an exception. Given Congress\u2019 awareness of pre-existing immunity provisions like \u00a7 233 when it enacted the Westfall Act, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>499 U.S. 160, 173, 111 S. Ct. 1180, 113 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1991), it is telling that Congress declined to enact a similar exception to the immunity provided by \u00a7 233(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In advocating a contrary reading of \u00a7 233(a), respondents rely heavily on our opinion in <em>Carlson, </em>as did the Court of Appeals. <em>Carlson, </em>however, is inapposite to the issue in this case.  There are two separate inquiries involved in determining whether a <em>Bivens </em>action may proceed against a federal agent: whether the agent is amenable to suit, and whether a damages remedy is available for a particular constitutional violation absent authorization by Congress. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 684, 107 S. Ct. 3054, 97 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1987) (\u201c[T]he availability of a damages action under the Constitution for particular <em>injuries </em>... is a question logically distinct from immunity to such an action on the part of particular <em>defendants\u201d). </em>Even in circumstances in which a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is generally available, an action under <em>Bivens </em>will be defeated if the defendant is immune from suit. See, <em>e.g., </em>403 U.S., at 397-398, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (remanding for determination of respondents\u2019 immunity after implying a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">[559 U.S. 808]</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Because petitioners in <em>Carlson </em>invoked no official immunity, the Court did not address that question. Instead, it considered whether a remedy was available under the Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a federal remedy was also available under the FTCA. 446 U.S., at 16-17, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15. Many of our subsequent <em>Bivens </em>decisions likewise addressed only the existence of an implied cause of action for an alleged constitutional violation. See, <em>e.g., Wilkie </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>551 U.S. 537, 549, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 168 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2007) (declining \u201cto devise a new <em>Bivens </em>damages action for retaliating against the exercise of ownership rights\u201d); <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 368, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 76 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1983) (declining to \u201cauthorize a new nonstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose First Amendment rights are violated by their superiors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">This case presents the separate question whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations.  To determine a defendant\u2019s amenability to suit, we consider whether he or she may claim the benefits of official immunity for the alleged misconduct. Because petitioners invoke only the immunity provided by \u00a7 233(a), the question in this case is answered solely by reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>whether that provision gives petitioners the immunity they claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">As noted, the text of \u00a7 233(a) plainly indicates that it precludes a <em>Bivens </em>action against petitioners for the harm alleged in this case. Respondents offer three arguments in support of their claim that it does not. None persuades us that \u00a7 233(a) means something other than what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Respondents first contend that \u00a7 233(a) incorporates the entirety of the FTCA, as amended by the West-fall Act, through its reference to \u00a7 1346(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 1346(b) in turn</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">[559 U.S. 809]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">refers to \u201cthe provisions of chapter 171,\u201d which constitute the FTCA, including the Westfall Act\u2019s exception for claims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A). Through this series of cross-references, respondents would read that exception for <em>Bivens </em>actions into \u00a7 233(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Section 233(a) is not susceptible of this reading. As petitioners observe, that provision refers only to \u201c [t]he <em>remedy </em>against the United States provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672.\u201d \u00a7 233(a) (emphasis added). Thus, only those portions of chapter 171 that establish the FTCA remedy are incorporated by \u00a7 233(a)\u2019s reference to \u00a7 1346. Section 2679(b) is not such a provision. Section 233(a)\u2019s reference to \u00a7 2672<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2014which is codified in chapter 171\u2014also belies respondents\u2019 theory. If \u00a7 233(a)\u2019s reference to \u00a7 1346(b) served to incorporate all the provisions of chapter 171, the separate reference to \u00a7 2672 would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Respondents next argue that the Westfall Act\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>exception, \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a <em>Bivens </em>action against PHS officers and employees. That \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A) by its terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in \u201c[paragraph (1)\u201d belies respondents\u2019 claim. Moreover, if \u00a7 233(a) forecloses a <em>Bivens </em>action against PHS personnel, respondents\u2019 reading of \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of that more specific provision. Although we</p>\n<p id=\"Alh8\">[559 U.S. 810]</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">noted in <em>Smith </em>that \u00a7 2679(b) applies to all federal employees, see 499 U.S., at 173, 111 S. Ct. 1180, 113 L. Ed. 2d 134, we had no occasion to consider whether the <em>Bivens </em>exception in \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A) impliedly repealed pre-existing immunity provisions to the extent of any inconsistency. \u201cAs we have emphasized,  repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.\u201d <em>Hawaii </em>v. <em>Office of Hawaiian Affairs, </em>556 U.S. 163, 175, 129 S. Ct. 1436, 173 L. Ed. 2d 333 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>(2009) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Respondents have pointed to nothing in \u00a7 2679(b)\u2019s text or drafting history that suggests that Congress intended to repeal the more comprehensive immunity provided by \u00a7 233(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Finally, respondents contend that other features of \u00a7 233 show that subsection (a) does not make the remedy under the FTCA exclusive of all other actions against PHS personnel. Respondents first note \u00a7 233\u2019s lack of a procedure for \u201cscope certification\u201d in federal-court actions.  Under the FTCA, \u201ccertification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose\u201d transforms an action against an individual federal employee into one against the United States. \u00a7 2679(d)(1). Because \u00a7 233 does not provide a similar mechanism for scope certification in federal-court actions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> respondents contend that PHS defendants seeking to invoke the immunity provided by \u00a7 233(a) must rely on the FTCA\u2019s scope certification procedure, set forth in \u00a7 2679(d). Section 2679(d), respondents note, is in turn subject to the \u201climitations and exceptions\u201d applicable to actions under the FTCA\u2014including the</p>\n<p id=\"Aknx\">[559 U.S. 811]</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">exception for <em>Bivens </em>actions provided by \u00a7 2679(b)(2). See \u00a7 2679(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We agree with petitioners that there is no reason to think that scope certification by the Attorney General is a prerequisite to immunity under \u00a7 233(a). To be sure, that immunity is contingent upon the alleged misconduct having occurred in the course of the PHS defendant\u2019s duties, but a defendant may make that proof pursuant to the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure. As petitioners observe,  proof of scope is in most \u00a7 233(a) cases established by a declaration affirming that the defendant was a PHS official during the relevant time period. See Reply Brief for Petitioner Hui 6-7, and n. 1. Thus, while scope certification may provide a convenient mechanism for establishing that the alleged misconduct occurred within the scope of the employee\u2019s duties, the procedure authorized by \u00a7 2679(d) is not necessary to effect substitution of the United States. Finally, that the FTCA\u2019s scope certification procedure was enacted almost two decades after \u00a7 233(a) confirms that Congress did not intend to make that procedure the exclusive means for PHS personnel to invoke the official immunity provided by \u00a7 233(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Respondents\u2019 argument based on \u00a7 233(f) is similarly unavailing.  That subsection authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \u201chold harmless or provide liability insurance\u201d for a PHS officer or employee for personal injuries caused by conduct occurring \u201cwithin the scope of his office or employment ... if such employee is assigned to a foreign country . . . and if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against the United States described in section 2679(b).\u201d Noting that the FTCA precludes recovery against the United States for \u201c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\u201d \u00a7 2680(k), respondents urge that \u00a7 233(f)\u2019s authorization of insurance or indemnification in those circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>stances anticipates that an injured</p>\n<p id=\"AUPh\">[559 U.S. 812]</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">party without a remedy under the FTCA may sue a PHS official directly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, respondents contend, \u00a7 233(a) cannot be read to make the remedy under the FTCA truly exclusive. Even if that reading of \u00a7 233(f) were correct, it would not benefit respondents because an FTCA remedy is unquestionably available for the misconduct alleged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">For the foregoing reasons, respondents\u2019 arguments do not undermine our conclusion that the immunity provided by \u00a7 233(a) precludes <em>Bivens </em>actions against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of conduct described in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"pA-Bg\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"34\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASMAAAAjAQAAAAD3LFE0AAAAnElEQVR4nO3TvQkCQRCG4XeHCwwES9DcJhQsxBLswcIswdRwbeA4wUAU/Ax3gg80OCOd7JkfmIXZIt7HOT5ogp/pGnLGIQBOueAw9l7XyaIlLALoU94jgFm+C4sOmO62reAhSXulMKgBsMnvsZD0XKZphxrAfb1q0x6Shn7exh1qAJeSNvGQ9Dge2rhDDaC7pVUsxryJ8v/bX+h6ASU9q/sBvpxcAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"291\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In construing \u00a7 233(a) in petitioners\u2019 favor, we are mindful of the confines of our judicial role. Respondents\u2019 <em>amici </em>caution that providing special immunity for PHS personnel is contrary to the public interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Respondents likewise contend that allowing <em>Bivens </em>claims against PHS personnel is necessary to ensure an adequate standard of care in federal detention facilities, and they further urge that permitting such actions would not endanger PHS\u2019 institutional interests as it would simply place PHS personnel in the same position as other federal employees who perform similar functions. See Brief for Respondents 52-55, 60-61. We are required, however, to read the statute according to its text. Because</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">[559 U.S. 813]</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">\u00a7 233(a) plainly precludes a <em>Bivens </em>action against petitioners for the harms alleged in this case, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-11\">. Because this case comes to us on petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of respondents\u2019 factual allegations. See <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Barnstable School Comm., </em>555 U.S. 246, 249, 129 S. Ct. 788, 172 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-12\">.  In <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971), this Court recognized an implied cause of action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated the petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. We subsequently found such a remedy available for violations of an individual\u2019s rights under the Cruel and Unusual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause. See <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 17-19, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 230, 99 S. Ct. 2264, 60 L.

Although it does not bear directly on the question presented in this case, we note that while petitioners\u2019 appeal was pending the Government filed a formal notice admitting liability with respect to respondents\u2019 claims for medical negligence under the FTCA. App. 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b798-13\">. The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal because district court orders denying absolute immunity constitute \u201cfinal decisions\u2019\u2019 for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. See 546 F.3d, at 687 (citing <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 524-527, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L.

Prior to the Westfall Act amendments, the FTCA authorized substitution of the United States as a defendant in suits against federal employees for harms arising out of conduct undertaken in the scope of their employment, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (1982 ed.), but it made that remedy \u201cexclusive\u201d only for harms resulting from a federal employee\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle, \u00a7 2679(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-12\">. We express no opinion as to whether a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is otherwise available in these circumstances, as the question is not presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b801-13\">. Section 1346(b) provides in pertinent part that,  \u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of [Title 28], the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\">.  Section 2672 authorizes agency heads and their designees to \u201cconsider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\">. Section 233(c) includes such a provision for state-court actions, authorizing removal to federal court \u201c[u]pon a certification by the Attorney General that the defendant was acting in the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose,\u201d but unlike \u00a7 2679(d) it does not prescribe a particular mechanism for substituting the United States in federal-court actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. As respondents note, the Westfall Act substantially limited the effect of \u00a7 233(f). See Brief for Respondents 32 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>499 U.S. 160, 166-167, 111 S. Ct. 1180, 113 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1991)). But because the Act does not weaken any inference about the meaning of \u00a7 233(a) that might be drawn from \u00a7 233(f), the changes effected by the Act are not relevant to the instant inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b803-12\">.
