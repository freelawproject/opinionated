One of those customers is Ani-malFeeds International Corp. (hereinafter AnimalFeeds), which supplies raw ingredients, such as fish oil, to animal-feed producers around the world. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Numerous charter parties are in regular use, and the charter party that AnimalFeeds uses is known as the \u201cVegoilvoy\u201d charter party. Petitioners assert, without contradiction, that charterers</p>\n<p id=\"ADD_\">[559 U.S. 667]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">like Ani-malFeeds, or their agents\u2014not the shipowners\u2014typically select the particular charter party that governs their shipments. Accord, Trowbridge, Admiralty Law Institute: Symposium on Charter Parties: The History, Development, and Characteristics of the Charter Concept, 49 Tulane L. Rev. 743, 753 (1975) (\u2018Voyage charter parties are highly standardized, with many commodities and charterers having their own specialized forms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">Adopted in 1950, the Vegoilvoy charter party contains the following arbitration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-18\">\u201cArbitration. Any dispute arising from the making, performance or termination of this Charter Party shall be settled in New York, Owner and Charterer each appointing an arbitrator, who shall be a merchant, broker or individual experienced in the shipping business; the two thus chosen, if they cannot agree, shall nominate a third arbitrator who shall be an Admiralty lawyer. Such arbitration shall be conducted in conformity with the provisions and procedure of the United States Arbitration Act <em>[i.e., </em>the FAA], and a judgment of the Court shall be entered upon any award made by said arbitrator.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-19\">In 2003, a Department of Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>criminal investigation revealed that petitioners were engaging in an illegal price-fixing conspiracy. When AnimalFeeds learned of this, it brought a putative class action against petitioners in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserting antitrust claims for supracompetitive prices that petitioners allegedly charged their customers over a period of several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Other charterers brought similar suits. In one of these, the District Court for the District of Connecticut held that the charterers\u2019 claims were not subject to arbitration under the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second Circuit reversed. See <em>JLM Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stolt-Nielsen S. </em>A., 387</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">[559 U.S. 668]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">F.3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was pending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against petitioners, including AnimalFeeds\u2019 action, in the District of Connecticut. See <em>In re Parcel Tanker Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litigation, </em>296 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1371, and n. 1 (2003). The parties agree that as a consequence of these judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand for class arbitration, designating New York City as the place of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of \u201c[a] 11 direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils, acids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any time during the period from August 1, 1998, to November 30, 2002.\u201d 548 F.3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental agreement providing for the question of class arbitration to be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to \u201cfollow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were developed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) after our decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. 444, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414 (2003), and  Class Rule 3, in accordance with the plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator, as a threshold matter, to determine \u201cwhether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.\u201d App. 56a.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipulated that the arbitration clause was \u201csilent\u201d with respect to class arbitration. Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to the arbitration panel that the term \u201csilent\u201d did not simply mean that</p>\n<p id=\"AvBlB\">[559 U.S. 669]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">the clause made no express reference to class arbitration. Rather, he said, \u201c[a] 11 the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue there\u2019s been no agreement that has been reached on that issue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 77a.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">After hearing argument and evidence, including testimony from petitioners\u2019 experts regarding arbitration customs and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators concluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other arbitrators ruling after <em>Bazzle </em>had construed \u201ca wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration,\u201d but the panel acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>edged that none of these decisions was \u201cexactly comparable\u201d to the present dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a-50a. Petitioners\u2019 expert evidence did not show an \u201cin ten [t] to preclude class arbitration,\u201d the arbitrators reasoned, and petitioners\u2019 argument would leave \u201cno basis for a class action absent express agreement among all parties and the putative class members.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 51a.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the parties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an application to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. See  9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4) (authorizing a district court to \u201cmake an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration . . . where the arbitrators exceeded their powers\u201d); Petition To Vacate Arbitration Award, No. 1:06-CV-00420-JSR (SDNY) App. in No. 06-3474-cv (CA2), p. A-17, \u00b6 16 (citing \u00a7 10(a)(4) as a ground for vacatur of the award); see also <em>id., </em>at A-15 to A-16, \u00b6 9 (invoking the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1333). The District Court vacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators\u2019 decision was made in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the law insofar as the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analysis. 435 F. Supp. 2d 382, 384-385 (SDNY 2006). See <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 436-437, 74 S. Ct. 182, 98 L. Ed. 168 (1953) (\u201c[T]he interpretations of the law by the arbitrators</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">[559 U.S. 670]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation\u201d); see also Petition To Vacate Arbitration Award, <em>supra, </em>at A-17, \u00b6 17 (alleging that the arbitration panel \u201cmanifestly disregarded the law\u201d). Had such an analysis been conducted, the District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied the rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts be interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp. 2d, at 385-386.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(E) (\u201cAn appeal may be taken from ... an order . . . vacating an award\u201d). As an initial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d standard survived our decision in <em>Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. </em>v. <em>Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008), as a \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the enumerated grounds for vacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. 548 F.3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a federal maritime rule of custom and usage <em>against </em>class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision was not in manifest disregard of federal maritime law. <em>Id., </em>at 97-98. Nor had the arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the Court of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York case law established a rule against class arbitration. <em>Id., </em>at 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 903, 129 S. Ct. 2793, 174 L. Ed. 2d 289 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>[559 U.S. 671]</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Petitioners contend that the decision of the arbitration panel must be vacated, but  in order to obtain that relief, they must clear a high hurdle. It is not enough for petitioners to show that the panel committed an error\u2014or even a serious error. See <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. </em>v. <em>Mine Workers, </em>531 U.S. 57, 62, 121 S. Ct. 462, 148 L. Ed. 2d 354 (2000); <em>Paperworkers </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987). \u201cIt is only when [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively \u2018dispense [s] his own brand of industrial justice\u2019 that his decision may be unenforceable.\u201d <em>Major League Baseball Players Assn. </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>532 U.S. 504, 509, 121 S. Ct. 1724, 149 L. Ed. 2d 740 (2001) <em>(per curiam) </em>(quoting <em>Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">[559 U.S. 672]</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\"><em>Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1424 (1960)). In that situation, an arbitration decision may be vacated under \u00a7 10(a)(4) of the FAA on the ground that the arbitrator \u201cexceeded [his] powers,\u201d for the task of an arbitrator is to interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy. In this case, we must conclude that what the arbitration panel did was simply to impose its own view of sound policy regarding class arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">In its memorandum of law filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the arbitration proceedings, Animal-Feeds made three arguments in support of construing the arbitration clause to permit class arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">\u201cThe parties\u2019 arbitration clause should be construed to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the issue of class treatment and, without express prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under Bazzle; <em>(b) the clause should be construed to permit class arbitration as a matter of public policy, </em>and (c) the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable if it forbade class arbitration.\u201d App. in No. 06-3474-cv (CA2), at A-308 to A-309 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds\u2019 first argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing about the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested</p>\n<p id=\"ALFP\">[559 U.S. 673]</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">its decision on AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument.  Because the parties agreed their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d in the sense that they had not reached any agreement on the issue of class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was to identify the rule of law that governs in that situation. Had they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably would have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the two bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing, <em>i.e., </em>either federal maritime law or New York law. But the panel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule of decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt to determine what rule would govern under either maritime or New York law in the case of a \u201csilent\u201d contract. Instead, the panel based its decision on <em>post-Bazzle </em>arbi-tral decisions that \u201cconstrued a wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a-50a. The panel did not mention whether any of these decisions were based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law, or New York law contains a \u201cdefault rule\u201d under which an arbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitration in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded as if it</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">[559 U.S. 674]</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">had the authority of a common-law court to develop what it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a situation. Perceiving a post-<em>Bazzle </em>consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in \u201ca wide variety of settings,\u201d the panel considered only whether there was any good reason not to follow that consensus in this case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a-50a. The panel was not persuaded by \u201ccourt cases denying consolidation of arbitrations,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>charter party had \u201cnever been the basis of a class action,\u201d or by expert opinion that \u201csophisticated, multinational commercial parties of the type that are sought to be included in the class would never intend that the arbitration clauses would permit a class arbitration.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">[559 U.S. 675]</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 50a-51a. Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for departing from the <em>post-Bazzle </em>ar-bitral consensus, the panel held that class arbitration was permitted in this case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a. The conclusion is inescapable that the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">[559 U.S. 676]</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references to intent, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>none of these shows that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference. The opinion states that, under <em>Bazzle, </em>\u201carbitrators must look to the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to ascertain the parties\u2019 intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action,\u201d and the panel added that \u201c[t]his is also consistent with New York law.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. But the panel had no occasion to \u201cascertain the parties\u2019 intention\u201d in the present case because the parties were in complete agreement regarding their intent. In the very next sentence after the one quoted above, the panel acknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the Vegoilvoy charter party was \u201csilent on whether [it] permitted] or preclude [d] class arbitration,\u201d but that the charter party was \u201cnot ambiguous so as to call for parol evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This stipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties\u2019 intent, and any inquiry into that settled question would have been outside the panel\u2019s assigned task.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The panel also commented on the breadth of the language in the Vegoil-voy charter party, see id., at 50a, but since the only task that was left for the panel, in light of the parties\u2019 stipulation, was to identify the governing rule applicable in a case in which neither the language of the contract nor any other evidence established that the parties had reached any agreement on the question of class arbitration, the particular wording of the charter party was quite beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New York</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">[559 U.S. 677]</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy choice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result,  under \u00a7 10(b) of the FAA, we must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by the arbitrators\u201d or decide the question that was originally referred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can be only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">The arbitration panel thought that <em>Bazzle </em>\u201ccontrolled\u201d the \u201cresolution\u201d of the question whether the Vegoilvoy charter party \u201cpermit[s] this arbitration to proceed on behalf of a class,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a-49a, but that understanding was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\"><em>Bazzle </em>concerned contracts between a commercial lender (Green Tree) and its customers. These contracts contained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention class arbitration. Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted class arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the awards. <em>Bazzle </em>v. <em>Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>351 S.C. 244, 569 S.E.2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Seventh Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority to order classwide arbitration under \u00a7 4 of the FAA, see <em>Champ </em>v. <em>Siegel Trading Co., </em>55 F.3d 269 (1995), and conflicting California precedent, see <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Alameda Cty., </em>31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P.2d 1192 (1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the California approach, which it characterized as permitting a trial court to \u201corder class-wide arbitration under adhesive but enforceable franchise contracts,\u201d 351 S.C., at 259, 266, 569 S.E.2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Carolina court observed, a trial judge must \u201c[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">[559 U.S. 678]</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">of requiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual basis against \u201cresulting prejudice to the drafting party\u201d and should take into account factors such as \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cequity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 260, and n. 15, 569 S.E.2d, at 357, and n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Applying these standards to the case before it, the South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause in the Green Tree contracts was \u201csilent regarding class-wide arbitration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 263, 569 S.E.2d, at 359 (emphasis deleted). The court described its holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201c[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be ordered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it would serve efficiency and equity, and would not result in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhesive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting party could effectively prevent class actions against it without having to say it was doing so in the agreement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 266, 569 S.E.2d, at 360 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">When <em>Bazzle </em>reached this Court, no single rationale commanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who joined the judgment\u2014that is, the plurality opinion and Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion\u2014collectively addressed three separate questions. The first was which decisionmaker (court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts in question were \u201csilent\u201d on the issue of class arbitration. The second was what standard the appropriate decisionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA entirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit class arbitration only under limited circumstances, such as when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this question left entirely to state law?) The final question was whether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">[559 U.S. 679]</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">The plurality opinion decided only the first question, concluding that the arbitrator and not a court should decide whether the contracts were indeed \u201csilent\u201d on the issue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, \u201c[i]n certain limited circumstances,\u201d involving \u201cgateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy,\u201d it is assumed \u201cthat the parties intended courts, not arbitrators,\u201d to make the decision. 539 U.S., at 452, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414. But the plurality opined that the question whether a contract with an arbitration clause forbids class arbitration \u201cdoes not fall into this narrow exception.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The plurality therefore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme Court should be vacated and that the case should be remanded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question whether the contracts were indeed \u201csilent.\u201d The plurality did not decide either the second or the third question noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment vacating and remanding because otherwise there would have been \u201cno controlling judgment of the Court,\u201d but he did not endorse the plurality\u2019s rationale. <em>Id., </em>at 455, 123 S.

See App. 89a (transcript of argument before arbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: \u201cWhat <em>[Bazzle] </em>says is that the contract interpretation issue is left up to the arbitrator, that\u2019s the rule in <em>[BazzleD. </em>In fact, however, only the plurality decided that question.

See <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 279, 289, 122 S. Ct. 754, 151 L.

It falls to courts and arbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations, and when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose sight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the intent of the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>Volt, </em>489 U.S., at 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">From these principles, it follows that  a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party <em>agreed </em>to do so. In this case, however, the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration even though the parties concurred that they had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d on that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view of the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not \u201cestablish that the parties to the charter agreements intended to <em>preclude </em>class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. Even though the parties are sophisticated business entities, even though there is no tradition of class arbitration under maritime law, and even though AnimalFeeds does not dispute that it is customary for the shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a particular shipment, the panel regarded the agreement\u2019s silence on the question of class arbitration as dispositive. The panel\u2019s conclusion is fundamentally at war with  the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that parties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">[559 U.S. 685]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are necessary to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement. Thus, we have said that \u201c \u2018 \u201cprocedural\u201d questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition\u2019 are presumptively <em>not </em>for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to decide.\u201d <em>Howsam </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002) (quoting <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S. Ct. 909, 11 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1964)). This recognition is grounded in the background principle that \u201c[w]hen the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 204 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitration, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. This is so because class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes. See <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate </em>/ <em>Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 31, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991); <em>Mitsubishi Motors, </em>473 U.S., at 628, 105 S.

Ed. 2d 398 (2009) (\u201cParties generally favor arbitration precisely because of the economics of dispute resolution\u201d (citing <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U.S. 105, 123, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001))); <em>Gardner-Denver, supra, </em>at 57, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L.

But the relative benefits of class-action arbitration are much less assured, giving reason to doubt the parties\u2019 mutual consent to resolve</p>\n<p id=\"acif-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 686]</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">disputes through classwide arbitration. Cf. <em>First Options, supra, </em>at 945, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L.

An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed-upon procedure, see, <em>e.g., supra, </em>at 667, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 613, no longer resolves a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement, but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (\u201c[W]e believe domestic class members could be in the hundreds\u201d and that \u201c[t]here could be class members that ship to and from the U. S. who are not domestic who we think would be covered\u201d); see also, <em>e.g., Bazzle, </em>351 S.C., at 251, 569 S.E.2d, at 352-353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals that was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than $14 million by a single arbitrator). Under the Class Rules, \u201c[t]he presumption of privacy and confidentiality\u201d that applies in many bilateral arbitrations \u201cshall not apply in class arbitrations,\u201d see Addendum to Brief for AAA as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>10a (Class Rule 9(a)), thus potentially frustrating the parties\u2019 assumptions when they agreed to arbitrate. The arbitrator\u2019s award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well. Cf. <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 846, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999) (noting that \u201cthe burden of justification rests on the exception\u201d to the general rule that \u201cone is not bound by a judgment <em>in personam </em>in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And the commercial stakes of class-action arbitration are comparable to those of class-action litigation, cf. App. in No. 06-3474-cv (CA2), at A-77, A-79, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, 40, even</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">[559 U.S. 687]</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">though the scope of judicial review is much more limited, see <em>Hall Street, </em>552 U.S., at 588, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254. We think that  the differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume, consistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that the parties\u2019 mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by characterizing the question before the arbitrators as being merely what \u201cprocedural mode\u201d was available to present Animal-Feeds\u2019 claims. <em>Post, </em>at 696, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 631. If the question were that simple, there would be no need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>consider the parties\u2019 intent with respect to class arbitration. See <em>Howsam, supra, </em>at 84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (committing \u201cprocedural questions\u201d presumptively to the arbitrator\u2019s discretion (internal quotation marks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasizing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the question as being whether the parties <em>agreed to authorize </em>class arbitration.

Ripeness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>reflects constitutional considerations that implicate \u201cArticle III limitations on judicial power,\u2019\u2019 as well as \u201cprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\u2019\u2019 <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Catholic Social Services, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 43, 57, n. 18, 113 S. Ct. 2485, 125 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial review, we consider both \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision\u2019\u2019 and \u201cthe hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u2019\u2019 <em>National Park Hospitality Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Interior, </em>538 U.S. 803, 808, 123 S. Ct. 2026, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2003). To the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we granted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree. The arbitration panel\u2019s award means that petitioners must now submit to class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners are correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the parties\u2019 agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class Rule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for AAA as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what they maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would almost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. Cf. <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 143, 95 S. Ct. 335, 42 L.

We think it is clear on these facts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that their question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the dissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that argument as waived, <em>Sprietsma </em>v. <em>Mercury Marine, </em>537 U.S. 51, 56, n. 4, 123 S.

All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA\u2019s Class Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available when the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during the class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F.3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the panel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that \u201c[w]hen you talk about expectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were the subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before <em>[Bazzle], </em>So therefore, if you are going to talk about the parties\u2019 intentions, <em>pre-[Bazzle] </em>class arbitrations were not common, post <em>[Bazzle] </em>they are common.\u201d App. 87a.

The Court of Appeals upheld the award: \u201cBecause the parties specifically agreed that the arbitration panel would decide whether the arbitration claus [e] permitted class arbitration,\u201d the Second Circuit reasoned, \u201cthe arbitration panel did not exceed its authority in deciding that issue\u2014 irrespective of whether it decided the issue correctly.\u201d 548 F.3d 85, 101 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AW4S\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">I consider, first, the fitness of the arbitrators\u2019 clause-construction award for judicial review.

Notably, the arbitrators in the matter at hand labeled their decision \u201cPartial Final Clause Construction Award.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.

It would be better to minimize the number of occasions the parties to arbitration can come to court; on the whole, this benefits the parties, the arbitration process and the courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">While lower court opinions are thus divided, this much is plain: No decision of this Court, until today, has ever approved immediate judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision as preliminary as the \u201cpartial award\u201d made in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">[559 U.S. 693]</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Even if Stolt-Nielsen had a plea ripe for judicial review, the Court should reject it on the merits.

Instead, the panel tied its conclusion that the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration, App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal maritime law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to Rule 3 of the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations. <em>Id., </em>at 49a-50a.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">At the outset of its explanation, the panel rejected the argument, proffered by AnimalFeeds, that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green Tree Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. 444, 123 S.

The panel further noted \u201cthat many of the other panels [had] rejected arguments similar to those advanced by [Stolt-Nielsen].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 50a.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">The Court features a statement counsel for AnimalFeeds made at the hearing before the arbitration panel, and maintains that it belies any argument that the clause in question permits class arbitration: \u201c[A] 11 the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue there\u2019s been no agreement that has been reached on that issue.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 669, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 614 (quoting App. 77a); see <em>ante, </em>at 673, 676, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>684, 687, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 617, 618-619, 624, 625-626, and n. 10. The sentence quoted from the hearing transcript concluded: \u201c[T]herefore there has been <em>no agreement to bar class </em>arbitrations.\u201d App. 77a (emphasis added). Counsel quickly clarified his position: \u201cIt\u2019s also undisputed that the arbitration clause here contains broad language and this language should be interpreted to permit class arbitrations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 79a. See also <em>id., </em>at 80a (noting consistent recognition by arbitration panels that \u201ca silent broadly worded arbitration clause, just like the one at issue here, should be construed to permit class arbitration\u201d); id<em>., </em>at 88a (\u201c[B]road . . . language . . . silent as to class proceedings should be interpreted to permit a class proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">[559 U.S. 696]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Stolt-Nielsen, the panel acknowledged, had vigorously argued, with the support of expert testimony, that \u201cthe bulk of international shippers would never intend to have their disputes decided in a class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a. That concern, the panel suggested, might be met at a later stage; \u201cif a class is certified,\u201d the panel noted, class membership could be confined to those who affirmatively \u201c \u2018opt in\u2019 \u201d to the proceeding. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The question properly before the Court is not whether the arbitrators\u2019 ruling was erroneous, but whether the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers.\u201d \u00a7 10(a)(4). The arbitrators decided a threshold issue, explicitly committed to them, see <em>supra, </em>at 688-689, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 626-627, about the procedural mode available for presentation of AnimalFeeds\u2019 antitrust claims. Cf. <em>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., ante, </em>at 408, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (plurality opinion) (\u201cRules allowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multiple parties) to be litigated together . . . neither change plaintiffs\u2019 separate entitlements to relief nor abridge defendants\u2019 rights; they alter only how the claims are processed.\u201d). That the arbitrators endeavored to perform their assigned task honestly is not contested. \u201cCourts ... do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts.\u201d <em>Paperworkers </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987). The arbitrators here not merely \u201carguably,\u201d but certainly, \u201ccon-stru[ed] . . . the contract\u201d with fidelity to their commission. <em>Ibid. </em>This Court, therefore, may not disturb the arbitrators\u2019 judgment, even if convinced that \u201cserious error\u201d infected the panel\u2019s award. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The Court not only intrudes on a decision the parties referred to arbitrators. It compounds the intrusion by according the arbitrators no opportunity to clarify their decision and thereby to cure the error the Court perceives. Section</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">[559 U.S. 697]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">10(b), the Court asserts, invests in this tribunal authority to \u201cdecide the question that was originally referred to the panel <em>.\u2019\u2019Ante, </em>at 677, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 619. The controlling provision, however, says nothing of the kind. Section 10(b) reads, in full: \u201cIf an award is vacated and the time within which the agreement required the award to be made has not expired, the court may, in its discretion, <em>direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Just as \u00a7 10(a)(4) provides no justification for the Court\u2019s disposition, see <em>supra, </em>at 693-696, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 629-631 and this page, so, too, \u00a7 10(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>provides no grounding for the Court\u2019s peremptory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">For arbitrators to consider whether a claim should proceed on a class basis, the Court apparently demands contractual language one can read as affirmatively authorizing class arbitration. See <em>ante, </em>at 684, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 624 (\u201c[A] party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party <em>agreed </em>to do so.\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 687, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 625-626. The breadth of the arbitration clause, and the absence of any provision waiving or banning class proceedings,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> will not do. <em>Ante, </em>at 684-687, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 624-626.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The Court ties the requirement of affirmative authorization to \u201cthe basic precept that arbitration \u2018is a matter of consent,</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">[559 U.S. 698]</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">not coercion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 681, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 622 (quoting <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., </em>489 U.S. 468, 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1989)). Parties may \u201cspecify <em>with whom </em>they choose to arbitrate,\u201d the Court observes, just as they may \u201climit the issues they choose to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 683, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 623. But arbitrators, in delineating an appropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard such contractual constraints. In this case, for example, AnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only \u201cclaims . . . arising out of any [charter-party agreement] . . . <em>that provides for arbi</em>tration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the proposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of persons \u201cwith whom\u201d Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate, and only \u201cissues\u201d subject to arbitration. <em>Ante, </em>at 683, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 623 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">The Court also links its affirmative-authorization requirement to the parties\u2019 right to stipulate rules under which arbitration may proceed. See <em>ibid. </em>The question, however, is the proper default rule when there is no stipulation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a species of forum-selection clauses. See <em>Scherk </em>v. <em>Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 519, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1974). Suppose the parties had chosen a New York <em>judicial forum </em>for resolution of \u201cany dispute\u201d involving a contract for ocean carriage of goods. There is little question that the designated court, state or federal, would have authority to conduct claims like AnimalFeeds\u2019 on a class basis. Why should the class-action prospect vanish when the \u201cany dispute\u201d clause is contained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, </em>210 F.3d 771, 774-776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract\u2019s authorization to arbitrate \u201c[a]ny dispute\u201d to permit consolidation of arbitrations). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>If the Court is right that arbitrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class proceedings, see <em>ante, </em>at 685-686, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 624-625, then the claimant should retain its right to proceed in that format in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">[559 U.S. 699]</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no more than modest in size, class proceedings may be \u201cthe thing,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>without them, potential claimants will have little, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights. <em>Amchem Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 617, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997); <em>Carnegie </em>v. <em>Household Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe <em>realistic </em>alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\u201d). Mindful that disallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the dimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can mount, I note some stopping points in the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">First, the Court does not insist on express consent to class arbitration. Class arbitration may be ordered if \u201cthere is a contractual basis for concluding that the part[ies] <em>agreed\u201d </em>\u201cto submit to class arbitration.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 684, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 624; see <em>ante, </em>at 687, n. 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 625 (\u201cWe have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support a finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\u201d). Second, by observing that \u201cthe parties [here] are sophisticated business entities,\u201d and \u201cthat it is customary for the shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a particular shipment,\u201d the Court apparently spares from its affirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhesion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. <em>Ante, </em>at 684, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 624. While these qualifications limit the scope of the Court\u2019s decision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators\u2019 judgment should not have been disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"pAY1K\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"60\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAVkAAAA7AQAAAAD5wsSTAAAAmUlEQVR4nO2VsQnDQBAEVw8GZypBasO9uAlnCqVMZagUY5wb3IoSB4ZTsIE2WVDyiu6yGQb+eB6+CRyeqRxvgYwzzjjj+vGoxgMKgHiK8FB75+UmwgPjhwoPjIefCA+M76sIDwAi4t/FPh5iLABKr0dZ4BqrKg+Mv3rZHhi/WxEeGM9XER4Yfy4iPDDuXyI81Hx1TX70GZ8eb01LTl1dUzu0AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"345\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition for want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.
