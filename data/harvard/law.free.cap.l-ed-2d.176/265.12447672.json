Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1979). The following arrangements are typical. A separate entity called an investment adviser creates the mutual fund, which may have no employees of its own. See <em>Kamen </em>v. <em>Kemper Financial Services, Inc., </em>500 U.S. 90, 93, 111 S. Ct. 1711, 114 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1991); <em>Daily Income Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>464 U.S. 523, 536, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1984); <em>Burks, </em>441 U.S., at 480-481, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. The adviser selects the fund\u2019s directors, manages the fund\u2019s investments, and provides other services. See <em>id., </em>at 481, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. Because of the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser, the fund often \u201c \u2018cannot, as a practical matter sever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the forces of arm\u2019s-length bargaining do not work in the mutual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other sectors of the American economy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting S. Rep. No. 91-184, p. 5 (1969) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">[559 U.S. 339]</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201cCongress adopted the [Investment Company Act of 1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse inherent in the structure of investment companies.\u201d <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U.S., at 536, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (internal quotation marks omitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a fund and its investment adviser was \u201cfraught with potential conflicts of interest,\u201d the Act created protections for mutual fund shareholders. <em>Id., </em>at 536-538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 482-483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. Among other things, the Act required that no more than 60 percent of a fund\u2019s directors could be affiliated with the adviser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by the directors and the shareholders of the fund. See \u00a7\u00a7 10, 15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The growth of mutual funds in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s prompted studies of the 1940 Act\u2019s effectiveness in protecting investors. See <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U.S., at 537-538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identified problems relating to the independence of investment company boards and the compensation received by investment advisers. See <em>ibid. </em>In response to such concerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered shareholder protection in two primary ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">First, the amendments strengthened the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of the Act\u2019s efforts to check conflicts of interest, the independence of mutual fund boards of directors, which negotiate and scrutinize adviser compensation. <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 482, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404.  The amendments required that no more than 60 percent of a fund\u2019s directors be \u201cpersons who are interested persons,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>that they have no interest in or affiliation with the investment adviser.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u00a7 80a-10(a);</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">[559 U.S. 340]</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00a7 80a-2(a)(19); see also <em>Daily Income Fund, supra, </em>at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. These board members are given \u201ca host of special responsibilities.\u201d <em>Burks, </em>441 U.S., at 482-483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. In particular, they must \u201creview and approve the contracts of the investment adviser\u201d annually, <em>id., </em>at 483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404, and a majority of these directors must approve an adviser\u2019s compensation, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-15(c). Second, \u00a7 36(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of the Act imposed upon investment advisers a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d with respect to compensation received from a mutual fund, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b), and granted individual investors a private right of action for breach of that duty, <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d standard contained in \u00a7 36(b) represented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of the 1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment adviser fees under state law were required to meet \u201ccommon-law standards of corporate waste, under which an unreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the court deemed it \u2018unconscionable\u2019 or \u2018shocking,\u2019 \u201d and \u201csecurity holders challenging adviser fees under the [Investment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross abuse of trust.\u201d <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U.S., at 540, n. 12, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the SEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the Commission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was not \u201creasonable\u201d and to intervene in any similar action brought by or on behalf of an investment company. <em>Id., </em>at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. This approach was included in a bill that passed the House. H. R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 8(d) (1967); see also S. 1659, 90th Cong.,</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">[559 U.S. 341]</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">1st Sess., \u00a7 8(d) (as introduced May 1, 1967). Industry representatives, however, objected to this proposal, fearing that it \u201cmight in essence provide the Commission with ratemaking authority.\u201d <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U.S., at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The provision that was ultimately enacted adopted \u201ca different method of testing management compensation,\u201d <em>id,, </em>at 539, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (quoting S. Rep., at 5; internal quotation marks omitted), that was more favorable to shareholders than the previously available remedies but that did not permit a compensation agreement to be reviewed in court for \u201creasonableness.\u201d This is the fiduciary duty standard in \u00a7 36(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">Petitioners are shareholders in three different mutual funds managed by respondent Harris Associates L. P, an investment adviser. Petitioners filed this action in the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to \u00a7 36(b) seeking damages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agreements between Harris Associates and the mutual funds. The complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated \u00a7 36(b) by charging fees that were \u201cdisproportionate to the services rendered\u201d and \u201cnot within the range of what would have been negotiated at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>arm\u2019s length in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d App. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The District Court granted summary judgment for Harris Associates. Applying the standard adopted in <em>Gartenberg </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., </em>694 F.2d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to \u201cwhether the fees charged . . . were so disproportionately large that they could not have been the result of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed that it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with those that Harris Associates charged its other clients. <em>Id., </em>at 30a. But in light of those comparisons as well as comparisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to similar mutual</p>\n<p id=\"AFYN\">[559 U.S. 342]</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">funds, the court held that it could not reasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside the range that could have been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining. <em>Id., </em>at 29a-32a.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based on different reasoning, explicitly \u201cdisapprov[ing] the <em>Gartenberg </em>approach.\u201d 527 F.3d 627, 632 (2008). Looking to trust law, the panel noted that, while a trustee \u201cowes an obligation of candor in negotiation,\u201d a trustee, at the time of the creation of a trust, \u201cmay negotiate in his own interest and accept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to pay.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 242, and Comment <em>f). </em>The panel thus reasoned that \u201c[a] fiduciary duty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation.\u201d 527 F.3d, at 632. In the panel\u2019s view, the amount of an adviser\u2019s compensation would be relevant only if the compensation were \u201cso unusual\u201d as to give rise to an inference \u201cthat deceit must have occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision have abdicated.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The panel argued that this understanding of \u00a7 36(b) is consistent with the forces operating in the contemporary mutual fund market. Noting that \u201c[t]oday thousands of mutual funds compete,\u201d the panel concluded that \u201csophisticated investors\u201d shop for the funds that produce the best overall results, \u201cmov[e] their money elsewhere\u201d when fees are \u201cexcessive in relation to the results,\u201d and thus \u201ccreate a competitive pressure\u201d that generally keeps fees low. <em>Id., </em>at 633-634. The panel faulted <em>Gartenberg </em>on the ground that it \u201crelies too little on markets.\u201d 527 F.3d, at 632. And the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the fees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the fees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients, observing that \u201c[d]if-ferent clients call for different commitments of time\u201d and that costs, such as research, that may benefit several categories of clients \u201cmake it hard to draw inferences from fee levels.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">[559 U.S. 343]</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an equally divided vote. 537 F.3d 728 (2008) <em>(per curiam). </em>The dissent from the denial of rehearing argued that the panel\u2019s rejection of <em>Gartenberg </em>was based \u201cmainly on an economic analysis that is ripe for reexamination.\u201d 537 F.3d, at 730 (opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent expressed concern that Harris Associates charged \u201cits captive funds more than twice what it charges independent funds,\u201d and the dissent questioned whether high adviser fees actually drive investors away. <em>Id., </em>at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals over the proper standard under \u00a7 36(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 556 U.S. 1104, 129 S. Ct. 1579, 173 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Since Congress amended the Investment Company Act in 1970, the mutual fund industry has experienced exponential growth. Assets under management increased from $38.2 billion in 1966 to over $9.6 trillion in 2008. The number of mutual fund investors grew from 3.5 million in 1965 to 92 million in 2008, and there are now more than 9,000 open- and closed-end funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">During this time, the standard for an investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary duty has remained an open question in our Court, but, until the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision below, something of a consensus had developed regarding the standard set forth</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">[559 U.S. 344]</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">over 25 years ago in Gartenberg, 694 F.2d 923. The <em>Gartenberg </em>standard has been adopted by other federal courts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he SEC\u2019s regulations have recognized, and formalized, <em>Gartenberg-</em>like factors.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>23. See 17 CFR \u00a7 240.14a-101, Sched. 14A, Item 22, par. (cXllXi) (2009); 69 Fed. Reg. 39801, n. 31, 39807-39809 (2004). In the present case, both petitioners and respondent generally endorse the <em>Gartenberg </em>approach, although they disagree in some respects about its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">In <em>Gartenberg, </em>the Second Circuit noted that Congress had not defined what it meant by a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d with respect to compensation but concluded that  \u201cthe test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm\u2019s-length in the light of all of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d 694 F.2d, at 928. The Second Circuit elaborated that, \u201c [t] o be guilty of a violation of \u00a7 36(b), . . . the adviser-manager must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cTo make this determination,\u201d the court stated, \u201call pertinent facts must be weighed,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 929, and the court specifically mentioned \u201cthe adviser-manager\u2019s cost in providing the service, . . . the extent to which the adviser-manager realizes economies of scale as the fund grows larger, and the volume of orders which must be processed by the manager,\u201d <em>id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>930.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Observing that competition among advisers for</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">[559 U.S. 345]</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">the business of managing a fund may be \u201cvirtually non-existent,\u201d the court rejected the suggestion that \u201cthe principal factor to be considered in evaluating a fee\u2019s fairness is the price charged by other similar advisers to funds managed by them,\u201d although the court did not suggest that this factor could not be \u201ctaken into account.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 929. The court likewise rejected the \u201cargument that the lower fees charged by investment advisers to large pension funds should be used as a criterion for determining fair advisory fees for money market funds,\u201d since a \u201cpension fund does not face the myriad of daily purchases and redemptions throughout the nation which must be handled by [a money market fund].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 930, n. 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The meaning of \u00a7 36(b)\u2019s reference to \u201ca fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is hardly pellucid, but based on the terms of that provision and the role that a shareholder action for breach of that duty plays in the overall structure of the Act, we conclude that <em>Gartenberg </em>was correct in its basic formulation of what \u00a7 36(b) requires:  To face liability under \u00a7 36(b), an investment adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">[559 U.S. 346]</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">We begin with the language of \u00a7 36(b). As noted, the Seventh Circuit panel thought that the phrase \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d incorporates a standard taken from the law of trusts. Petitioners agree but maintain that the panel identified the wrong trust-law standard. Instead of the standard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negotiate the trustee\u2019s fee at the time of the creation of a trust, petitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trustee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for Petitioners 20-23, 35-37. A compensation agreement reached at that time, they point out, \u201c \u2018will not bind the beneficiary\u2019 if either \u2018the trustee failed to make a full disclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement\u2019 \u201d which he knew or should have known or if the agreement is unfair to the beneficiary. <em>Id., </em>at 23 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 242, Comment <em>i). </em>Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d is not exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means different things in different contexts, and that there is no reason to believe that \u00a7 36(b) incorporates the specific meaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Respondent 34-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281 (1939), we discussed the meaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that is analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to trust law. At issue in <em>Pepper </em>was whether a bankruptcy court could disallow a dominant or controlling shareholder\u2019s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corporation. Dominant</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">[559 U.S. 347]</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">or controlling shareholders, we held, are \u201cfiduciar[ies]\u201d whose \u201cpowers are powers [held] in trust.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 306, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281. We then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201cTheir dealings with the corporation are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or engagements with the corporation is challenged the burden is on the director or stockholder not only to prove the good faith of the transaction but also to show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the corporation and those interested therein. . . . <em>The essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm\u2019s length bargain. </em>If it does not, equity will set it aside.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 306-307, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281 (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see also <em>Geddes </em>v. <em>Anaconda Copper Mining Co., </em>254 U.S. 590, 599, 41 S. Ct. 209, 65 L. Ed. 425 (1921) (standard of fiduciary duty for interested directors).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">We believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of the phrase \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d in \u00a7 36(b), 84 Stat. 1429. The Investment Company Act modifies this duty in a significant way: It shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming breach, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(1), to show that the fee is outside the range that arm\u2019s-length bargaining would produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The <em>Gartenberg </em>approach fully incorporates this understanding of the fiduciary duty as set out in <em>Pepper </em>and reflects \u00a7 36(b)(1)\u2019s imposition of the burden on the plaintiff. As noted, <em>Gartenberg </em>insists that all relevant circumstances be taken into account, see 694 F.2d, at 929, as does \u00a7 36(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (\u201c[A]pproval by the board of directors . . . shall be given such consideration by the court as is deemed appropriate under <em>all the circumstances\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). And <em>Gartenberg </em>uses the range of fees that might result from arm\u2019s-length bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">[559 U.S. 348]</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a7 36(b)\u2019s place in the statutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protections that the Act affords investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Under the Act, scrutiny of investment-adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the \u201ccornerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest within mutual funds.\u201d <em>Burks, </em>441 U.S., at 482, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. The Act interposes disinterested directors as \u201cindependent watchdogs\u201d of the relationship between a mutual fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and its adviser. <em>Id., </em>at 484, 99 S.

To provide these directors with the information needed to judge whether an adviser\u2019s compensation is excessive, the Act requires advisers to furnish all information \u201creasonably . . . necessary to evaluate the terms\u201d of the adviser\u2019s contract, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-15(c), and gives the SEC the authority to enforce that requirement. See \u00a7 80a-41. Board scrutiny of adviser compensation and shareholder suits under \u00a7 36(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts. See <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U.S., at 541, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (Congress intended for \u00a7 36(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser contracts to act as \u201cindependent checks on excessive fees\u201d); <em>Kamen, </em>500 U.S., at 108, 111 S. Ct. 1711, 114 L. Ed. 2d 152 (\u201cCongress added \u00a7 36(b) to the [Act] in 1970 because it concluded that the shareholders should not have to rely solely on the fund\u2019s directors to assure reasonable adviser fees, notwithstanding the increased disinterestedness of the board\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In recognition of the role of the disinterested directors, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser\u2019s compensation \u201csuch consideration ... as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a7 80a-35(b)(2). Cf. <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 485, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (\u201c[I]t would have been paradoxical for Congress to have been willing to rely largely upon [boards of directors as] \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to protect shareholder</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">[559 U.S. 349]</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">interests and yet, where the \u2018watchdogs\u2019 have done precisely that, require that they be totally muzzled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">From this formulation, two inferences may be drawn. First, a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment may be appropriate in some instances. Second, the appropriate measure of deference varies depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\"><em>Gartenberg </em>heeds these precepts. <em>Gartenberg </em>advises that  \u201cthe expertise of the independent trustees of a fund, whether they are fully informed about all facts bearing on the [investment adviser\u2019s] service and fee, and the extent of care and conscientiousness with which they perform their duties are important factors to be considered in deciding whether they and the [investment adviser] are guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of \u00a7 36(b).\u201d 694 F.2d, at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">While both parties in this case endorse the basic <em>Gartenberg </em>approach, they disagree on several important questions that warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">The first concerns comparisons between the fees that an adviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees that it charges its independent clients. As noted, the <em>Gartenberg </em>court rejected a comparison between the fees that the adviser in that case charged a money market fund and the fees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F.2d, at 930, n. 3 (noting that \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the services required by each type of fund differ sharply\u201d). Petitioners contend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for Petitioners 30-31, but respondent disagrees, Brief for Respondent 38-44.  Since the Act requires consideration of all relevant factors, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(2); see also \u00a7 80a-15(c), we do not think that there can be any categorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>charged different types of clients. See <em>Daily Income Fund, supra, </em>at 537, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (discussing concern with investment advisers\u2019 practice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to their other clients). Instead, courts may</p>\n<p id=\"a5ev-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 350]</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">give such comparisons the weight that they merit in light of the similarities and differences between the services that the clients in question require, but courts must be wary of inapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may be significant differences between the services provided by an investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it provides to a pension fund which are attributable to the greater frequency of shareholder re-demptions in a mutual fund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more burdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher marketing costs. 527 F.3d, at 634 (\u201cDifferent clients call for different commitments of time\u201d). If the services rendered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not probative, then courts must reject such a comparison. Even if the services provided and fees charged to an independent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between mutual funds and institutional clients, contrary to petitioners\u2019 contentions. See <em>id., </em>at 631 (\u201cPlaintiffs maintain that a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more than its independent clients\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">By the same token,  courts should not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other advisers. These comparisons are problematic because these</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">[559 U.S. 351]</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of negotiations conducted at arm\u2019s length. See 537 F.3d, at 731-732 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); <em>Gartenberg, supra, </em>at 929 (\u201cCompetition between money market funds for shareholder business does not support an inference that competition must therefore also exist between [investment advisers] for fund business. The former may be vigorous even though the latter is virtually nonexistent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Finally,  a court\u2019s evaluation of an investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and substance. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(2) (requiring deference to board\u2019s consideration \u201cas is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances\u201d); cf. <em>Daily Income Fund, </em>464 U.S., at 541, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (\u201cCongress intended security holder and SEC actions under \u00a7 36(b), on the one hand, and directorial approval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as independent checks on excessive fees\u201d). Where a board\u2019s process for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser compensation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>robust, a reviewing court should afford commensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining process. See <em>Burks, </em>441 U.S., at 484, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (unaffiliated directors serve as \u201cindependent watchdogs\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, if the disinterested directors considered the relevant factors, their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to considerable weight, even if a court might weigh the factors differently. Cf. <em>id.., </em>at 485, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. This is not to deny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated by a board in possession of all relevant information, but such a determination must be based on evidence that the fee \u201cis so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d <em>Garten-berg, </em>694 F.2d, at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In contrast,  where the board\u2019s process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information, the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an investment adviser fails to disclose material information to the</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">[559 U.S. 352]</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">board, greater scrutiny is justified because the withheld information might have hampered the board\u2019s ability to function as \u201can independent check on management.\u201d <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 484, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSection 36(b) is sharply focused on the question of whether the fees themselves were excessive.\u201d <em>Migdal </em>v. <em>Rowe Price-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>248 F.3d 321, 328 (CA4 2001); see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b) (imposing a \u201cfiduciary duty with respect to the <em>receipt of compensation </em>for services, or of payments of a material nature\u201d (emphasis added)). But an adviser\u2019s compliance or noncompliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that must be considered in calibrating the degree of deference that is due a board\u2019s decision to approve an adviser\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">It is also important to note that  the standard for fiduciary breach under \u00a7 36(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of informed board decisions. See <em>Daily Income Fund, supra, </em>at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645; see also <em>Burks, </em>441 U.S., at 483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (\u201cCongress consciously chose to address the conflict-of-interest problem through the Act\u2019s independent-directors section, rather than through more drastic remedies\u201d). \u201c[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some restraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinterested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transactions with the investment adviser,\u201d but they do not suggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disinterested directors apprised of all relevant information, without additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm\u2019s-length range. <em>Id., </em>at 481, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. In reviewing compensation under \u00a7 36(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in a precise calculation of fees representative of arm\u2019s-length bargaining. See 527 F.3d, at 633 (\u201cJudicial price-setting does not accompany fiduciary duties\u201d). As recounted above, Congress rejected a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement that was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting responsibilities. See <em>Daily Income Fund, supra, </em>at 538-540, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. Congress\u2019 approach recognizes that</p>\n<p id=\"AkBh\">[559 U.S. 353]</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">courts are not well suited to make such precise calculations. Cf. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>519 U.S. 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>308, 117 S. Ct. 811, 136 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1997) (\u201c[T]he Court is institutionally unsuited to gather the facts upon which economic predictions can be made, and professionally untrained to make them\u201d); <em>Verizon Communications Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>535 U.S. 467, 539, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2002); see also <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>915 F.2d 17, 25 (CA1 1990) (opinion for the court by Breyer, C. J.) (\u201c[H]ow is a judge or jury to determine a \u2018fair price\u2019 \u201d). <em>Garten-berg\u2019s </em>\u201cso disproportionately large\u201d standard, 694 F.2d, at 928, reflects this congressional choice to \u201crely largely upon [independent director] \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to protect shareholder interests.\u201d <em>Burks, supra, </em>at 485, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">By focusing almost entirely on the element of disclosure, the Seventh Circuit panel erred. See 527 F.3d, at 632 (An investment adviser \u201cmust make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation\u201d). The <em>Gartenberg </em>standard, which the panel rejected, may lack sharp analytical clarity, but we believe that it accurately reflects the compromise that is embodied in \u00a7 36(b), and it has provided a workable standard for nearly three decades. The debate between the Seventh Circuit panel and the dissent from the denial of rehearing regarding today\u2019s mutual fund market is a matter for Congress, not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">.

Investors can invest in such a fund for as little as a day, so, from the investor\u2019s perspective, the fund resembles an investment \u201cmore like a bank account than [a] traditional investment in securities.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 925.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\">.
