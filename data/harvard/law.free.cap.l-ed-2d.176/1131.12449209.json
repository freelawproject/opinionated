Relevant to our inquiry is the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), [1] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining \u201cthe assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d More embracive than the TIA, the comity doctrine applicable in state taxation cases restrains federal courts from entertaining claims for relief that risk disrupting state tax administration. See <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>454 U.S. 100, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1981). The comity doctrine, we hold, requires that a claim of the kind here presented proceed originally in state court. In so ruling, we</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-14\">[560 U.S. 418]</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">distinguish <em>Hibbs </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2004), in which the Court held that neither the TIA nor the comity doctrine barred a federal district court from adjudicating an Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax credit that allegedly funneled public funds to parochial schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-19\">Historically, all natural gas consumers in Ohio purchased gas from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>the public utility, known as a local distribution company (LDC), serving their geographic area. In addition to selling gas as a commodity, LDCs own and operate networks of distribution pipelines to transport and deliver gas to consumers. LDCs offer customers a single, bundled product comprising both gas and delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">Today, consumers in Ohio\u2019s major metropolitan areas can alternatively contract with an independent marketer (IM) that competes with LDCs for retail sales of natural gas. IMs do not own or operate distribution pipelines; they use LDCs\u2019 pipelines. When a customer goes with an IM, therefore, she purchases two \u201cunbundled\u201d products: gas (from the IM) and delivery (from the LDC).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Ohio treats LDCs and IMs differently for tax purposes. Relevant here, Ohio affords LDCs three tax exemptions that IMs do not receive. First, LDCs\u2019 natural gas sales are exempt from sales and use taxes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5739.02(B)(7) (Lexis Supp. 2010); \u00a7\u00a7 5739.021(E), .023(G), .026(F) (Lexis 2008); \u00a7\u00a75741.02(0, .021(A), .022(A), .023(A) (Lexis 2008). LDCs owe instead a gross receipts excise tax, \u00a7 5727.24, which is lower than the sales and use taxes IMs must collect. Second, LDCs are not subject to the commercial activities tax imposed on IMs\u2019 taxable gross receipts. \u00a7\u00a7 5751.01(E)(2), .02 (Lexis Supp. 2010). Finally, Ohio law excludes inter-LDC natural gas sales from the gross receipts tax, which IMs must pay when they purchase gas from LDCs. \u00a7 5727.33(B)(4) (Lexis 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">[560 U.S. 419]</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">Plaintiffs-respondents Commerce Energy, Inc., a California corporation, and Interstate Gas Supply, Inc., an Ohio company, are IMs that market and sell natural gas to Ohio consumers. Plaintiff-respondent Gregory Slone is an Ohio citizen who has purchased natural gas from Interstate Gas Supply since 1999. Alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their patrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses, Complaint \u00b6\u00b635-39, App. 11-13, respondents sued Richard A. Levin, Tax Commissioner of Ohio (Commissioner), in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Invoking that court\u2019s federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, Complaint \u00b66, App. 3, respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating the three tax exemptions LDCs enjoy and ordering the Commissioner to stop \u201crecognizing and/or enforcing\u201d the exemptions. <em>Id., </em>at 20-21. Respondents named the Commissioner as sole defendant; they did not extend the litigation to include the LDCs whose tax burden their suit aimed to increase.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">The District Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. The TIA did not block the suit, the District Court initially held, because respondents, like the plaintiffs in <em>Hibbs, </em>were \u201cthird-parties challenging the constitutionality of [another\u2019s] tax benefit,\u201d and their requested relief \u201cwould not disrupt the flow of tax revenue\u201d to the State. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">Nevertheless, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>\u201cdecline [d] to exercise jurisdiction\u201d as a matter of comity. <em>Id., </em>at 32a. Ohio\u2019s Legislature, the District Court observed, chose to provide the challenged tax exemptions to LDCs. Respondents requested</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">[560 U.S. 420]</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">relief that would \u201crequir[e] Ohio to collect taxes which its legislature has not seen fit to impose.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Such relief, the court said, would draw federal judges into \u201ca particularly inappropriate involvement in a state\u2019s management of its fiscal operations.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). A state court, the District Court recognized, could extend the exemptions to IMs, but the TIA proscribed this revenue-reducing relief in federal court. \u201cWhere there would be two possible remedies,\u201d the Court concluded, a federal court should not \u201cimpose its own judgment on the state legislature mandating which remedy is appropriate.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 554 F.3d 1094 (2009). While agreeing that the TIA did not bar respondents\u2019 suit, the Sixth Circuit rejected the District Court\u2019s comity ruling. A footnote in <em>Hibbs, </em>the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed the District Court\u2019s \u201cexpansive reading\u201d of this Court\u2019s comity precedents. 554 F.3d, at 1098. The footnote stated that the Court \u201chas relied upon \u2018principles of comity\u2019 to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.\u201d <em>Hibbs, </em>542 U.S., at 107, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (citation omitted). Abroad view of the comity cases, the Sixth Circuit feared, would render the TIA \u201ceffectively superfluous,\u201d and would <em>\u201csub silentio </em>overrule a series of important cases\u201d presenting challenges to state tax measures. 554 F.3d, at 1099, 1102 (citing <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>433 U.S. 267, 97 S. Ct. 2749, 53 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1977); <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>463 U.S. 388, 103 S. Ct. 3062, 77 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1983)); 554 F.3d, at 1099-1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">In so ruling, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, which had similarly read <em>Hibbs </em>to rein in the comity doctrine, see <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>510 F.3d 755 (CA7 2007); <em>Wilbur </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 F.3d 1101 (CA9 2005), and it disagreed with the Fourth Circuit, which had concluded that <em>Hibbs </em>left comity doctrine untouched, see <em>DIRECTV, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tolson, </em>513 F.3d 119 (2008). Noting that respondents</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">[560 U.S. 421]</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">\u201cchallenge [d] only a few limited exemptions,\u201d and satisfied, therefore, that \u201c[respondents\u2019] success would not significantly intrude upon traditional matters of state taxation,\u201d the Sixth Circuit remanded the case for adjudication of the merits. 554 F.3d, at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">After unsuccessfully moving for rehearing en banc, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a-2a, the Commissioner petitioned for certiorari. By then, the First Circuit had joined the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in holding that <em>Hibbs </em>sharply limited the scope of the comity bar. <em>Coors Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>M\u00e9ndez-Torres, </em>562 F.3d 3 (2009). We granted the Commissioner\u2019s petition, 558 U.S. 989, 130 S. Ct. 496, 175 L. Ed. 2d 344 (2009), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">Comity considerations, the Commissioner dominantly urges, preclude the exercise of lower federal-court adjudicatory authority over this controversy, given that an adequate state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>court forum is available to hear and decide respondents\u2019 constitutional claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">The comity doctrine counsels lower federal courts to resist engagement in certain cases falling within their jurisdiction. The doctrine reflects</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-5\">\u201ca proper respect for state functions, a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate state governments, and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in separate ways.\u201d <em>Fair Assessment, </em>454 U.S., at 112, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (quoting <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 44, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Comity\u2019s constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity. For \u201c[i]t is upon taxation that the several States chiefly rely to obtain the means to carry</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">[560 U.S. 422]</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">on their respective governments, and it is of the utmost importance to all of them that the modes adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be interfered with as little as possible.\u201d <em>Dows </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>11 Wall. 108, 110, 20 L. Ed. 65 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">\u201cAn examination of [our] decisions,\u201d this Court wrote more than a century ago, \u201cshows that a proper reluctance to interfere by prevention with the fiscal operations of the state governments has caused [us] to refrain from so doing in all cases where the Federal rights of the persons could otherwise be preserved unimpaired.\u201d <em>Boise Artesian Hot &amp; Cold Water Co. </em>v. <em>Boise City, </em>213 U.S. 276, 282, 29 S. Ct. 426, 53 L. Ed. 796 (1909). Accord <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>284 U.S. 521, 525-526, 52 S. Ct. 217, 76 L. Ed. 447 (1932) (So long as the state remedy was \u201cplain, adequate, and complete,\u201d the \u201cscrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts, and a proper reluctance to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations, require that such relief should be denied in every case where the asserted federal right may be preserved without it.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">[560 U.S. 423]</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\">Statutes conferring federal jurisdiction, we have repeatedly cautioned, should be read with sensitivity to \u201cfederal-state relations\u201d and \u201cwise judicial administration.\u201d <em>Quackenbush </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 716, 116 S. Ct. 1712, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). But by 1937, in state tax cases, the federal courts had moved in a different direction: They \u201chad be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>come free and easy with injunctions.\u201d <em>Fair Assessment, </em>454 U.S., at 129, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress passed the TIA to reverse this trend. <em>Id,, </em>at 109-110, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Our post-Act decisions, however, confirm the continuing sway of comity considerations, independent of the Act. Plaintiffs in <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. </em>v. <em>Huffman, </em>319 U.S. 293, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407 (1943), for example, sought a federal judgment declaring Louisiana\u2019s unemployment compensation tax unconstitutional. Writing six years after the TIA\u2019s passage, we emphasized the Act\u2019s animating concerns:  A \u201cfederal court of equity,\u201d we reminded, \u201cmay in an appropriate case refuse to give its special protection to private rights when the exercise of its jurisdiction would be prejudicial to the public interest, [and] should stay its hand in the public interest when it reasonably appears that private interests will not suffer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 297-298, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407 (citations omitted). In enacting the TIA, we noted, \u201cCongress recognized and gave sanction to this practice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 298, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407. We could not have thought Congress intended to cabin the comity doctrine, for we went</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">[560 U.S. 424]</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">on to instruct dismissal in <em>Great Lakes </em>on comity grounds without deciding whether the Act reached declaratory judgment actions. <em>Id., </em>at 299, 301-302, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">Decades later, in <em>Fair Assessment, </em>we ruled, based on comity concerns, that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not permit federal courts to award damages in state taxation cases when state law provides an adequate remedy. 454 U.S., at 116, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271. We clarified in <em>Fair Assessment </em>that [6] \u201cthe principle of comity which predated the Act was not restricted by its passage.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 110, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271. And in <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>515 U.S. 582, 590, 115 S. Ct. 2351, 132 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1995), we said, explicitly, that \u201cthe [TIA] may be best understood as but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">Although our precedents affirm that the comity doctrine is more em-bracive than the TIA, several Courts of Appeals, including the Sixth Circuit in the instant case, have comprehended <em>Hibbs </em>to restrict comity\u2019s compass. See <em>supra, </em>at 420-421, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140. <em>Hibbs, </em>however, has a more modest reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">Plaintiffs in <em>Hibbs </em>were Arizona taxpayers who challenged a state law authorizing tax credits for payments to organizations that disbursed scholarship grants to children attending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>private schools. 542 U.S., at 94-96, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. These organizations could fund attendance at institutions that provided religious instruction or gave admissions preference on the basis of religious affiliation. <em>Id., </em>at 95, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. Ranking the credit program as state subsidization of religion, incompatible with the Establishment Clause, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and an order requiring the organizations to pay sums still in their possession into the State\u2019s general fund. <em>Id., </em>at 96, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\">[560 U.S. 425]</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">The Director of Arizona\u2019s Department of Revenue sought to escape suit in federal court by invoking the TIA. We held that the litigation fell outside the TIA\u2019s governance. Our prior decisions holding suits blocked by the TIA, we noted, were tied to the Act\u2019s \u201cstate-revenue-protective moorings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 106, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. The Act, we explained, \u201crestrain [ed] state taxpayers from instituting federal actions to contest their [own] liability for state taxes,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 108, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172, suits that, if successful, would deplete state coffers. But \u201cthird parties\u201d like the <em>Hibbs </em>plaintiffs, we concluded, were not impeded by the TIA \u201cfrom pursuing constitutional challenges to tax benefits in a federal forum.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The case, we stressed, was \u201cnot rationally distinguishable\u201d from a procession of pathmarking civil-rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained challenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a jurisdictional barrier. <em>Id., </em>at 93-94, 110-112, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. See, <em>e.g., Griffin </em>v. <em>School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., </em>377 U.S. 218, 84 S. Ct. 1226, 12 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1964) (involving, <em>inter alia, </em>tax credits for contributions to private segregated schools).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">Arizona\u2019s Revenue Director also invoked comity as cause for dismissing the action. We dispatched the Director\u2019s comity argument in a spare footnote that moved the Sixth Circuit here to reverse the District Court\u2019s comity-based dismissal. As earlier set out, see <em>supra, </em>at 420, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140, the footnote stated:  \u201c[T]his Court has relied upon \u2018principles of comity\u2019 to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.\u201d 542 U.S., at 107, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (citation omitted) (citing <em>Fair Assessment, </em>454 U.S., at 107-108, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271; <em>Great Lakes, </em>319 U.S., at 296-299, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">Relying heavily on our footnote in <em>Hibbs, </em>respondents urge that \u201ccomity should no more bar this action than it did the action in <em>Hibbs.\u201d </em>Brief for Respondents 42. As we explain below, however, the two cases differ markedly in ways bearing on the comity calculus. We have had no prior occasion to consider, under the comity doctrine, a taxpayer\u2019s complaint</p>\n<p id=\"A7WAp\">[560 U.S. 426]</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">about allegedly discriminatory state taxation framed as a request to increase a competitor\u2019s tax burden. Now squarely presented with the question, we hold that comity precludes the exercise of original federal-court jurisdiction in cases of the kind presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-12\">Respondents complain that they are taxed unevenly in comparison to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>LDCs and their customers. Under either an equal protection or dormant Commerce Clause theory, respondents\u2019root objection is the same: State action, respondents contend, \u201cselects [them] out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.\u201d <em>Hillsborough </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>326 U.S. 620, 623, 66 S. Ct. 445, 90 L. Ed. 358 (1946) (equal protection); see <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>498 U.S. 439, 447-448, 111 S. Ct. 865, 112 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1991) (dormant Commerce Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">When economic legislation does not employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on fundamental rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> courts generally view constitutional challenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative choices demands. See, <em>e.g., Hodel </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>452 U.S. 314, 331-332, 101 S. Ct. 2376, 69 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1981); <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 488-489, 75 S.

With the State\u2019s legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a State\u2019s allocation of benefits or burdens, generally remands the case, leaving the remedial choice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>hands of state authorities. See, <em>e.g.,Wengler </em>v. <em>Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>446 U.S. 142, 152-153, 100 S. Ct. 1540, 64 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1980); <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>440 U.S. 268, 283-284, 99 S.

Our remand leaves the interim solution in state-court hands, subject to subsequent definitive disposition by the State\u2019s legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">If lower federal courts were to give audience to the merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for the interim remedial determination would be unavailable. That is so because  federal tribunals lack authority to remand to the state court system an action initiated in federal court. Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA; absent certain exceptions, see, <em>e.g., Department of Employment </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 355, 357-358, 87 S. Ct. 464, 17 L. Ed. 2d 414 (1966), the Act precludes relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legislature\u2019s design.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These limitations on the remedial competence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">[560 U.S. 429]</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">Comity considerations, as the District Court determined, warrant dismissal of respondents\u2019 suit. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that respondents could pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>vail on the merits of the suit,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the most obvious way to achieve parity would be to reduce respondents\u2019 tax liability. Respondents did not seek such relief, for  the TIA stands in the way of any decree that would \u201cenjoin . . . collection of [a] tax under State law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A more ambitious solution would reshape the relevant provisions of Ohio\u2019s tax code. Were a federal court to essay such relief, however, the court would engage in the very interference in state taxation the comity doctrine aims to avoid. Cf. <em>State Railroad Tax Cases, </em>92 U.S. 575, 614-615, 23 L. Ed. 663 (1876). Respondents\u2019 requested remedy, an order invalidating the exemptions enjoyed by LDCs, App. 20-21, may be far from what the Ohio Legislature would have willed. See <em>supra, </em>at 427, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1144. In short, if the Ohio scheme is indeed unconstitutional, surely the Ohio courts are better positioned to determine\u2014unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs in\u2014how to comply with the mandate of equal treatment. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept, of Treasury, </em>489 U.S. 803, 817-818, 109 S. Ct. 1500, 103 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">[560 U.S. 430]</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">As earlier noted, our unelaborated footnote on comity in <em>Hibbs, </em>see <em>supra, </em>at 425, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1143, led the Sixth Circuit to conclude that we had diminished the force of that doctrine and made it inapplicable here. We intended no such consequential ruling. <em>Hibbs </em>was hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case. It was essentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes. In <em>Hibbs, </em>the charge was state aid in alleged violation of the Establishment Clause; in other cases of the same genre, the attack was on state allocations to maintain racially segregated schools. See 542 U.S., at 93-94, 110-112, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. The plaintiffs in <em>Hibbs </em>were outsiders to the tax expenditure, \u201cthird parties\u201d whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor. In this case, by contrast, the very premise of respondents\u2019 suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs. Unlike the <em>Hibbs </em>plaintiffs, respondents do object to their own tax situation, measured by the allegedly more favorable treatment accorded LDCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\"><em>Hibbs </em>held that the TIA did not preclude a federal challenge by a third party who objected to a tax credit received by others, but in no way objected to her own liability under any revenue-raising tax provision. In context, we clarify, the <em>Hibbs </em>foot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>note comment on comity is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as the case was a poor fit under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity. The Court, in other words, did not deploy the footnote to recast the comity doctrine; it intended the note to convey only that the Establishment Clause-grounded case cleared both the TIA and comity hurdles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\">Respondents steadfastly maintain that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the relief they seek, <em>i.e., </em>invalidation of exemptions accorded the</p>\n<p id=\"a5le-dedup-1\">[560 U.S. 431]</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">LDCs. But as we just explained, even if respondents\u2019 Commerce Clause and equal protection claims had merit, respondents would have no entitlement to their preferred remedy. See <em>supra, </em>at 427, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1144. In <em>Hibbs, </em>however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs\u2019 grievance: invalidation of the credit, which inevitably would increase the State\u2019s tax receipts. Notably, redress in state court similarly would be limited to an order ending the allegedly impermissible state support for parochial schools.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because state courts would have no greater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged violation, nothing would be lost in the currency of comity or state autonomy by permitting the <em>Hibbs </em>suit to proceed in a federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">Comity, in sum, serves to ensure that \u201cthe National Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States.\u201d <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S., at 44, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669. A confluence of factors in this case, absent in <em>Hibbs, </em>leads us to conclude that the comity doctrine controls here. First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny. Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position. Third, the Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation</p>\n<p id=\"AXxB\">[560 U.S. 432]</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">because they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options. Individually, these considerations may not compel forbearance on the part of federal district courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the state adjudicative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-11\">The Sixth Circuit expressed concern that application of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA \u201ceffectively superfluous.\u201d 554 F.3d, at 1099; see <em>id., </em>at 1102. This concern overlooks Congress\u2019 point in enacting the TIA. [15] The Act was passed to plug two large loopholes courts had opened in applying the comity doctrine. See <em>supra, </em>at 423, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1141-1142, and n. 3. By closing these loopholes, Congress secured the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>trine against diminishment. Comity, we further note, is a prudential doctrine. \u201cIf the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case back into the State\u2019s own system.\u201d <em>Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. </em>v. <em>Hodory, </em>431 U.S. 471, 480, 97 S. Ct. 1898, 52 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Because we conclude that the comity doctrine justifies dismissal of respondents\u2019 federal-court action, we need not decide whether the TIA would itself block the suit. See <em>Great Lakes, </em>319 U.S., at 299, 301, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407 (reserving judgment on TIA\u2019s application where comity precluded suit).

State tax agencies are organized to discharge their responsibilities in accordance with the state procedures. If federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assessments, state tax administration might be thrown into disarray, and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law. During the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent damage to the State\u2019s budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk of taxpayer insolvency. Moreover, federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts.\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Ledesma, </em>401 U.S. 82, 128, n. 17, 91 S.

Ed. 2d, at 1148 (Kennedy, J., concurring), I agree that it is not necessary for us to revisit that decision to hold that this case belongs in state court. As the Court suggests, <em>Hibbs </em>permits not just the application of comity principles to the litigation here, but also application of the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. See <em>ante, </em>at 432, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1147-1148. I concur only in the judgment because where, as here, the same analysis supports both jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional grounds for dismissal (the TIA imposes a jurisdictional bar, see, <em>e.g., Hibbs, supra, </em>at 104, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172), the \u201cproper course\u201d under our precedents is to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. </em>v. <em>Malaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., </em>549 U.S. 422, 435-436, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-17\">Congress enacted the TIA\u2019s prohibition on federal jurisdiction over certain cases involving state tax issues because federal courts had proved unable to exercise jurisdiction over such cases in the restrained manner that comity requires. See <em>ante, </em>at 423, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1141-1142. As the Court explains, Congress\u2019 decision to prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>federal jurisdiction over cases within the Act\u2019s scope did not disturb that jurisdiction, or the comity</p>\n<p id=\"afub-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 434]</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">principles that guide its exercise, in cases outside the Act\u2019s purview. See <em>ante, </em>at 423-424, 429-432, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1141-1142; 1145-1146. I therefore agree with the Court that nothing in the Act or in <em>Hibbs </em>affects the application of comity principles to cases not covered by the Act. I disagree that this conclusion moots the need for us to decide \u201cwhether the TIA would itself block th [is] suit.\u201d Ante, at 432, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">The Court posits that because comity is available as a ground for dismissal even where the Act is not, the Act\u2019s application to this case is irrelevant if comity would also support sending the case to state court. See <em>ibid. </em>The Court rests this analysis on our recent holding in <em>Sinochem </em>that a court <em>may </em>dismiss a case on a non-merits ground such as comity without first resolving an accompanying jurisdictional issue. See <em>ante, </em>at 432, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1147-1148 (citing 549 U.S., at 431, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15). The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Sinochem </em>is misplaced, however, because it confuses the fact that a court <em>may </em>do that with whether, and when, it <em>should. </em>As <em>Sinochem </em>itself explains, courts should <em>not </em>dismiss cases on nonjurisdictional grounds where \u201cjurisdiction . . . \u2018involve [s] no arduous inquiry\u2019 \u201d and deciding it would not substantially undermine \u201cjudicial economy.\u201d 549 U.S., at 436, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15 <em>(quoting Ruhrgas AG </em>v. <em>Marathon Oil Co., </em>526 U.S. 574, 587-588, 119 S. Ct. 1563, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760 (1999)). In such circumstances, <em>Sinochem </em>reiterates the settled rule that \u201cthe proper course\u201d is to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. 549 U.S., at 436, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15. That is the proper course here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The TIA prohibits federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over any action that would \u201csuspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of [a] tax under State law.\u201d \u00a7 1341. As the Court appears to agree, see <em>ante, </em>at 432, n. 13, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1148, this is such a case even under the crabbed construction of the Act in <em>Hibbs, </em>which the Court accurately describes as holding only that the Act does \u201cnot preclude a federal challenge by a third party who object[s] to a tax credit received by others, but in no way object[s] to her own liability under any revenue-raising tax provision,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 430, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1146-1147 (emphasizing</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">[560 U.S. 435]</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">that the \u201cplaintiffs in <em>Hibbs </em>were outsiders to the tax expenditure, \u2018third parties\u2019 whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor\u201d). This is not such a case, because the respondents here are in no sense \u201coutsiders\u201d to the revenue-raising state tax regime they ask the federal courts to restrain. <em>Ibid.\\ </em>see also <em>Hibbs, supra, </em>at 104, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. Respondents compete with entities who receive tax exemptions under that regime in providing services whose cost is affected by the exemptions. Respondents thus <em>do </em>object to their own liability in a very real and economically significant way: The liability the state tax regime imposes on them but not on their competitors makes it more difficult for respondents to match or beat their competitors\u2019 prices. The fact that they raise this objection through the expedient of contesting their competitors\u2019 exemptions is plainly not enough to qualify them as Hibbs-like \u201coutsiders\u201d to the state revenue-raising scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>they wish to enjoin. If it were, application of the Act\u2019s jurisdictional bar would depend on little more than a pleading game. The Act would bar a federal suit challenging a state tax scheme that requires the challenger to pay more taxes than his competitor if the challenger styles the suit as an objection to his own tax liability, but would not bar the suit if he styles it as an objection to the competitor\u2019s exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Because the Court appears to agree that even <em>Hibbs </em>does not endorse such a narrow view of the Act\u2019s jurisdictional bar, see <em>ante, </em>at 430-432, 432, n. 13, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1146-1147, 1148, the \u201cproper course\u201d is to dismiss this suit under the statute and not reach the comity principles that the Court correctly holds independently support the same result, <em>Sinochem, supra, </em>at 436, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15. Here, unlike in <em>Sinochem, </em>there is no economy to deciding the case on the nonjurisdictional ground: The same analysis that supports dismissal for comity reasons subjects this case to the Act\u2019s jurisdictional prohibition, even as construed in <em>Hibbs. </em>Compare ante, at 421-433, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140-1148, with <em>Sinochem, supra, </em>at 435-436, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15 (approving dismissal of a suit on <em>forum non con-veniens </em>grounds because dismissal on personal jurisdiction grounds would</p>\n<p id=\"aj5q-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 436]</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">have required the \u201cexpense and delay\u201d of a minitrial on forum contacts). Given this, I see only one explanation for the Court\u2019s decision to dismiss on a \u201cprudential\u201d ground (comity), <em>ante, </em>at 432-433, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1147-1148, rather than a mandatory one (jurisdiction): The Court wishes to leave the door open to doing in future cases what it did in <em>Hibbs, </em>namely, retain federal jurisdiction over constitutional claims that the Court simply does not believe Congress should have entrusted to state judges under the Act, see 542 U.S., at 113-128, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">That is not a legitimate approach to this important area of the law, see <em>ibid.., </em>and the Court\u2019s assertion that our civil rights precedents require it does not withstand scrutiny. If it is indeed true (which it may have been in the civil rights cases) that federal jurisdiction is necessary to ensure a fair forum in which to litigate an allegedly unconstitutional state tax scheme, the Act itself permits federal courts to retain jurisdiction on the ground that \u201ca plain, speedy and efficient remedy\u201d cannot be had in state court. \u00a7 1341. But where, as here and in <em>Hibbs, </em>such a remedy can be had in state court, the Court should apply the Act as written. See 542 U.S., at 113-128, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Because I believe the Act forbids the approach to federal jurisdiction over state tax issues that the Court adopted in <em>Hibbs, </em>I would not decide this case in a way that leaves the door open to it even if the Court could find a doorstop that accords with, rather than upends, the settled principle that judges presented with multiple nonmerits grounds for dismissal should dismiss on jurisdictional grounds first. But the tension the Court\u2019s decision creates with this settled principle should be enough to convince even those who do not share my view of the TIA that the proper course here is to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction because <em>Hibbs\u2019 </em>construction of the Act applies at most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>to the type of true third-party suit that <em>Hibbs </em>describes, and thus does not save this case from the statute\u2019s jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">[560 U.S. 437]</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1239-5\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq3\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">I agree with the Court that principles of comity bar the present action. I am doubtful about the Court\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Hibbs </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2004), but whether today\u2019s holding undermines <em>Hibbs\u2019 </em>foundations is a question that can be left for another day.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
