Respondents are natives of Somalia who allege that they, or members of their families, were the victims of torture and extrajudicial killings during those years. They seek damages from petitioner based on his alleged authorization of those acts. The narrow question we must decide is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602 <em>et seq., </em>provides petitioner with immunity from suit based on actions taken in his official capacity. We hold that the FSIA does not govern the determination of petitioner\u2019s immunity from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\">Respondents are members of the Isaaq clan, which included well-educated and prosperous Somalis who were subjected to systematic persecution during the 1980\u2019s by the military regime then governing Somalia. They allege that petitioner exercised command and control over members of the Somali military forces who tortured, killed, or arbitrarily detained them or members of their families; that petitioner knew or should have known of the abuses perpetrated by his subordinates; and that he aided and abetted the commission of these abuses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondents\u2019 complaint sought damages from petitioner pursuant to the Torture Victim Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350, and the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350.

The United States has not recognized any entity as the government of Somalia since the fall of the military regime. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Respondents filed their complaint in November 2004, and petitioner promptly moved to dismiss. The District Court stayed the proceedings to give the State Department an opportunity to provide a statement of interest regarding petitioner\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity. Each month during the ensuing two years, petitioner advised the court that the State Department had the matter \u201c \u2018still under consideration.\u2019 \u201d No. I:04cvl360 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. In 2007, having received no response from the State Department, the District Court reinstated the case on its active docket. The court concluded that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">The District Court\u2019s decision rested squarely on the FSIA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   The FSIA provides that a \u201cforeign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction\u201d of both federal and state courts except as provided in the Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, and the District Court noted that none of the parties had argued that any exception was applicable, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a. Although characterizing the statute as silent on its applicability to the officials of a foreign state, the District Court followed appellate decisions holding that a foreign state\u2019s sovereign immunity under the Act extends to \u201c \u2018an individual acting in his official capacity on behalf of a foreign state,\u2019 \u201d but not to \u201c \u2018an official who acts beyond the scope of his authority.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47a (quoting <em>Velasco </em>v. <em>Government of Indonesia, </em>370 F.3d 392, 398, 399 (CA4 2004)). The court rejected respondents\u2019 argument that petitioner was necessarily</p>\n<p id=\"AThKh\">[560 U.S. 310]</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">acting beyond the scope of his authority because he allegedly violated international law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District Court\u2019s ruling that the FSIA governs petitioner\u2019s immunity from suit. It acknowledged \u201cthe majority view\u201d among the Circuits that \u201cthe FSIA applies to individual officials of a foreign state.\u201d 552 F.3d 371, 378 (CA4 2009).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It disagreed</p>\n<p id=\"AdETQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>with that view, however, and concluded, \u201cbased on the language and structure of the statute, that the FSIA does not apply to individual foreign government agents like [petitioner].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 381.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Having found that the FSIA does not</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">[560 U.S. 311]</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">govern whether petitioner enjoys immunity from suit, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for further proceedings, including a determination of whether petitioner is entitled to immunity under the common law. <em>Id., </em>at 383-384. We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 49, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity developed as a matter of common law long before the FSIA was enacted in 1976. In <em>Verlinden B. V. </em>v. <em>Central Bank of Nigeria, </em>461 U.S. 480, 486, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1983), we explained that in <em>Schooner Exchange </em>v. <em>McFaddon, </em>7 Cranch 116, 3 L. Ed. 287 (1812), \u201cChief Justice Marshall concluded that. . . the United States had impliedly waived jurisdiction over certain activities of foreign sovereigns.\u201d The Court\u2019s specific holding in <em>Schooner Exchange </em>was that a federal court lacked jurisdiction over \u201ca national armed vessel ... of the emperor of France,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 146, 3 L. Ed. 287, but the opinion was interpreted as extending virtually absolute immunity to foreign sovereigns as \u201ca matter of grace and comity,\u201d <em>Verlinden, </em>461 U.S., at 486, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">Following <em>Schooner Exchange, </em>a two-step procedure developed for resolving a foreign state\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels. See, <em>e.g., Republic of Mexico </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>324 U.S. 30, 34-36, 65 S. Ct. 530, 89 L. Ed. 729 (1945); <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U.S. 578, 587-589, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014 (1943); <em>Compania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A. </em>v. <em>The Navemar, </em>303 U.S. 68, 74-75, 58 S. Ct. 432, 82 L. Ed. 667 (1938). Under that procedure, the diplomatic representative of the sovereign could request a \u201csuggestion of immunity\u201d from the State Department. <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U.S., at 581, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014. If the request was granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdiction. <em>Id., </em>at 588, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014; see also <em>Hoffman, </em>324 U.S., at 34, 65 S. Ct. 530, 89 L. Ed. 729. But \u201cin the absence of recognition of the immunity by the Department of State,\u201d a district court \u201chad authority to decide for itself whether all the requisites for such immunity existed.\u201d <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U.S., at 587, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014; see also <em>Compania Espanola, </em>303 U.S., at 75, 58 S. Ct. 432, 82 L. Ed. 667 (approving judicial inquiry into sovereign</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\">[560 U.S. 312]</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">immunity when the \u201cDepartment of State . . . declined to act\u201d); <em>Heaney </em>v. <em>Government of Spain, </em>445 F.2d 501, 503, and n. 2 (CA2 1971) (evaluating sovereign immunity when the State Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>ment had not responded to a request for its views). In making that decision, a district court inquired \u201cwhether the ground of immunity is one which it is the established policy of the [State Department] to recognize.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>324 U.S., at 36, 65 S. Ct. 530, 89 L. Ed. 729. Although cases involving individual foreign officials as defendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was typically followed when a foreign official asserted immunity. See, <em>e.g., Heaney, </em>445 F.2d, at 504-505; <em>Waltier </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>189 F.Supp. 319 (SDNY 1960).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">Prior to 1952, the State Department followed a general practice of requesting immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns, but in that year the Department announced its adoption of the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory of sovereign immunity. <em>Verlinden, </em>461 U.S., at 486-487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81; see also Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Dept. of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull. 984-985 (1952). Under this theory, \u201cimmunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts, and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s strictly commercial acts.\u201d <em>Verlinden, </em>461 U.S., at 487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81. This change threw \u201cimmunity determinations into some disarray,\u201d because \u201cpolitical considerations sometimes led the Department to file \u2018suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Republic of Austria </em>v. <em>Altmann,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">[560 U.S. 313]</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">541 U.S. 677, 690, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2004) (quoting <em>Verlinden, </em>461 U.S., at 487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">Congress responded to the inconsistent application of sovereign immunity by enacting the FSIA in 1976. <em>Altmann, </em>541 U.S., at 690-691, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1; see also <em>Verlinden, </em>461 U.S., at 487-488, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81.  Section 1602 describes the Act\u2019s two primary purposes: (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for deciding \u201cclaims of foreign states to immunity\u201d from the State Department to the courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the enactment of the FSIA, the Act\u2014and not the preexisting common law\u2014indisputably governs the determination of whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">What we must now decide is whether the Act also covers the immunity claims of foreign officials. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>begin with the statute\u2019s text and then consider petitioner\u2019s reliance on its history and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">The FSIA provides that \u201ca foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States\u201d except as provided in the Act. \u00a7 1604. Thus, if a defendant is a \u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of the Act, then the defendant is immune from jurisdiction unless</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">[560 U.S. 314]</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">one of the exceptions in the Act applies. See \u00a7\u00a7 1605-1607 (2006 ed. and Supp. II) (enumerating exceptions). The Act, if it applies, is the \u201csole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\u201d <em>Argentine Republic </em>v. <em>Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S. Ct. 683, 102 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1989). The question we face in this case is whether an individual sued for conduct undertaken in his official capacity is a \u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">The Act defines \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a7 1603 (2006 ed.) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-9\">\u201c(a) A \u2018foreign state\u2019 ... includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-10\">\u201c(b) An \u2018agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\u2019 means any entity\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-11\">\u201c(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-12\">\u201c(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-13\">\u201c(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any third country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-15\">The term \u201cforeign state\u201d on its face indicates a body politic that governs a particular territory. See, <em>e.g., </em>Restatement \u00a7 4 (defining \u201cstate\u201d as \u201can entity that has a defined territory and population under the control of a government and that engages in foreign relations\u201d). In \u00a7 1603(a), however, the Act establishes that \u201cforeign state\u201d has a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the state\u2019s political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. Then, in \u00a7 1603(b), the Act specifically delimits what counts as an agency or instrumentality. Petitioner argues that either \u201cforeign state,\u201d \u00a7 1603(a), or \u201cagency or instrumentality,\u201d \u00a7 1603(b),</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-16\">[560 U.S. 315]</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-17\">could be read to include a foreign official. Although we agree that petitioner\u2019s interpretation is literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory text persuades us that petitioner\u2019s reading is not the meaning that Congress enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-19\">We turn first to the term \u201cagency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d \u00a7 1603(b). It is true that an individual official could be an \u201cagency or instrumentality,\u201d if that term is given the meaning of \u201cany thing or person through which action is accomplished,\u201d <em>In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, </em>538 F.3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008). But Congress has specifically defined \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the FSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut against such a broad construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-20\">First,  the statute specifies that \u201c \u2018agency or instrumentality . . .\u2019 means any entity\u201d matching three specified characteristics, \u00a7 1603(b) (emphasis added), and \u201centity\u201d typi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>cally refers to an organization, rather than an individual. See, <em>e.g., </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009). Furthermore, several of the required characteristics apply awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. The phrase \u201cseparate legal person, corporate or otherwise,\u201d \u00a7 1603(b)(1), could conceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of the word \u201cperson.\u201d But the phrase \u201cseparate legal person\u201d typically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to hold personhood separate from the natural persons who are its shareholders or officers. Cf. <em>First Nat. City Bank </em>v. <em>Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, </em>462 U.S. 611, 625, 103 S. Ct. 2591, 77 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1983) (\u201cSeparate legal personality has been described as \u2018an almost indispensable aspect of the public corporation\u2019 \u201d). It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an \u201corgan\u201d of the foreign state. See \u00a7 1603(b)(2). And the third part of the definition could not be applied at all to a natural person. A natural person cannot be a citizen of a State \u201cas defined in section 1332(c) and (e),\u201d \u00a7 1603(b)(3), because those subsections refer to the citizenship of corporations and estates. Nor can a natural person be \u201ccreated under the laws of any</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">[560 U.S. 316]</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">third country.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus,  the terms Congress chose simply do not evidence the intent to include individual officials within the meaning of \u201cagency or instrumentality.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Dole Food. Co. </em>v. <em>Patrickson, </em>538 U.S. 468, 474, 123 S. Ct. 1655, 155 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2003) (describing \u00a7 1603(b) as containing \u201cindicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">Petitioner proposes a second textual route to including an official within the meaning of \u201cforeign state.\u201d He argues</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">[560 U.S. 317]</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">that the definition of \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a7 1603(a) sets out a nonexhaustive list that \u201cincludes\u201d political subdivisions and agencies or instrumentalities but is not so limited. See Brief for Petitioner 22-23. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>It is true that use of the word \u201cinclude\u201d can signal that the list that follows is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And, to be sure, there are fewer textual clues within \u00a7 1603(a) than within \u00a7 1603(b) from which to interpret Congress\u2019 silence regarding foreign officials. But even if the list in \u00a7 1603(a) is merely illustrative, it still suggests that \u201cforeign state\u201d does not encompass officials, because the types of defendants listed are all entities. See <em>Russell Motor Car Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>261 U.S. 514, 519, 43 S. Ct. 428, 67 L. Ed. 778 (1923) (  \u201c[A] word may be known by the company it keeps\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly mentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests that officials are not included within the unadorned term \u201cforeign state.\u201d Cf. <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 103, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007) (  \u201cDrawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it knows how to [address an issue] in express terms\u201d). For example, Congress provided an exception from the general grant of immunity for cases in which \u201cmoney damages are sought against a foreign state\u201d for an injury in the United States \u201ccaused by the tortious act or omission <em>of that foreign state or of any official </em>or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office.\u201d \u00a7 1605(a)(5) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added). The same reference to officials is made in a similar, later enacted exception. See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1605A(a)(l) (eliminating immunity for suits \u201cin which money damages are sought against a foreign state\u201d for certain acts \u201cengaged in</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">[560 U.S. 318]</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency\u201d); see also \u00a7 1605A(c) (creating a cause of action against the \u201cforeign state\u201d and \u201cany official, employee, or agent\u201d thereof).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the term \u201cforeign state\u201d by definition includes an individual acting within the scope of his office, the phrase \u201cor of any official or employee . . .\u201d in \u00a7 1605(a)(5) would be unnecessary. See <em>Dole Food Co., </em>538 U.S., at 476-477, 123 S. Ct. 1655, 155 L. Ed. 2d 643 (  \u201c[W]e should not construe the statute in a manner that is strained and, at the same time, would render a statutory term superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">Other provisions of the statute also point away from reading \u201cforeign state\u201d to include foreign officials. Congress made no express mention of service of process on individuals in \u00a7 1608(a) (2006 ed.), which governs service upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>a foreign state or political subdivision. Although some of the methods listed could be used to serve individuals\u2014 for example, by delivery \u201cin accordance with an applicable international convention,\u201d \u00a7 1608(a)(2)\u2014the methods specified are at best very roundabout ways of serving an individual official. Furthermore, Congress made specific remedial choices for different types of defendants. See \u00a7 1606 (allowing punitive damages for an agency or instrumentality but not for a foreign state); \u00a7 1610 (affording a plaintiff greater rights to attach the property of an agency or instrumentality as compared to the property of a foreign state). By adopting petitioner\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">[560 U.S. 319]</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">reading of \u201cforeign state,\u201d we would subject claims against officials to the more limited remedies available in suits against states, without so much as a whisper from Congress on the subject. (And if we were instead to adopt petitioner\u2019s other textual argument, we would subject those claims to the different, more expansive, remedial scheme for agencies.) The Act\u2019s careful calibration of remedies among the listed types of defendants suggests that Congress did not mean to cover other types of defendants never mentioned in the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">In sum,  \u201c[w]e do not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>467 U.S. 822, 828, 104 S. Ct. 2769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1984).  Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest we should read \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a7 1603(a) to include an official acting on behalf of the foreign state, and much to indicate that this meaning was not what Congress enacted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The text does not expressly foreclose petitioner\u2019s reading, but it supports the view of respondents and the United States that the Act does not address an official\u2019s claim to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">Petitioner argues that the FSIA is best read to cover his claim to immunity because of its history and purpose. As discussed at the outset,  one of the primary purposes of the FSIA was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">[560 U.S. 320]</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">which Congress recognized as consistent with extant international law. See \u00a7 1602. We have observed that a related purpose was \u201ccodification of international law at the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment,\u201d <em>Permanent Mission of India to United Nations </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>551 U.S. 193, 199, 127 S. Ct. 2352, 168 L. Ed. 2d 85 (2007), and have examined the relevant common law and international practice when interpreting the Act, <em>id., </em>at 200-201, 127 S. Ct. 2352, 168 L. Ed. 2d 85. Because of this relationship between the Act and the common law that it codified, petitioner argues that we should construe the FSIA consistently with the common law regarding individual immunity, which\u2014in petitioner\u2019s view\u2014was coextensive with the law of state immunity and always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>immunized a foreign official for acts taken on behalf of the foreign state. Even reading the Act in light of Congress\u2019 purpose of codifying <em>state </em>sovereign immunity, however, we do not think that the Act codified the common law with respect to the immunity of individual officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The canon of construction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the common law helps us interpret a statute that clearly covers a field formerly governed by the common law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the canon does not help us to decide the antecedent question whether, when a statute\u2019s coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended the statute to govern a particular field\u2014in this case, whether Congress intended the FSIA to supersede the common law of official immunity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">[560 U.S. 321]</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Petitioner argues that because state and official immunities are coextensive, Congress must have codified official immunity when it codified state immunity. See Brief for Petitioner 26-30. But the relationship between a state\u2019s immunity and an official\u2019s immunity is more complicated than petitioner suggests, although we need not and do not resolve the dispute among the parties as to the precise scope of an official\u2019s immunity at common law. The very authority to which petitioner points us, and which we have previously found instructive, see, <em>e.g., Permanent Mission, </em>551 U.S., at 200, 127 S. Ct. 2352, 168 L. Ed. 2d 85, states that  the immunity of individual officials is subject to a caveat not applicable to any of the other entities or person<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to which the foreign state\u2019s immunity extends. The Restatement provides that the \u201cimmunity of a foreign state . . . extends to . . . any other public minister, official, or agent of the state with respect to acts performed in his official capacity <em>if the effect of exercising jurisdiction would, be to enforce a rule of law against the state.\u201d </em>Restatement \u00a7 66 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And historically, the Government sometimes sug-</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>[560 U.S. 322]</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">gested immunity under the common law for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qualify. See, <em>e.g., Greenspan </em>v. <em>Crosbie, </em>No. 74 Civ. 4734 (GLG), 1976 WL 841 (SDNY, Nov. 23, 1976). There is therefore little reason to presume that when Congress set out to codify state immunity, it must also have, <em>sub silentio, </em>intended to codify official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Petitioner urges that a suit against an official must always be equivalent to a suit against the state because acts taken by a state official on behalf of a state are acts of the state. See Brief for Petitioner 26.  We have recognized, in the context of the act of state doctrine, that an official\u2019s acts can be considered the acts of the foreign state, and that \u201cthe courts of one country will not sit in judgment\u201d of those acts when done within the territory of the foreign state. See <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>168 U.S. 250, 252, 254, 18 S. Ct. 83, 42 L. Ed. 456 (1897). Although the act of state doctrine is distinct from immunity, and instead \u201cprovides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits,\u201d <em>Altmann, </em>541 U.S., at 700, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1, we do not doubt that in some circumstances the immunity of the foreign state extends to an individual for acts taken in his official capacity. But it does not follow from this premise that Congress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA. It hardly furthers Congress\u2019 purpose of \u201cclarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 699, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1, to lump individual officials in with foreign states without so much as a word spelling out how and when individual officials are covered.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">[560 U.S. 323]</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">Petitioner would have a stronger case if there were any indication that Congress\u2019 intent to enact a comprehensive solution for suits against states extended to suits against individual officials. But to the extent Congress contemplated the Act\u2019s effect upon officials at all, the evidence points in the opposite direction. As we have already mentioned, the legislative history points toward an intent to leave official immunity outside the scope of the Act. See n. 12, <em>supra. </em>And although questions of official immunity did arise in the pre-FSIA period, they were few and far between. <footnotemark>18</footnotemark>\n                   The immunity of officials simply was not the particular problem to which Congress was responding when it enacted the FSIA. The FSIA was adopted, rather, to address \u201ca modern world where foreign state enterprises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>are every day participants in commercial activities,\u201d and to assure litigants that decisions regarding claims against states and their enterprises \u201care made on purely legal grounds.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 7. We have been given no reason to believe that Congress saw as a problem, or wanted to eliminate, the State Department\u2019s role in determinations regarding individual official immunity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">[560 U.S. 324]</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">Finally, our reading of the FSIAwill not \u201cin effect make the statute optional,\u201d as some Courts of Appeals have feared, by allowing litigants through \u201cartful pleading ... to take advantage of the Act\u2019s provisions or, alternatively, choose to proceed under the old common law,\u201d <em>Chuidian </em>v. <em>Philippine Nat. Bank, </em>912 F.2d 1095, 1102 (CA9 1990).  Even if a suit is not governed by the Act, it may still be barred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common law. And not every suit can successfully be pleaded against an individual official alone.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Even when a plaintiff names only a foreign official, it may be the case that the foreign state itself, its political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality is a required party, because that party has \u201can interest relating to the subject of the action\u201d and \u201cdisposing of the action in the person\u2019s absence may ... as a practical matter impair or impede the person\u2019s ability to protect the interest.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(B). If this is the case, and the entity is immune</p>\n<p id=\"agm-dedup-3\">[560 U.S. 325]</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">from suit under the FSIA, the district court may have to dismiss the suit, regardless of whether the official is immune or not under the common law. See <em>Republic of Philippines </em>v. <em>Pimentel, </em>553 U.S. 851, 867, 128 S. Ct. 2180, 171 L. Ed. 2d 131 (2008) (  \u201c[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to the interests of the absent sovereign\u201d). Or [28] it may be the case that some actions against an official in his official capacity should be treated as actions against the foreign state itself, as the state is the real party in interest. Cf. <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985) (\u201c[A]n official-capacity suit is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity. It is <em>not </em>a suit against the official personally, for the real party in interest is the entity\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the statute\u2019s text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt to select between application of the FSIA or the common law. And we think  this case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets, is properly governed by the common law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term. Although Congress clearly intended to supersede the common-law regime for claims against foreign states, we find nothing in the statute\u2019s origin or aims to indicate that Congress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-3\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA leads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals correctly held the FSIA does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim of immunity. The Act therefore did not deprive the District Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. We emphasize, however, the narrowness of our holding. Whether petitioner may be entitled to immunity under the common law, and whether he may</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">[560 U.S. 326]</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">have other valid defenses to the grave charges against him, are matters to be addressed in the first instance by the District Court on remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-16\">. Although we do not set out respondents\u2019 allegations in detail, the District Court\u2019s written opinion contains a comprehensive summary, describing not only the abuses respondents suffered but also the historical context in which the abuses occurred, as well as some of the attempts to establish a stable government in Somalia in recent years. See No. 1:04cv1360 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-43a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">.

Because we hold that  the FSIA does not govern whether an individual foreign official enjoys immunity from suit, we need not reach respondents\u2019 argument that an official is not immune under the FSIA for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. See Brief for Respondents 51-5 3. We note that in determining petitioner had not acted beyond the scope of his authority, the District Court afforded great weight to letters from the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to the State Department, App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a, in which the TFG supported petitioner\u2019s claim of immunity and stated \u201cthe actions attributed to [petitioner] in the lawsuit. . . would have been taken by [petitioner] in his official capacities,\u2019\u2019 App. 104. Although the District Court described the TFG as \u201crecognized by the United States as the governing body in Somalia,\u2019\u2019 App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a, the United States does not recognize the TFG (or any other entity) as the Government of Somalia, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">.

As an alternative basis for its decision, the Court of Appeals held that even if a current official is covered by the FSIA, a former official is not. See 552 F.3d, at 381-383.

Petitioner points out that \u00a7 1603(b)(3) describes only which defendants <em>cannot </em>be agencies or instrumentalities. He suggests that it therefore tells us nothing about which defendants <em>can </em>be covered by that term. Brief for Petitioner 46. Even if so, reading \u00a7 1603(b) as petitioner suggests would leave us with the odd result that a corporation that is the citizen of a state is excluded from the definition under \u00a7 1603(b)(3), and thus not immune, whereas a natural person who is the citizen of a state is not excluded, and thus retains his immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">.  Nor does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress intended the term \u201cagency or instrumentality\u2019\u2019 to include individuals. On the contrary, the legislative history, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities. See, <em>e.g., </em>H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p. 15 (1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (\u201cThe first criterion, that the entity be a separate legal person, is intended to include a corporation, association, foundation, or any other entity which, under the law of the foreign state where it was created, can sue or be sued in its own name\u2019\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">Justice Scalia may well be correct that it is not strictly necessary to confirm our reading of the statutory text by consulting the legislative history, see <em>post, </em>at 326-327, 176 L.

But as the Court explained some years ago in an opinion authored by Justice White:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">\u201cAs for the propriety of using legislative history at all, common sense suggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing additional information rather than ignoring it.

Petitioner argues that \u00a7 1605A abrogates immunity for certain acts by individual officials, which would be superfluous if the officials were not otherwise immune. See Brief for Petitioner 41-43. But the import of \u00a7 1605A is precisely the opposite.  First, \u00a7 1605A(a)(l) eliminates the immunity of the <em>state </em>for certain acts of its officers; it says a \u201cforeign state shall not be immune\u201d in a suit \u201cin which money damages are sought against a foreign state.\u201d As it does not expressly refer to the immunity of individual officers, it adds nothing to petitioner\u2019s argument. Second, the creation of a cause of action against both the \u201cforeign state\u201d and \u201cany official, employee, or agent\u201d thereof, \u00a7 1605A(c), reinforces the idea that \u201cforeign state\u201d does not by definition include foreign officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1151-13\">.

The Courts of Appeals have had to develop, in the complete absence of any statutory text, rules governing when an official is entitled to immunity under the FSIA.

That may be correct as a matter of common-law principles, but it does not derive from any clarification or codification by Congress. Furthermore, if Congress intended the FSIA to reach individuals, one would expect the Act to have addressed whether <em>former </em>officials are covered, an issue it settled with respect to instrumentalities, see <em>Dole Food Co. </em>v. <em>Patrickson, </em>538 U.S. 468, 478, 123 S. Ct. 1655, 155 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2003) (\u201c[instrumentality status [must] be determined at the time suit is filed\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">. A study that attempted to gather all of the State Department decisions related to sovereign immunity from the adoption of the restrictive theory in 1952 to the enactment of the FSIA reveals only four decisions related to official immunity, and two related to head of state immunity, out of a total of 110 decisions. Sovereign Immunity Decisions of the Dept. of State, May 1952 to Jan. 1977 (M. Sandler, D. Vagts, &amp; B. Ristau eds.), in Digest of U. S. Practice in International Law 1977, pp. 1020, 1080 (hereinafter Digest).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">. The PSIA was introduced in accordance with the recommendation of the State Department. H. R. Rep., at 6. The Department sought and supported the elimination of its role with respect to claims against foreign states and their agencies or instrumentalities. See Hearings on H. R. 11315 before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 34 (1976) (testimony of Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Dept, of State) (\u201c[I]t is our judgment . . . that the advantages of having a judicial determination greatly outweigh the advantage of being able to intervene in a lawsuit\u201d). But the Department has from the time of the PSIA\u2019s enactment understood the Act to leave intact the Department\u2019s role in official immunity cases. See Digest 1020 (\u201cThese decisions [of the Department regarding the immunity of officials] may be of some future significance, because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not deal with the immunity of individual officials, but only that of foreign states and their political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">. Furthermore, a plaintiff seeking to sue a foreign official will not be able to rely on the Act\u2019s service of process and jurisdictional provisions. Thus, a plaintiff will have to establish that the district court has personal jurisdiction over an official without the benefit of the PSIA provision that makes personal jurisdiction over a foreign state automatic when an exception to immunity applies and service of process has been accomplished in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608. See \u00a7 1330(b) (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a),\u201d <em>i.e., </em>claims for which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity, \u201cwhere service has been made under section 1608 of this title\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b1155-11\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"A_C_\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">I join the opinion of the Court, although I think that the citations to legislative history are of little if any value here.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1155-13\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"AB2I\">concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">I join the Court\u2019s opinion except for those parts relying on the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602 <em>et seq. </em>In my view, the Court\u2019s textual analysis is sufficient to resolve this case. See <em>post </em>this page and 327-329, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1067-1069 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1155-15\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"ALVl\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-16\">The Court\u2019s admirably careful textual analysis, <em>ante, </em>at 313-319, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1060-1063, demonstrates that the term \u201cforeign state\u201d in the provision \u201ca foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, does not include foreign officials. Yet the Court insists on adding legislative history to its analysis. I could understand that (though not agree with it) if, in the absence of supposed legislative-history support, the Court would reach a different result. Or even if there was something in the legislative history that clearly contradicted the Court\u2019s result, and had to be explained away. That is not the situation here (or at least the Court\u2019s opinion does not think it to be so). The Court assures us, however (if this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>could be thought assurance), that legislative history is \u201c \u2018not generally so misleading\u2019 \u201d that it should \u201c \u2018never\u2019 \u201d be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">[560 U.S. 327]</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\"><em>Ante, </em>at 316, n. 9, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1061 (quoting <em>Wisconsin Public Intervenor </em>v. <em>Mortier, </em>501 U.S. 597, 611-612, n. 4, 111 S. Ct. 2476, 115 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1991)). Surely that is damning by faint praise. And the Court\u2019s mention of the past practice of using legislative history, <em>ante, </em>at 316, n. 9, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1061, does not support the Court\u2019s use of it today. The past practice was <em>\u201cnot </em>the practice of utilizing legislative history for the purpose of giving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory text,\u201d <em>Mortier, supra, </em>at 622, 111 S. Ct. 2476, 115 L. Ed. 2d 532 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">The Court\u2019s introduction of legislative history serves no purpose except needlessly to inject into the opinion a mode of analysis that not all of the Justices consider valid. And it does so, to boot, in a fashion that does not isolate the superfluous legislative history in a section that those of us who disagree categorically with its use, or at least disagree with its superfluous use, can decline to join. I therefore do not join the opinion, and concur only in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">The Court relies on legislative history to support three of its positions. First, after explaining why the phrase \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the definition of \u201cforeign state,\u201d see \u00a7 1603(a), (b), does not refer to natural persons, <em>ante, </em>at 315-318, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1060-1063, the Court says \u201c[n]or does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress intended the term \u2018agency or instrumentality\u2019 to include individuals,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 316, n. 9, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1061. According to the Court, \u201cthe legislative history, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Apparently, the legislative history must be consulted, not to show that it <em>supports </em>the Court\u2019s textual analysis, or even to explain why its seeming contradiction of the Court\u2019s analysis is inconsequential, but to show nothing more than that it contains the same ambiguous language as the text. This is beyond all reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">Second, after concluding its review of the statute\u2019s text, the Court states that the \u201clegislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend the [Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976] to address position-based individual immunities</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-11\">[560 U.S. 328]</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">such as diplomatic and consular immunity,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 319, n. 12, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1063. See also <em>ante, </em>at 323, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1065-1066. It cites for this proposition a House Committee Report that we have no reason to believe was read (much less approved) by the Senate\u2014 or, indeed, by the Members of the House who were not on the Committee\u2014or even, for that matter, by the members of the Committee, who never voted on the Report. In any case, the quoted excerpt does not address \u201cposition-based individual immunities\u201d in general but only \u201cdiplomatic and consular immunity,\u201d which is not at issue here. Unless diplomatic and consular immunity, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, what <em>is </em>at issue here\u2014state-agent immunity\u2014are always treated the same (which I doubt and the Court does not attempt to establish), the passage contributes nothing to analysis of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">The same footnote also quotes a portion of the same House Report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-14\">\u201c \u2018The bill does not attempt to deal with questions of discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a diplo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>mat in the United States or a high-ranking official of a foreign government, diplomatic and official immunity would apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 319, n. 12, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1063.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\">If anything, this passage cuts against the Court\u2019s result. The two sentences omitted from the above quotation read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-5\">\u201cExisting law appears to be adequate in this area. For example, if a private plaintiff sought the production of sensitive governmental documents of a foreign state, concepts of governmental privilege would apply.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p. 23 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Thus, the House Report makes it clear that the bill\u2019s failure to deal with discovery applies to <em>both </em>discovery against sovereigns <em>and </em>discovery against foreign officials. But the latter would have been unnecessary if the bill dealt only with sovereigns. The implication (if any) is that the bill\u2019s provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">[560 U.S. 329]</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">regarding immunity from suit apply to both sovereigns and foreign officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-9\">Third, and finally, the Court points to legislative history to establish the purpose of the statute. See <em>ante, </em>at 323, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1065-1066, and n. 19. This is particularly puzzling, because the <em>enacted </em>statutory text itself includes findings and a declaration of purpose\u2014the very same purpose (surprise!) that the Court finds evidenced in the legislative history. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602. To make matters worse, the Court itself notes this statutory declaration of purpose twice earlier, in the body of its opinion, see <em>ante, </em>at 313, 319-320, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1059, 1063-1064. If those textual references to the statute itself were deleted, the footnoted citation of legislative history would at least perform some function. As it is, however, it adds nothing except the demonstration of assiduous law-clerk research.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">It should be no cause for wonder that, upon careful examination, all of the opinion\u2019s excerpts from legislative history turn out to be, at best, nonpro-bative or entirely duplicative of text. After all, legislative history is almost never the real reason for the Court\u2019s decision\u2014and makeweights do not deserve a lot of the Court\u2019s time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
