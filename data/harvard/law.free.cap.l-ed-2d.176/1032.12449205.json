The state court rejected that claim after making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an expert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under the governing federal statute, that factual finding is presumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1)-(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court of Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifically \u00a7 2254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself \u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept the state court\u2019s finding, and rejected Jefferson\u2019s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable exceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-15\">When Jefferson was a child, he \u201csuffered a serious injury to his head.\u201d <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>490 F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1326 (ND Ga. 2007); see <em>id., </em>at 1320 (quoting Jefferson\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that \u201ca car ran over the top of his head\u201d when he was two years old). The accident left his skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly scarred. <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>570 F.3d 1283, 1311, 1315, n. 4 (CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting). During the District Court proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified that, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has \u201cpermanent brain damage\u201d that \u201ccauses abnormal behavior\u201d over which he \u201chas no or substantially limited control.\u201d 490 F. Supp. 2d, at 1321-1322. According to these experts, Jefferson\u2019s condition causes \u201c \u2018emotional dullness,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018restless or aggressive characteristics,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018impulsiveness,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018temper outbursts,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018markedly diminished impulse control,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018impaired social judgment,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018transient outbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his normal behavioral pattern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1322, 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-18\">The experts further testified that Jefferson\u2019s \u201c \u2018severe cognitive disabilities\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018profoundly alter\u2019 \u201d his \u201c \u2018abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>ity to plan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the consequences</p>\n<p id=\"A2EA\">[560 U.S. 286]</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or intentional acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1327. But they testified he is neither psychotic nor retarded. <em>Id., </em>at 1319. Thus, they said, to a lay observer or even to a professional psychologist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally impaired. Indeed, according to the experts, \u201c \u2018the behavior that may result from\u2019 \u201d his condition \u201c \u2018could, without the administration of proper testing, be mistaken for volitional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co-worker while the two men were fishing. <em>Id., </em>at 1271-1272. Prior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named Dr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which he concluded that Jefferson\u2019s mental deficiencies do not impair \u201c \u2018his judgment or decision-making capacity.\u2019 \u201d 570 F.3d, at 1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley\u2019s report included a caveat: \u201c \u2018One possibility that could not be explored because of [Jefferson\u2019s] incarceration has to do with the sequelae,\u2019 \u201d <em>i.e., </em>pathologies, related to a \u201c \u2018head injury experienced during childhood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c \u2018In my opinion,\u2019 \u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2018it would be worthwhile to conduct neuropsycho-logical evaluation of this individual to rule out an organic etiology,\u2019 \u201d <em>i.e., </em>to rule out brain damage. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">Although \u201cit is undisputed that the testing\u201d Dr. Dudley recommended \u201ccould have easily been performed,\u201d 490 F. Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson\u2019s attorneys possessed police reports and hospital records recounting his head injury, <em>id., </em>at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jefferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testimony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson was an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of Jefferson\u2019s family, who testified that he is a \u201cresponsible, generous, gentle, and kind\u201d person and \u201ca good father.\u201d 570 F.3d, at 1290-1291. And while Jefferson\u2019s mother briefly mentioned the car accident, \u201cshe was not questioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the impact, if any, that the accident had on him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1291. Thus, \u201c[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson</p>\n<p id=\"aiqd-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 287]</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">did not suffer from brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no organic disorders\u201d; and \u201chis emotional stability, impulse control, and judgment were perfectly normal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1311 (Car-nes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue brain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys testified that they did not pursue such testing because, after delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later told them that further investigation \u201c \u2018may be a waste of time because the rest of [his] report\u2019 \u201d had \u201c \u2018said that [Jefferson] was non psychotic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1295 (quoting testimony). Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the hearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that he had ever made such statements. He said \u201cit had always been his expert opinion \u2018that neuropsychological testing was necessary\u2019 \u201d and that when he wrote as much in his formal report \u201che \u2018meant it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1312 (Carnes, J., dissenting) (quoting affidavit). He added, \u201c \u2018I never, before or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson\u2019s attorneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it would not be worthwhile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>cf. Pet. for Cert. 17, n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">Jefferson contends, and the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>has not disputed, that after the hearing concluded the state-court judge contacted the attorneys for the State <em>ex parte. </em>And in a private conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his attorneys, the judge asked the State\u2019s attorneys to draft the opinion of the court. See <em>id., </em>at 3, 12. According to Jefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he informed of the request made to opposing counsel. <em>Id., </em>at 12, n. 8, 13; see also <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>263 Ga. 316, 431 S.E.2d 110, 111 (1993) (\u201cJefferson contends [the order] amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which [he] has not had a chance to respond\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding that \u201cDr. Dudley led [Jefferson\u2019s trial attorneys] to believe that further investigation would simply be a waste of time</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">[560 U.S. 288]</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.\u201d <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>Civ. Action No. 87-V-1241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Oct. 7, 1992), p. 16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter State Order); see also <em>id., </em>at 37. The opinion \u201cspecifically credits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to their efforts to investigate Petitioner\u2019s mental condition.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 18; see also <em>id., </em>at 36. And relying on these findings, it concludes that Jefferson\u2019s attorneys \u201cmade a reasonable investigation into [his] mental health\u201d and were thus not ineffective. <em>Id., </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged, the State\u2019s opinion discusses statements purportedly made on Jefferson\u2019s behalf by a witness \u201cwho did not testify\u201d or participate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S.E.2d, at 112; see State Order 24-25. Nonetheless, the opinion \u201cwas adopted verbatim by the [state] court.\u201d 263 Ga., at 317, 431 S.E.2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme Court recognized that we have \u201c \u2018criticized\u2019 \u201d such a practice, it affirmed the judgment. <em>Id., </em>at 317, 320, 431 S.E.2d, at 112, 114 (quoting <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 572, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">Jefferson next sought federal ha-beas relief in the District Court. In his opening brief, he argued that \u201cthere is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus Court.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. l:96-CV-989-CC (ND Ga.), Doc. 105, p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court Brief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the state court \u201cmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revision of a single word,\u201d even though the order \u201cdescribed witnesses who never testified.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>And he said that such a process \u201crais[es] serious doubts as to whether [the judge] even read, much less carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the State.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">[560 U.S. 289]</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">The District Court ruled in Jefferson\u2019s favor. It noted that under the relevant statute \u201cfactual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct unless one of . . . eight enumerated exceptions . . . applies.\u201d 490 F. Supp. 2d, at 1280; see also <em>ibid.., </em>n. 5 (listing the exceptions). And it acknowledged \u201cthe state habeas corpus court\u2019s failure to explain the basis\u201d for its credibility findings. <em>Id., </em>at 1324, n. 17. But it accepted Jefferson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without disturbing the state court\u2019s factual findings because it believed he should prevail even accepting those findings as true. <em>Id., </em>at 1324-1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court\u2019s judgment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that the state court\u2019s factfinding was \u201cdubious at best\u201d in light of the process that court employed, and that the Court of Appeals therefore \u201cshould harbor serious doubts about the findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state court record.\u201d Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07-12502 (CA11), pp. 31-32, n. 10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jefferson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing, he challenges\u2014as he did in the State Supreme Court, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals\u2014\u201cthe fact findings of the state court,\u201d given what he describes as the deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing his claim. Pet. for Cert. 11-13, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13 (recounting \u201c \u2018reason[s] to doubt\u2019 \u201d the state court\u2019s findings). Cf. <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation, </em>513 U.S. 374, 379, 115 S. Ct. 961, 130 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1995) (stating standard for preserving an issue for review in this Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment of the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it existed prior to that point. <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 326-336, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">[560 U.S. 290]</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">(1997). In 1963, we set forth the \u201cappropriate standard\u201d to be applied by a \u201cfederal court in habeas corpus\u201d when \u201cthe facts\u201d pertinent to a habeas applica-</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">tion \u201care in dispute.\u201d <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770. We held that when \u201cthe habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable findings\u201d the district court \u201cordinarily should ... accept the facts as found\u201d by the state-court judge. <em>Id., </em>at 318, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770. However, \u201cif the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,\u201d we held that the federal court \u201cmust hold an evidentiary hearing\u201d to resolve any facts that \u201care in dispute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 312, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770. We further \u201cexplain [ed] the controlling criteria\u201d by enumerating six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hearing would be required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-11\">\u201c(1) [T]he merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) <em>the fact-finding procedure </em>employed by the state court <em>was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing-, </em>(4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) <em>for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford, the habeas applicant a full and. fair fact </em>hearing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 313, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">Three years later, in 1966, Congress enacted an amendment to the federal habeas statute that \u201cwas an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated in <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sain.\u201d Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 111, 106 S. Ct. 445, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1985). That codification read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>\u201cIn any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination ... of a factual issue, made by a State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-4\">[560 U.S. 291]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-5\">court of competent jurisdiction . . . , shall be presumed to be correct, <em>unless </em>the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-6\">\u201c(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the State court hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-7\">\u201c(2) <em>that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford, a full and fair hearing;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-8\">\u201c(3) that the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-9\">\u201c(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or over the person of the applicant in the State court proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-10\">\u201c(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right, failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State court proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-11\">\u201c(6) <em>that the applicant did not receive a full, fail; and. adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-12\">\u201c(7) <em>that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the State court proceeding;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-13\">\u201c(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a consideration of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determination <em>is not fairly supported, by the </em>record..\u201d \u00a7 2254(d) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-14\">As is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as the District Court correctly stated,  if any \u201cone of the eight enumerated exceptions . . . applies\u201d then \u201cthe state court\u2019s factfinding is not presumed correct.\u201d 490 F. Supp. 2d, at 1280; accord, Miller, <em>supra, </em>at 105, 106 S. Ct. 445, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405 (\u201cUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), state-court findings of fact \u2018shall be presumed to be correct\u2019 in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies\u201d); see also 1 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a7 20.2c, pp. 915-918 (5th ed. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-15\">[560 U.S. 292]</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-16\">Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts \u201cshould harbor serious doubts about\u201d and should not \u201cgive any deference to\u201d the \u201cfindings of fact and credibility determinations\u201d made by the state habeas court because those findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys for the State pursuant to an <em>ex parte </em>request from the state-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson, failed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing counsel, and adopted the State\u2019s proposed opinion verbatim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent witness. See, <em>e.g., </em>Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court Brief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that the state court\u2019s <em>process </em>was deficient. In other words, they are arguments that Jefferson \u201cdid not receive a full and fair eviden-tiary hearing in . . . state court.\u201d <em>Townsend, supra, </em>at 312, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770. Or, to use the statutory language, they are arguments that the state court\u2019s \u201cfactfind-ing procedure,\u201d \u201chearing,\u201d and \u201cproceeding\u201d were not \u201cfull, fair, and adequate.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-17\">But the Court of Appeals did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>consider the state court\u2019s process when it applied the statutory presumption of correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8) of \u00a7 2254(d), which, codifying the second <em>Townsend </em>exception, 372 U.S., at 313, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770, lifts the presumption of correctness for findings that are \u201cnot fairly supported by the record.\u201d See 570 F.3d, at 1300 (quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. Herring, 42 F.3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in turn quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8)). And even though the Court of Appeals \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that Jefferson had argued that the state court\u2019s <em>process </em>had produced factual findings that were \u201c \u2018dubious at best,\u2019 \u201d and that federal courts should therefore \u201c \u2018harbor serious doubts about\u2019 \u201d the state court\u2019s \u201c \u2018findings of fact and credibility,\u2019 \u201d the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court\u2019s findings are \u201c \u2018entitled to a presumption of correctness\u2019 \u201d that it was \u201cduty-bound\u201d to apply. 570 F.3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that it considered itself</p>\n<p id=\"akv0-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 293]</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\">\u201cduty-bound\u201d to defer to the state court\u2019s findings because \u201cJefferson has not argued that any of the state courts\u2019 factual findings were <em>\u2018not fairly supported by the record \u2019 </em>\u201d a direct reference to \u00a7 2254(d)(8) and to the second <em>Townsend, </em>exception. 570 F.3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then concluded: \u201cBased on these factual findings of the state ha-beas courts\u2014all of which are <em>fairly supported by the </em>record.\u2014we believe that Jefferson\u2019s counsel were reasonable in deciding not to pursue neuro-psychological testing.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 1304 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly consider the legal status of the state court\u2019s factual findings. Under Townsend., as codified by the governing statute, a federal court is not \u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept any and all state-court findings that are \u201cfairly supported by the record.\u201d Those words come from \u00a7 2254(d)(8), which is only one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of correctness. But there are seven others, see \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when addressing Jefferson\u2019s claim. To be sure, we have previously stated in cases <em>applying </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(8) that \u201ca federal court\u201d may not overturn a state court\u2019s factual conclusion \u201cunless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em>498 U.S. 308, 320, 111 S. Ct. 731, 112 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1991) (granting federal habeas relief after rejecting state court\u2019s finding under \u00a7 2254(d)(8)); see also <em>Demosthenes </em>v. <em>Baal, </em>495 U.S. 731, 110 S. Ct. 2223, 109 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1990) <em>(per curiam) </em>(applying \u00a7 2254(d)(8)); cf. <em>post, </em>at 303, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1045 (Scalia, J., dissenting). But in those cases there was no suggestion that any <em>other </em>provisions enumerated in \u00a7 2254(d) were at issue. That is not the case here. In treating \u00a7 2254(d)(8) as the <em>exclusive </em>statutory exception, and by failing to address Jefferson\u2019s argument that the state court\u2019s <em>procedures </em>deprived its findings of deference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and our precedents incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Although we have stated that a court\u2019s \u201cverbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties\u201d should be</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">[560 U.S. 294]</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">treated as findings of the court, we have also criticized that practice. <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S., at 572, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518. And we have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the application of the habeas statute to, the use of such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>practice where (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings <em>ex parte, </em>(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to criticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that the judge may not have read them. Cf. <em>id., </em>at 568, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518; Ga. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibiting <em>ex parte </em>judicial communications).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">We decline to determine in the first instance whether any of the exceptions enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 2254(d)(1)-(8) apply in this case, see, <em>e.g., Cutter </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020 (2005), especially given that the facts surrounding the state habeas court\u2019s process are undeveloped. Respondent has conceded that the State drafted the state court\u2019s final order at that court\u2019s request and that the order was adopted verbatim, 263 Ga., at 317, 431 S.E.2d, at 111, and has not disputed in this Court that the state court solicited the order <em>\u201cex parte </em>and without prior notice\u201d and \u201cdid not seek a proposed order from Petitioner,\u201d Pet. for Cert. 12, and n. 8. But the precise nature of what transpired during the state-court proceedings is not fully known. See 263 Ga., at 316-317, 431 S.E.2d, at 111 (noting dispute as to whether Jefferson \u201chad a chance to respond\u201d to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts to determine on remand whether the state court\u2019s factual findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of their resolution of that issue. See <em>Townsend, </em>372 U.S., at 313-319, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770; <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes, </em>504 U.S. 1, 112 S. Ct. 1715, 118 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1992). In so holding, we express no opinion as to whether Jefferson\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated assuming the state court\u2019s factual findings to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">[560 U.S. 295]</p>\n<p id=\"pAaDG\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"33\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAR0AAAAhAQAAAADM3kK0AAAAj0lEQVR4nN3TsQ3CMBSE4d9HASUFA2SQDMAeLMAIsFtK2CFFBkhrIdmUfsVJToEQ4nXf6WQ/F06V7mT1O/CjpRJtIXjF3OKTO9X70ughyhRXtRCa53CwhUjXR8s9BJc1XGGRKnkfcocseN5CbiE4H0JuIepxbLGHKMPQcg+xG08t99j6uv5sKqV//3ffLL0B3gU63bm/+V0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"285\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">The petition for a writ of certiorari and motion to proceed <em>in forma pau-peris </em>are granted.

In my view the Court should either answer that question or (as I would prefer) deny the petition. In-</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-14\">stead, it summarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an altogether different ground that was neither raised nor passed upon below and that is not fairly included within the sole question presented. To make matters worse, the Court conjures up an \u201cerror\u201d with respect to that ground by misquoting and mischaracteriz-ing the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion, <em>ante, </em>at 293, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1039, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>and by overlooking relevant authority from this Court. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">The prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1994 ed.) applicable in this case provided that in federal habeas proceedings the factual determinations of a state court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct,\u201d unless the applicant proves, the respondent admits, or a federal court determines that one of eight exceptions set forth in \u00a7 2254(d)( 1)\u2014(8) applies. The Court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit misapplied that provision and our precedents by treating one of those exceptions, \u00a7 2254(d)(8), \u201cas the <em>exclusive </em>statutory exception\u201d to the presumption of correctness, and by failing to address</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">[560 U.S. 296]</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">whether \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), or (7) might also bar application of that presumption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>at 293, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">The Court\u2019s opinion, however, is the first anyone (including Jefferson) has heard of this argument. Jefferson\u2019s briefs below contain no discussion or even citation of subsection (d)\u2014let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)\u2014 and the courts below understandably never passed upon the application of those provisions. Under our longstanding practice, that should be the end of the matter. See, <em>e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Yeskey, </em>524 U.S. 206, 212-213, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">But the Court insists, <em>ante, </em>at 289, 292, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1036-1037, 1038-1039, that if we squint at them long enough we can see in Jefferson\u2019s briefs below a challenge to the state court\u2019s factfinding process cognizable under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of isolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds of pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court\u2019s only evidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District Court, <em>ante, </em>at 288, 292, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1036, 1038-1039, consists of a single sentence of text (and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the \u201cPrior Proceedings\u201d section of his 180-page brief. Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96-CV-989-CC (ND Ga.), Doc. 105 (hereinafter District Court Brief). The sentence is: \u201cIn entering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton merely signed an order drafted by the State without revision of a single word.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 4. The footnote adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-12\">[560 U.S. 297]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-13\">\u201c[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described witnesses who never testified, raising serious doubts as to whether he even read, much less carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the State. In this circumstance, there is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus Court, because there was apparently no serious consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>or deliberation of the factual and legal issues raised.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>n. 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">This passing suggestion that deference would be unwarranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that the state factfinding procedure was inadequate, \u00a7 2254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and adequate hearing, \u00a7 2254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was denied due process of law, \u00a7 2254(d)(7). And it only appeared, I emphasize again, in the \u201cPrior Proceedings\u201d section of the brief. The <em>argument </em>section of Jefferson\u2019s District Court Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing separate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no mention of the ground upon which the Court today relies. And the assignment of error that is the basis for the question presented in Jefferson\u2019s petition, VI, <em>id., </em>at 48-80, did not dispute the state courts\u2019 factual findings under \u00a7 2254(d), but only challenged the state courts\u2019 legal conclusion that his attorneys\u2019 failure to conduct a fuller investigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not deficient performance under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh Circuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the state courts\u2019 \u201c[f]indings of fact and credibility determinations are reviewed for clear error.\u201d Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07-12502, pp. 16-17 (hereinafter Appeals Brief). It declared that \u201cThe District Court Correctly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court\u201d in adjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. <em>Id., </em>at 21 (some capitalization and boldface type deleted); see also <em>id., </em>at 29,</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">[560 U.S. 298]</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim, \u201c [t]he relevant facts are not in dispute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 24. Jefferson did characterize the state habeas court\u2019s factual findings as generally \u201cdubious\u201d and suggested there were \u201cserious doubts\u201d about them, <em>id., </em>at 31-32, n. 10. But not once did he argue that the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence of a failure to meet the requirements of \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), or (7)\u2014or even more generally that the findings should not be presumed correct under \u00a7 2254(d). Instead, he pressed the same argument he made in the District Court: Even if the state courts\u2019 factual findings were correct, his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to forgo further investigation of his childhood head injury. <em>Id., </em>at 31-33, 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-10\">Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the Court now addresses. The District Court did not dispute the state courts\u2019 factual findings. <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>490 F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1319-1320 (ND Ga. 2007). It accepted those findings as true, including the state habeas court\u2019s credibility findings, <em>id.., </em>at 1323-1324, and n. 17, but held \u201cas a matter of law\u201d that it was objectively unreasonable for Jefferson\u2019s attorneys \u201cnot to investigate\u201d further into the effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson\u2019s mental capacity and health, <em>id., </em>at 1324. Concluding that Jefferson was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sentencing hearing. <em>Id., </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination and reversed, holding that his trial attorneys\u2019 performance was not objectively unreasonable under <em>Strickland. Jefferson </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>570 F.3d 1283, 1301-1309 (CA11 2009). That court correctly stated the applicable framework under \u00a7 2254(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>\u201cPre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while the state courts\u2019 factual findings are \u2018subject to the presumption of correctness.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-4\">[560 U.S. 299]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-5\"><em>Freund v. Butterworth, </em>165 F.3d 839, 861 (11th Cir. 1999). Although these findings may be disregarded <em>if, for example, </em>they are \u2018not fairly supported by the record,\u2019 <em>Jackson v. Herring, </em>42 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8)), this Court has construed the \u2018presumption of correctness\u2019 standard to be the same as the \u2018clear error\u2019 standard of review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">Confronted with no argument that \u00a7 2254(d)( 1)\u2014(7) applied or that it must disregard the state courts\u2019 factual findings, the Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own, as required by \u00a7 2254(d)(8), to determine whether the state courts\u2019 factual determinations were fairly supported by the record. <em>Id., </em>at 1303-1304, and n. 8. In doing so, the court \u201cspecifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district court questioned the state court\u2019s factual finding that [the defense\u2019s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson\u2019s attorneys] to believe that further investigation <em>would, </em>simply be a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney\u2019s] testimony that [the expert] told him it \u2018may\u2019 be a waste of time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1303, n. 8 (some internal quotation marks omitted). It added that Jefferson did not \u201cpoint to any particular factual finding that was clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1304, n. 8\u2014applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed in his brief, see <em>supra, </em>at 297, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1041-1042. Even the dissent agreed that the court was \u201cobliged to accept\u201d the state courts\u2019 credibility determination, despite the \u201creasons to doubt it.\u201d 570 F.3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not cite \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the same question of constitutional law that occupied Jefferson\u2019s briefs, the District Court\u2019s opinion, and the majority\u2019s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and credibility determination of the state courts as true, Jefferson\u2019s attorneys rendered ineffective</p>\n<p id=\"AvUe\">[560 U.S. 300]</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">assistance of counsel. <em>That </em>is the only question that occupied the courts and the parties below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not raised or resolved in the lower courts. It is much worse that it decides an issue Jefferson has not even asked <em>us </em>to address. Under this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a), \u201c[o]nly the questions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court.\u201d We apply that rule in all but \u201cthe most exceptional cases, where reasons of urgency or of economy suggest the need to address the unpresented question in the case under consideration.\u201d <em>Yee </em>v. <em>Escondido, </em>503 U.S. 519, 535, 112 S. Ct. 1522, 118 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">Jefferson\u2019s petition for writ of cer-tiorari presents a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-13\">\u201c[W]hether the majority opinion, in affording trial counsel\u2019s decision to limit the scope of investigation in a death penalty case \u2018higher-than-strong presumption of reasonableness\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>conflicts with this Court\u2019s precedent as announced in <em>Williams v.

Nor does that question necessarily encompass whether the Court of Appeals misapplied that version of \u00a7 2254(d) in determining the deference due to the state courts\u2019 factual findings. The statutory question may be <em>\u201crelated </em>to,\u201d and \u201cperhaps <em>complementary </em>to the one petitioned] presented,\u201d but it is not \u201cfairly included therein.\u201d <em>Yee, supra, </em>at 537, 112 S.

Ed. 2d 153 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">[560 U.S. 301]</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">As for the body of Jefferson\u2019s petition: Far from invoking \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to support the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not even mention subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6), or (7). There is <em>no </em>argument, <em>anywhere </em>in the section entitled \u201cReasons for Granting the Writ,\u201d that the state courts\u2019 factual findings are not entitled to a presumption of correctness. Pet. for Cert. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">The Court claims, <em>ante, </em>at 289, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1036-1037, that Jefferson sufficiently presented the statutory issue by his characterizations of the state courts\u2019 factual findings in the \u201cStatement of the Case\u201d section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 2, 11-13, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, \u201c \u2018the fact that [petitioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for certiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires that a subsidiary question be fairly included in the <em>question presented </em>for our review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>558 U.S. 290, 304, 130 S. Ct. 841, 175 L. Ed. 2d 738 (2010) (quoting <em>Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha </em>v. <em>U. S. Philips Corp., </em>510 U.S. 27, 31, n. 5, 114 S. Ct. 425, 126 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1993) <em>(per curiam)). </em>But in any event, the cited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue. They contain no argument that \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s presumption is inapplicable because of \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely describe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11-13, and assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state-court findings (but for the \u00a7 2254(d) presumption), see <em>id., </em>at 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-9\">\u201cThe premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.\u201d <em>Carducci </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion for the Court by Scalia, J.). Our refusal to abide by standard rules of appellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose judgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respondent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without <em>ever </em>having an opportunity to address the merits of the statutory question the Court decides.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">[560 U.S. 302]</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">The Court\u2019s approach would be objectionable even if it were correct that the Court of Appeals went astray. But it is not. The Court of Appeals did <em>not </em>treat \u00a7 2254(d)(8) as \u201cthe <em>exclusive </em>statutory exception\u201d to the presumption of correctness. <em>Ante, </em>at 293, 176 L.

It is true that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>majority\u2019s opinion\u2014as well as the dissent\u2019s\u2014discussed only \u00a7 2254(d)(8). But that is because only \u00a7 2254(d)(8), and not \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the court\u2019s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion, there simply was no error in its application of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit ignored the other seven paragraphs in \u00a7 2254(d) when it \u201cinvoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8) of \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 292, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1038-1039. It did nothing of the sort. The Court of Appeals said that a state court\u2019s factual findings \u201cmay be disregarded <em>if, for example, </em>they are \u2018not fairly supported by the record,\u2019 <em>Jackson v. Herring, </em>42 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8)).\u201d 570 F.3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that \u00a7 2254(d)(8) was <em>but one example </em>of the grounds for disregarding a state court\u2019s factual findings. And the Circuit precedent it cited, <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>42 F.3d 1350 (CA11 1995), similarly did not imply, much less hold, that \u00a7 2254(d)(8) provided the only grounds for setting aside a state court\u2019s factual findings under \u00a7 2254(d). See <em>id., </em>at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">Next, the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-7\">\u201cAnd even though the Court of Appeals \u2018recognize [d]\u2019 that Jefferson had argued that the state court\u2019s <em>process </em>had produced factual findings that were \u2018 \u201cdubious at best,\u201d \u2019 and that federal courts should therefore \u2018 \u201charbor serious doubts about\u201d \u2019 the state court\u2019s \u2018 \u201cfindings of fact and credibility,\u201d \u2019 the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court\u2019s findings are \u2018 \u201centitled to a presumption of correctness\u201d \u2019 that it was \u2018duty-bound\u2019 to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-3\">[560 U.S. 303]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-8\">apply. 570 F.3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 292,176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1038-1039.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-12\">Again, the Court has plucked isolated language from here and there in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion, to produce a reading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed with, or at least did not contest, Jefferson\u2019s claim of \u201cserious doubts.\u201d That is not so. In the <em>first </em>paragraph of footnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was \u201cduty-bound to accept\u201d the state courts\u2019 factual findings because it concluded they \u201care clear, unambiguous, and fairly supported by the record.\u201d 570 F.3d, at 1303-1304, n. 8. That language precedes the panel\u2019s analysis\u2014in the <em>second </em>paragraph of footnote eight\u2014regarding Jefferson\u2019s statements that the findings were \u201cdubious\u201d and raised \u201cserious doubts.\u201d The Court omits the panel\u2019s <em>actual </em>explanation for declining to credit Jefferson\u2019s general characterization of the quality of the record, which is: \u201cJefferson does not point to any particular factual finding that was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the argument section of his brief that \u2018[t]he relevant facts are not in dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1304, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-13\">By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly described application of the pre-AEDPA version of \u00a7 2254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that would have been no worse than what we have done. For example, in <em>Demosthenes </em>v. <em>Baal, </em>495 U.S. 731, 735, 110 S. Ct. 2223, 109 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1990) <em>(per curiam), </em>we stated that a federal court may not overturn a state habeas court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cunless it concludes that they are not \u2018fairly supported by the record.\u2019 See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8).\u201d And in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Dug</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number><em>ger, </em>498 U.S. 308, 320, 111 S. Ct. 731, 112 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1991), we explained that a federal habeas court \u201cis not to overturn a factual conclusion of a state court, including a state appellate court, unless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the record.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">[560 U.S. 304]</p>\n<p id=\"pAFY_\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAR8AAAAsAQAAAAB0tYFXAAAAkklEQVR4nO2UsQlCQRBE3x8QzCxB2zCyEZswMzS0DEsxMBds5ScGcmvoBAMf4cLb7D1mYXc5bioWq7ScgRH6I3RxE0BA3U0n6DvTbW8igYCTdyUQcH6bTyDgOJuPUFWfbf0qQBOgnW8SQMDsPoGAlx8rgYDHxnwCAde1+QQCnivzEaqqHWzrAK3fK5jGXzBCHUNf4z1msSxVaHsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"287\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the duly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we find it to have been in error. More specifically, except where there has been an intervening legal development (such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that might alter the judgment below, we cannot <em>grant </em>a petition for certiorari, <em>vacate </em>the judgment below, and <em>remand </em>the case (GVR) simply to obtain a re-do. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>558 U.S. 1039, 1041-1042, 130 S. Ct. 456, 175 L. Ed. 2d 506 (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Yet today the Court vacates the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit on the basis of an error that court did not commit, with respect to a statutory issue that had never previously been raised, and remands for more extensive consideration of a new argument that <em>might </em>affect the judgment. Under the taxonomy of our increasingly unprincipled GVR practice, this creature is of the same genus as the \u201cSummary Remand for a More Extensive Opinion than Petitioner Requested\u201d (SRMEOPR). <em>Id., </em>at 1042, 130 S. Ct. 456, 175 L. Ed. 2d 506. But it is a distinctly odious species, deserving of its own name: Summary Remand to Ponder a Point Raised Neither Here nor Below (SRPPRNHB).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">.

The Court attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground that they contained \u201cno suggestion that any <em>other </em>provisions enumerated in \u00a7 2254(d) were at issue,\u2019\u2019 whereas \u201c[t]hat is not the case here.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 293, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1039. That is simply not so. As already noted, there was <em>no </em>\u201csuggestion\u201d here (let alone an actual <em>argument) </em>that paragraphs (2), (6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that petitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true\u2014and indeed more true\u2014of <em>Parker </em>and <em>Demosthenes. </em>In <em>Parker, </em>we stated the \u201ccrux of [petitioner\u2019s] contentions\u201d was that the state courts \u201cfail[ed] to treat adequately\u201d the evidence he presented. 498 U.S., at 313, 111 S.
