Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for further consideration in light of <em>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>559 U.S. 393, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (2010).

The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the rule of <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938), applies to federal suits under the Act, and that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 901(b) (West 2006)\u2014which bars class actions in suits seeking statutory damages\u2014is \u201csubstantive\u201d under <em>Erie. </em>485 F. Supp. 2d 179, 184-186 (EDNY 2007). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 had no bearing, it added, because \u201c\u00a7 901(b) is a matter not covered by [Rule] 23.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 185, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The Second Circuit summarily affirmed on the basis of its decision (issued the same day by the same panel) in <em>Bonime </em>v. <em>Avaya, Inc., </em>547 F.3d 497 (2008). <em>Bonime </em>held that \u00a7 901(b) applies to suits brought under the Act in federal court for two reasons. First, it read the Act to require that federal courts treat claims under the Act as though they arise under state law and therefore are subject to <em>Erie. </em>547 F.3d, at 501. Second, <em>Bonime </em>held that \u00a7 227(b)(3)\u2019s text\u2014which provides that \u201c[a] person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State\u201d a suit for actual and statutory damages\u2014prohibits federal courts from hearing suits under the Act that would be barred in state court. <em>Id., </em>at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\"><em>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., ante, </em>p. 393, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (2010), held that, irrespective of <em>Erie, </em>\u00a7 901(b) does not apply to state-law claims in federal court because it is validly pre-empted by Rule 23. <em>Ante, </em>at 398-406, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311; <em>ante, </em>at 406-410, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (plurality opinion); <em>ante, </em>at 429-436, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). That holding assuredly affects\u2014and in all likelihood <em>eliminates\u2014Bonime\u2019s </em>primary basis for applying \u00a7 901(b) in federal court. The dissent insists, however, that <em>Bonime\u2019s, </em>second ground remains unaffected. <em>Post, </em>at 1064, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 718 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">On one reading <em>of. Bonime\u2019s </em>opaque second ground, that is true: If the Second Circuit meant that \u00a7 227(b)(3) requires federal courts hearing claims under the Act to apply <em>all </em>state procedural rules that would effectively bar a suit, then <em>Shady Grove </em>has no bearing. That is, however, a highly implausible reading of the Act. Besides effecting an implied partial repeal of the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, it would require federal courts to enforce any prerequisite to suit state law makes mandatory\u2014a state rule limiting the length of the complaint, for example, or specifying the color and size of the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>A more probable meaning of <em>Bonime\u2019s </em>second ground is that when a State closes its doors to claims under the Act, \u00a7 227(b)(3) requires federal courts in the State to do so as well; but when such claims are allowed, the federal forum may apply its own procedures in processing them. See 547 F.3d, at 502 (\u201cThis statutory language is unambiguous\u2014a claim under the [Act] cannot be brought if not permitted by state law\u201d). Nothing in <em>Bonime </em>suggests, for example, that a federal court could not consolidate two suits under the Act for its own convenience, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42(a), even if the State\u2019s courts did not allow consolidation. Although that logic applies equally to Rule 23\u215b method of combining claims, <em>Bonime </em>may simply have assumed\u2014as the appellee urged it to conclude,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a number of District Courts had held,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as the Second Circuit itself held three weeks later<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2014that Rule 23 does not address whether class actions are available for specific claims. If that is what <em>Bonime </em>had in mind, <em>Shady Grove </em>will likely affect the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><em>Shady Grove </em>would also affect the outcome if the <em>Bonime </em>court believed that even if Rule 23 would otherwise allow a federal court to entertain a class action, \u00a7 227(b)(3) supersedes Rule 23 by precluding suits that cannot be brought in state courts, including class actions barred by \u00a7 901(b). <em>Shady Grove </em>reveals the error in this analysis: Section 901(b) does not prevent a plaintiff from <em>bringing </em>\u201can action to recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by statute\u201d\u2014as would be necessary to implicate \u00a7 227(b)(3)\u2014but only from \u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d such a suit <em>\u201cas a class action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Ante, </em>at 408, 130 S.

Holster sought statutory damages for Gatco\u2019s alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227, which authorizes a \u201c[p]rivate right of action\u201d when a person is \u201cotherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State\u201d to bring the action. \u00a7 227(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The District Court dismissed Holster\u2019s suit based on N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \u00a7 901(b) (West 2006), the provision at issue in <em>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., ante, </em>p. 393, 130 S. Ct. 1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (2010). That statute prescribes that, unless specifically ermitted, \u201can action to recover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d \u00a7 901(b). The District Court noted that, pursuant to \u00a7 901(b), New York courts had closed their doors to class actions seeking statutory damages under the TCPA. 485 F. Supp. 2d 179, 185 (EDNY 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Adopting its prior decision in <em>Bonime </em>v. <em>Avaya, Inc., </em>547 F.3d 497 (2008), the Second Circuit summarily affirmed. <em>Bonime </em>held that \u00a7 901(b) barred TCPA claims brought as class actions for two independent reasons. First, the Court of Appeals determined that \u00a7 901(b) governed because it qualified as \u201csubstantive\u201d under the doctrine of <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938). 547 F.3d, at 501-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">As a \u201csecond, independent\u201d ground for its holding, the <em>Bonime </em>panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201cThe private right of action created by the TCPA allows a person or entity to, \u2018if <em>otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, </em>bring . . . \u2019 an action for a violation of the TCPA. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(3) (emphasis added). This statutory language is unambiguous\u2014a claim under the TCPA cannot be brought if not permitted by state law. \u2018In determining the proper interpretation of a statute, this court will look first to the plain language of a statute and interpret it by its ordinary, common meaning. If the statutory terms are unambiguous, our review generally ends and the statute is construed according to the plain meaning of its words.\u2019 <em>Tyler v. Douglas, </em>280 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations, quotation marks, and alteration omitted). This provision constitutes an express limitation on the TCPA which federal courts are required to respect.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 502.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Judge Calabresi concurred, joining only the second ground \u201cidentified by the majority for its conclusion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As Judge Calabresi explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">\u201cA state law that bars suit in state court, like [CPLR] 901(b), .. . effectively eliminates the cause of action created under the TCPA because it eliminates the \u2018may\u2019 and the rest of the phrase that follows (\u2018bring ... an action\u2019). Federal law (the TCPA\u2019s cause of action) directs courts to look to \u2018the laws\u2019 and \u2018rules of court\u2019 of a state. Thus, when a state refuses to recognize a cause of action, there remains no cause of action to which any grant of federal court jurisdiction could attach.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Although <em>Shady Grove </em>may bear on the Second Circuit\u2019s <em>Erie </em>analysis,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> nothing in <em>Shady Grove </em>calls for a reading of \u00a7 227(b)(3) that fails fully to honor \u201cthe laws [and] rules of court of [New York] State.\u201d The Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA\u2019s private-right-of-action authorization stands on its own footing as an adequate and independent ground for dismissing Holster\u2019s suit. I would spare the Court of Appeals the necessity of revisiting\u2014and, presumably, reinstating\u2014 its TCPA-grounded ruling.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-19\"> Holster, however, arguably forfeited the argument, accepted in <em>Shady Grove, </em>that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 preempts \u00a7 901(b); the District Court concluded that Rule 23 and \u00a7 901(b) did not conflict and noted that Holster \u201cd[id] not dispute\u201d that point. 485 F. Supp. 2d 179, 185, n. 3 (EDNY 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
