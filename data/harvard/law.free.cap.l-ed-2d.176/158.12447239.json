The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require bankruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination in an adversary</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">[559 U.S. 264]</p>\n<p id=\"A6yD\">proceeding, see Rule 7001(6), which the party seeking the determination must initiate by serving a summons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003, 7004, 7008. The debtor in this case filed a plan with the Bankruptcy Court that proposed to discharge a portion of his student loan debt, but he failed to initiate the adversary proceeding as required for such discharge. The creditor received notice of, but did not object to, the plan, and failed to file an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>appeal after the Bankruptcy Court subsequently confirmed the plan. Years later, the creditor filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) asking the Bankruptcy Court to rule that its order confirming the plan was void because the order was issued in violation of the Code and Rules. We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to whether an order that confirms the discharge of a student loan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or an adversary proceeding, or both, is a void judgment for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Between 1988 and 1989, respondent Francisco Espinosa obtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a total principal amount of $13,250. In 1992, Espinosa filed a bankruptcy petition under  Chapter 13. That chapter permits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or a portion of their debts over a period of time specified in the plan. See <em>Nobelman </em>v. <em>American Savings Bank, </em>508 U.S. 324, 327, 113 S. Ct. 2106, 124 L. Ed. 2d 228 (1993); see also \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b). A proposed bankruptcy plan becomes effective upon confirmation, see \u00a7\u00a7 1324, 1325, and will result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if the debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see \u00a7 1328(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Espinosa\u2019s plan listed his student loan debt as his only specific indebtedness. App. 15-18. The plan proposed to repay only the princi-pal on that debt, stating that the remainder\u2014the accrued interest\u2014would be discharged once Espinosa repaid the principal. <em>Id., </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">[559 U.S. 265]</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">As the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require, the clerk of the Bankruptcy Court mailed notice and a copy of Espinosa\u2019s plan to petitioner United Student Aid Funds, Inc. (United), the creditor to whom Espi-nosa owed the student loan debt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 34; see Rules 2002(b), (g)(2), 3015(d). In boldface type immediately below the caption, the plan stated: \u201cWARNING IF YOU ARE A CREDITOR YOUR RIGHTS MAY BE IMPAIRED BY THIS PLAN.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 23. The plan also noted the deadlines for filing a proof of claim or an objection to the plan. <em>Id., </em>at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">United received this notice and, in response, filed a proof of claim for $17,832.15, an amount representing both the principal and the accrued interest on Espinosa\u2019s student loans. <em>Id., </em>at 35. United did not object to the plan\u2019s proposed discharge of Espino-sa\u2019s student loan interest without a determination of undue hardship, nor did it object to Espinosa\u2019s failure to initiate an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">In May 1993, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Espinosa\u2019s plan without holding an adversary proceeding or making a finding of undue hardship. One month later, the Chapter 13 trustee mailed United a form notice stating that \u201c[t]he amount of the claim filed differs from the amount listed for payment in the plan\u201d and that \u201c[y]our claim will be paid as listed in the plan.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 44. The form also apprised United that if United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201cwishe[d] to dispute the above stated treatment of the claim,\u201d it had the \u201cresponsibility\u201d to notify the trustee within 30 days. <em>Ibid. </em>United did not respond to that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In May 1997, Espinosa completed the payments on his student loan principal, as required by the plan. Shortly thereafter,</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">[559 U.S. 266]</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">the Bankruptcy Court discharged Espinosa\u2019s student loan interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In 2000, the United States Department of Education commenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on Espi-nosa\u2019s student loans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, Espinosa filed a motion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its 1997 discharge order by directing the Department and United to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on his student loan debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to set aside as void the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s 1993 order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan. United made two arguments in support of its motion. First, United claimed that the provision of Espinosa\u2019s plan authorizing the discharge of his student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code, which requires a court to find undue hardship before discharging a student loan debt, \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(8), 1328(a), and with the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to make the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6). Second, United argued that its due process rights had been violated because Es-pinosa failed to serve it with the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial proceeding. See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted Espinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part, denied United\u2019s cross-motion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their collection efforts. United sought review in the District Court, which reversed. That court held that United was denied</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">[559 U.S. 267]</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">due process because the confirmation order was issued without service of the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which issued an initial <em>per curiam </em>opinion remanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider correcting an apparent clerical error in its discharge order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 530 F.3d 895, 899 (2008). The Bankruptcy Court corrected the error, after which the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of Appeals resubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the District Court. The Court of Appeals concluded that by confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue hardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most committed a legal error that United might have successfully appealed, but that any such legal error was not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as void under Rule 60(b). 553 F.3d 1193, 1198-1202</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">[559 U.S. 268]</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">(2008).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the Court of Appeals held that although Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons and complaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan debt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void because United received actual notice of Espi-nosa\u2019s plan and failed to object. See <em>id., </em>at 1202-1205.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 903, 129 S. Ct. 2791, 174 L. Ed. 2d 289 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">A discharge under Chapter 13 \u201cis broader than the discharge received in any other chapter.\u201d 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1328.01, p. 1328-5 (rev. 15th ed. 2008). Chapter 13 nevertheless restricts or prohibits entirely the discharge of certain types of debts. As relevant here, \u00a7 1328(a) provides that when a debtor has completed the repayments required by a confirmed plan, a bankruptcy court \u201cshall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany debt ... of the kind specified in [\u00a7 523(a)(8)].\u201d \u00a7 1328(a)(2). Section 523(a)(8), in turn, specifies certain student loan debts \u201cunless excepting such debt from discharge . . . would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor\u2019s dependents.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted, the Bankruptcy Rules require</p>\n<p id=\"Agld\">[559 U.S. 269]</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">a party seeking to determine the discharge-ability of a student loan debt to commence an adversary proceeding by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>serving a summons and complaint on affected creditors. See <em>supra, </em>at 266, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 167. We must decide whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan is \u201cvoid\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) because the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the plan without complying with these requirements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s proposed plan was a final judgment, see <em>In re Optical Technologies, Inc., </em>425 F.3d 1294, 1300 (CA11 2005), from which United did not appeal.  Ordinarily, \u201cthe finality of [a] Bankruptcy Court\u2019s orders following the conclusion of direct review\u201d would \u201cstan[d] in the way of challenging [their] enforceability.\u201d <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>557 U.S. 137, 140, 129 S. Ct. 2195, 174 L. Ed. 2d 99 (2009). Rule 60(b), however, provides an \u201cexception to finality,\u201d <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 529, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2005), that \u201callows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">[559 U.S. 270]</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em>id., </em>at 528, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed. 2d 480. Specifically, Rule 60(b)(4)\u2014the provision under which United brought this motion\u2014authorizes the court to relieve a party from a final judgment if \u201cthe judgment is void.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">A void judgment is a legal nullity. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1822 (3d ed. 1933); see also <em>id., </em>at 1709 (9th ed. 2009). Although the term \u201cvoid\u201d describes a result, rather than the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable, it suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by a fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised even after the judgment becomes final. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments 22 (1980); see generally <em>id., </em>\u00a7 12. The list of such infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise, Rule 60(b)(4)\u2019s exception to finality would swallow the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\u201cA judgment is not void,\u201d for example, \u201csimply because it is or may have been erroneous.\u201d <em>Hoult </em>v. <em>Hoult, </em>57 F.3d 1, 6 (CA1 1995); 12 J. Moore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.44[1][a], pp. 60-150 to 60-151 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter Moore\u2019s). Similarly, a motion under Rule 60(b)(4) is not a substitute for a timely appeal. <em>Kocher </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co.,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">[559 U.S. 271]</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">132 F.3d 1225, 1229 (CA8 1997); see Moore\u2019s \u00a7 60.44[1][a], at 60-150. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>stead, Rule 60(b)(4) applies only in the rare instance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice or the opportunity to be heard. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boch Oldsmobile, Inc., </em>909 F.2d 657, 661 (CA1 1990); Moore\u2019s \u00a7 60.44[1] [a]; 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2862, p. 331 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2009); cf. <em>Chicot County Drainage Dist. </em>v. <em>Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 376, 60 S. Ct. 317, 84 L. Ed. 329 (1940); <em>Stoll </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>305 U.S. 165, 171-172, 59 S. Ct. 134, 83 L. Ed. 104 (1938). The error United alleges falls in neither category.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Federal courts considering Rule 60(b)(4) motions that assert a judgment is void because of a jurisdictional defect generally have reserved relief only for the exceptional case in which the court that rendered judgment lacked even an \u201carguable basis\u201d for jurisdiction. <em>Nemaizer </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>793 F.2d 58, 65 (CA2 1986); see, <em>e.g., Boch Oldsmobile, supra, </em>at 661-662 (\u201c[T]otal want of jurisdiction must be distinguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction, and . . . only rare instances of a clear usurpation of power will render a judgment void\u201d (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">This case presents no occasion to engage in such an \u201carguable basis\u201d inquiry or to define the precise circumstances in which a jurisdictional error will render a judgment void because United does not argue that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s error was jurisdictional. Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, 11. Such an argument would fail in any event. First,  \u00a7 523(a)(8)\u2019s statutory requirement that a bankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging a student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a discharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction. See, <em>e.g., Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 515-516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006). Second,</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">[559 U.S. 272]</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">the requirement that a bankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary proceeding derives from the Bankruptcy Rules, see Rule 7001(6), which are \u201cprocedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business\u201d that are \u201cnot jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Kontrick </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 454, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Although United concedes that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to enter the order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan, United contends that the court\u2019s judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) because United did not receive adequate notice of Espinosa\u2019s proposed discharge of his student loan interest. Specifically, United argues that the Bankruptcy Court violated United\u2019s due process rights by confirming Es-pinosa\u2019s plan despite Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require for the commencement of an adversary proceeding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons and complaint deprived United of a right granted by a procedural rule. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004(b)(3). United could have timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse ruling on its objection. But this deprivation did not amount to a violation of United\u2019s constitutional right to due process.  Due process requires notice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950); see also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>547 U.S. 220, 225, 126 S. Ct. 1708, 164 L. Ed. 2d 415 (2006) (\u201c[D]ue process does not require actual notice . . . \u201d). Here, United received <em>actual </em>notice of the filing and contents of Espinosa\u2019s plan. This more than satisfied United\u2019s due process rights. Accordingly, on these facts, Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve a summons and complaint does not entitle United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">[559 U.S. 273]</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Unable to demonstrate a jurisdictional error or a due process violation, United and the Government, as <em>am-icus, </em>urge us to expand the universe of judgment defects that support Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Specifically, they contend that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is void because the court lacked statutory authority to confirm Espinosa\u2019s plan absent a finding of undue hardship. In support of this contention, they cite the text of  \u00a7 523(a)(8), which provides that student loan debts guaranteed by governmental units are not discharge-able \u201cunless\u201d a court finds undue hardship. (Emphasis added.) They argue that this language imposes a \u201c \u2018self-executing\u2019 limitation on the effect of a discharge order\u201d that renders the order legally unenforceable, and thus void, if it is not satisfied. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>18 (quoting <em>Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>541 U.S. 440, 450, 124 S. Ct. 1905, 158 L. Ed. 2d 764 (2004)); Brief for Petitioner 23-24. In addition, United cites  \u00a7 1325(a)(1), which instructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans that comply with \u201cthe . . . applicable provisions\u201d of the Code. Reading these provisions in tandem, United argues that an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge a student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is \u201cdoubly beyond the court\u2019s authority and therefore void.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hardship in accordance with \u00a7 523(a)(8) is on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings that define void judgments that qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(4). As noted,  \u00a7 523(a)(8) does not limit the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over student loan debts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Supra, </em>at 272, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 170; see <em>Hood, </em>541 U.S., at 447, 124 S. Ct. 1905, 158 L. Ed. 2d 764 (noting</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">[559 U.S. 274]</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">that \u201c[b]ankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor\u2019s property\u201d). Nor does the provision impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a denial of due process. Instead, \u00a7 523(a)(8) requires a court to make a certain finding before confirming the discharge of a student loan debt. It is true, as we explained in <em>Hood, </em>that this requirement is \u201c \u2018self-executing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 450, 124 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Ct. 1905, 158 L.

See Part III, <em>infra. </em>But the order remains enforceable and binding on United because United had notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">United\u2019s response\u2014that it had no obligation to object to Espinosa\u2019s plan until Espinosa served it with the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require, Brief for Petitioner 33\u2014is unavailing.  Rule 60(b)(4) does not provide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights. United had actual notice of the filing of Espinosa\u2019s plan, its contents, and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s subsequent confirmation of the plan. In addition, United filed a proof of claim regarding Espi-nosa\u2019s student loan debt, thereby submitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to that claim. See <em>Langenkamp </em>v. <em>Culp, </em>498 U.S. 42, 44, 111 S. Ct. 330, 112 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1990) <em>(per curiam). </em>United therefore forfeited its arguments regarding the validity of ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>vice or the adequacy of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s procedures by failing to raise a timely objection in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">[559 U.S. 276]</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Rule 60(b)(4) strikes a balance between the need for finality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that litigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a dispute. Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan\u2019s contents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan before the time for appeal expires, that party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the party\u2019s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not justify Rule 60(b)(4) relief. We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In issuing its judgment, however, the Court of Appeals looked beyond the narrow question whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan was void under Rule 60(b)(4). It canvassed other bankruptcy court decisions within the Circuit that presented a different question\u2014whether a bankruptcy court presented with a debtor\u2019s plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt, in the absence of an adversary proceeding to determine undue hardship, should confirm the plan despite its failure to comply with the Code and Rules. The Court of Appeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined to confirm such plans \u201ceven when the creditor fail[ed] to object to the plan.\u201d 553 F.3d, at 1205. The court disapproved that practice and overruled those cases, stating that bankruptcy courts <em>must </em>confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without a determination of undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection. <em>Ibid. </em>This, we think, was a step too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">As Espinosa concedes, Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 36,  a Chapter 13 plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt without a determination of undue hardship violates \u00a7\u00a7 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this self-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of the plan even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in the proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"akuv-dedup-0\">[559 U.S. 277]</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">at all. See <em>Hood, </em>541 U.S., at 450, 41 S. Ct. 116, 65 L. Ed. 297.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That is because \u00a7 1325(a)(1) instructs a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan only if the court finds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plan complies with the \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the Code. \u00a7 1325(a) (providing that a bankruptcy court \u201cshall confirm a plan\u201d if the plan \u201ccomplies with the provisions of\u2019 Chapter 13 and with \u201cother applicable provisions of this title\u201d); see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Home State Bank, </em>501 U.S. 78, 87, 111 S. Ct. 2150, 115 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1991); see also \u00a7 105(a) (authorizing bankruptcy courts to issue \u201cany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>priate to carry out\u201d the Code\u2019s provisions).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeals\u2019 assertion, the Code makes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority\u2014indeed, the obligation\u2014to direct a debtor to conform his plan to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">[559 U.S. 278]</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We are mindful that conserving assets is an important concern in a bankruptcy proceeding. We thus assume that, in some cases, a debtor and creditor may agree that payment of a student loan debt will cause the debtor an undue hardship sufficient to justify discharge. In such a case, there is no reason that compliance with the undue hardship requirement should impose significant costs on the parties or materially delay confirmation of the plan.  Neither the Code nor the Rules prevent the parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship, and neither prevents the creditor from waiving service of a summons and complaint. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k). But, to comply with \u00a7 523(a)(8)\u2019s directive, the bankruptcy court must make an independent determination of undue hardship before a plan is confirmed, even if the creditor fails to object or appear in the adversary proceeding. See <em>supra, </em>at 275, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">United argues that our failure to declare the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order void will encourage unscrupulous debtors to abuse the Chapter 13 process by filing plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship requirement in the hopes the bankruptcy court will overlook the proposal and the creditor will not object. In the event the objectionable provision is discovered, United claims, the debtor can withdraw the plan and file another without penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">We acknowledge the potential for bad-faith litigation tactics. But expanding the availability of relief under Rule 60(b)(4) is not an appropriate prophylaxis. As we stated in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Freeland &amp; Kronz, </em>503 U.S. 638, 112 S. Ct. 1644, 118 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1992),  \u201c[d]ebtors and their attorneys face penalties under various provisions for engaging in improper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 644, 112 S. Ct. 1644, 118 L. Ed. 2d 280; see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011. The specter of such penalties should deter bad-faith attempts to discharge student loan debt without the undue hardship finding Congress required. And to the extent existing sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"ARHY\">[559 U.S. 279]</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">prove inadequate to this task, Congress may enact additional provisions to address the difficulties United predicts will follow our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"pA7z\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"48\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATAAAAAwAQAAAAC+9xvqAAAAlElEQVR4nO3UMQ7CMBBE0e9VapQDIcHN4DAcgoLLQJE6dEgghtKDtJZShAq7e5rxagsnRSw5sajVa732H7WvryZHAO+jJTnW3Q1J27vqyRGgm9/KEVDmuSYNBHCebEIDkh47WydHAMPeBuQIYPIkRwCnwZIGJG2utk6OAI1jvd+CpMvTBuRA0utgSY51X0jpP/xf1j7AfdZshf7EnQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"304\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">.

That provision appeared irreconcilable with the confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the interest on Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt. Suggesting that the Bankruptcy Court may have automatically generated the discharge order without tailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the discharge order to conform to the confirmation order. <em>Id., </em>at 899; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to \u201ccorrect a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission\u2019\u2019). On remand, the Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order excepting Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt from discharge \u201cwas inserted because of a clerical mistake\u2019\u2019 and struck that language from the order.

Section 1330(a) imposes a 180-day time limit for a party to seek revocation of a confirmation order \u201cprocured by fraud.\u201d Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Rule 60(b)(4) motion should be treated as a \u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d a plan subject to \u00a7 1330\u2019s time limit and substantive limitation to motions based on fraud.

We need not settle that question, however, because the parties did not raise it in the courts below. And even under a theory that would treat United\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion as a \u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d the plan, United\u2019s failure to file its motion within \u00a7 1330(a)\u2019s 180-day deadline and its failure to seek relief on the basis of fraud did not deprive those courts\u2014and does not deprive us\u2014of authority to consider the motion on the merits because those limitations are not jurisdictional.

Sections 1328(a) and 523(a)(8) provide that student loan debt <em>is </em>dischargeable in a Chapter 13 proceeding if a court makes a finding of undue hardship. In contrast, other provisions in Chapter 13 provide that certain other debts are <em>not </em>dischargeable under <em>any </em>circumstances. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(1)(B), (C) (specified tax debts); \u00a7 523(a)(5) (domestic support obligations); \u00a7 523(a)(9) (debts \u201ccaused by\u2019\u2019 the debtor\u2019s unlawful operation of a vehicle while intoxicated).

That is not what we concluded in <em>Hood </em>and, in this case, would be irrelevant in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">In <em>Hood, </em>we described as \u201c \u2018self-executing\u2019 \u201d paragraph (8)\u2019s instruction that student loan debt not be discharged \u201cunless\u201d an undue hardship determination is made. 541 U.S., at 450, 124 S.

The \u201cdoes not discharge\u201d language in \u00a7 523(a), which applies generally to every enumerated paragraph in that section\u2014and to which we never referred in Hood\u2014was not relevant to our analysis.
