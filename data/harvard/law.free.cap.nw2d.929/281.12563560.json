In addition to the brief, the appellant shall electronically file an appendix conforming to MCR 7.312(D)(2). In the brief, citations to the record must provide the appendix page numbers as required by MCR 7.312(B)(1).

A reply, if any, must be filed by the appellant within 14 days of being served with the appellees' brief.
