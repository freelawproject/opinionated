He argues the district court erred in determining he failed to establish (a) the failure to learn about the evidence at the time of trial was not the result of the defendant's lack of diligence and (b) the weight and quality of the newly discovered evidence would likely have resulted in an acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20ND%20145\">\n    2019 ND 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12563064\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/928/441/\">\n    928 N.W.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taylor argues that after his trial he discovered evidence that would have impeached the State's only witness on a collateral issue. Essentially, Taylor argues that if he had had this evidence to impeach the officer, the jury would have disbelieved other aspects of the officer's testimony and returned an acquittal. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for new trial. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b62] Gerald W.
