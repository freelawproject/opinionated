State Farm insured both parties. Immediately following the accident, State Farm paid a portion of James's medical expenses under the medical payment provisions of his policy. Acting on behalf of Rivers, State Farm then settled with James. Once James released Rivers from liability, State Farm demanded James use his settlement proceeds to reimburse it for paying his medical expenses under his policy. James sued for declaratory relief, arguing State Farm had no right to reimbursement or subrogation. The circuit court denied State Farm's motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment in favor of James. State Farm appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [\u00b62.] The automobile accident occurred on July 22, 2016, on Highway 16 near Rapid City. At the time, State Farm insured both Rivers and James under separate auto insurance policies. Rivers's policy provided $ 100,000 in liability coverage. James's policy contained a $ 5,000 benefit for medical payments coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   State Farm immediately paid $ 5,000 on James' behalf to medical services providers for treatment of James's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b63.] Ultimately, James settled his claim against Rivers. Rivers did not personally fund any of the settlement proceeds. Instead, State Farm paid James $ 43,000 on Rivers's behalf in exchange for a full and complete release from liability. After paying his attorney a one-third contingency fee plus costs and sales tax, James's net settlement was $ 19,927.54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b64.] James's policy contained both a reimbursement clause and a subrogation clause. Following the settlement, State Farm demanded reimbursement from James for the $ 5,000 payment it made on James's behalf to cover medical expenses under the reimbursement clause. State Farm did not reduce its request to account for the attorney fees and costs James incurred to obtain his recovery from Rivers. James refused to reimburse State Farm for any amount; instead, he sued State Farm, seeking a declaratory judgment to determine his contractual rights under the policy. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    James's medical payment coverage provision provides: \"The Medical Payment Coverage limit is shown on the Declarations Page under 'Medical Payments Cover - Limit - Each person.'

It further held that the reimbursement clause was ambiguous. As a consequence, the court construed the policy against State Farm, the drafter, granting summary judgment to James.

Here, there are no disputed facts, so our task is to determine whether the circuit court correctly applied the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    [\u00b67.] Each party filed briefs advising the circuit court of their interpretation of the policy. James alleged that the reimbursement provision was ambiguous and should therefore be construed against its drafter, State Farm. In response, State Farm argued the policy provided it with an unambiguous contractual right to reimbursement. In addition to the question of ambiguity, the parties also disputed whether the anti-subrogation rule applied to the reimbursement provision in the policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    [\u00b68.] A brief explanation of these concepts is helpful to understand the arguments advanced by the parties both before the circuit court and in this appeal. \"[S]ubrogation is a time-honored theory [in which] insurers who pay a loss [for insureds] are entitled, within the limits of [the] subrogation doctrine, to pursue the actual wrongdoer.\" 16 Steven Plitt et al.,\n    <em>\n     Couch on Insurance\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 222:4 (3d ed. Supp. 2018);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Auto-Owners Ins.

By subrogating a claim, the insurer is allowed to stand in the shoes of the insured to sue the tortfeasor to recover the payments it made. One limitation to the doctrine of subrogation, however, is the anti-subrogation rule, a defense that prohibits insurers from suing their own insureds to recover a loss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Plitt,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 224:3. Even though the anti-subrogation rule is widely recognized, courts take varying approaches when applying the rule.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    [\u00b69.] Reimbursement, on the other hand, often differs factually from subrogation because rather than seeking recovery from a third party, it allows \"the insurer to recover policy payments directly from its own insured or beneficiary upon that party's recovery of the same loss from a third party ....\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00a7 222:81. Therefore, although the mechanisms of recovery are different, \"the effect of subrogation and reimbursement are essentially the same.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    [\u00b610.] James relied upon subrogation principles to argue State Farm was not entitled to recovery under either the reimbursement or subrogation provisions based on the anti-subrogation rule. Even though the rule is generally applicable only to subrogation claims, James contended the\n    language and effect of the provisions were similar enough to apply the principal of anti-subrogation to the reimbursement clause. This is because permitting reimbursement, according to James, would allow State Farm to recover against James, its own insured.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    [\u00b611.] In response, State Farm argued that: (1) it was exercising an unambiguous contractual right of reimbursement completely distinct from instituting a subrogation action; (2) even if subrogation principles applied to its request for reimbursement, the anti-subrogation rule did not preclude State Farm's rights because the rule applied only to co-insureds under a single insurance policy; and (3) enforcing the reimbursement clause did not offend public policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    [\u00b612.] Because it is dispositive of the issues in this case, we address only the question of whether the language of the reimbursement clause was ambiguous. \"Insurance contract interpretation is a question of law reviewed de novo.\"\n    <em>\n     W.

In its view, this language unambiguously includes Rivers, who is \"another\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      person\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    \" from James, even if State Farm funded the settlement on Rivers's behalf. In response, James argues the policy is ambiguous because it could also be interpreted to require reimbursement only when the insured recovers from\n    <em>\n     another\n    </em>\n    person or organization, but not another insured by State Farm. He contends that, here, there is no other \"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      person\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    or organization\"-there is only State Farm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    [\u00b617.] From our review, there are two equally reasonable interpretations of the reimbursement provision when viewed objectively in the context of the entire agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alverson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10592538,103487\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sd/1997/9/\">\n     1997 S.D. 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 8,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10592538\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/559/234/#p235\">\n     559 N.W.2d at 235\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . James had a legal claim against Rivers, but his actual recovery came from settlement proceeds State Farm paid pursuant to its policy with Rivers. Therefore, the language could be interpreted to mean State Farm has a right to reimbursement because James recovered from Rivers, who is \"another\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      person\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\" But James recouped his financial loss following the accident from State Farm's pocket, not \"\n    <em>\n     another\n    </em>\n    person or organization.\" Therefore, the language could also be interpreted to mean James recovered from State Farm, the party who paid James.
