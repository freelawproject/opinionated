There is no dispute that the VPA constitutes a contract or that it contains a mathematical error. The MCAC concluded that the magistrate lacked the equitable\n   authority to reform the parties' contract. We hold that the MCAC's determination was correct, but we choose to exercise our own equitable authority to reform the VPA. We therefore affirm, but we order the parties' VPA reformed and the matter remanded to the MCAC for entry of the corrected VPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 4, 2007, plaintiff was injured in a work-related automobile accident. Plaintiff was then employed by defendant Charlevoix Abstract &amp; Engineering Company (Charlevoix). Defendant Accident Fund Insurance Company of America (Accident Fund) was Charlevoix's workers' compensation insurance carrier. Nonparty Harleysville Insurance Company (Harleysville) was Charlevoix's automobile insurance carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Initially, Accident Fund voluntarily paid benefits to plaintiff, but it eventually\n   ceased payments, whereupon plaintiff commenced a workers' disability compensation claim. Accident Fund promptly reinstated payment of plaintiff's weekly benefits. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff obtained a $450,000 judgment in a civil action against the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident. Plaintiff only received $100,000 from the other driver, reflecting the limits of the other driver's insurance policy. Consequently, plaintiff collected the remaining $350,000 from Harleysville. Eventually, Accident Fund again discontinued plaintiff's disability payments, and plaintiff sought to reinstate those benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties entered into negotiations, and they ultimately agreed that Accident Fund could set off $100,000 from plaintiff's future benefits pursuant to MCL 418.827. However, the parties were unable to agree whether Charlevoix or Accident Fund could set\n   off the $350,000 recovery. Plaintiff and Accident Fund entered into the VPA on April 3, 2012. Under the VPA, Accident Fund would pay plaintiff $494.50 a week, but that amount would be \"redeuced [sic] to $264.53 for 54.23 [weeks] beginning 3/29/12 based on Franges of $100,000.00 3rd party settlement.\" The parties also agreed to litigate the consequences of the $350,000 recovery. The word \"Franges\" in the VPA is a reference to\n   <em>\n    Franges v. Gen. Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1958921\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/404/590/\">\n    404 Mich. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20N.W.2d%20392\">\n    274 N.W.2d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).\n   <em>\n    Franges\n   </em>\n   set forth how to apportion credit to a workers' compensation insurer when an employee receiving benefits also receives a money judgment against a third-party tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, Accident Fund then discovered that the VPA contained a mathematical error. Stated briefly, Accident Fund argued that the VPA's \"\n   <em>\n    Franges\n   </em>\n   worksheet\" had made improper use of the benefits it had thus far paid to plaintiff. As a consequence, the remaining calculations derived from that amount were also wrong, culminating in an impossible result of\n   <em>\n    negative\n   </em>\n   54.2328 weeks before full resumption of weekly workers' compensation benefits. Accident Fund provided a corrected\n   <em>\n    Franges\n   </em>\n   worksheet, which showed that plaintiff's temporary reduction of benefits should have been for 131.7464 weeks, instead of 54.23 weeks. Defendants filed a motion to modify or correct the VPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The magistrate resolved the matter of the $350,000 recovery, which is not at issue in this appeal. The magistrate also determined that the VPA did in fact contain a mathematical error but that he lacked equitable jurisdiction and therefore could not modify the parties' agreement. However, the magistrate also stated that he would have modified the agreement if he had the power to do so and that \"the correct\n   <em>\n    Franges\n   </em>\n   numbers to be applied ... would be a future weekly\n   rate of $264.53 for 131.7464 weeks into the future before resumption of full weekly benefits.\" On appeal, the MCAC affirmed the magistrate's ruling that he lacked equitable power or authority to modify the VPA. The MCAC declined to address the magistrate's \"dicta\" detailing how he would have modified the VPA given the power to do so. Nevertheless, the MCAC did observe that the facts in the matter were essentially undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We likewise observe that nothing in plaintiff's brief submitted to this Court appears to challenge the magistrate's finding that the VPA contained a mathematical error and acceptance of Accident Fund's calculations as correct. To the contrary, in his brief submitted to the MCAC, plaintiff affirmatively conceded that \"if the MCAC reverses the magistrate's ruling on the jurisdictional issue,\" the correct calculation would be a reduction of weekly benefits to $264.53 for 131.7464 weeks. We therefore treat as an established and undisputed fact\n   that the VPA did contain a mathematical error, and Accident Fund's recomputation is objectively correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the context of an MCAC appeal, inquiries \"into the nature, scope, and elements of a remedy,\" including an equitable remedy, are questions of law reviewed de novo, as are questions regarding the proper construction of the Worker's Disability Compensation Act (WDCA), MCL 418.101 et seq.\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners Ins.

Because defendants specifically asked the MCAC to review the issues raised on appeal, those issues are properly preserved.

EQUITABLE POWERS OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION MAGISTRATES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The primary issue presented on appeal is whether the MCAC correctly determined that the magistrate lacked the equitable power necessary to modify the VPA. A contract is legally enforceable even if procured by fraud or mistake, and thus \"plenary relief traditionally rests exclusively in equity....\"\n   <em>\n    Solo v. Chrysler Corp. (On Rehearing)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1950982\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/408/345/#p352\">\n    408 Mich. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.2d%20438\">\n    292 N.W.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). We conclude that the MCAC correctly determined that the magistrate lacked equitable jurisdiction and therefore lacked the power to modify the VPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Long ago, we recognized that the right to have equity controversies dealt with by equitable methods is as sacred as the right of trial by jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Madugula v.

Consequently, it is well established that the relief sought in this matter, modification of a contract, is strictly equitable in nature, and the magistrate, as a member of an administrative tribunal, had no equitable jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nevertheless, some confusion may have resulted from this Court's observation that \"[w]hile the [MCAC] has no equitable\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   , it is well established that it may apply equitable\n   <em>\n    principles\n   </em>\n   in appropriate instances to further the purposes of the [WDCA].\"\n   <em>\n    Lulgjuraj v.

To the extent\n   <em>\n    Lulgjuraj\n   </em>\n   can be understood to suggest that the MCAC may exercise equitable powers, such as the power to reform a contract,\n   <em>\n    Lulgjuraj\n   </em>\n   unambiguously conflicts with well-established and thoroughly settled caselaw\n   from our Supreme Court to the contrary.

Because\n   <em>\n    Lulgjuraj\n   </em>\n   was decided before November 1, 1990, it is not strictly binding pursuant to MCR 7.215(J)(1), and even if it were, we would be required to ignore it in favor of any conflicting Supreme Court precedent.
