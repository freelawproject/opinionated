He further contends that expert testimony is not required to establish the requisite causation to maintain his private nuisance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 We conclude that the oral policy in question here does not rise to the level of a ministerial duty. The proffered \"rule of thumb\" is not \"absolute, certain and imperative, involving merely the performance of a specific task when the law imposes, prescribes and defines the time, mode, and occasion for its performance with such certainty that nothing remains for judgment or discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lister v.

Because such a task is discretionary, the Village is immune from suit for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Further, we conclude that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the Village on Pinter's private nuisance claim. Pursuant to the facts of this case, expert testimony was required to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 The Village of Stetsonville owns and operates a wastewater disposal system that serves approximately 500 people. The system is primarily gravity fed, but wastewater is pumped at two lift stations-the north lift station and the main lift station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 There is a separate storm sewer system in the Village for the collection of storm water. Although the wastewater system is designed to be closed and separate from the storm water system, Village employees testified that there may be storm water infiltration into the wastewater disposal system because of cracks in the pipes and because drain tile and sump pumps from older homes in the Village may improperly drain into the wastewater disposal system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The main wastewater lift station contains a concrete pit approximately 20 feet deep. On one side wall of the pit are 12 ladder-like rungs that extend down the length of the pit, which an employee can use to climb inside the lift station for cleaning and maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 When the wastewater reaches a certain level in the pit, a pump lifts the wastewater through a pipe up to a point where it can then flow downhill to the water treatment facility. If the wastewater reaches another higher level, an alarm is triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) generally prohibits pumping untreated wastewater into a public waterway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a municipality can legally justify bypassing the water treatment facility if it can demonstrate that: (1) the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; (2) there were no feasible alternatives\n   to the bypass; and (3) the bypass was reported to the DNR by the municipality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 Testimony in this case indicated that, in addition to allowing employees access to the bottom of the pit, the ladder-like rungs on the side of the pit\n   served an additional purpose, although there was some discrepancy regarding the specifics of that purpose. Namely, Village employees used the height of the rungs as a guide for determining when to bypass the wastewater disposal system and pump wastewater directly into a nearby ditch so as to avoid the backup of wastewater into the basements of nearby homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 There are some discrepancies in the record regarding how the rungs were used to determine the appropriateness of bypassing the water treatment facility. For example, according to the deposition testimony of David Duellman, the Director of Public Works for the Village, the \"rule of thumb\" was that when the wastewater reached the fourth rung from the top of the pit in the main lift station, the bypass pump would be set in place. If the water level continued to rise, or if it continued to rain, an employee would start the pump, bypassing the treatment facility and instead pumping the untreated wastewater directly into a ditch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 Another Village employee, Chad Smith, testified differently. Specifically, Smith testified in his deposition that \"at the sixth rung we should be setting in place the portable pump. If it gets to the fourth rung, we bypass.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 The \"rule of thumb\" focusing on the fourth rung was created by Mike Danen, a former director of public works for the Village. It was not written down,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor was it ever formally enacted by the Village Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, it was communicated orally among Village employees. Danen passed the \"rule of thumb\" on to Duellman, and Duellman passed it on to Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b616 Alan Pinter lives near the main lift station. During the past two decades, Pinter's home has experienced wastewater backups on multiple occasions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b617 On September 10, 2014, during a heavy rainstorm, Smith received a high level alarm for both lift stations. Because Smith received the alarm for the north lift station first, he called Black River Transport, a septic hauling company, to transport wastewater from the north lift station to the water treatment facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b618 Meanwhile, Pinter told Duellman, who was stationed at the main lift station, that the floor drain in his basement was \"gargling.\" Accordingly, he urged Duellman to use the portable bypass pump. However, Duellman told Pinter that he wanted to wait for Black River Transport to arrive at the main lift station so that he could avoid pumping the untreated wastewater directly into the ditch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pinter offered\n   to help set up the bypass pump, but when Duellman declined the offer, Pinter left for work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b619 Within minutes of arriving at work, Pinter's wife called and told him that wastewater was backing up into their basement. Pinter returned to the main lift station and told Duellman about the flooding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Duellman called Smith and asked him to have Black River Transport come to the main lift station and begin pumping. Duellman told Smith that the wastewater had reached the second rung from the top, the highest Duellman had ever seen it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b620 The truck from Black River Transport left the north lift station and went to the water treatment facility. After emptying its load there, the truck arrived at the main lift station and began pumping. Once the truck became full, it went to the water treatment facility to again empty its load. Before the truck made it to the treatment facility, however, the main lift station had taken on a significant amount of water. Pinter yelled from his house that wastewater was still overflowing into his basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b621 At this point, Smith decided to use the portable bypass pump, but wastewater continued to flow into Pinter's basement. The wastewater eventually receded, leaving a black and grey residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b622 Pinter brought suit against the Village, alleging causes of action for negligence and private nuisance. Moving for summary judgment, the Village asserted that it was entitled to governmental immunity pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20893.80\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further asserted that Pinter failed to demonstrate that any failure to repair the piping in the system was a legal\n   cause of the sewage backup, and that expert testimony would be necessary to establish causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b623 The circuit court granted summary judgment to the Village. It determined first that no exception to governmental immunity applied. Specifically, it stated that \"[t]here is no case law to support the plaintiff's assertion that the Village's 'rule of thumb' created a ministerial duty such that there was no room for exercise of discretion by the employees.\" As a result, the circuit court dismissed Pinter's negligence cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b624 Further, the circuit court determined that \"[t]he allegations that the Village failed to maintain the sewer system and thus caused the sewage back up into plaintiff's home are not supported by any evidence.\" The reason for this determination was that \"[t]he statements made by Village employees are their personal assumptions as to the cause or suspected cause of the problem, but this is not sufficient proof or explanation as to link the Village's alleged lack of maintenance to the back up of sewage in plaintiff's home.\" Accordingly, the circuit court also dismissed Pinter's cause of action for private nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b625 The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court, concluding that the Village was entitled to governmental immunity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20893.80\">\n    Wis.

Specifically, the Village employees did not have a ministerial duty to pump water directly into the ditch when the water reached the fourth rung.

As the Village's counsel highlighted at oral argument, the decision to bypass involves the consideration of a number of variables, including whether the water level is rising,\n   whether it is still raining, and the viability of using a pump truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b647 Further, our analysis is informed by DNR wastewater treatment regulations. Generally, the DNR prohibits any bypass, which is defined as \"the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a sewage treatment facility or a wastewater treatment facility.\" Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 NR 205.03(5), 205.07(1)(u).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b648 An unscheduled bypass is only permissible if three conditions are met. Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 NR 205.07(1)(u)3. First, the bypass must have been \"unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.\" \u00a7 NR 205.07(1)(u)3.a. Second, there must be \"no feasible alternatives to the bypass ....\" \u00a7 NR 205.07(1)(u)3.b. Finally, the bypass must be reported in accordance with DNR regulations. \u00a7 NR 205.07(1)(u)3.c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b649 The first two of these requirements emphasize the discretionary nature of the decision to bypass. Specifically, one must exercise discretion in determining if a bypass is \"unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 NR 205.07(1)(u)3.a. Second, one cannot determine if there are feasible alternatives without exercising discretion. Indeed, the use of the word \"feasible\" necessarily implies a certain amount of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b650 Before the court of appeals, Pinter also argued that the known and compelling danger exception to governmental immunity was applicable to allow his negligence cause of action to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heuser ex rel.

The factors that must be considered before bypass is accomplished, especially in light of the DNR regulations on the subject, offer a quintessential example of a discretionary task and the antithesis of a ministerial one. Accordingly, we determine that the Village is immune from suit for negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b653 Finally, we turn to address the necessity of expert testimony to establish that infiltration of water from outside sources caused the backup in Pinter's basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b654 Pinter brought two causes of action in his amended complaint: negligence and private nuisance. Pursuant to this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Milwaukee Metro. Sewerage Dist. v. City of Milwaukee\n   </em>\n   , \"a municipality may be immune from nuisance suits depending on the nature of the tortious acts giving rise to the nuisance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012520\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/635/\">\n    2005 WI 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012520\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/635/\">\n    277 Wis. 2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012520\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/635/\">\n    691 N.W.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is \"immune from suit for nuisance if the nuisance is predicated on negligent acts that are discretionary in nature. A municipality does not enjoy immunity from suit for nuisance when the underlying tortious conduct is negligence and the negligence is comprised of acts performed pursuant to a ministerial duty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012520\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/277/635/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, \"[w]hether immunity exists for nuisance founded on negligence depends upon the character of the negligent acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b655 Pinter's complaint alleges negligent acts of two distinct characters. First, he alleges that the Village was negligent in failing to pump wastewater directly to the ditch. As analyzed above, this is a discretionary decision for which the Village is immune. Accordingly, it is also immune from a private nuisance cause of action with the underlying negligent act being the failure to pump.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b656 Second, Pinter alleges that the Village negligently maintained its sewer system. Specifically, Pinter alleges that the Village negligently allowed storm water to infiltrate the wastewater disposal system, causing the backup in his basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b657 The Village conceded that it is not entitled to immunity from a claim that it negligently maintained its wastewater disposal system, causing a private nuisance. Because the issue was conceded, it was not briefed or argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b658 We observe some dissonance in this concession. As set forth above, Pinter has not contested the court of appeals' determination that the known and compelling danger exception does not allow his negligence claim to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b651. The character of the acts underlying Pinter's private nuisance cause of action is the same as that underlying the negligence cause of action. Indeed, the amended complaint bases the private nuisance cause of action on the allegations \"set forth above\" with regard to the negligence cause of action. There is thus some incongruity in concluding that the Village is immune from suit for negligence but not immune from suit for private nuisance based on negligence,\n   when the character of the acts on which the claims are premised is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b659 Nevertheless, we need not address this unbriefed issue because, assuming without deciding that the private nuisance action can be maintained, Pinter has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to causation. We reach this conclusion because he failed to present expert testimony on an issue that is beyond common knowledge and lay comprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b660 The Village contends that Pinter has not raised a genuine issue of material fact because he did not present expert testimony on the issue of whether the infiltration of storm water was a legal cause of the backup in Pinter's basement. In response, Pinter contends that no such expert testimony is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b661 A plaintiff claiming private nuisance must demonstrate that the \"actor's conduct is [a] legal cause of the invasion.\"\n   <em>\n    Wis.

Stat. \u00a7 893.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). Moreover, they were not making balanced policy decisions for wastewater management on behalf of the Village for which the protection of immunity was intended. They therefore cannot be said to have acted in a quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial manner. Treating the Village employees' actions in response to an emergency as legislative, quasi-legislative, judicial, or quasi-judicial functions protected by immunity is a distortion of the clear\n   statutory language of \u00a7 893.80(4) and the purpose of governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b679 On the other hand, formal action by the Village Board to memorialize or adopt the protocol regarding the proper response to high wastewater levels could qualify as a quasi-legislative function of the Village. Had the Village's protocol been memorialized or adopted by the Village Board, followed by the Village employees on September 10, 2014, yet the backup still occurred, the Village would arguably have immunity against a claim for negligence because their employees acted in accordance with a policy adopted pursuant to a legislative or quasi-legislative function. However, in this case it is undisputed that the protocol was never mandated by the Village and, in any event, was not followed. The circuit court improperly granted summary judgment to the Village on the grounds that the Village\n   was immune from suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20893.80\">\n    Wis.

Majority op., \u00b659. To the contrary, I conclude that the evidence in the record and inferences from that evidence were sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that the Village negligently maintained the wastewater disposal system causing a private nuisance, and that expert testimony was not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b681 Whether the Village may be held liable for maintaining a nuisance in its operation of the wastewater disposal system depends upon whether there was underlying negligent conduct on the part of the Village \"otherwise actionable under the rules governing liability for negligent ... conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Power &amp; Light Co. v.

To prove liability for negligent conduct, Pinter must therefore prove four elements: (1) the existence of a duty of care on the part of the Village; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the breach of the duty of care and Pinter's injury; and (4) actual damages resulting from the breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b682 The disputed issues in this case are whether the Village negligently maintained the wastewater disposal system and whether that negligence caused the wastewater to back up into Pinter's basement. The Village argues, and the majority opinion agrees, that Pinter did not present the requisite expert testimony to prove it was negligent in maintaining the wastewater disposal system. However, the majority fails to recognize that \"[t]he requirement of expert testimony is an extraordinary one.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

Unlike in this case, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Menick\n   </em>\n   proceeded only on a theory of strict liability and there was another potential cause of the sewage backup unrelated to the actions of the City, unprecedented rainfall. Rather than create a bright line rule,\n   <em>\n    Menick\n   </em>\n   supports the conclusion that whether an expert is required to prove causation in a private nuisance claim arising out of negligent maintenance of a wastewater disposal system is fact-specific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b684 The majority opinion gives short shrift to the evidence that Pinter presents. Pinter identifies three ways in which the storm water allegedly infiltrated the closed wastewater disposal system: (1) leaky pipes; (2) sump pumps directly pumping into\n   the wastewater disposal system; and (3) drain tiles improperly connected to the wastewater disposal system. Pinter relies upon the testimony of David Duellman, the Director of Public Works for the Village, who testified that the wastewater disposal system is supposed to be a closed system from storm water but that water still infiltrates the system. Duellman testified that there is an eight-inch wastewater treatment line that goes up to the hill north of town and that \"we believe that's where a lot of the infiltration is coming from.\" He further testified that sump pumps are draining into the wastewater disposal system and that some of the older homes have drain tiles that might accumulate into the wastewater disposal system. Duellman admitted that they watched the rains carefully. Moreover, Pinter testified that on October 1, 2014, when he asked why the water comes into his basement, Duellman told him that \"they have some broken pipes on the north end that the water filters in from the ditch line\" and that the Village did not have the over one hundred thousand dollars needed to fix them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b685 Pinter also presented the testimony of the Village President, Gregory Brunner, who testified that the wastewater disposal system had a problem with storm water infiltration if there was \"heavy rain.\" Pinter also points to concessions by Brunner that: (1) the Village had not enforced its own ordinance that made it illegal to connect a sump pump into the wastewater disposal system; (2) sometime after September 10, 2014, the Village created an inspection schedule to address this issue; and (3) in October 2014, the Village Board of Trustees created a formal policy which called for pumping when the wastewater reached the fourth rung, no questions asked, and that no backups have occurred in Pinter's basement since\n   then. Pinter asserts that the testimony and common sense prove that causation in this case was uncontroverted as a matter of law or, at a minimum, raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b686 I agree with Pinter that the inferences drawn from the testimony of the Village employees taken in the light most favorable to Pinter, the standard the majority opinion fails to acknowledge, provides a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Village negligently maintained its wastewater disposal system and whether this negligence was a substantial factor in the wastewater backup into Pinter's basement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This issue is not nuanced and complex, as the majority opinion asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Instead, water infiltration, wastewater disposal system overflows, seepage of wastewater into homes, and related issues are all within the capability of jurors to understand and do not require any specialized knowledge or experience. Pinter's witnesses described personal experiences with and observations of the infiltration of storm water into the closed wastewater disposal system through leaky pipes and improperly connected sump pumps and drain tiles. In addition, these witnesses reported a connection between storm water infiltration and the rising wastewater levels. This testimony, along with the application of common sense, allows the trier of fact to draw its own conclusions without the need for expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tews v.
