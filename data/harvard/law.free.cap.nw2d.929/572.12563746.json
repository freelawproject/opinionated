Dane County issued to Enbridge a conditional use permit (\"CUP\") including two conditions requiring Enbridge\n   to procure additional insurance prior to expanding its pipeline pump station. After Dane County initially approved the CUP with\n   these insurance conditions, but pending Enbridge's appeal to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, the Wisconsin Legislature passed 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, which prohibits counties from requiring an interstate pipeline operator to obtain additional insurance when the pipeline operating company carries comprehensive general liability insurance with coverage for \"sudden and accidental\" pollution liability. Although Dane County recognized the impact of Act 55 on the enforceability of the insurance conditions, it nevertheless issued the CUP with the invalid conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 In response, Enbridge filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which the Dane County Circuit Court granted. The circuit court struck the two insurance conditions from the CUP as unenforceable under Act 55. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that Enbridge failed to show it carried the requisite coverage triggering the statutory prohibition barring Dane County from imposing additional insurance procurement requirements. Enbridge maintains that because it carries the requisite insurance, Act 55 rendered Dane County's extra insurance conditions unenforceable, and the proper remedy is to strike the illegal conditions, leaving the remainder of the permit in place. We agree with Enbridge, reverse the court of appeals decision, and reinstate the circuit court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 In 2014, Enbridge applied for a zoning permit to expand the pumping capacity at its Waterloo Pump Station (\"Pump Station\") in the Town of Medina. The Pump Station is part of a pipeline that runs from Douglas County in northern Wisconsin, through Dane County, and into Illinois. The Dane County Zoning\n   Administrator issued the permit on April 29, 2014, and Enbridge agreed to comply with all Dane County Ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 On June 12, 2014, however, the Zoning Administrator revoked the zoning permit because the expansion and other improvements required a CUP. Enbridge applied for a CUP on August 19, 2014, which the Town Board of Medina approved on October 1, 2014. The Town Board attached two conditions requiring Enbridge to sign an agreement for the use of the Town's roads and to construct a spill basin, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 On November 11, 2014, the CUP application came before the Dane County Zoning and Land Regulation Committee (\"Zoning Committee\"), which directed its staff to \"pursue a condition requiring a surety bond for assurances of spill clean up due to the increase[d] pressure that the pumping station will create on the existing line,\" and requested that Enbridge produce documentation of its insurance for catastrophic events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Zoning Committee considered the CUP again on January 27, 2015, and voted to retain an insurance expert \"for the purposes of determining the insurance needs of the proposal.\" The insurance expert, David Dybdahl, prepared an insurance and risk management report for the Zoning Committee. He recommended:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 That Enbridge agree to indemnify and hold harmless Dane County for pollution losses Per the terms as outlined in Enbridge's proposal titled \"CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT (\"CUP\") CONDITIONS\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 That Enbridge procures and maintains liability insurance, including Environmental Impairment Liability Insurance, making Dane County an Additional Insured to a level equal to 10% of the Line 6 B loss costs, $ 125,000,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 As part of this overall liability insurance requirement, Enbridge should purchase $ 25,000,000 of EIL [Environmental Impairment Liability] Insurance on the proposed pumping station in Dane County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 Dybdahl noted that in preparing his report, \"Enbridge declined to provide the actual insurance policies (42 of them in total) to [him] for review, claiming that the documents contain trade secrets.\" Instead, Enbridge gave him summaries of the policies. Although he did not review the actual policies, Dybdahl \"found [Enbridge's] summary of their insurance program to be credible,\" and he additionally observed that reading the policies \"was not necessary to evaluate the insurance coverage parameters of concern.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 Dybdahl determined that Enbridge had $ 700,000,000 of general liability insurance coverage for bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, and defense costs. His report noted that this coverage was \"confirmed by a certificate of insurance prepared by [Enbridge's] insurance broker.\" The policy period ran through May 1, 2015. Dybdahl also wrote that Enbridge's general liability policy had an exception to the standard pollution exclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Sudden and accidental pollution liability\" is what Enbridge shows for insurance coverage in their financial statements today. However,\n   <em>\n    the pollution exclusion exemption in the Enbridge policy is not limited to sudden or quick events\n   </em>\n   . A Property Damage or Bodily Injury claim arising from a pollution event that begins\n   and is discovered within 30 days and is reported to the insurance company within 90 days is not excluded by the Pollution Exclusion in the primary Enbridge General Liability insurance policy. Hence the words \"sudden and accidental\" carry no weight in the current pollution exclusion. A more accurate term to describe the limited coverage for pollution events within the current General Liability Insurance policy is \"Time Element Pollution\" coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Enbridge did not have separate environmental impairment liability insurance, also known as pollution insurance. Dybdahl acknowledged that \"it is very possible that Enbridge is already purchasing all of the General Liability insurance capacity available in the world for their operations. Therefore, I do not recommend the purchase of higher G[eneral] L[iability] limits for the operation of the ... Pumping Station.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b68 Dybdahl appeared before the Zoning Committee on April 14, 2015. When asked by a Zoning Committee member to describe a \"time element\" exception, he explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   So the total pollution release from the time it begins to the time it is discovered, in the Enbridge policy must transpire in 30 days. That's the time element, and then there's 90 days to report it to the insurance company. It used to be referred to as sudden and accidental pollution insurance, but the words sudden and accidental were removed from the insurance coverage in 1986. So it doesn't-\n   <em>\n    no one really could define what sudden meant\n   </em>\n   , so they went to we're not going to argue whether it's sudden,\n   <em>\n    because nobody can figure out how darn quick that needs to be, so we'll just say [it] has to happen within 30 days start-start\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to the time it's discovered. That's the time element\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b69 After reviewing the report and hearing Dybdahl's testimony, the Zoning Committee considered the CUP with twelve conditions. Two of those conditions imposed insurance coverage requirements and are the subject of this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   7. Enbridge shall procure and maintain liability insurance as follows: $ 100,000,000 limits in General Liability Insurance with a time element exception to the pollution exclusion\n   <em>\n    (currently in place)\n   </em>\n   , and $ 25,000,000 of Environmental Impairment Liability insurance. Enbridge shall list Dane County as an Additional Insured on the total of $ 125,000,000 of combined liability insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   8. The required General Liability Insurance and Environmental Impairment Liability insurances shall meet the technical insurance specifications listed in Appendix A of the insurance consultant's report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The Zoning Committee unanimously approved the CUP with the twelve conditions. The Town of Medina then re-approved the CUP with the additional requirements on April 20, 2015. On May 4, 2015 Enbridge appealed to the Dane County Board of Supervisors (\"County Board\"), challenging the two insurance requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b610 Before the appeal was heard, however, the Legislature passed Act 55. Two sections of the Act addressed CUPs and insurance, respectively. First, \u00a7 1922am created\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.69\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(bs) (2017-18),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   As part of its approval process for granting a conditional use permit under this section, a county\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    impose on a permit applicant a requirement that is expressly preempted by federal or state law\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Second, \u00a7 1923e created\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (25), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A county may not require an operator of an interstate hazardous liquid pipeline to obtain insurance if the pipeline operating company carries comprehensive general liability insurance coverage that includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b611 Because \"the county cannot enforce the insurance requirements of [the] CUP ... that were the subject of the Enbridge appeal,\" the County Board removed the CUP appeal from its July agenda. A few days later, the Dane County Assistant Corporation Counsel wrote to the Zoning Administrator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A recent enactment of the legislature that was included in the Budget Bill prohibits counties from requiring an operator of an interstate hazardous liquid pipeline to obtain insurance if the company carries comprehensive general liability coverage that includes sudden and accidental pollution liability. Since Enbridge has the required general liability coverage, the CUP condition requiring additional insurance is unenforceable by the county.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [ Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7] 59.70(25) expressly prohibits a county from requiring a pipeline operator to obtain insurance if they have the required coverage. Therefore, Dane County has no authority to require Enbridge to obtain additional\n   insurance coverage. There is no issue of retroactive application of the statute. By the express language of the statute, effective July 14, 2015 the county is prohibited from requiring the\n   insurance coverage. When the CUP was approved is irrelevant. The insurance conditions are rendered unenforceable prospectively by the language of \u00a7 59.70(25).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b612 The Zoning Administrator then notified Enbridge by letter that the CUP \"has been revised to reflect\" new legislation prohibiting counties from \"requiring additional insurance of an operator of an interstate hazardous liquid pipeline beyond\" its CGL insurance. On that basis, the Zoning Administrator removed conditions 7 and 8 from Enbridge's CUP. The Zoning Committee, however, concluded that the \"Zoning Administrator did not have the authority to revise the conditions of approval.\" On September 29, 2015, the Zoning Committee directed the Zoning Administrator to restore the insurance requirements in the CUP as originally approved by the Zoning Committee on April 14, 2015. Instead of removing the requirements, the Zoning Committee commanded that \"[a] note shall be added to the conditional use permit which identifies that [Dane] County's ability to enforce conditions 7 &amp; 8 [is] affected by the State Budget Bill, 2015 Wisconsin Act 55.\" On October 9, 2015, the Zoning Administrator sent a letter informing Enbridge that the Zoning Committee had instructed him to include the insurance conditions in the CUP exactly as initially approved. The letter also notified Enbridge that \"[a]s part of the Committee's direction, a note has been added to the conditional use permit which identifies that conditions 7 &amp; 8 are unenforceable by [Dane] County due to the State Budget Bill[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b613 Enbridge appealed the Zoning Committee's decision to reinsert the insurance conditions with the added note to the County Board, which held a hearing\n   on December 3, 2015. After a summary of the CUP by the Zoning Administrator, Enbridge's counsel affirmed that at the time Dane County issued the CUP, \"Enbridge had $ 700 million worth of general liability insurance which included sudden and accidental pollution coverage\" that \"has since been raised to $ 860 million.\" Following questions from several supervisors, and numerous comments from the public, the County Board voted 27-2 to deny the appeal and keep the CUP with conditions 7 and 8 intact along with the note regarding their unenforceability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b614 In January 2016, Enbridge filed a petition for a writ of certiorari under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.694\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10) in Dane County Circuit Court. Enbridge argued that the County Board's decision affirming the Zoning Committee should be reversed because the insurance conditions were unenforceable under Act 55. In February 2016, Robert and Heidi Campbell, Keith and Trisha Reopelle, James and Jan Holmes, and Tim Jensen-all of whom owned property near the Pump Station (collectively, \"Landowners\")-filed a complaint for injunctive relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.69\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11), which allows an \"owner of real estate within the district affected by the [zoning] regulation\" to enforce a zoning\n   <em>\n    ordinance\n   </em>\n   . The Landowners asked \"the Court to exercise its injunctive powers to enforce and compel compliance with Condition 7 of the Conditional Use Permit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b615 The circuit court consolidated the Landowners' case and Enbridge's certiorari action, and issued an oral ruling on July 11, 2016. The circuit court concluded that Act 55 rendered the insurance conditions void and unenforceable and adjourned the matter for a later hearing on the appropriate remedy. After the parties briefed the issue, the circuit court determined\n   the appropriate\n   remedy was to strike the two unenforceable conditions from the CUP:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I don't think you can put conditional uses that will come into effect upon some contingency years in the future that we don't know whether or not it will occur. We can't create contingent future conditions is my understanding of conditional use permits. You can't just do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   But in my view, those circumstances really, really counsel against authorizing the [Zoning Committee] or the county board to start again on the conditional use permit even independent of the vested rights issue, but the vested rights issue is not insubstantial. Like I said, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge or tar sands through the pipeline since the legislation a year ago, and\n   <em>\n    the time for the county to have acted was last fall, and rather than take the action\n   </em>\n   that they now want me to authorize them to do,\n   <em>\n    they instead affirm the issuance of the conditional use permit as is with unenforceable provisions\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The circuit court also dismissed the Landowners' injunction action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.69\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11) because the conditions the Landowners sought to enforce were unenforceable, and they \"wouldn't be enforcing anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b616 Dane County and the Landowners appealed the circuit court's decision, and the court of appeals consolidated the appeals and reversed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enbridge Energy Co. v. Dane Cty.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 2016AP2503 &amp; 2017AP13, unpublished slip op.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202347124\">\n    2018 WL 2347124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wis. Ct. App. May 24, 2018). In part, the court of appeals held that \"Enbridge failed to show to the zoning committee that, as required to trigger the Act 55 insurance limitation, it 'carries' insurance that 'includes' any particular coverage,\n   and also failed to show that it carries coverage 'for sudden and accidental pollution liability.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b641.

Therefore, if Enbridge carries CGL insurance for \"sudden and accidental pollution liability,\" conditions 7 and 8 requiring Enbridge to obtain additional insurance are unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b621 Dane County concedes that conditions 7 and 8 are unenforceable under Act 55.

We reject both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b622 The certiorari record contained ample and uncontroverted evidence that Enbridge carried the\n   requisite insurance. Dybdahl's report and testimony establish that Enbridge carried CGL insurance covering pollution events provided they are discovered within 30 days and reported to the insurance company within 90 days. During the December 2015 hearing when the County Board issued its final decision on the CUP, Enbridge reaffirmed that it continued to carry insurance, with increased policy limits. Nothing in the certiorari record contradicts Enbridge's summary of insurance coverage presented to Dybdahl, who found Enbridge's representations satisfactory and confirmed by the certificate of insurance furnished by Enbridge's insurance broker. Nor did the Landowners introduce any contrary evidence as part of their injunction action. Therefore, we reject the Landowners' argument that Enbridge failed to show it carried insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b623 The Landowners assert that Enbridge must not only\n   <em>\n    carry\n   </em>\n   insurance but also must\n   <em>\n    maintain\n   </em>\n   it in perpetuity in order to be exempt from Dane County's imposition of additional insurance requirements. Setting aside the unlikelihood that a hazardous liquid pipeline operator would go uninsured and expose itself to catastrophic liability, the statutory text does not require an operator to \"maintain\" the specified insurance coverage. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 59.70(25) precludes a county from requiring additional insurance provided the operator \"carries\" CGL coverage for sudden and accidental pollution. Nothing more is required of the operator in order to avail itself of the statutory exemption from additional, county-imposed\n   insurance requirements. We decline to add words to the statute, as the Landowner's argument would necessitate. \"Under the omitted-case canon of statutory interpretation, '[n]othing is to be added to what the text states or reasonably implies (\n   <em>\n    casus omissus pro omisso habendus est\n   </em>\n   ).

Contrary to the Landowners' construction of the statute, it does not require coverage for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   unexpected and unintended pollution regardless of when the pollution event is discovered or reported to the insurer. The text of \u00a7 59.70(25) requires only that the pipeline operator carry CGL insurance with coverage for \"sudden and accidental\" pollution liability. As Dybdahl confirmed, the term \"sudden and accidental\" is \"commonly used\" in reference to CGL policies covering pollution events that \"happen in certain timeframes.\" Indeed, Dybdahl explained \"because nobody can figure out how darn quick [\"sudden\"] needs to be ... we'll just say [it] has\n   to happen within 30 days start ... to the time it is discovered. That's the time element.\" The statute contains no language requiring the pollution coverage to apply regardless of when the pollution is discovered or when it is reported to the insurer in order for a county to be precluded from imposing additional insurance requirements on the pipeline operator. According to Dybdahl, the meaning of \"sudden\" within this insurance context has morphed into a pollution event that is discovered within 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b625 The statute does not define \"sudden\" or \"accidental.\" According to Dybdahl, the insurance industry abandoned these terms nearly 30 years before the Legislature enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n    Wis.

The Remedy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b634 We next consider whether the circuit court properly struck conditions 7\n   and 8 from the CUP as the appropriate remedy, as Enbridge maintains, or whether the CUP should be remanded to the Zoning Committee, as the Landowners and Dane County propose. Dane County argues that the Zoning Committee \"is the agency charged with making findings as to whether issuance of a CUP is in the public interest,\" and it \"never considered issuing the [CUP] without the insurance conditions.\" Dane County maintains that striking the conditions usurps the Zoning Committee's authority to determine whether issuing a CUP is appropriate under Dane County's ordinances. Dane County contends that \"the function of the reviewing court ends when an error of law is laid bare.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Federal Power Comm'n v.

Conditions No 7 and 8.\" Like Dane County, the Landowners insist the insurance conditions were integral to the CUP, and \"[t]he Act 55 Insurance Limitations were clearly not anticipated\" by the Zoning Committee. In the Landowners' view, the Zoning Committee must be allowed to reconsider the CUP in order to confirm that Enbridge will maintain insurance coverage sufficient to protect the residents of Dane County or \"craft additional conditions\" to do so. The Landowners are incorrect. We reject remand as the remedy and conclude the circuit court properly struck the unlawful CUP conditions because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.694\">\n    Wis.

These distinctions are irrelevant. Under\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , striking CUP conditions-a statutorily-authorized remedy-does not encroach upon the authority of a municipality\n   that chose to impose unlawful conditions. In this case, a court's authority to strike unlawful conditions on certiorari review is even clearer than in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ; the circuit court here had explicit authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.694\">\n    Wis.

The circuit court exercised that authority by striking conditions 7 and 8 from the CUP in order to conform it to the law. Contrary to the court of appeals' characterization of the circuit court's action, by striking conditions 7 and 8, the circuit court did not \"usurp[ ] the authority of the zoning committee.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enbridge Energy Co.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 2016AP2503 &amp; 2017AP13, unpublished slip op., \u00b6104.

In this case, Dane County knew that Act 55 rendered the conditions unenforceable but it issued the CUP with those conditions anyway. At oral argument, Dane County conceded the County Board could have sent the CUP back to the Zoning Committee to conduct \"meaningful review\" of the CUP without the invalid insurance conditions and to consider whether the CUP should be issued without them. The County Board, however, decided not to send the CUP back to the Zoning Committee to reconsider the standards in Dane\n   County Ordinance \u00a7 10.255(2)(h) in light of Act 55. Instead, the County Board affirmed the issuance of the CUP knowing that two of its conditions were unlawful and therefore unenforceable. It would be senseless to give the Zoning Committee the opportunity to reevaluate its decision under these circumstances. As the circuit court recognized, \"the time for the County to have acted was last fall [2015], and ... they instead affirm[ed] the issuance of the conditional use permit as is with unenforceable provisions.\" In\n   <em>\n    Lamar Central Outdoor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , remand was the only available remedy because the zoning board denied the variance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b612.

As Dane County conceded at oral argument, the County Board effectively issued the CUP without conditions 7 and 8 by deciding to issue the permit after Act 55 invalidated them. In\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , we determined it would be absurd to\n   force the permit applicant to repeat the permitting process due to the Town's\n   <em>\n    mistake\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027391\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/342/444/\">\n    342 Wis. 2d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b665,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027391\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/342/444/\">\n    820 N.W.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, it would be even more absurd to force Enbridge to repeat the permitting process when the County Board\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   issued a CUP with unlawful conditions.

(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b644\n   In 2010 an Enbridge oil spill in Michigan cost $ 1.2 billion and has resulted in \"ongoing insurance coverage litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b645 The Dane County Board of Supervisors was mindful that running an oil pipeline is a dangerous business and sought to avoid such a result. Accordingly, to ensure that Enbridge provides adequate coverage in the event of a catastrophe, it included certain insurance conditions in Enbridge's conditional use permit for expansion of a pipeline through the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b646 However, the legislature stepped in and passed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.69\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 59.69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(bs) and 59.70(25). These new provisions have preemptive effect on county action. They prohibit a county from requiring that an oil pipeline operator obtain additional insurance if the operator \"carries comprehensive general liability insurance coverage that includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability.\" \u00a7 59.70(25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b647 The majority determines that Enbridge maintains the requisite insurance, and that therefore Dane County can require of it no more. Majority op., \u00b62. In doing so, the majority endorses an unreasonable result through its interpretation of the word \"carries\" and departs from this court's precedent that defined \"sudden and accidental.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b648 I agree with the unanimous court of appeals that \"Enbridge failed to demonstrate at any time that it carried sudden and accidental pollution liability insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Enbridge Energy Co., Inc. v.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b649 The majority errs in its interpretation of two key statutory terms-\"carries\" and \"sudden and accidental.\" Accordingly, its determination that Enbridge \"carries\" the requisite insurance to trigger Act 55's preemption provisions is in error. As the court of appeals unanimously determined, Enbridge made no such showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b650 Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n    Wis.

To answer this question, we must look to the words of the statute.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Kalal v.

If the meaning is plain, we need not inquire further.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b652 Two statutory terms are of particular note: \"carries\" and \"sudden and accidental.\" With regard to the term \"carries,\" the majority draws a distinction between \"carrying\" and \"maintaining\" insurance. Majority op., \u00b623. In the majority's view, \"the statutory text does not require an operator to\n   'maintain' the specified insurance coverage[,]\" and thus Enbridge need not demonstrate that it \"carries\" the requisite insurance at any time other than the discrete point in time at which the conditional use permit was issued.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188131\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/271/633/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b653 Such an interpretation leads to an absurd result. Interpreting \"carries\" to indicate a discrete moment in time appears to allow Enbridge to have no insurance at all provided that it previously carried insurance at the moment the conditional use permit was granted. Unlike the majority, I agree with the court of appeals that \"when as here a county issues a conditional use permit that includes a produce-proof-on-demand requirement, then the operator must produce, on demand, proof of the insurance that triggers the insurance limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Enbridge Energy Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , unpublished slip op., \u00b673.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b654 Here, Enbridge has made no showing that it \"carries\" the requisite insurance. As the court of appeals wrote, Enbridge \"pointed only to coverage that was, at best, lapsing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b675.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b655 Turning to the phrase \"sudden and accidental,\" the majority determines that \" 'sudden' in the context of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (25) applies a temporal meaning, such as something happening quickly, abruptly, or immediately.\" Majority op., \u00b628. Applying this definition, it concludes that Enbridge's \"time element\" policy fulfills this requirement because its policy \"provides coverage for claims 'arising from a pollution event that begins and is discovered within 30 days' after its occurrence 'and is reported to the insurance company within 90 days.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n    , \u00b631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the majority's view, such coverage \"is not limited to sudden or quick events\" and is therefore \"broader than the statutorily-described insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059.70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b656 This case, however, is not the court's first go-round with the term \"sudden and accidental.\" In\n   <em>\n    Just v.
