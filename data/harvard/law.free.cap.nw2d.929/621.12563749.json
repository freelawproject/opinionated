Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   This is the third case we decide today concerning a defendant's right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. An African-American defendant was charged with first-degree murder in Floyd County, a county that is approximately 2.3% African-American in population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20707.1\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 707.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , .2(1)(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (2017). The decedent was also African-American. The jury pool of unexcused jurors, however, contained only one African-American. The district court overruled the defendant's motion to strike the jury panel. Later, the court declined to permit defense counsel to individually voir dire the prospective jurors on a sequestered basis concerning their racial attitudes. During trial, the court also refused to admit into evidence the decedent's prior criminal record or other bad acts unless the defendant knew about them. Further, the court declined to give the defendant's proposed implicit-bias instruction, noting that it had not been previously reviewed by an Iowa court and that its subject matter was essentially covered by the latest version of an instruction promulgated by the Iowa State Bar Association. Lastly, the court did not allow the defendant to assert a \"stand your ground\" defense because it had not become effective until after the alleged murder had been committed. The jury found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20707.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 707.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On appeal, we find that the district court's voir dire ruling and its decision not to give the implicit-bias instruction were within the court's discretion. We also agree with the district court that when asserting self-defense, the defendant generally may not offer proof of prior bad acts not known to the defendant as a way of proving the allegedly aggressive character of the other party. And we agree that the stand your ground defense does not apply to crimes committed before that law took effect. However, we believe further consideration of the defendant's fair-cross-section claim is warranted in light of the decisions we are filing today in\n   <em>\n    State v. Lilly\n   </em>\n   , --- N.W.2d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202236099\">\n    2019 WL 2236099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Iowa 2019), and\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, we conditionally affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence while remanding for further proceedings consistent with\n   <em>\n    Lilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Veal\n   </em>\n   , and this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts and Procedural History.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Late in the day on June 30, 2017, Shaun Biehl and his ex-girlfriend Jocelyn Simmons were spending time at her apartment in the Clarkview Apartments in Charles City. Biehl and Simmons were no longer in a romantic relationship but remained friends. Their four-year-old daughter also lived in the apartment. While Biehl was there, Nate Fleming dropped in several times. Fleming was a relatively small man who weighed 146 pounds and was five feet, seven inches tall. According to Biehl, Fleming was not upset or angry when he came by. Both Biehl and Simmons were also familiar with Antoine Williams, another resident of the Clarkview Apartments. Williams was a large man who weighed approximately 300 pounds and was six feet, seven inches tall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Around 8:10 p.m., Biehl put his and Simmons's daughter to bed. Biehl and Simmons\n   sat down to watch television. After watching a full episode of a show, Biehl remembers hearing two gunshots outside and running to a window that overlooked the Clarkview Apartments parking lot. Biehl saw Williams standing outside Fleming's red Chevy Equinox with his arm extended into the open driver's side door. Biehl heard two more shots and saw muzzle flashes. He then saw Williams pull Fleming's body out of the vehicle, throw him on the ground, get in the truck, and drive off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Biehl called 911 on his cellphone and rushed outside to try to render assistance. Others also came to the scene. Fleming was on his back, bleeding with bullet wounds in his chest area, and gasping for air. Meanwhile, Biehl spotted Williams driving back toward the group in the Equinox. Biehl told everyone to run and ran himself. Williams sped past the group in his vehicle and continued out of the complex. Fleming died at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Simmons likewise recalled being with Biehl at the apartment the evening of June 30. Fleming came by a couple of times to see her, and he was not upset or angry, although he smelled of alcohol. Simmons also remembered hearing shots and rushing to the window after their daughter had been put to bed. The first thing she saw was Williams holding a gun and standing over Fleming's body. After that, she saw Williams get into the red Chevy Equinox and drive away. Simmons too ran outside, and observed Fleming lying on the ground bleeding and then losing consciousness. She put a pillow under his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Christopher Vierkant, who was familiar with Williams, lived next door to the Clarkview Apartments. On the evening of June 30, around 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., Vierkant was outside with his children. He saw Williams walk past and said hello to him. According to Vierkant, Williams was focused on a red car that he was walking toward. Vierkant saw an African-American man in the red car with his hands on the wheel but could not see the man's face. Vierkant did not hear any talking or arguing between Williams and the man in the red car. He then saw two flashes and heard two bangs. At the time, he thought these were just fireworks. Vierkant ran back outside later after the police arrived at the apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the police arrived, they found two .380 caliber shell casings on the ground at the scene. They were also later able to track down the abandoned red Equinox, but Williams had moved on to Chicago, Illinois. On July 5, Williams was arrested there. On July 7, Williams was interviewed in Chicago by a special agent with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. When asked about the evening of June 30, Williams initially claimed that he had hung out with a group that included Fleming and then gone over to an ex-girlfriend's apartment and stayed there for the night. Williams claimed he did not learn until several days later that Fleming had been shot. Williams steadfastly denied having anything to do with Fleming's death, saying, \"No, sir, that's crazy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Later, questioning became more pointed. Williams was asked, \"Do you think that law enforcement knows that you were involved in -- in [Fleming's] death?\" Williams acknowledged at that point that he had shot Fleming in the parking lot of the Clarkview Apartments. He said that he had been approaching the Chevy Equinox when Fleming \"said something that triggered him.\" Williams said he was standing a few feet from the open window of the car when he shot Fleming. He shot \"however many bullets he had in his gun.\" Williams also admitted he \"never saw [Fleming] with a gun that night.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Williams admitted that after he shot Fleming, he opened the car door, pulled Fleming out, and got into the vehicle and drove away. Williams said that he later broke Fleming's cellphone into pieces and threw them away. He also retrieved two shell casings from the car and discarded the gun he had used to shoot Fleming. Williams said he had purchased the gun from Ed Brown and had kept it under the sink in his apartment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Williams went on with this version of events. He claimed that earlier that evening of June 30, when Fleming, Williams, and others were hanging out at the apartment complex, Fleming had questioned the group whether they had something to do with a beating Fleming had recently received. Before Fleming left in his vehicle, he allegedly told others in the group, \"You better not be standing here when I get back.\" Williams told the investigator he went to retrieve his gun after Fleming left. Williams added that he should have let the matter go. As Williams put it, \"I did it, I did it, and I shouldn't have done it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Williams did not claim in the interview that he had acted in self-defense. To the contrary, he said, \"[I]t's on me. That's on me.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    An autopsy report determined that Fleming died from multiple gunshot wounds. Fleming's body contained six gunshot wounds, which were caused by between four and six bullets. Four bullets were recovered from Fleming's body. One of the wounds had gunpowder stippling, which meant that the gun had been discharged within eighteen inches of Fleming's body. Fleming's blood alcohol concentration at the time of his death was .242.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    On July 19, a trial information was filed in the Iowa District Court for Floyd County, charging Williams with first-degree murder.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20707.1\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 707.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , .2(1)(\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    ). On August 24, Williams moved to change the venue from Floyd County. On September 11, the district court denied the motion, indicating that the majority of the media articles had been factual and that it did not believe prospective jurors would have a predisposition about the case. The court did instruct the clerk, however, to bring in an additional jury panel to ensure there would be sufficient numbers from which to select a jury. On September 18, Williams filed a notice that he intended to rely on the defense of self-defense/justification at trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20707.1\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 704; Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.11(11)(\n    <em>\n     c\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Trial was scheduled to begin October 10. On October 2, Williams, who is African-American, filed a motion to challenge the jury panel. Williams's motion noted that African-Americans represent 2.3% of the Floyd County population according to the 2016 census, yet only two of the 166 potential jurors who submitted questionnaire responses for two jury pools for October through December 2017 self-identified as African-American. (One of these two had been excused.) Williams also reported tallies for the last four years:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    In the calculations overall in the [last] four years, there were 1,404 jurors, of which, 452 did not respond to the race question. Of the 952 remaining jurors, in this four-year span, only 9 members reported being African American, which would be only 0.9% of the jurors pooled from 2013 through 2017.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    On October 3, the State filed a resistance to Williams's motion. The State acknowledged that the most recent census data showed that 2.3% of the population in Floyd County was Black or African-American, but argued this figure should not be used for comparisons because the African-American population was disproportionately younger and 2.3% did not reflect the percentage actually eligible for jury service. The State also urged the\n    data on which Williams relied were flawed because they did not account for jurors who declined to disclose their race on their questionnaire responses. The State thus insisted that Williams had not proved substantial underrepresentation or systematic exclusion under the three-part\n    <em>\n     Duren\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     /\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    standard.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Duren v. Missouri\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/#p364\">\n     439 U.S. 357\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 364,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/#p364\">\n     99 S.

On October 6, the district court entered a written ruling denying Williams's motion to challenge the jury panel. The court found that Williams failed to show a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under the second and third prongs of the\n    <em>\n     Duren\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     /\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    test. The court noted,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    Turning to the panels available for the defendant's trial the Court required the clerk to call in two separate pools. According to Exhibit D, the last two pages, there were 103 letters sent to potential jurors in Pool 1 and 103 letters sent to potential jurors in Pool 2. Twelve letters were either undelivered or did not respond as to Pool 1. Thus there were 91 responses in Pool 1. In Pool 2 there were five that were undelivered or failed to respond. There were 98 responses in Pool 2.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    In Pool [1] there are 23 potential jurors who did not identify their ethnicity. The 23 number is derived from adding the three who responded, the nine who were excused, and the ten who were disqualified, and the one who was deferred. Subtracting 23 from 91 results in 68 potential jurors who responded and self-identified their ethnicity. In Pool 2, of the 98 responses, 28 responses did not self-identify their ethnicity (six responding, 14 excused, six disqualified, and two deferred). Subtracting 28 from 98 results in 70 potential jurors who responded and self-identified their ethnicity.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    Combining the two pools results in 138 individuals who responded to their summons and who self-identified their ethnicity. Exhibit D demonstrates that there is one self-identified African-American who was excused from the jury. The Court understands that the reason for the excusal is because the individual was attending college away from home. Panel 2 has one person [who] identified as African-American.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    If the jury pool was proportional to the population, out of 138 jurors, there should be two to three potential jurors who are African-American. If the Court accepts the defendant's figure of 2.3 percent, then the number of expected African-American jurors in the pool should be at least three jurors.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The district court went on to reject Williams's argument that the excused African-American juror could not be considered because \"there is no showing that the method of excusing jurors is such that African-Americans are excused in greater numbers than other persons of different ethnicity or nationality.\" The court then found no underrepresentation because given the small numbers involved, \"it is difficult to apply a rigid statistical analysis to the matter.\" The court also held there was no showing of systematic exclusion of African-Americans from the potential jury pool. It noted, however,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    In reviewing historical numbers, the Court believes that the state court system can do more and the Court suspects that a more through statistical analysis would show that African-Americans are less likely to have motor vehicle registration or are less likely to be registered to vote. However, that showing has not\n    been made in this case. The Court believes that additional lists could be used to increase the potential numbers of distinct minority groups. However, while believing there may be better ways to select potential jurors, this does not mean that the current method systematically excludes African-American jurors. The State attempts to use neutral, readily-available lists. Defendant's position does not address potential other reasons for the potential underrepresentation of African-Americans on the historical jury pools. There is not sufficient showing that a systematic exclusion resulted from something that the State has done.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Trial began as scheduled on October 10. Two days earlier, Williams had moved for individualized voir dire by counsel \"so that the Defendant can effectively and adequately exercise his peremptory challenges in selecting jurors.\" For most of the day of the 10th, the court, the prosecution, and the defense conducted voir dire, and a number of prospective jurors were excused. In the afternoon, the defense approached the court and specifically requested taking each of the thirty-four prospective jurors in the box for a private interview to talk to them about their attitudes regarding race, among other things. The State opposed the request. The district court ruled,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    THE COURT: All right. I'm going to overrule that motion. One, for the reasons stated by the State. I -- We've listened to this jury, and I think most of them have expressed an opinion that they can be fair and impartial and don't have any predisposition in -- in this matter. And just from that kind of general sampling, I don't think it's going to be necessary to have an individual examination.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    The second reason is just a matter of -- of timing. Five minutes each -- and I think that's generous -- times 34 is 170 minutes, which is, you know, almost three hours. And if we take some breaks here and there for the court reporter, you know, basically we'd be using a half a day for that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    We have a shot of getting the jury selected today. I don't know if that's going to happen or not. My experience is if I have 150 people having to come back overnight, we lose some of them, there might be exposure to things that we don't want to have them exposed to. It's a lot easier if I have 14 people that I have to take care of -- and keep track of.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    So I don't want to spend that time in order to -- to pick a jury, given all that; and also I -- I think it's somewhat unfair to -- to the jury members that we do that without, you know, more cause shown for doing that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Williams's counsel proceeded to voir dire the jurors concerning racial attitudes as a group. For example, she asked, \"If you're picked to be on the jury and you go back to the jury room and you hear another juror making an argument based on race, what would you do?\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    During the defense case, Williams presented witnesses who testified that Fleming had a disagreeable and boastful personality and had got into an altercation earlier that month and threatened retaliation. Witnesses also testified that Fleming was driving recklessly, had tried to slap a woman, and was making threats on June 30. Witnesses also testified to Williams's peaceful disposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Additionally, Williams testified on his own behalf and gave a different version of events than he had provided after his arrest. According to Williams, earlier in the day on June 30, Fleming was driving recklessly through the Clarkview Apartments parking lot, acting aggressively, insulting people, and making threats. Williams\n    claimed the threats included the use of firearms.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Williams testified he obtained the gun he used to shoot Fleming from a friend, i.e., Brown, earlier on June 30 because he was fearful of Fleming. However, Brown denied at trial he had provided the gun to Williams. Brown said he had previously seen Williams with a gun.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Williams claimed that when he approached Fleming in the Chevy Equinox on the evening of June 30, Fleming was highly agitated and had his music on loud, and Williams was trying to calm him down. According to Williams, Fleming said to him, \"Man, you know what, don't even approach my m__f__ing car,\" and accused him of being in association with the individuals who had recently beaten up Fleming. After some exchanges back and forth, in Williams's words, \"[H]e started reaching for what I thought was a gun.\" At this point, Williams said he pulled the gun out of his back pocket, covered his face, and fired shots at Fleming repeatedly until the gun was empty. Williams claimed he covered his face the entire time that he was shooting Fleming, although all the shots apparently hit their mark. Williams also claimed that when he pulled Fleming out of the car, \"I didn't think he was really hurt ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Even at trial, Williams admitted that he never saw a gun on Fleming's person:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Q. Did you ever see a weapon in the car? A. I -- I don't know. I didn't check for one, though. That -- That's my answer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    Q. Did you see a weapon in the car? A. I did not check for one, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    Q. Well, did you see Mr. Fleming with a weapon? A. You're just trying to switch this on me; but no, sir.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    On October 18, the jury returned a verdict finding Williams guilty of the lesser included offense of murder in the second degree.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20707.3\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 707.3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . On December 8, the court sentenced Williams to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of fifty years with a mandatory seventy percent minimum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20707.3\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 707.3(2) ;\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20707.3\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 902.12. Williams filed a notice of appeal, and we retained the appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    On appeal, Williams raises five arguments. First, he contends that he was denied his constitutional right to a jury panel drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Second, he contends the district court abused its discretion in not allowing individualized voir dire of potential jurors on race-related issues. Third, he maintains the district court erred in excluding evidence of Fleming's criminal history and prior acts of violence not known by Williams. Fourth, Williams insists that the district court erred in refusing to give his proposed jury instruction on implicit bias. Finally, Williams contends the court erred in not following the stand your ground amendment that was enacted in 2017 and became effective on July 1 of that year.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

Williams argues that she and other preexcused jurors should not be counted in determining the percentage of the distinctive group in the jury pool, making the ratio 1/130 rather than 2/138. The State and the district court viewed the matter otherwise. As the State reasons, there is no reason to omit persons who received a juror summons from the statistics, \"especially in the absence of any allegation that hardship excusals are granted in patterns that contribute to underrepresentation or exclusion.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    There is a potential problem with the State and the district court's position, at least under article I, section 10 of the Iowa Constitution.

But Williams cites no scholarship directed to the specific issue here-namely, the effectiveness of questioning prospective jurors on race in an individual, sequestered setting as opposed to a group setting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    On our review of the record, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion. The defendant and the decedent were of the same race and there is no suggestion that race played a role in the alleged crime or its investigation. Additionally, the district court balanced Williams's request against other concerns. This case had received some notoriety in this county of around 16,000 people. The district court noted that if it granted individualized voir dire, it would no longer be possible to\n    finish jury selection that day.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The court worried that it would be more difficult to limit the exposure of a large group of potential jurors overnight to improper influence than to limit the exposure of a small group of actual jurors: \"It's a lot easier if I have 14 people [twelve jurors and two alternates] that I have to take care of and -- keep track of.\" There is logic to the court's reasoning. The message that people need to act responsibly tends to be better received when those people have been given responsibility. Thus, a person who has been told she or he is an actual juror may be more prone to take the court's admonition seriously. Finally, we note that defense counsel's panel questioning on the subject of race was thoughtful and insightful.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Having said that, we emphasize that this was a murder trial where the defendant faced a very severe sentence. Defense counsel should be given considerable leeway in utilizing voir dire to eliminate potential racial bias from the jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     VI. Implicit-Bias Instruction.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    At trial, the district court gave Jury Instruction 5, which stated in part,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    As you consider the evidence, do not be influenced by any personal sympathy, bias, prejudices or emotions. Because you are making very important decisions in this case, you are to evaluate the evidence carefully and avoid decisions based on generalizations, gut feelings, prejudices, sympathies, stereotypes, or biases. The law demands that you return a just verdict, based solely on the evidence, your reason and common sense, and these instructions. As jurors, your sole duty is to find the truth and do justice.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    However, the court denied Williams's request to give the following additional instruction:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    Our system of justice depends on judges like me and jurors like you being able and willing to make careful and fair decisions. Scientists studying the way our brains work have shown that, for all of us, our first responses are often like reflexes. Just like our knee reflexes, our mental responses are quick and automatic. Even though these quick responses may not be what we consciously think, they could influence how we judge people or even how we remember or evaluate the evidence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    Scientists have taught us some ways to be more careful in our thinking that I ask you to use as you consider the evidence in this case:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    Take the time you need to test what might be reflexive unconscious responses and to reflect carefully and consciously about the evidence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    \u2022 Focus on individual facts, don't jump to conclusions that may have been influenced by unintended stereotypes or associations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    \u2022 Try taking another perspective.

The court also pointed out that Instruction 5 in its view covered the subject matter:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    Instruction 5 does talk about setting aside stereotypes, biases, and prejudices. I think that addresses the issue. The law -- The jury's otherwise instructed to consider what they've heard in the courtroom; and -- and if they follow those instructions, then the race of the -- of the defendant or the -- or Mr. Fleming would not be pertinent. I'm aware of the concerns; but, as I said, I think Instruction 5 addresses that matter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Williams argues on appeal that the district court's refusal of his implicit-bias instruction amounted to reversible error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    , the district court declined to give a different implicit-bias instruction than the one Williams requested here. 898 N.W.2d at 816. We noted in\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    that denial of a cautionary instruction like an implicit-bias instruction is subject to an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    We held the trial court had abused its discretion \"because it erroneously believed it lacked authority from our court to give the [implicit-bias] instruction.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 817. Yet, in the end, we found that the district court's refusal to give Plain's requested implicit-bias instruction was not prejudicial.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    In this case, unlike\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    , the district court did not conclude it lacked authority to give an implicit-bias instruction. Rather, it found that Instruction 5 adequately addressed the concern. Instruction 5 was based on the Iowa State Bar Association's latest version of Instruction 100.8.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Iowa State Bar Ass'n, Iowa Criminal Jury Instructions 100.8 (2018) (revised June 2016). The Iowa State Bar Association updated Instruction 100.8 in 2016 so that it now directs the jury to \"avoid decisions based on generalizations, gut feelings, prejudices, sympathies, stereotypes, or biases.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    This version of Instruction 100.8 did not exist at the time of Plain's trial and was not given in\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    , 898 N.W.2d at 839 n.14 (Waterman, J., specially concurring) (quoting from the jury instructions). It is also noteworthy that both Williams and Fleming were of the same race, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    where the defendant was African-American and the complaining witness was white.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 809 (majority opinion). Given these factors, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give Williams's requested implicit-bias instruction.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    This does not mean, of course, that it would have been an abuse of discretion to use Williams's requested instruction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <strong>\n     VII. Fleming's Convictions and Other Prior Bad Acts Not Known by Williams.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    At trial, Williams asserted that he shot Fleming in self-defense. In support of this claim, Williams was allowed to introduce (1) evidence of Fleming's behavior on the day of the shooting, (2) any other specific acts by Fleming known to\n    Williams, and (3) Fleming's alleged reputation for aggressive behavior. Specifically, Williams was permitted to introduce evidence that on the evening in question, Fleming was highly intoxicated, and that he had been acting tough, voicing threats, and driving recklessly.

In light of the great racial disparity in imprisonment in this state, I disagree with the district court judge's conclusion that expediently completing voir dire in one day was more important than Williams's quest to find a jury free of racial bias. The majority's myopic and maladroit paralogism that the district court found it was more important to finish voir dire in one day rather than to worry that a prospective juror would be exposed to improper influences overnight is an excuse, not a reason. It is also illogical. Wouldn't the same concern apply to jurors the parties picked to serve? Why wouldn't these jurors be subject to the same improper influences? Admonitions take care of this problem.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.

The district court declined to give the proposed instruction because, in its view, the instruction has not been specifically approved by this court and other instructions adequately covered the subject.

The ABA model instruction, although more verbose than that proposed in\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    , is a correct statement of law. As in\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    , prior approval of this court or the Iowa State Bar Association was not required.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Further, in this case, the district court suggested that other instructions regarding burden of proof and other instructions were the equivalent of an implicit-bias instruction. In particular, the district court seemed to rely on Instruction 5, which generally stated that jurors were not to be influenced by \"any personal sympathy, bias, prejudices or emotions,\" to \"evaluate the evidence carefully,\" to \"avoid decisions based on generalizations, gut feelings, prejudices, sympathies, stereotypes, or biases,\" and to return a verdict based \"solely on the evidence, your reason, and common sense.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    There is nothing wrong, of course, with Instruction 5. But it does not cover the question of implicit bias. Implicit bias is\n    bias that is subconscious or unintentional.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    , 898 N.W.2d at 830-36 (Appel, J., concurring specially). Because of the often unrecognized but potentially very powerful pull of implicit bias, the American Bar Association has recommended that judges should give an instruction on implicit bias. While we have not yet required a particular approach to implicit bias, the\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    court declared, \"We strongly encourage district courts to be proactive about addressing implicit bias; however, we do not mandate a singular method of doing so.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 817 (majority opinion). It was error for the district court to conclude that Instruction 5 covered the same subject matter as an implicit-bias instruction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The concept of implicit bias is old, but the notion of an implicit-bias instruction is somewhat new. Change comes hard. In my view, however, the time has come, and has in fact long since passed, to adjust our approach to implicit bias in our courtrooms. Giving an appropriate implicit-bias instruction at the request of the defense is not a panacea, but it moves us in the right direction in seeking to ensure that racial bias plays no part in our justice system.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    There is some good news in all of this. Researchers have found that instructions that emphasize fairness and the importance of recognizing racial bias can have impact.

Individual Voir Dire of Jurors Regarding Racial Bias.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    I also conclude that the district court erred in not allowing individual voir dire. I join Justice Wiggins's opinion on this point as well. I write separately to emphasize the limitations of conventional group voir dire in rooting out racial bias and the modest potential of individual voir dire, properly handled, in addressing the potential of racial bias.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    First, closed-end judge-based questioning is ineffective in identifying racially prejudiced jurors. As noted by a leading scholar many years ago, closed-end questions from the court, such as questioning whether the jurors can be fair and impartial, base their verdict on the evidence, and follow the court's instructions, would not smoke out professed racists like Lester Maddox or George Wallace.

He faced the prospect of life in prison without parole, Iowa's equivalent of the death penalty. African-Americans comprised only 2.3% of the population of the county in which he was being tried. Further, in addition to starting as a distinct minority, the jury panel was not representative of the population of African-Americans. The trial judge declined to draw new jury pools because they would no doubt suffer from the same defect as the pool before the district court. So, with a virtual assurance that no African-Americans would be on this jury, the district court was unwilling to take a few extra minutes to allow the defendant to explore sensitive issues involving racial bias even though the African-American defendant faced life in prison without parole.
