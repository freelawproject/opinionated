He challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the state's evidence. He argues that he was unlawfully arrested by a Red Lake Band police officer before he was arrested by a Beltrami County deputy sheriff. We conclude that the district court did not err by denying Thompson's motion because Indian tribes have inherent authority to expel a non-member who is suspected of criminal activity from the tribe's reservation by detaining and delivering the non-member to a non-Indian\n   law-enforcement agency. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts relevant to this appeal are contained in two written reports, both of which were introduced into evidence at the hearing on Thompson's motion to suppress. One report was prepared by Officer Bendel, an officer of the Red Lake Police Department; the other report was prepared by Deputy Roberts, a Beltrami County deputy sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The report prepared by Officer Bendel states that, on August 16, 2017, Thompson's brother was treated at the Red Lake Indian Health Service Hospital in the city of Red Lake on the Red Lake reservation. The hospital's lead nurse called Thompson by telephone and asked him to come to the hospital to pick up his brother, who was being discharged. While speaking with Thompson, the lead nurse perceived that he was intoxicated. The lead nurse spoke with Officer Bendel by telephone and asked him to remove Thompson's brother from the hospital and also stated that Thompson seemed intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Bendel drove to the hospital, where he saw Thompson's brother sitting in a wheelchair, waiting for a ride. The lead nurse asked Officer Bendel to drive Thompson's brother to his home beyond the boundaries of the reservation or, at the least, to the reservation boundary. Officer Bendel contacted his supervisor, who instructed him not to drive Thompson's brother home. Officer Bendel then saw Thompson arrive at the hospital, driving his brother's green pick-up truck. As Thompson exited the truck and approached his brother, Officer Bendel observed that Thompson's eyes were \"watery and bloodshot,\" that he was \"slurring his words,\" and that he smelled of an alcoholic beverage. Officer Bendel administered a preliminary breath test, which indicated that Thompson had an alcohol concentration of 0.121. Officer Bendel administered several field sobriety tests, which further indicated that Thompson was intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Bendel informed Thompson that he was being detained on suspicion of driving while impaired. Officer Bendel placed handcuffs on Thompson's wrists, read him the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, and placed him in the back seat of his patrol car. Officer Bendel asked the Red Lake dispatcher to contact the Beltrami County Sheriff's office to request that a deputy sheriff meet Officer Bendel at the reservation boundary and take custody of Thompson, who Officer Bendel apparently knew was not a member of the Red Lake Band. Before transporting Thompson, Officer Bendel administered a second preliminary breath test, which indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Officer Bendel drove south on State Highway 89, he spoke with Deputy Roberts, who agreed to meet him at the reservation boundary. During that conversation, Officer Bendel briefed Deputy Roberts on the situation. Officer Bendel waited at the boundary until Deputy Roberts arrived, at which time Officer Bendel transferred custody of Thompson to Deputy Roberts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The report prepared by Deputy Roberts states that, upon meeting Officer Bendel at the reservation boundary, Officer Bendel told him that Thompson had failed field sobriety tests and two preliminary breath tests. Deputy Roberts handcuffed Thompson and placed him in the back seat of his squad car. As Deputy Roberts did so, he observed that Thompson had bloodshot and watery eyes. Deputy Roberts drove Thompson to the Beltrami County jail, where he read Thompson the implied-consent advisory. Thompson agreed to submit to a breath test, which revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state charged Thompson with first-degree driving while impaired (DWI), in violation of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.24, subd. 1(2) (2016). Thompson moved to suppress all of the state's evidence on the ground that he was unlawfully arrested by Officer Bendel because, he asserted, Officer Bendel is not a \"peace officer,\" as that term is defined in the relevant Minnesota statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.03, subd. 18 (2016). A brief omnibus hearing was held in early September 2017. The district court identified the sole issue as \"whether the Red Lake officer is an officer per the statute.\" The prosecutor and Thompson's attorney agreed with the district court's statement of the issue and agreed to submit memoranda of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Thompson's memorandum, he argued that Officer Bendel is not a peace officer for purposes of the Minnesota DWI statute, that Officer Bendel unlawfully arrested Thompson, and that the unlawful arrest required the suppression of all evidence arising from the arrest. In response, the state argued that Minnesota law cannot authorize Red Lake tribal police officers to act as peace officers for purposes of the Minnesota DWI statute; that Thompson was \"subject to the Red Lake Officer, as that is who enforces the law on the Red Lake Indian Reservation\"; and that Thompson's argument, if adopted, would imply that no one may enforce DWI laws on the Red Lake reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In early November 2017, the district court filed a two-page order and memorandum in which it denied Thompson's motion. The memorandum states, in full, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Public Law 83-280 (codified as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201360\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201321\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1326 ) granted jurisdiction of Indian Reservations to the States; in Minnesota this included all Indian Reservations except the Red Lake Indian Reservation. Minnesota law does not govern on the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indian Reservation; the Red Lake Nation governs and polices itself. Because Red Lake is a sovereign nation, the state of Minnesota can neither grant nor deny authority over how the Red Lake Nation makes or enforces laws, including laws granting law enforcement authority. No Minnesota statute specifically authorizes Red Lake Police officers to act as peace officers and perform sobriety tests and arrests because Minnesota does not have the authority to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Furthermore, neither the Minnesota State Patrol nor the Beltrami County Sheriff's department has jurisdiction on the Red Lake Indian Reservation; to hold that the Red Lake Police Department also cannot enforce the DWI laws against non-band members on the Red Lake Indian Reservation would create an absurd result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's motion to suppress and dismiss is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At trial in early December 2017, Thompson waived his right to a jury trial, stipulated to the prosecution's evidence, and agreed that his right to appeal would be limited to the district court's ruling on the pre-trial suppression motion. In addition, both parties agreed that the pre-trial ruling would be dispositive of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01, subd. 4. The district court found Thompson guilty and sentenced him to 60 months of imprisonment. Thompson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Did the Red Lake tribal police officer unlawfully arrest Thompson by detaining him on suspicion of driving while impaired, driving him to the boundary of the Red Lake reservation, and delivering him to a Beltrami County deputy sheriff?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Thompson renews the argument that he made to the district court. In his principal brief, he argues that Officer Bendel is not a \"peace officer\" as that term is defined in the Minnesota DWI statute and, thus, is not authorized to make an arrest for purposes of enforcing Minnesota DWI laws; that Officer Bendel arrested him; that the arrest is unlawful because Officer Bendel is not a \"peace officer\"; and that the unlawful arrest requires the suppression of all evidence arising from the arrest. In its responsive brief, the state argues that Officer Bendel is a \"peace officer\" under the Minnesota DWI statute; that, in the alternative, Officer Bendel's arrest of Thompson is justified by the citizen's-arrest statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20629.37\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 629.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; and that the district court did not err by denying Thompson's motion to suppress on the ground that a contrary conclusion would create an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At oral argument, the appellate attorneys for both parties referred to legal principles that are beyond the scope of their respective briefs. Thompson's appellate attorney asserted that only the federal government may prosecute a person who is not a member of the Red Lake Band for criminal conduct occurring on the Red Lake reservation. In response, the county attorney asserted that the state may prosecute a non-Indian for driving while impaired on the Red Lake reservation but that a county deputy sheriff may not enforce Minnesota law on the Red Lake reservation. In rebuttal, Thompson's attorney candidly acknowledged that, under federal law, Indian tribes generally may expel non-members from their reservations. The court asked follow-up questions of Thompson's attorney concerning the authority of an Indian tribe to expel non-members and whether such authority was exercised in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After oral argument, the court determined that supplemental briefing would assist the decision-making process. The court did so because Thompson's argument depends, at least in part, on the authority of Indian tribes to police tribal lands and challenges the actions of a police officer of the Red Lake Band, which is not a party to this appeal. Both parties submitted supplemental briefs, which were helpful to the court. In Thompson's supplemental brief, he again acknowledges that Indian tribes possess inherent authority to expel non-members from their lands, but he argues that such authority does not authorize a tribal police officer to make an arrest. The state argues in its supplemental brief that Indian tribes possess inherent authority to expel non-members from their lands and that Officer Bendel acted pursuant to that authority when he detained Thompson and delivered him to Deputy Roberts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We first consider whether Officer Bendel is a peace officer for purposes of the Minnesota DWI statute. This is the issue that was identified by the district court at the hearing on Thompson's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Chapter 169A of the Minnesota Statutes is known as the Minnesota Impaired Driving Code. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.01, subd. 1 (2016). The impaired-driving code establishes, among other things, the criminal offenses of driving while impaired. Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 169A.20 -.27 (2016). The impaired-driving code provides that, if there is probable cause that a person has committed the offense of DWI, the person may be arrested by a \"peace officer.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.40, subd. 1 (2016). For purposes of chapter 169A, the term \"peace officer\" is defined to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) a State Patrol officer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) University of Minnesota peace officer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) police officer of any municipality, including towns having powers under section 368.01, or county; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (4) for purposes of violations of this chapter in or on an off-road recreational vehicle or motorboat, or for violations of section 97B.065 or 97B.066, a state conservation officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.03, subd. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thompson contends that Officer Bendel is not a \"peace officer\" for purposes of chapter 169A because he is not among the officers listed in section 169A.03, subdivision 18. In response, the state contends that Officer Bendel is included in the third paragraph of the definition on the ground that an Indian tribe is a \"municipality.\" For this proposition, the state cites only one Minnesota case:\n   <em>\n    Granite Valley Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Jackpot Junction Bingo &amp; Casino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10591978\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/559/135/\">\n    559 N.W.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. App. 1997). Specifically, the state quotes one sentence on page 142 of that opinion. But the quoted sentence is part of a concurring opinion, which is not the opinion of the court and, thus, not precedential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10591978\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/559/135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10591978\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/559/135/\">\n    at 138-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Randall, J., concurring specially).

In\n   <em>\n    Hester\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court considered whether an officer of the Lower Sioux Indian Community was a \"peace officer\" for purposes of section 169A.03, subdivision 18.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n    at 331-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court looked to section 626.91, which stated that the Lower Sioux \" 'has the powers of a law enforcement agency if' \" certain statutory requirements are met.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n    at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20626.91\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 626.91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subds. 2, 2(a), 4 ). As Thompson notes, section 626.91 is one of three statutes that define the powers of tribal police officers of specific tribes or bands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20626.90\">\n    Minn.

But there is no such statute for the Red Lake Band. Another nearby statute defines the law-enforcement authority of other Indian tribes and bands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20626.93\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 626.93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). That statute provides, in part, \"If the requirements of subdivision 2 are met and the tribe enters into a cooperative agreement pursuant to subdivision 4, the tribe shall have concurrent jurisdictional authority under this section with the local county sheriff within the geographical boundaries of the tribe's reservation to enforce state criminal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20626.93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 3. There is nothing in the record of this case to suggest that the Red Lake Band has entered into a cooperative agreement that would give its police officers concurrent jurisdiction to enforce state criminal law on the Red Lake reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, Officer Bendel, a Red Lake tribal police officer, is not a \"peace officer\" for purposes of the Minnesota Impaired Driving Code, chapter 169A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The next question is whether Officer Bendel arrested Thompson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court did not make any findings as to\n   whether Officer Bendel arrested Thompson. It appears that the district court intentionally avoided the issue on the ground that the State of Minnesota \"does not have the authority to\" authorize a Red Lake police officer to make an arrest. Regardless, the state does not dispute Thompson's contention that he was arrested. Rather, the state assumes that an arrest occurred. The state focuses its argument on the question whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful. Accordingly, for purposes of this opinion, we will accept the state's concession on that factual issue and proceed to analyze the remaining issues based on the assumption that Officer Bendel arrested Thompson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We proceed to the main issue in Thompson's argument: whether Officer Bendel's arrest is unlawful on the ground that the officer had no authority to arrest him for violating the Minnesota DWI statute on the Red Lake reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thompson's argument for reversal is based primarily on the supreme court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Hester\n   </em>\n   . The defendant in that case was arrested for DWI by a Lower Sioux police officer, who read Hester the implied-consent advisory.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n    796 N.W.2d at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The reading of the implied-consent advisory by a licensed \"peace officer\" was a prerequisite of the offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 330-31 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169A.20, sub. 2 (2010). Because the\n   tribal police officer who read the implied-consent advisory to Hester was not licensed by the State of Minnesota, Hester did not commit a crime by refusing to submit to chemical testing in response to the tribal police officer's request.\n   <em>\n    Hester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079386\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/796/328/\">\n    796 N.W.2d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, Deputy Roberts did so. Furthermore, Thompson did not refuse to submit to chemical testing. Rather, he submitted to chemical testing by providing a sample of his breath, and the resulting breath test indicated that he was impaired. For purposes of the DWI statute, it is immaterial that Thompson's impairment was first observed by Officer Bendel instead of Deputy Roberts. Officer Bendel communicated his observations to Deputy Roberts, and Deputy Roberts also acquired first-hand knowledge of Thompson's likely impairment after he took custody of him. The determination of Thompson's guilt does not depend on whether Officer Bendel is a \"peace officer\" licensed by the State of Minnesota. Thus, the district court's reasoning is not in conflict with the supreme court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Hester\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thompson's argument for reversal also is based on the principle that, because Officer Bendel was not licensed by the State of Minnesota, he had no authority to arrest him for a violation of the Minnesota DWI statute on the Red Lake reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thompson raised this issue in the district court by contending that \"Red Lake Tribal authorities may enforce tribal laws on their own reservation against their own band members,\" that \"the defense is unaware of any legal authority which permits Red Lake law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities to prosecute non-tribal members in tribal court,\" and that, as a consequence, \"tribal authorities cannot police their own reservation as it pertains to non-band members.\" Thompson also contended in the district court that Red Lake \"could agree to allow Beltrami County law enforcement to patrol and enforce Minnesota DWI laws against non-band members on the Red Lake reservation\" but that \"[b]y not allowing Beltrami County to enforce said DWI offenses against non-tribal members, the Red Lake Band is choosing to allow said conduct to occur.\" The state responded to Thompson's argument by contending that the Red Lake Band \"governs itself and polices itself\" and that Thompson \"was subject to [the authority of] the Red Lake officer, as that is who enforces the law on the Red Lake Indian reservation.\" The district court addressed this issue in a manner that is consistent with the state's argument. The district court stated that \"Minnesota law does not govern on the Red Lake Band Indian Reservation\" and that \"the Red Lake Nation governs and polices itself.\" The district court also stated, \"Because Red Lake is a sovereign nation, the state of Minnesota can neither grant nor deny authority over how the Red Lake Nation makes or enforces laws, including laws granting law enforcement authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Whether a federal, tribal, or state law-enforcement officer has authority to investigate a criminal offense committed on an Indian reservation generally depends on whether the federal government, a tribe, or a state has authority to prosecute and to adjudicate guilt with respect to the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Felix S.
