Stat. \u00a7 211B.04, subd. 1. Relators argue that (1) the disclaimer requirement violates the right to free speech, (2) the complaint alleging the violation was untimely, and (3) substantial evidence does not support the determination that relators violated the disclaimer requirement. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2017, relator David Hutchinson was contemplating running for Hennepin County Sheriff. He began collecting campaign contributions and created a \"Hutch for Sheriff\" Facebook page. He also paid a printing company to prepare four \"prototype\" lawn signs that read: \"Elect HUTCH for Hennepin County Sheriff.\" Hutchinson posted a picture of the signs on Facebook. He also gave one to his father, who placed it in the front lawn of the Medina residence he rents from Hutchinson's brother, and one to a friend, who placed the sign in the front lawn of his Minneapolis residence. The other two signs remained in Hutchinson's garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 18, 2017, Hutchinson filed his candidacy and registered his campaign committee, relator Hutch for Sheriff. Hutchinson and his committee (collectively, Hutchinson) thereafter ordered more than 1,000 campaign signs bearing substantially the same message as the original four, as well as a disclaimer: \"Paid for and prepared by the Hutch for Sheriff volunteer committee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following August, respondent Alex Lewison, the deputy treasurer of then-Sheriff Rich Stanek's volunteer campaign committee, saw the two posted signs that lacked disclaimers. The signs remained in place through the primary election. On August 22, 2018, Lewison filed a complaint with the OAH alleging that Hutchinson violated Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04, subd. 1, by preparing and disseminating campaign material that lacked a disclaimer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A panel of three administrative law judges conducted an evidentiary hearing and determined that Hutchinson violated the disclaimer requirement. Because the violation was inadvertent and had \"minimal impact on voters,\" the OAH imposed a civil penalty of $ 200. Hutchinson appeals by writ of certiorari.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

But this case involves a political candidate and his campaign committee, not an independent actor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to political candidates, the United States Supreme Court has long recognized the validity of disclosure and disclaimer requirements.\n   <em>\n    Buckley v.

The\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned that, while such requirements burden free speech, they are permissible because they serve important governmental interests in: (1) \"provid[ing] the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate,\" (2) avoiding corruption, and (3) detecting campaign-finance violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.

Stat. \u00a7 211B.04 expressly limits its reach to those \"required to register or report under chapter 10A or 211A.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04, subd. 3(b). This includes political candidates and campaign committees that accept or spend at least $ 750. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211A.02 (2018). Hutchinson does not dispute that, by December 2017, he and his campaign committee were subject to those reporting and registration requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rather, Hutchinson contends that the disclaimer requirement unfairly burdens a first-time candidate such as himself. We disagree. Every political candidate must know-indeed, is presumed to know-the laws governing campaign practices, which are published in publicly available statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carlson v. Ritchie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068421\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/830/887/#p892\">\n    830 N.W.2d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 892 (Minn. 2013) (presuming that candidate was aware of political party caucus requirements). Difficulty learning the applicable laws does not make compliance with the laws themselves unfairly onerous. And equal application of those laws is the only way to further their substantial governmental purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04 imposes only the type of limited disclaimer requirement long permitted as a means of informing the electorate about the election-related spending of certain political actors. Because Hutchinson and his campaign committee are such actors, their challenge to the statute's constitutionality fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

We are not convinced that such a limitation is warranted.

And for every day that a lawn sign remains on display without the required disclaimer, a violation exists-one that may be abated at any time by removing the sign or adding the disclaimer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, applying the continuing-violation doctrine to the dissemination of nonconforming campaign material that communicates continuously supports the important purposes behind Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04, subd. 1. The statute requires disclaimers to inform voters about election-related spending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p366\">\n    558 U.S. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p366\">\n    130 S.

Every day the campaign material is displayed without the disclaimer, the electorate lacks that vital information about its source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Hutchinson's dissemination of campaign material in the form of lawn signs that lacked the required disclaimer continued unabated through August 2018. Accordingly, Lewison's complaint filed that same month was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Substantial evidence supports the determination that Hutchinson violated Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The record establishes a substantial basis to support an OAH determination if \"there is relevant evidence that a reasonable person would accept as adequate\" to support the determination.\n   <em>\n    In re A.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6788452\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/883/251/#p259\">\n    883 N.W.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259 (Minn. 2016). When determining whether this standard is met, we view factual findings \"in the light most favorable to the decision,\" and we will not disturb those findings \"if there is evidence reasonably tending to sustain them.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster v. Hennepin County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555566\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/910/420/#p428\">\n    910 N.W.2d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (Minn. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Hutchinson first challenges the OAH's finding that he disseminated the lawn signs \"for the purpose of influencing voting at a primary or other election,\" as required for them to constitute campaign material under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.01, subd. 2. He contends that he lacked the requisite intent because the signs were prototypes. We disagree. Hutchinson paid for four lawn signs that urged voters to \"Elect HUTCH for Hennepin County Sheriff.\" He gave two of the signs to his father and his friend, who, as one might reasonably expect, posted them in public view. After filing his candidacy in December 2017, Hutchinson could have acted to ensure that the two \"prototype\" signs were modified to include the then-required disclaimer or removed. But he did not. And the signs remained in public view for at least eight months after he filed his candidacy and registered his campaign committee. During that time, Hutchinson also paid for the preparation of and disseminated numerous virtually identical lawn signs (but with a disclaimer), likewise urging voters to elect him. Overall, the record contains substantial evidence that Hutchinson disseminated the lawn signs for the purpose of influencing voting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hutchinson next argues that small signs stating only a candidate's name and the office he seeks are exempt from the disclaimer requirement because their origin is apparent, bringing them within the scope of the exemption for \"items that are clearly being distributed by the candidate.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04, subd. 3(a). This argument\n   is unavailing. A lawn sign urging readers to vote for a political candidate is not connected to the candidate's person in any way; anyone could independently declare support for a candidate by placing a sign in public view. In this way, a lawn sign is unlike those items listed as examples in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04, subd. 3(a), which, by their nature, identify their origin-\"fund-raising tickets, business cards, [and] personal letters.\" The record supports the OAH's determination that Hutchinson's lawn signs were not clearly distributed by him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Like any other political candidate, Hutchinson was required to include a disclaimer to inform the public that he and his campaign committee-not some political action committee, lobbying group, or private citizen-prepared and disseminated the lawn signs promoting his candidacy. Because he failed to do so with respect to the two signs at issue here, the record supports the determination that he violated Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 211B.04 's requirement that political candidates and campaign committees include a disclaimer on campaign materials that they prepare and disseminate does not violate the First Amendment. The complaint alleging a continuing violation of that requirement was timely, and substantial evidence supports the OAH's finding that Hutchinson violated the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Lewison also claimed violation of campaign contribution limits, Minn.
