Subsequent to the breach of the contract, in an action brought to dissolve said corporation, the defendant was duly appointed receiver of the property and effects of said corporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>It does not appear that the corporation has ever been dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">A motion to dismiss the complaint on the following ground, among others, was made and denied : \u2018 \u2018 That the receiver is not liable, being only temporary receiver; and. the company not being dissolved, action must be commenced against it.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\"><em>A.

The corporation was not dissolved, and a suit, against it could proceed to judgment (Knauer v. Globe Mutual Life Ins. Co., 46 <em>Super. Ct. </em>370).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The plaintiffs were authorized by the court that appointed the defendant receiver to commence this action. This was\u2019not a determination that the plaintiffs had a good cause of action against the defendant as receiver. The court, in granting leave to sue, was not called to, and did not pass upon the question of the receiver\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The judgment and order are reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. The order appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
