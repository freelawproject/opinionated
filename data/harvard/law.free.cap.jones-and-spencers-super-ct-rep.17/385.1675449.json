The petition also set forth other facts tending to support the charge of fraud; stated that defendants had remained in undisturbed possession till \u25a0September 1,1881, the time this action was begun; and finally prayed an inspection and discovery of any and all conveyance or conveyances in writing, and other instruments in writing upon which the plaintiff or its said attorney intends to rely, or which the plaintiff, or its said. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>attorney intends to produce on the trial of this action for the purpose of proving or establishing the title of the plaintiff or its interest in or its right to the possession of the property mentioned in the amended complaint herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">The affidavits in opposition verified by plaintiff\u2019s attorney denied possession or knowledge of such papers by him, and also denied generally the allegations of fraud in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The motion was denied on the authority of Andrews <em>v. </em>Townshend (48 <em>Super.

The order should be granted when in the exercise of discretion the court deems such discovery proper (Powers <em>v. </em>Elmendorf, 4 <em>How. </em>61; <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 807, 803, 806; 2 <em>R. S. </em>199, \u00a7 21; 3 Ed. p. 262). \u201cAs the object of this jurisdiction in cases of bills of discovery is to assist and promote the administration of public justice in-.other courts, they are greatly favored in equity \u201d (2 <em>Story Eq. </em>\u00a7 1488).</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-8\">Andrews <em>v. </em>Townshend, a case of ejectment, is not an authority against the motion. We set up a general scheme of fraud that antedates the suit itself, which is a part of the fraud, and one of the fraudulent acts was making fraudulent and merely colorable conveyances to hinder and delay creditors. That the allegations of fraud will sustain the motion, see Brevoort <em>v. </em>Warner, 8 <em>How. </em>326; Apthorpe <em>v. </em>Comstock, <em>Hop. </em>149; 8 <em>Cow. </em>386, 1 <em>Dan. Ch. Pl. Pr. </em>Perkins\u2019 <em>Ed. </em>[4 ed. 579], 632. Where either party shows conclusively that the evidence sought is material to his case, their right to a discovery is not affected by the fact that it is also material to the case of the adverse party (Riccard v. Inclosure Comm., 4 <em>Ell. &amp; Bl. </em>329; London Gas Light Co. <em>v. </em>Chelsea, 6 <em>C. B. U. S. </em>411). Sections 1490-1493, 2 <em>Story Eq. Jur., </em>show the application of the rule as to production of title papers, and that it has primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>reference to questions of title to land between heir and devisee and the like (1 <em>Sand. Ch. </em>98, <em>supra), </em>and that the rule, even in such cases, is not sweeping or inflexible. And see <em>Story Eq. Pl., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 591-594; Harris, J., in Powers <em>v. </em>Elmendorf (4 <em>How. Pr. </em>61 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-5\">That the court will assume that the papers can be produced, and that defendant is entitled to an inspection. See Lefferts <em>v. </em>Brampton (supra); Hepburn <em>n. </em>Archer, (20 <em>Hun, </em>537); Amsinck <em>v. </em>Northrup (12 <em>Week. Dig. </em>573); Thompson v<em>. </em>The Erie Railway Co.

S. </em>199; Townsend <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 9 <em>Wend. </em>458). One of the rules there was that the discovery must relate to the title of the party seeking the discovery, and the evidence must be for him and not as to the title of the opposite party <em>(Story's Eq. Pl. </em>\u00a7 317; also, note 2, p. 258; <em>Cooper Pl. </em>58, <em>197; Mitford Pl. </em>189).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-7\">This rule also applies to proceedings under the Code (Brevoort <em>v. </em>Warner, 8 <em>How. </em>321; Davis <em>v. </em>Dunham, 13 <em>How. </em>428; Commercial Bank of Albany <em>v. </em>Dunham, 13 <em>Id. </em>545; Pegram <em>v. </em>Carson, 18 <em>How. </em>522; Strong <em>v. </em>Strong, 1 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>233; Andrews <em>v. </em>Townshend, 48 <em>Super. Ct. </em>162; 2 <em>Wait's Pr. </em>531).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-8\">The law does not authorize a discovery as a precautionary measure or to enable a party to prepare to answer his adversary\u2019s case. It must appear to be necessary (Woods <em>v. </em>Figarine, 25 <em>How. </em>528; Campbell <em>v. </em>Hoye, <em>2 Hun, </em>309; Holtz <em>v. </em>Schmidt, 2 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>28-31).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-9\">The existence of the papers must be shown positively, and that they are material and contain material evidence (Speyers <em>v. </em>Forstitch, 5 <em>Rob. </em>606; Walker <em>v. </em>Granite Bank, 4 <em>Barb. </em>39; 19 <em>Abb. </em>111; Harison <em>v. </em>Vanvalkenburgh, 5 <em>Pun, </em>454; Mott <em>v. </em>Consumers\u2019 Ice Co., <em>2 Abb. N. C. </em>144).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARq\">\u2014Upon an application for a bill of discovery the rule in chancery was; that the plaintiff might have a discovery of matters necessary to maintain his own title, as for example, deeds under which he claimed. But he was not entitled to have a discovery of the title of his adversary from whom he sought the discovery and whose title he denied. It was only when the plaintiff was entitled to a discovery of deeds or documents for the purpose of establishing his own case, that his right to such discovery was held to be not affected by the circumstance that the same deeds or documents were also evidence of the defendants\u2019 case. These principles have not been abrogated or changed by the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In the case at bar, the applicant did not bring himself within the exception, for the allegations and the prayer of his petition show, that all he wanted was to discover and inspect conveyances and instruments in writing which he could not specify, which he- did not even know to exist, but which he suspected the plaintiff might produce on the trial for. the purpose of establishing its title to, or its interest in, or right to the possession of, the property mentioned in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Th\u00f3 order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and O\u2019Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
