I do not think that such an objection could be taken at the trial where the court has jurisdiction of the cause of action and the persons of the parties. A failure to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for an infant plaintiff, is-simply an irregularity, and such an omission does not deprive the court of jurisdiction (Rutter y. Puckhover, 9 <em>Bosw. </em>638). In this case the court appointed a guardian, and having jurisdiction to make such an appointment, it cannot be questioned collaterally, but only by a motion to set aside such an appointment as irregular\". It appears that such a motion was made and denied and from the order denying it no appeal was taken. This I think concluded the parties here as to any alleged irregularity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-8\">\u201cThe appellant also moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not appear in evidence that no other settlement had been made for the children of the testator. The will of deceased gave to the defendant all his real and personal property, of whatever nature or kind of which he was possessed, at the time of his death. It was alleged in the complaint, and it appears by the evidence, that the defendant had taken possession of all the assets and property left by the deceased, and there were no allegations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the pleadings, and no evidence offered at the trial, that the plaintiffs were provided for by any settlement. This I think is sufficient to bring the case within the statute. The will was made several years before the plaintiffs were born; it gave all the property of the deceased to his wife; on the1 death of the testator the wife took possession of all the property and assets of the deceased ; and the infants were at the time of the testator\u2019s death under the age of fourteen years. These facts are entirely inconsistent with the idea that the testator had provided by any settlement for the plaintiffs, and were I think sufficient to put the defendants to the proof of such a provision by settlement if one had. been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">\u201cThe real estate of the testator therefore, descended to the plaintiffs, and they were entitled to the same share of the personal property as if the testator had died intestate (Smith <em>v. </em>Robertson, 89 <em>JV. T. 555).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">\u201c The fact that at the time of the execution of the will in question, the defendant made a will leaving all her property to the testator, does not of itself make the wills mutual wills. In order to make a mutual will the instrument, or instruments, must be executed by both parties under an agreement to make such a disposition of the property of each, that the survivor will be entitled to the property of the one first dying, or the disposition of the property must be in the instrument executed by both of the parties. There is no evidence in this case that the defendant made her will under any such agreement or understanding, or in fact that the testator ever knew that she had made a will in his. favor, except the fact that he signed the defendant\u2019s will as a witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">\u2018\u2018The evidence was not sufficient to establish a gift of the $18,800 of United States bonds by the testator to the defendants; the most that can be said is that there was some evidence from which such a gift might have been, found. The burden of proving a gift is on the party alleging it, and the mere manual possession of a deceased husband\u2019s property by his widow is not <em>prima facie </em>evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>deuce of a change of title to her (Conklin <em>v. </em>Conklin, 20 <em>Hun, </em>278).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">\u201c The exclusion of the examinations of the defendant taken before trial, was not error. The defendant had been examined on her own behalf, the plaintiff had then rested their case on rebuttal, and it was within the discretion of the trial court whether to allow the defendant to be recalled or not, and under the circumstances, I do not think that there was such an abuse of that discretion as would justify a reversal. Under any circumstance no harm could come to the defendant, as after the rejection of the evidence, the court allowed her to be recalled and testify.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-6\"><em>William C.
