J., and O\u2019Gorman, J.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b434-9\"><em>Decided December </em>3, 1883.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-10\">Exceptions taken by plaintiff heard in the first instance at general term. The complaint alleged, that while a train of cars and a locomotive belonging to defendant were passing, \u201c the defendant carelessly and negligently allowed sparks of fire to escape from its said locomotive, which sparks entered the dwelling-house occupied by the plaintiff, thereby setting fire to the curtains, furniture and property of the plaintiff; that in his efforts to extinguish said five the plaintiff\u2019s left hand without any negligence on his pavt was sevevely burned, and the plaintiff thereby suffered, and still suffers, etc.\u201d The complaint contained no demand of damages to property and on the trial, counsel for plaintiff, in opening the case, stated that no claim was made for damage to property, it having been insured ; that the case was founded upon the injury to plaintiff\u2019s hand sustained in the course of his endeavor to extinguish the fire communicated to the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-11\">The counsel for defendant then moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the damage was too remote. The motion was granted, and the plaintiff\u2019s exception to this ruling was directed to be heard, in first instance at general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AO1\"><em>Smith, Allen &amp; Smith, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABh\">\u2014The complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action (Rexter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>v. Starin, 73 N. <em>Y. </em>601). It was not the necessary result of plaintiff\u2019s efforts to extinguish the fire that his hand should be burned. As in Rexter <em>v. </em>Starin, \u201c it was for the jury to determine whether the act of plaintiff was a prudent and proper one.\u201d There is nothing in Eckert <em>v. </em>L. I. R. R. Co. (43 N. <em>Y. 502), </em>in conflict with these views.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">' The damages were not too remote. It was the defendant\u2019s negligence that put the plaintiff in a position in which he was forced to make so perilous a choice, and the defendant is liable for the consequences (Coulter v. Am. M. Un. Express Co., <em>5 Lans. </em>68; Buel v. New York Cent. R. R. Co., 31 N. <em>Y. </em>319). If the plaintiff was injured by acting precipitately and under excitement, which precipitation and excitement were caused by the negligent act of the defendant, he can recover (Vanderburgh v. Truax 4 <em>Den. </em>464; Scott v. Sheperd, 1 <em>Smith's L. C. </em>5th [Am. Ed.] 549).</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">It was plaintiff\u2019s duty to act as he did. If the plaintiff had made no efforts to extinguish the fire and to prevent damage therefrom, and was in a position so to do, he could not have recovered damage for the destruction of his property <em>(Wharton Neg. </em>\u00a7 877; Ill. Cen. R. R. Co. v. McClelland, 42 <em>Ill. </em>355; Ward v. St. P. R. R., 29 <em>Wis. </em>144).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-7\"><em>Deyo, Duer, &amp; Bauerdorf, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajmy\">\u2014For a person engaged in his ordinary affairs or in the mere protection of property, knowingly and voluntarily to place himself in a position where he is liable to receive a serious injury, is negligence which will preclude a recovery for an injury so received. But when the exposure is for the purpose of saving life, it is not wrongful, and therefore not negligent, unless such is to be regarded either rash or reckless (Eckert v. L. I. R. R. Co., 43 N. <em>Y. </em>402). Rexter v. Starin (73 N. <em>Y. 502) </em>is not in conflict with the Eckert case. Plaintiff\u2019s injury was due to his voluntary act, and that the negligence was not the <em>causa causans </em>of the injury to his hands, and consequently is too remote to enable him to recover, see Ryan v. N. Y. Central, 35 N. <em>Y. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>210; Tonawanda R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Munger, <em>5 Den. </em>255; People <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc., <em>5 Lans. 524.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AxY\">\u2014The ancient rule that the allegations of a pleading are to be taken as stating the most favorable jjossible case for the pleader, and therefore that a fact, necessary to the cause of action, is not to be considered as-existing if-it be not alleged, must be applied in the present case. There being essential- omissions, no liberality in construing what appears, would cure the. defect. The-plaintiff alleges, \u201c that in his efforts to extinguish said fire the plaintiff\u2019s left hand, without any negligence on his-part was severely burned.\u201d There is no allegation that at the time he made the effort to extinguish the fire, the fire was spreading to other property than that actually burned, or that there was an appearance of the fire endangering life or other property, or that the effort was made for the purpose of preventing the fire imperiling life or other .property or causing further damage. From the pleading it is to be understood, that the facts of the case would not justify such allegation. It is to be taken that the fire was of a kind that did not threaten injury to person or further-damage, and that the evidence would so show. In the-latter case the party guilty of the negligence is not deemed to be responsible because the negligent act, it is deemed was not the proximate cause of the effort to extinguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The allegation that the effort to extinguish was without negligence on his part does -not increase the scope of the pleading, for this averment being equivalent to alleging that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the damage, avails nothing, unless beyond it the pleading adequately states that the negligence was the cause of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">For these reasons the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled, defendant to enter judgment with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
