Mr. Prague-was merely the architect of the defendant. There is no evidence in the case,- that he was employed by the company at all, except to make the plans for the buildings and see that the plans were carried out, or had any authority to* bind them in any way; and no declarations of his are admissible as against the defendant. An agency cannot be created by the representations of an assumed agent (Marvin u. Wilbur, 52 <em>N. 7. </em>270) and the admission of such representative without subsequently showing that the party making them, was agent of the company, or connecting' the company in any way with the conversation, is error. . (Snook <em>v. </em>Lord, 56 <em>N. T. </em>605). The alleged admission of Mr. Mehrbach at a subsequent interview that he had sent Mr. Prague to the plaintiffs to have them go on and do the roofing, does not make the evidence competent. No-authority to the president to either make the contract or-to bind the defendant by admissions, was proved, and the \" defendant could not be bound by his declarations made-after the transaction in question (First National Bank tu \u25a0jOcean National Bank, 60 <em>N. T. </em>278).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>James A. </em>Hudson, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-5\"><em>Austin G. </em>Fox, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Opinion by Ingraham, J. ; Sedgwick, Ch.
