Mittnacht to recover the possession of a certain safe, keys, &amp;c., or their value; in that action the defendant was arrested for eloigning the property, and gave an undertaking upon arrest, his bail being the defendants in this action. Said action was tried and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff Lewis Beckel; execution was duly issued therein and returned unsatisfied. The said judgment was thereafter assigned to this plaintiff, together with the undertaking upon arrest above referred to, and this action upon the undertaking was then brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">The plaintiff was the attorney for the plaintiff in the case of Beckel <em>v. </em>Mittnacht, and took the assignment to protect a lien on the judgment in that action, in which the undertaking in suit was given and in payment for services rendered by him therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-7\"><em>Christopher </em>Fine, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-8\"><em>Goff &amp; Pollock, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b261-9\">By the Court.-\u2014O\u2019Gorman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjF\">\u2014This case was tried before Judge Freedman and a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The chief question discussed was whether an attorney, having obtained a judgment in favor of his client, who was plaintiff in an action of replevin, upon which judgment he had a lien for his professional services, can, on the assignment of such judgment to him, succeed in an action in his own name against the sureties of the defendants in such action of replevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">There is no legal objection to an attorney taking an assignment of a judgment in favor of his client in payment of any debt due to him by said client; and becoming thus the lawful owner of the judgment (Coughlin <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. <em>&amp; </em>H. R. R. R., 71 <em>N.
