T. Russell &amp; Co., agents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">\u201cThis should be read as if the \u2018cable authority\u2019 were-annexed to the charter party. It would thus unmistakably appear that the defendants were included as the principals of the one part, who executed it by C. T. Russell <em>&amp; </em>Co., as their agents. The instrument commences thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\">\u2018 Liverpool, 29th Aug., 1877. It is this day mutually agreed, between Messrs. Adamson &amp; Short, procuring of the good ship or vessel called the \u201cEgbert,\u201d ... of the one part, and J. W. Elwell <em>&amp; </em>Co., of New York, and C. T. Russell <em>&amp; </em>Co., of Liverpool, agents, merchants and charterers, of the other part.\u2019 Assuming that this instrument should be read as if the character \u2018&amp;\u2019 was not written between the names of the defendants and the names of C. T. Russell <em>&amp; </em>Co., then a very natural construction of it would be that id states \u2018 J. W. Elwell &amp;Co.\u2019 to be the party \u2018 of the other part,\u2019 and C. T. Russell <em>&amp; </em>Co. to be acting as their agents. If it is to be read with the character. \u2018 <em>&amp; </em>\u2019 in it, then it describes the party of the second or \u2018 other part \u2019 to be J. W. Elwell <em>&amp; Go., </em>and C. T. Russell &amp; Co., agents. Even thus read, it is not a forced construction to regard the word \u2018 agents \u2019 as applying only to C. T. Russell &amp; Co. They signed as \u2018agents\u2019 of J. W. Elwell <em>&amp; </em>Co., by virtue of authority to do so, conferred on them by cablegram from J. W. Elwell &amp; Co. The words <em>\u2019\u25a0merchant </em>\u2019 and \u2018 charterer1 are <em>printed </em>on the blank form here used. The blank form thus used being filled up and leaving these printed words in it, would describe any charterer as \u2018 merchant \u2019 and \u2018 charterer,\u2019 whatever his occupation might be. If it can be held that C. T. Russell &amp; Co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>have so executed the charter party as to make them joint principals with the defendants as charterers, the objection appears on the face of the complaint, as a copy of the instrument is made part of it. The omission to demur to the complaint waives such a defect of parties.
