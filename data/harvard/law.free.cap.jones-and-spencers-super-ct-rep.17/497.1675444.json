The plaintiff of whom as a witness these questions had been asked, did not testify that he sold these bricks after their non-acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>by the defendant, but that he had made deliveries of them under contracts already made with other parties. The defendant was not permitted to show what prices he would receive under these contracts. This was correct, for admitting that the prices were higher in those contracts-than in this, the plaintiff would be damaged by the breach of this, inasmuch as they would be entitled to the benefits of the performance of all the contracts. There would be indeed a question as to whether the plaintiff could have performed the other contracts, unless they used the bricks they were to deliver under the present contract. This was not presented upon the trial, to the referee, or in any way brought to the attention of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-5\"><em>Lindsay &amp; </em>McAdam, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-6\"><em>Cozans &amp; </em>Shepard, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Opinion by Sedgwick, Ch.
