As a first cause of action plaintiff stated her title to be that of an heir at law of the former owner. As a second cause of action, she states her title to be that of devisee of the former owner. The statements in other respects, as to the cause of action, are' similar, and are sufficient in' such an action. The motion was to strike out, as irrelevant or redundant, the statement of the sources of title, and to compel the plaintiff make a statement of a single cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-12\">The court at General Term, said: \u201cThe appellant is not aggrieved by the order below, for his preparation for trial would necessarily be the same, whether the amendments demanded were or were not made. He, if the superfluous matter were stricken out, would be forced to be prepared for any title the plaintiff might rest on, as heir or as devisee. The duplication of the causes of action does not lead to confusion or obscurity or additional labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-13\">\u201c The order must be affirmed, but, as the pleading in. the complaint is unusual- and naturally led to the motion,; without costs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-14\"><em>G.
