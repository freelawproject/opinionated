Y. </em>313, 319). This is so whether the defendant has transferred the note or not (Thayer <em>v. </em>Manley, 73 N. <em>Y. 305, </em>308). The allegation that the defendants converted and disposed of the bonds to their own use is sufficient (Decker <em>v. </em>Mathews; Thayer <em>v. </em>Manley, <em>supra). </em>And it is not necessary to prove that the defendants actually appropriated the proceeds to his own use, or derived any benefit from the use of the bonds (Reynolds <em>v. </em>Shuler, <em>5 Cow. </em>323; Connah <em>v. </em>Hale, 23 <em>Wend. </em>462; Murray <em>v. </em>Burling, 10 <em>Johns. </em>172; Bristol <em>v. </em>Burt, 7 <em>Id. </em>254). The conversion was complete at the moment of the unlawful delivery of the bonds to the defendant Fellows, by the consent of the defendant Mehrbach. The action is sustained by showing possession in the plaintiff and the wrongful delivery by the direction or assent of the defendant Mehrbach (Cases cited <em>supra; </em>Ely <em>v. </em>Ehle, 3 N. <em>Y. </em>509). Nor is a wrongful intent an essential element of the conversion (Boyce <em>v. </em>Brockway, 31 N. <em>Y. </em>490, 493; Poucher <em>v. </em>Blanchard, 86 <em>Id. </em>256). The delivery of the seven bonds to the defendant Fellows was unauthorized. But, whatever might have been implied frq&gt;m the alleged custom of the president to pledge the company\u2019s bonds at his discretion, in order to raise money for the company, still, in regard to the bonds in question, he was controlled by an express resolution of the board of directors to sell the bonds, and a violation of that instruction was a conversion (Laverty <em>v. </em>Snethen, 68 N. <em>Y. 522).</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-7\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvK\">\u2014The action was for damages for the conversion of what were called in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>complaint, bonds. The instruments, seven in number, were in the form of bonds, signed and sealed by the proper officers of the plaintiff, but had not been delivered. While they were in this condition, the defendant, who was president of the plaintiff, loaned them to one Fellows. Fellows had subscribed for twenty-five of the same kind of bonds, had received them, but had not paid the price of them in full. The purpose of the loan was to enable Fellows to raise money with which to pay for the twenty-five bonds in full. This was conversion by the defendant. It was an appropriation by the defendant to himself of the property of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">It was claimed on the trial that the proof showed that the loan of the seven bonds to Fellows was authorized by the plaintiff in general powers that had been conferred by them on defendant, and also that this special transaction had been ratified by the plaintiff. There was no testimony tending to show any ratification. As to the claim of authority under general power, it is not necessary to ascertain what general powers the defendant had, for his powers as to bonds like those in question were the subject of specific authorization by resolution. That resolution conferred on him authority to sell at a certain price. There was no proof that this resolution had become in any way inoperative or unobserved by tacit consent. The loaning to Fellows was not a sale. It was not a transaction, the object of which was a return of money for the loan. It was solely for the benefit of Fellows, to enable him to pay the subscription price of the twenty-five bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">There was no error in the proceedings on the trial, and the court was right in directing a verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Truax and Ingraham, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
