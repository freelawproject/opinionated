HAZEWELL, Appellant, <em>v. </em>GERSHON H. COURSEN, Respondent.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\"><em>Judge's charge\u2014that plaintiff must maintain his case by </em>\u201c <em>uncontradicted evidence \"\u2014when not deemed error\u25a0\u2014when specific objection to must be made.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b506-6\">Before Sedgwick, Ch. J., Freedman and Russell, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b506-7\"><em>Decided December </em>30, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">Appeal by plaintiff from judgment dismissing complaint with costs entered upon a verdict, in favor of defendant, and also from an order denying her motion, upon the minutes for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">Action to recover damages for the alleged conversion by the defendant of a contract for the sale and purchase of lands. The trial judge charged that \u201c the burden of proving the plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the plaintiff and she must establish that fact, by a preponderance of uncontradicted evidence,\u201d to which plaintiff excepted generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-10\">The court at General Term said, \u201c To sustain the exception, we must suppose that the judge conveyed the notion that if the case for the plaintiff were opposed by oral testimony or by circumstances or inferences, that the plaintiff could not in any event recover. This ground could not be taken, without it also being true, that the defendant\u2019s case should not be sustained by the jury, if it were opposed in like manner. The result would be, that the judge would be of the opinion that neither party was entitled to a verdict on the merits of the respective cases, for certainly each was contradicted, in a narrow sense by the other. It is impossible to imagine that the counsel or jury took this to be the judge\u2019s meaning or opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-11\">\u201c On the whole, it seems to me that it is a case where the general purport of the charge was correct and that inadvertently a phrase was used in a peculiar way.. A general exception was therefore not valid and did not call the attention of the court to the very point that is now taken. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>On such a point to make a valid exception, it should be necessary to state it specifically to the court.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AY0\"><em>Luther R. Marsh, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>John E. Burrill, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Opinion by Sedgwick, Ch.
