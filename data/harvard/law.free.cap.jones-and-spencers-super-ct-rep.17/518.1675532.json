Pro. \u00a7 1069). The jury found single damages, which were reduced as excessive by order of the j udge, and by the same' order the reduced amount was trebled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-11\">It appeared that the defendant was guilty of the forcible <em>entry, </em>and that he detained the premises from the plaintiff for the space of about five months. The complaint claimed as damages in part, the value of the use and occupation'for the five months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-12\">The court at General Term said : \u201c It is a mistake to suppose that the claim was for the use and occupation by the defendant as upon a letting. It was upon the value to the plaintiff of the use and occupation if he had.not been prevented from disposing of it by the defendant. There was nothing incorrect in the court charging that the jury in estimating the value referred to might consider what it would be for thc| five months, if the plaintiff could rent it for one year, including the five months. The power of the plaintiff to use, the occupation for five months in such a way, affected the actual value, to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-13\">\u201c The appelMnt\u2019s counsel argue, that the court had no power to treble the damages, because the complaint contained a claim for damages that could not be recovered in an action for forcible entry. It is true that the complaint did make such a claim, but there was no recovery upon it. and the present case, being a part of the record, this ap-; pears upon the .record.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>Henderson &amp; Tompkins, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-5\"><em>John </em>Townshend, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Opinion Per Curiam.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Jndgment affirmed with costs, and order affirmed with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
