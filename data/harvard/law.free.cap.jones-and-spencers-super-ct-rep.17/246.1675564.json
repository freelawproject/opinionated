B. Deady surrendered to the defendant the said certificate which had been given to him for safe keeping by the plaintiff and received in the-place of it a certificate in which one Emma L. Deady, was designated as the person to whom the money should be paid. The said certificate was surrendered without the-knowledge or consent of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-6\"><em>John Callahan </em>and <em>James </em>Flynn, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgP\">\u2014By the provisions of its. constitution and by-laws, and by the-act under which it is organized, the defendant had full power and authority to make the contract or agreement set forth in the complaint (Gunlach <em>v. </em>Germania Mec. Asso., 4 <em>Hun, </em>339). Mr. Deady gave to the plaintiff that contract containing the provision making her the beneficiary; he-could not thereafter surrender, cancel or change its effect without her consent (Lemon <em>v. </em>Ph\u0153nix Mutual Life Ins. Co., 38 <em>Conn. </em>294; Whitehead <em>v. </em>New York Life Ins. Co., 63 <em>How. </em>394; <em>Bliss on Ins. </em>\u00a7 339 [2d ed.]). The case of Durian <em>v. </em>Central Verein (7 Daly, 168), is not adverse to-this view. The question there was as to the effect of a. change made in the constitution of the society. In this-case Mr. Deady, under the express provisions of the constitution and by-laws of the assciation, designated his mother as the beneficiary, and gave to her the contract or agree- \u2018 ment making her such, thus placing in her hands and beyond his own control the means of enforcing her claim to-the money.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-7\"><em>Carlisle </em>Norwood, Jr., for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aua\">\u2014The allegation of incorporation establishes that the defendant is not a life-insurance company. The act under which it was founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>is entitled \u201cAn act for the incorporation of benevolent, charitable, and scientific and missionary societies\u201d <em>(L. </em>1848, c. 319, 2 <em>R. S. </em>[7th ed.], 1701). A reference to the act (\u00a7 1), will show for what purposes corporations may be formed under it. The character of this corporation, as shown in the complaint, is an association for benevolent purposes. Such a corporation cannot issue a policy of insurance, and its certificate is only a certificate of membership, containing an acknowledgment on the association\u2019s part, that it has received notice of the designation by the member of a person who is to be the recipient of its benevolence on the death of such member (Durian <em>v. </em>The Central Verein, &amp;c., 7 <em>Daly, </em>169). The further provisions of the act so expressly restrict, corporations formed, that any contract in the nature of a policy of life insurance would be <em>ultra vires. </em>The act provides : \u201cEvery corporation formed under this act shall possess the powers and be subject to the provisions and restrictions contained in the 3d title of the 18th chap, of the first part of the R. S.\u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>[7th ed.] \u00a7 9, p. 1703). The provisions and restrictions referred to contain the following: \u201c \u00a7 3. In addition to the powers enumerated in the first section of this title, and to those expressly given in the charter or in the act under which it is or shall be incorporated, no corporation shall possess or exercise any corporate powers, except such as shall be necessary to the exercise of the powers so enumerated and given\u201d (2 R. S. [7th ed.] p. 1531). It was perfectly competent for the defendant and Richard Deady to modify their original agreement and make any agreement satisfactory to both, and within the corporate powers of defendant (Durian <em>v. </em>The Central Verein, &amp;c., 7 <em>Daly, </em>168, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-5\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL5\">\u2014The complaint set out the by-law under which the certificate in question was made, in the following words : \u201cthat any member might by written notice to the board of management designate to whom the sum due at the time of his death shall be paid.\u201d So far as the meaning of these words must be considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>view of the general intent of the statutes, and the peculiarities of the case it was meant for, I am of opinion that the by-law means a designation from time to time, and the power of designation is not exhausted by one designation. To hold that it would, would be contrary to the exigencies of the most of the clerks. Say, for instance, as in this case, a young man becomes a member, shall he wait until he is about to die before he makes the only designation he is entitled to, or is he right in saying,- I may die soon, .and so I name the person that I think the right one now ; but I may marry and have children, and then it will be right to name them.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">To me it is manifest that the certificate in question is not legally operative as a contract between the plaintiff and defendant. It has as one of its terms, implied if not expressed, the by-law that has been referred to. \"The defendant had no power to make any other contract than such as would be justified by the charter and by-laws. Such a contract would express the obligation of the defendant to the member to pay to the appointee as appointee. The present certificate is no further valid, than it. embodies evidence that the plaintiff was the appointee. The rights of the plaintiff are not greater than they would be if she never had had the certificate, but depended solely upon the fact that she had been designated to the bond. It is not a negotiable instrument, or mercantile obligation. No consideration is implied. There is no estoppel. The plaintiff did not pay value for it. Granting that the member has the power to make an appointment that shall be irrevocable between him and the appointee, <em>e. g., </em>because of some consideration paid, there is no presumption that such an arrangement was made in this case. As against a subsequent appointee, the burden of proof would be on a prior appointee.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">For these reasons, I am of opinion that on the case as made, the defendants were not bound to pay the amount of the certificate to the plaintiff, and that defendants\u2019 exception should be sustained, the verdict set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Truax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
