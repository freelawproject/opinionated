The plaintiff claimed judgment in the sum of $9,861.43., for money, which she alleged she deposited with them as bankers. The defendants that she deposited the money with them as brokers, as a margin for speculations, and that it was wholly applied by her authority to meet losses by her in those speculations, and that the speculations were made for her by her authority ; and they set up a counter-claim of $2,030.70, for losses not covered by the margin. On the motion by defendant for a reference, it appeared that if the transactions in stock were on her account, it was because she had directed them through her husband as her agent, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the one who, in fact, gave defendants order and directions. To-meet the motion, among other objections, the plaintiff offered a stipulation which was recited in the order after-wards made and filed with the papers. It was: \u201cThe plaintiff hereby stipulates that if this case is tried before a jury, and the jury or the court decide that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was authorized as her agent, to purchase and sell stocks and securities upon a margin in her name, with her money, on deposit with the defendants, that she will not dispute any of the items of the account annexed to defendants answer, but will admit that said account is in all respects correct.\u201d The account contained more than two hundred items.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">The motion was denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-6\"><em>Henry A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArA\">\u2014I am of opinion that it was within the power of the court below to grant \u25a0the motion, because the matters to which the account set up in the answer pertained, were directly involved in the defense and counter-claim, and were not collateral to the issue or details of evidence only ; and that it was within the discretion of the court to deny the motion, if the stipulation offered by plaintiff would render an accounting before a jury unnecessary. There seems to me to be no doubt, that if the evidence the defendant might produce to show that the plaintiff gave authority to her husband to give' orders, etc., to the defendants for her, would be applicable to the matters of account <em>in </em>solido, there should be <em>no </em>reference. Further, there should be no reference, if the defense be upon <em>an </em>account stated, but no decision as to this is made, one way <em>or </em>the other..</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">. The defense claims, however, that on the trial, the defendants may be, able to show that plaintiff\u2019s husband was her agent as to some matters in account, but not as to others, and that the stipulation will not cover the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the jury being obliged to take the whole account, and to make up a new account that excludes those particulars as to which sufficient proof of agency was not given. As to this, perhaps it might be right to think that the defendant should not affect the action of the court-upon a possibility, as suggested by them, of a partial failure of proof on. their part. But beyond this, while the application of the stipulation may be what it is argued to be by the defendants, yet, on the facts of this case, as shown by its intrinsic nature and the affidavits read, it is not probable that the defendants will, in fact, meet on the trial the danger they fear. To entirely prevent an unforeseen contingency happening, which it may be too late to remedy, a modification of the order should be made, by properly inserting \u201cwithout prejudice to the court upon the trial directing a-reference on motion of defendants, if a reference then appears to be necessary or proper.\u201d The order made below does not state that it was made because the court had no power to order a reference. The defendants should, therefore, pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Order modified as directed, and affirmed as modified, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
