That agreement provided that defendant should pay to plaintiff one half of the profits accruing from sales of merchandise by plaintiff, for account of defendant, during the year 1881; and that the defendant should advance on account of said profits $200, at the end of each month\u2014$100 to be applied in payment of his traveling expenses. It was also agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>should half the profits not equal the amount above stated, there should be no charge by defendant' against plaintiff. Defendant claimed that under that contract, plaintiff was entitled to $100 per month, and traveling, and other expenses. The judge at the trial held that the plaintiff was entitled to the $200 per month, and directed a verdict accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\">The court at General Term said: \u201c I am of the opinion that the construction of the contract by the trial court was right. The defendant agreed to advance, not $100 per month and expenses, but $200 per month. That obligation was absolute ; it did not depend on the amount of the profits or On any other contingency ; and at the end of each month plaintiff was entitled to receive the advance of $200. The complaint alleges that said sum was not paid, and that the answer admits. There is nothing inconsistent with this obligation in the fact that plaintiff was to render a detailed account of his expenses. The obligation still remained, and on his performing his part of the agreement, he was-\u25a0entitled to enforce such obligation.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-5\"><em>Stern &amp; </em>Myer, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-6\"><em>Edward Kempter, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Opinion by Ingraham, J.; Sedgwick,.
