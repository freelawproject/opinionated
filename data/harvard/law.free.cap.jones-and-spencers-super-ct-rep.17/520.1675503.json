The complaint alleged that the defendant was the owner of stock to an amount specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-17\">The answer alleged that bef\u00f3re the judgment referred to Lwas obtained, the capital stock of the company was dimin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ishecL to one-tenth-of the original amount. The order below struck out as irrelevant, the words that constituted this allegation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">The court at General Term, said : \u2018 \u2018 This was erroneous. The answer had controverted the averment of the complaint, as to the amount of stock owned by the defendant, and had alleged that the amount was one hundred shares, and no more. The defendant had a right to take the position that the number of shares which might be the basis of his responsibility was to be determined in part, by the reduction of the original amount of the capital. This position was not irrelevant to the issue referred to, and even if not well taken as a defense, or part of a defense, should not have been stricken out, so that the defendant could not use it in the trial of the issues. The order should be reversed so far as it struck out the matter that has been examined.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">The order also struck out as irrelevant, allegations that a permanent receiver of the property of the company had been appointed, who had entered upon his trust and had taken possession of all the property of the company, and had never been discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">The court at General Term, said : \u201c This is not pleaded as a separate defense and is not relevant to any defense pleaded, or to any that can be suggested as possible. It would not be received as evidence upon any issue that might be made upon the trial. The order was correct in this respect.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-8\"><em>T. H.
