Appellants claimed that the objection that the subscription for the bonds of said railway company was beyond the powers of the bank, was not open to Jones or Ms executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">No money was paid out by plaintiff and no loss was incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">The court at General Term distinguished Pratt <em>v. </em>Short (79 <em>N. Y. </em>437), in which a deposit and savings institution had discounted a note payable to the order of defendant, the corporation being authorized by law to loan its capital and funds, but not on the security of commercial paper, and it was held that, although the security taken on the discount was void, the money loaned could be recovered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">The court at General Term, further, said: \u201cThis, however, is not the position of the case at bar. Here, the effort . of the plaintiff is to <em>enforce an illegal </em>contract, not to recover money paid under it, which the borrower is bound in equity to repay. There is no analogy between the cases.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-8\"><em>Martin &amp; Smith, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-9\"><em>Martin &amp; Keogh, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Opinion by O\u2019Gorman, J.; Ingraham, J., concurred in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
