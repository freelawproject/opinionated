It left him, until its promised performance, without the title or power or interests of owner. The expense, therefore, was not within the contemplation of the parties, at the time of making the contract. Nor was the expense an ordinary or anticipated consequence of the making of the contract. This amount should therefore be deducted from the amount of the verdict and the judgment should be modified in accordance. As modified the judgment should be affirmed without costs of the appeal to either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">\u201c As the jury gave the amount of the verdict directed as a formal matter it was within the power of the court after-wards to correct the error in the addition, that had been made at the time of the verdict. The order appealed from should be affirmed with $10 costs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-5\"><em>George H.
