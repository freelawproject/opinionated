The only writing signed by the defendant was a letter directed to the plaintiff, as follows: \u201cI to-day sold the lot to theQuintard Works and signed the contract for the same and received part of the money, hence that part is settled. I now propose to let the premises to you, as I described them, for five years at $1,800 per year, and with a privilege of five more, at $2,000, and will get it ready for occupancy on the 1st of April.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-13\">The court at General Term, said: \u201cThe only evidence that the proposition of this letter was ever accepted, which was necessary to the existence of the contract, was another letter written by the plaintiff, but this letter contained terms and further propositions which were not in the writing signed by defendant. There was therefore, no contract proven. The letter moreover could not be considered to be a contract inasmuch as it did not state what premises were to be leased. The letter alluded to them as premises 4 as I described them.\u2019 The reference was to a conversation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>This could not be used as a part of a contract which by statute must be wholly in writing (Wright <em>v. </em>Weeks, <em>25 N* Y. </em>153). . \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b554-4\"><em>E.
