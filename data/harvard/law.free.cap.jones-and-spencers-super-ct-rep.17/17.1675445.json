It then averred that said judgments were recovered against him \u201calthough the defendants were the principals in said transaction, and he was a mere broker and surety, under allegations and proof that he failed to disclose the defendants as his principals, all of which were at the defendants\u2019 request, and for their use.\u201d The complaint prayed judgment for $6,498.36, with interest from January 15, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">Only the defendant, Ulrich Simon, answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">By his answer he denied all the above allegations ; and alleged affirmatively that all the grain and merchandise which were purchased by defendants from plaintiff were so purchased from him as principal, and not as agent for Carlos Cobb or any other person; and also set up (among others), as affirmative defenses the statute of limitations and a release to him from Cobb of, and from all claims and demands arising out of the transactions in the complaint set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-8\">On the trial the plaintiff testified: \u201cI have been a grain broker since 1863. I know the firm of C. A. Steen <em>&amp; </em>Co. Its members were C. A. Steen, Simon Donau, and Ulrich Simon. Mr. Donau came to my office, and stated to me that they wished me to buy them a small quantity of wheat\u2014say two thousand five hundred or three thousand bushels\u2014and have it delivered to that distillery as soon as I could ; I did so that day; I bought three thousand and twenty-six bushels and eleven pounds of Mr. Carlos Cobb, and it was delivered by Mr. Cobb ; I ordered it of Mr. Cobb for this firm, I think, on October 23, 1868 ; I was to pay, I think, $1.62 a bushel; I had bought other grain for them about that time, aggregating, including this, somewhere in the neighborhood of $40,000 worth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-9\">Two witnesses gave evidence in corroboration of this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-10\">Defendant Simon was asked, \u201cYou knew Mr. Knapp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>bought this grain as a broker for your firm ? \u201d and answered, \u201c I can hardly tell how he bought it\u2014he charged brokerage. Yes sir.\u201d It appeared on the trial that the wheat was delivered to defendant; that about November 5, 1868, Cobb brought an action .against these defendants for $5,064.95, the value of said wheat, with certain charges, alleging a sale and delivery thereof to them through the plaintiff; that this action was settled as to defendant Simon, October 30, 1869, by his paying' his part of the whole claim, and a release was given him under the act, entitled an act for the relief of partners and joint debtors, passed April 18, 1838, which release contained the recital, \u201cWhereas the late copartnership of C.

Its value was derived from the oral testimony. Plaintiff testified as to it, \u201c I could not get the money ; they refused to pay. I called on them for the money, then I could not get the money, and I sued them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-8\">Defendant Simon testified, \u201che sued me for $39,000.

He testified :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-10\">\u201cMr. Ulrich Simon called me out of the court-room ; he said he wished to make a settlement, that he did not wish to have the matter go -further, and wanted to know what arrangement he could make with me; I said they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>settle if they wished to pay and make a very easy arrangement ; he said they could not do that, but that he and Mr. Donan would pay me fifty cents on the dollar of my claim ; I said, \u201c Will you then take charge of the Cobb claim\u2014bar that from me? ' Mr. Ulrich Simon said, \u201cYou never shall hear of that again ; that we will settle ourselves; you need never give yourself any uneasiness in regard to the Cobb matter, that we will settle then we agreed upon a basis of settlement, paying me fifty c^nts on the dollar, excluding the Cobb claim, which was deducted from the original amount, which was not settled then.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">One witness gave evidence in corroboration of this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">Defendant Simon testified : \u201cAt the time I settled with Knapp, he gave me distinctly to understand I had to settle the one with Cobb also.\u201d On his cross, the following questions were put and answers given. Q. \u201c You agreed to settle it ? A. I agreed to settle my portion. Q. And you say Mr. Knapp said you have got to settle that for yourself ? A. Yes, my portion. Q. Did he use the words \u2018 your portion ? \u2019 A. Yes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">Defendant Simon did settle with Cobb for his portion, as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">It further appeared, that in October, 1873, Cobb commenced an action against the plaintiff, alleging a sale and delivery of the wheat in question, by him to,the plaintiff ; that this plaintiff, for defense to that action, set up that he bought the wheat, as. broker, for C. S. Steen &amp; Co., and at the time disclosed his principals. In that action, Cobb recovered a judgment against this plaintiff for $5,554.30, being for costs of the action, and the price of the wheat and towage with interest, after crediting the amount as to which Steen had been released.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-9\">Plaintiff paid this judgment, January 16,1878. Defendants had no notice of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-10\">The judge charged the jury : \u201cIf in the transaction the plaihtiff acted as principal, and made a sale of the wheat to defendant, he - cannot recover in this action, because his claim is outlawed.\u201d (To this plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>If, on the other hand, he simply acted as broker in the transaction, then you have a further question to consider, and that is in respect to this release. Notwithstanding the release, if it was given by Cobb to the defendant, without the knowledge of the plaintiff, then plaintiff, having paid the money, can recover. On the other hand, if the plaintiff were present, or acquiesced in the agreement by which Simon was released, then the defendant is not liable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\">The jury rendered a verdict for defendant. A motion for a new trial was denied. From the judgment entered on the verdict, and the order denying the motion for a new trial, plaintiff appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-6\"><em>D. M. </em>Porter,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AKE\">attorney, and of counsel for appellant, on the questions considered in the opinion urged:\u2014(1.) Under the agreement whereby defendant undertook to protect plaintiff against the Cobb claim, the relation of the parties, whatever they may have been originally, became, as between them, that of principal and surety; the defendants becoming principal debtors to Cobb and the plaintiff surety for the defendant; the surety cannot recover of the principal until he has paid the debt. Therefore plaintiff\u2019s cause of action under the agreement did not accrue until he paid the debt, which was not until January, 1878, and consequently this action having been commenced April, 1878, it was not bar-, red by the statutes of limitations. Citing numerous authorities. (2.) Notice by plaintiff to Simon of the pendency of the Cobb suit was unnecessary (citing many authorities). (3.) This charge of the court, to wit: \u201cIf, in the transaction, the plaintiff acted as principal and made a sale of the wheat to the defendants, the plaintiff cannot recover in the present action,\u201d is erroneous, (&lt;x.) Because there is no evidence that he acted as principal, but the evidence is uncontradicted that he acted as broker. The complaint in the suit of Cobb <em>v. </em>Steen shows that Knapp was simply broker, and that suit was pending at the time of the settlement. Simon does not testify that Knapp sold as principal; the evidence is uncontradicted that Knapp bought as broker. Reed so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>testifies and also Knapp. Simon testifies : \u201cAs I stated he (Knapp) sued us for $39,000 ; there was $37,000 and odd for grain and $1,100 and odd for commission.\u201d (5.) Because under the agreement plaintiff was surety for the defendants, and as such having paid defendants\u2019 debt is entitled to recover against them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>Vanderpoel, Green &amp; </em>Cuming, attorneys, <em>A.

J.\u2014The</author>\n<p id=\"AfG\">complaint alleged that, in October, 1868, the defendants requested the plaintiff to purchase, as broker, for them certain wheat of Carlos Cobb, and that the plaintiff, as such broker, did buy for the defendants the wheat for $5,064; that in October, 1868, the defendants paid said Carlos Cobb $1,688, leaving the sum of $3,737 due, which the defendants never paid; that thereafter said Carlos Cpbb sued the plaintiff for the price and value of the wheat remaining unpaid and recovered judgment against him for the amount claimed ; \u201c that the said Cobb recovered the said judgments against this plaintiff, although the defendants herein were the principals in said transaction and the plaintiff was a mere broker and surety, under allegations and proof that the plaintiff failed to disclose the defendants as his principals, all of which was at the defendants\u2019 request and for their use.\u201d The testimony established the facts about to be stated. In agreement with the allegations of the complaint, the plaintiff as a witness swore that the defendants\u2019 firm requested him to buy the grain for them, and that on October 23, 1868, he ordered it of Mr. Cobb for the firm. The complaint, it has been seen, specifically states that he bought as a broker. The plaintiff gave no evidence to show that at any time down to January, 1878, he took the position, that he bought of Cobb apparently for himself but actually for defendants\u2019 firm as their broker, not disclosing the agency. For in addition to what has already been noticed, his answer in the action of Cobb against him alleged that the wheat was purchased of Cobb by him only as a broker for the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>defendants\u2019 firm, and that Cobb knew that the wheat was purchased only by him as a broker and for the benefit of that firm. The plaintiff verified this answer ^f ter October, 1873, five years after the wheat was bought.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Soon after the wheat was bought in October, 1868, the plaintiff took a position at variance with that shown by the complaint and the proof. He brought an action against the defendants\u2019 firm for the value or price of the wheat, as goods sold and delivered by him to them. If this were well founded, the fact asserted by the plaintiff must have been that he bought for himself of Cobb, and sold to the defendants\u2019 firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">* In this action last referred to, the plaintiff claimed to recover for other wheat sold by him to the defendant\u2019s firm, which, with the Cobb wheat, amounted in value to about $40,000. The learned counsel for appellant has argued that this form of complaint as to the Cobb wheat was, \u201cin other words alleging, in effect, that he had not disclosed the names of the buyers and sellers, and therefore brought suit as principal.\u201d This seemed to me conclusively negatived, by the train of considerations that has been adduced, ending in his sworn answer of October, 1873, that Cobb knew that he acted as broker for the defendants\u2019 firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">I wish now to notice, the effect of the action of Cobb against this plaintiff, upon the relation of the defendant to the transaction. It has been noticed that down to the time of the beginning of that action, plaintiff did not claim that he bought of Cobb as broker in fact, but not so informing Cobb. There is no testimony tending to show that the defendant or his firm, were informed or had any reason to believe, that the plaintiff had bought in that manner, or that Cobb claimed that he had. There is no proof that the defendant knew of the action by Cobb, its nature, its progress, or its result. He swears he did not, until after the judgment was paid by the plaintiff 1878. In the case it is admitted that he had no notice of the action, or the complaint of Cobb against the plaintiff simply charged him as purchaser. The answer alleged that the present plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>bought as broker of the present defendants\u2019 firm, and that Cobb so knew at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The present complaint avers that Cobb recovered judgment inethis action \u201cunder allegations and proof that the plaintiff failed to disclose the defendants or his principals.\u201d This averment was not proved. Cobb recovered from the plaintiff, on the purchase by him, he failing to prove that he bought as alleged in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">While the action of this plaintiff against defendants\u2019 firm was pending, another action, that of Cobb against defendants? firm was pending, and this the plaintiff' knew. Cobb alleged in his complaint, that he sold and delivered to the defendants\u2019 firm, through the present plaintiff as broket, the wheat in question. The complaint did not, and it was not necessary to allege, whether at the time of the sale, the present plaintiff announced his agency for defendants\u2019 firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The case does not show what was the answer of the defendants\u2019 firm to this complaint, nor does it show what was the answer of defendants\u2019 firm in the action of the present plaintiff against them. Although it may now be taken that there was an issue of fact in each action, its nature is not disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">While these two actions were pending, contemporaneously and before April, 1869, negotiations began between the plaintiff and the defendants, for the settlement of claims in the action by the plaintiff against the defendants\u2019 firm. There was an agreement finally made, as plaintiff testified, on which he relies in whole or in part to support this action. The agreement, according-to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, was that defendant\u2019s firm should, pay in a specified way, 50 per cent, of the claim for goods sold and delivered excepting for the wheat bought of Cobb. This 50 per cent, was afterward paid. The plaintiff further testified, that, in addition, he said to the defendant \u201cwill you then take charge of the Cobb claim, bar that from me?\u201d and that to this the defendant said: \u201cYou shall never hear .of that again ; that we will settle ourselves; you need never give yourself any un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>easiness in regard to the Qobb matter; that we will settle.\u201d Now it is of vital importance, in the construction of this alleged agreement to determine to what both the parties referred in the phrase Cobb claim. The question, of course, is not, to what, if each had taken other positions than in fact were taken, they might have referred to <em>% </em>nor to what either in his own mind referred to ? but to what did they both refer, in the use of that term <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">They must have referred to a claim against the present plaintiff. He, of course, would only stipulate for that. If Cobb was right in his action against the defendants\u2019 firm, as stated in his complaint, and as this plaintiff swore in his answer to Cobb some years after, then the plaintiff appeared in the transaction as an avowed agent, and would not be liable to Cobb, and would have no claim against defendants\u2019 firm except for brokerage.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">But if his action against the defendants\u2019 firm were well founded, as he asserted by bringing the action and then settling it, and as he therein sued for wheat sold by him to the defendants\u2019\" firm, his position, at the time of the agreement, was, that he remained liable to Cobb for the value of the same wheat as a purchaser of the wheat. He had bought the wheat of Cobb, and sold it to the defendants\u2019 firm., If they paid him, he could pay Cobb. Or, if they paid Cobb, the same benefit resulted to him. It would be, in effect, the same thing if they settled with Cobb, for then he could not recover from plaintiff on an allegation that the plaintiff bought the wheat. This latter was the case on the assumption\" of facts between the parties. Neither Cobb nor the present plaintiff had asserted that the latter had bought as broker without disclosing the principal. Cobb made no such claim until in his action in 1873. Noras against the defendant has it been shown tobe the fact. The conclusion seems to me to be inevitable that the claim which the parties stipulated should be settled, was such claim as Cobb might have against the plaintiff for goods sold and delivered to him absolutely, and not as broker, without disclosure of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>If these be just views, then \u00a3he plaintiff could, in this action, only rely upon a cause of action arising out of the making of the agreement, for the reason before stated, that the only claim by Cobb from which the plaintiff at that time considered he was to be relieved, was such that it negatived the notion that the plaintiff had any claims against the defendants\u2019 firm excepting as sellers of wheat to them. This latter cause of action has been barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">But this action is not apon the agreement. The complaint contains no intimation that the plaintiff claims upon it. The learned counsel for the appellant takes the position that the making of the agreement operated as a request that the-plaintiff should do all the things alleged to have been done. We have seen that if this were right in principle it is not supported by the testimony. The only alternatives for the defendant are either that the plaintiff bought the wheat for himself of Cobb, or as broker, Cobb knowing the principal. If the latter be the fact, the defendant, who had no notice of the action of Cobb against the plaintiff, is not responsible for the consequences of the plaintiff not proving his defense in that action. It cannot be true, I say with deference, that when the testimony does not show that the agreement referred to any claim by Cobb against the plaintiff, based upon the relation of the defendant to the plaintiff as broker and principal, and the testimony does not show that, as a fact, the plaintiff was liable to Cobb on such a claim, the plaintiff can gain any rights by the result of the action, for which and for the testimony and want of testimony in it the defendants were not responsible. The defendant has never before this action been called and given a day to answer as to this. The claim, as stated in the complaint, evidently depends upon its being the fact, that plaintiff bought of Cobb actually as agent for defendants, but did not disclose that defendants\u2019 firm were his principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The agreement referred to was given in evidence by the plaintiff, and contradictory evidence as to it was given by defendant. No objection was made to the evidence. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cannot, for that reason, be assumed that the parties acted as if the agreement were the substantive cause of action intended to be litigated. Evidence as to it was competent under the complaint, as it was to show that in the settlement of the action of plaintiff against defendant the claim of plaintiff, in regard to the Cobb wheat, had been accepted, and also in connection with the position assumed by the complaint as to the liability of plaintiff to Cobb, as ostensible purchaser, while, in fact, broker, to show that the defendant, in the agreement, recognized his' obligation to indemnify the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">If the agreement created an independent cause of action, as was argued by appellant\u2019s counsel, it, as described by the plaintiff, was made upon a valuable consideration, that is upon relinquishing plaintiff\u2019s claim to one half of the other amounts due, and was a promise to protect plaintiff from Cobb\u2019s claim, which we have already examined. This stood on its own feet, and was to be enforced the same as if there were no question that the plaintiff had not bought as broker, in any sense, the wheat from Cobb.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The counsel for plaintiff did not request the court to charge the jury, as to the obligations of the defendant under the agreement, as itself with a breach, making a cause of action. The only allusion in the charge to the agreement, as to the executory rights of the plaintiff under it, was, that for the reasons the judge stated, the plaintiff refused to include the_ claim by him against the defendant for the Cobb wheat, in the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The court charged that if the evidence showed that the plaintiff acted as broker in the transaction, the defendant was liable, unless he had shown that the release by Cobb to the defendant was made with the assent or concurrence of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The court also charged, that &lt;\u00a3 If in this transaction the plaintiff acted as principal, and made a sale of this wheat to the defendants, the plaintiff cannot recover in the present action.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel made to this the only exception to the charge. The charge seems clearly right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>under the circumstances. As the plaintiff did not claim under the agreement, if he did not act as broker for the defendant, the only claim he could have would be as a seller of wheat to the defendant. That claim was barred by limitation of time, as we have already said.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The court of appeals, in its opinion in \u2022 this case, on appeal (86 <em>N. Y. </em>315), said that the defendants\u2019 firm \u201c were originally liable to pay the plaintiff for the wheat which he had purchased for them, upon the obligation incurred by , the nature of the contract itself, and the plaintiff had a remedy against them for the price of the wheat sold, which liability does not depend upon the recovery of the judgment by Cobb against the plaintiff.\u201d The application of this to the fact of plaintiff selling the wheat to the defendants, if such \u25a0 were the case, is clear. It may be applied, perhaps, to the,, fact of the plaintiff buying from Cobb, as a broker, disclosing or not disclosing his principal; but in the latter contingency it was left to the jury, on the last trial, to say whether the plaintiff bought as broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">It seems from the opinion of the court of appeals that the case then showed conclusively or as a matter for the jury to pass upon, that the Cobb claim, intended by the agreement was a claim against the plaintiff based upon the fact that the plaintiff had bought of Cobb as a purchaser, while in fact he was defendants\u2019 firm broker. This c\u00e1se shows that no such thing was proved oh the last trial or assumed to be the fact at the time of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">It may be well to see if there were anything done or said by the defendant which would tend to show that at the time of\" the agreement the parties to it meant to refer to a claim that Cobb might have against the plaintiff, although he in fact was broker for defendants\u2019 firm. I can perceive nothing of the kind. What the defense was- to the action, in which plaintiff alleged that defendants\u2019 firm had bought the Cobb wheat of him, is not shown. The defendant soon after the agreement paid to Cobb about $1,700 to procure a release for him individually from the claim made in Cobb\u2019s action, that the defendants\u2019 firm bought the wheat through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the plaintiff as a broker. This is no admission that Cobb had in such a- case any claim against the plaintiff. And on the other hand, any dealing by Cobb with the claim as he made it in the action last referred to, especially any payment upon a satisfaction of it, would tend to relieve the plaintiff from Cobb\u2019s claim, as the plaintiff asserted it to be, viz.: that of a vendor to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The exception that has been particularly examined seems to present the only important question.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">I am of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs, and that the order denying motion for a new trial made upon the minutes should be affirmed with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Freedman and Russell, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
