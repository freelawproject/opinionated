The executor or administrator of a decedent . . . may maintain an action to recover damages for a wrongful act, neglect, or default, by which the decedent\u2019s death was caused, against . . . 'a corporation which would have been liable to an action in favpr of the decedent, by reason thereof, if death had not ensued. Such an action must be commenced within two years after the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d The wording of the original act on this.subject was : \u201c . . . provided that every such action shall be commenced within two y\u00e9ars after the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>such deceased person\u201d <em>(Laws </em>1847, ch. 450). Plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed October 23, 1878. This action was commenced October 1, 1881. The defendant set up two defenses, one of which was as follows : \u201c Second.\u2014That for a further defense, the defendant says : That this action was not commenced within two years after the death of the said Patrick Londriggan.\u201d The plaintiff demurred to the-above defense, upon the ground that it was insufficient in law. The court, at Special Term, ordered that the demurrer be overruled with judgment for the defendant, from which order this appeal is taken. The following opinion was rendered:</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b555-4\">Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9R\">\u2014\u201cIf it were not for \u00a7401, <em>Code Civ. Pro., </em>the limitation of the time of enforcing civil remedies would be applied to all defendants irrespective of their being in or out of the state, residents or non-residents, at the time of the accruing of the action or during the limited time. Upon provisions similar to \u00a7 401 it was held that foreign corporations could not avail themselves of the Statute of Limitations, because such provisions applied to corporations as well as natural persons, and a foreign corporation was always without the state (Olcott <em>v. </em>Tioga R. R., 20 <em>N. Y. </em>210). Section 414 declares that the provisions of chapter 4 shall apply, except in a case where a different limitation is expressly prescribed by law. If this were all, inasmuch as the present case is under \u00a7 1902, which prescribes a special limitation of two years, it would seem to be clear that the provision of \u00a7 401 does not apply to the case, and the plaintiff is not authorized to commence the action at any time after the time specially limited therefor has passed. The only doubt, however, that occurs to me would be, if at all created by the question whether the words the \u2018 provisions of this chapter \u2019 were not so limited by its connection as not to refer to all the provisions in the widest sense, but refer to the times especially declared within which actions may be <em>begun\u2014e. g., </em>twenty years for ejectment, six years for contracts not under seal, &amp;c. The words are: \u2018 The provisions of this chapter apply and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>constitute the only rules of limitation applicable to a civil action,\u2019 &amp;c. A scrutiny of \u00a7 401 shows that the enlargement of the time given by it, upon the conditions it names, is in an exact sense a limitation of time, and is a rule of limitation, as also are the specific terms before-named in the chapter. The demurrer should be overruled with judgment for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b556-4\"><em>Cooper &amp; </em>Whitlock, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AG6\">\u2014Under section 401 of the Code, the defendant stands in all respects as a domestic corporation in regard to all limitation statutes, provided that they comply with subdivision <em>2 </em>of section 432 of the Code. It does not appear by the answer that this certificate has been filed. A foreign corporation cannot under any circumstances avail itself of a statute of limitation in the courts of this state (Rathbun <em>v. </em>Northern Central R. R., 50 <em>N. Y. </em>656; Boardman <em>v. </em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern R. R. Co., 84 <em>Ib. </em>185).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b556-5\"><em>W. E. </em>Barnett, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"ADD\">\u2014No action for causing death could be maintained under the c\u00f3mmon law. To sustain the action every condition of the statute must be complied with, one of which is that \u201csuch an action must be commenced within two years after the decedent\u2019s death\u201d (Brown <em>v. </em>Harmon, 21 <em>Barb. </em>508; Yertore v. Wiswall, 16 <em>How. </em>8).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Prior to the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, chapter IY. of the Code of Civil Procedure, containing the general statutes of limitation and the rules and exceptions in relation thereto, had been enacted; but the whole chapter is made subject to the qualifications contained in \u00a7 414, which provides that \u201c the provisions of this chapter (chapter IY.) apply, and constitute the only rules of limitation applicable, to a civil action .... except in one of the following cases: (1) A case where a different limitation is specially prescribed by law.\u201d An action under \u00a7 1902 is \u201ca case where a different limitation is specially prescribed,\u201d and is therefore expressly excepted from the \u201crules of limitation\u201d contained in chapter IY., including the \u201crule\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u00a7401, under a provision similar to which the cases above cited were decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It follows that Olcott v. Tioga R. R. Co. (20 <em>N.Y. </em>210), and Rathbun v. N. C. R. R. (50 <em>N. Y. </em>656), are not now authority for sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer in the case at bar <em>(Throop's </em>Code, \u00a7 414, note).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Boardman <em>v. </em>L. S. &amp; M. S. Ry. (84 <em>N. Y. </em>157), though recently decided, was commenced in 1875, two years before chapter IV. of the Code of Civil Procedure took effect. It was not a case governed by any special limitation, and of course the points raised in the case at bar were not considered in that action. Moreover, it was unnecessary in that case to make any decision as to the disability of a foreign corporation to plead the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The \u201cdesignation\u201d provided in the last clause of \u00a7 401 of the Code of Civil Procedure would enable a foreign corporation to plead the statute of limitations in actions mentioned in titles 1 and 2 of chapter IV. and not commenced within the times limited in those titles. It is not necessary for such a corporation to show the filing of a \u201c designation \u201d in order to be enabled to plead the statute of limitations in an action under \u00a7 1902, if the final sentence in that section is to b.e treated as a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The court at General Term said : \u201cIf this appeal could be entertained, I would have no hesitation in holding, as the merits have been argued and examined, that the learned chief judge was right in the conclusion reached and the assignment of his reasons therefor. But it has been repeatedly held that an appeal from such an order will not lie before judgment \u201d (Cambridge Valley Nat. Bank v. Lynch, 76 <em>N. Y. </em>514; Garner <em>v. </em>Harmony Mills, 45 <em>Super. Ct. </em>148; Campbell <em>v. </em>N. Y. Cotton Exchange, 47 <em>Super.Ct. </em>558)<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Opinion by Freedman, J.; O'Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
