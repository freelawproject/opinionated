The papers showed that the'defendants, commission merchants in the city of New York, received from the plaintiffs merchandise upon the agreement that defendants would sell the same as agents for the plaintiffs and remit the proceeds of sales to them; that the defendants did sell said merchandise to the amount of about $800, but did not remit the proceeds, but refuse to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-16\">The court at General Term, said : \u201cThe allegation in the complaint that the defendants \u201c unlawfully and wrongfully and with intent to defraud the plaintiffs, converted the \u25a0 same to their own use,\u201d cannot be regarded as a statement of facts of the truth of which plaintiffs could have knowledge, but rather as a legal conclusion from the facts which .they had averred (Greentree <em>v. </em>Rosenstock, 61 A7. <em>7. </em>583).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-17\">\u201cThe mere fact, that the defendant was an agent to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and receive the proceeds does not make him liable for a tort, in case he does not pay over the proceeds on demand, after those proceeds have passed from the specific form in which they were received, and have been commingled with/ the agents own money. The duty of an agent for sale is to account for the proceeds of his principal\u2019s property ; but he is not guilty of a conversion, if he does not deliver the specific proceeds to his principal (Robbins <em>v. </em>Falconer, 43 <em>Super. Ot. </em>363).\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-5\"><em>S. W.
