Mr. Nathan had no power to bind the defendants. He never attempted to bind them. That could only be done by the trustees of the corporation as a board and not as separate individuals (Constant <em>v. </em>The Rector, &amp;c., 4 Daly, 305). There was nothing in defendant\u2019s constitution and by-laws that gave any authority to the president, or acting president of the trustees, any power to employ the plaintiff, without the knowledge or consent of the board of trustees, and the plaintiff was chargeable with notice of the president\u2019s authority, and of the limitations and instructions upon it, contained in said constitution and by-laws (Dabney <em>v. </em>Stevens, <em>32 Super.
