S., all leases are assignable by any instrument showing an intention to dispose of them, so as to give the assignee a right to sue upon them in his own name.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b600-11\" pgmap=\"600(126) 601(66)\">2. Same\u2014When an Approved Assignment Becomes a New Lease.\u2014 Two railroad companies, being desirous of securing a hotel at the intersection of their roads, leased a portion of the station grounds to G-., for a term of years, on which G. agreed to erect and conduct a hotel, and not to underlet without the written consent of the companies. The said companies agreed to stop their trains for meals at the hotel when the time of passing was suitable. The premises passed through several hands, by proper assignments of the lease, to which the consent of the companies was given, until one M. became possessed of them, and continued to conduct the hotel, but the appellant company ceased to stop its trains for meals and M. brought suit for a breach of the lease in this regard which resulted in a recovery. Held, that although the agreement to stop the trains might have remained personal to, the first lessee, by the assignment and consent thereto by the company, it became in effect a new lease for the unexpired portion of the term and the recovery was sustained.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b601-4\" pgmap=\"601\">3. Evidence\u2014Of Collateral Matters\u2014Presumptions.\u2014In a suit for damages resulting from the breach of a covenant in a lease by a railroad company, to stop trains for meals at a hotel, at the intersection of another road, it is error to permit witnesses to testify as to the number of persons stopping for dinner on one road and to draw a presumption from the fact that a certain number of persons traveling on the other road would also stop for meals at the same place.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\" pgmap=\"601\">Assumpsit.\u2014Breach of contract.

And the distinction seems to be whether the subject-matter of the covenant is in esse at the time of the demise or not. If it is, the covenant binds the assignee, whether named or not; if it is not, it does not bind him, unless expressly named therein. Thus if the covenant be to keep houses then on the premises in repair, it runs with the land, and binds the assignee, though not named. But if to build a new house on the demised premises, it will not bind assignees unless named. Washburn on Beal Property, Yol. I, 330.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-5\" pgmap=\"604\">A covenant by a lessor to pay for improvements to be put on premises by a lessee is a personal one, and does not run with the land to bind assignee of reversion.

Thus, where the question between landlord and tenant was, whether the rent was payable quarterly, or half yearly, evidence of the mode in which other tenants of the same landlord paid their rent was held inadmissible. And where, in covenant, the issue was whether the defendant, who was a tenant of the plaintiff, had committed waste, evidence of bad husbandry, not amounting to waste, was rejected.</p><attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-4\" pgmap=\"605\">Parish &amp; Parish and Choisser, Whitley &amp; Choisser, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-5\" pgmap=\"605\">The construction we place upon this lease and its assignments is fully warranted by the well known rules of construction : \u201c In giving a construction to a contract, the question is, what was the bargain, by a fair and reasonable construction of the words and acts of the parties, and not what was the secret intent or understanding of either of them.\u201d Nichols v. Mercer, 44 Ill. 250. \u201c The rule universally adopted in the construction of contracts is, that the intent of the parties, at the time the instruments are executed, as collected from the language, shall prevail.\u201d Duncan et al. v. Charles, 4 Scam. 561. In Robinson v. Stow, 39 Ill. 568, the court, on page 572, uses this language: \u201c While it is not the province of courts to interpolate new terms into contracts, against the evident intention of the parties, with the view of making such contracts more reasonable, yet, on the other hand, even a strained construction of the language will be adopted for the purpose of preventing obvious injustice.\u201d Further, on the same page, the court quotes with approval the language of Lord Hale, now become a maxim: \u201c The judges ought to be curious and subtle to invent reasons and means to make acts effectual according to the just intent of the parties; they will not, therefore, cavil about the propriety of. words when the intent of the parties appears, but will rather apply the words to fulfill the intent than destroy the intent by reason of the insufficiency of the words.\u201d</p> <opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b605-6\" pgmap=\"605\">Mr. Justice Bigelow</author> <p id=\"AEA\" pgmap=\"605\">delivered the opiniok oe the Court.</p> <p id=\"b605-7\" pgmap=\"605(37) 606(91)\">When. plaintiff below offered in evidence the lease and assignments thereon and thereto attached, and also the consent of the railroad companies, the defendant objected to it for two reasons: First, because the instrument executed by Mrs. M. A. Hobbs and husband to appellee was not an assignment of the lease; second, because, in the language of appellant\u2019s counsel, \u201cThe subject-matter of the covenant between the two railway companies as to stopping trains was not in esse at the time of the execution of the lease; it was a covenant to do something in the future, of a personal nature, which the railway companies might be willing to undertake with Mrs. G-oe, but not with her assignees. It was not a covenant that ran with the land.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b606-5\" pgmap=\"606\">As the first ground of objection does not appear to be seriously insisted upon, it may be disposed of by observing that Section 15 of Chapter 80 of the Eevised Statutes of this State, which makes a lease assignable so as to give the assignee a right of action thereon in his own name, unlike the statute governing the assignment of negotiable instruments, does not require the assignment when in writing to be indorsed upon the instrument itself, and hence it may be . assigned by any instrument or agreement showing an inten- ' tion to dispose of it. It is true Mrs. Hobbs and. her husband do not use the word \u201c assign \u201d in the instrument executed by them, but they do use the word \u201c sold \u201d which is, as used, equivalent to \u201c assign \u201d as we think, and that is sufficient. As the sale was of the entire hotel property, and the instrument refers to the lease and by its terms was to be attached to and become a part of the lease, and since all of the parties, and particularly appellant itself, understood that the lease was being assigned, we must hold the instrument executed by Mrs. Hobbs and her husband effective for that purpose.</p> <p id=\"b606-6\" pgmap=\"606(110) 607(67)\">As to the second ground of objection to the introduction of the lease in- evidence, it would seem that a complete answer to it is, that although the agreement to stop the trains was and might have remained personal to Mrs. Goe, as far as anything she could do was concerned, yet when she assigned her lease by the consent of the lessors, as to all of the agreements of the lessors to be performed in the future by Mrs. Goe, the assignee of the lease stood in Mrs. Goe\u2019s shoes, and had been fully accepted by the lessors in her stead. By the assignment and consent thereto, the lease became in effect a new lease to appellee for the unexpired portion of the term it had to run, and the benefits' of all the agreements and undertakings on the part of appellant yet to be performed, passed to appellee, if not by express contract between the lessors and appellee, then certainly by virtue of section 15 of the landlord and tenant act, above referred to.</p> <p id=\"b607-4\" pgmap=\"607\">The agreement of appellant to stop its passenger trains for meals, was not for a single isolated act or series of acts, to be done for-the benefit of Mrs. Goe only, but the acts were to be continuous and ran with the lease for the benefit of whoever should become the legal owner of it.</p> <p id=\"b607-5\" pgmap=\"607\">The court did not err in admitting the lease in evidence.</p> <p id=\"b607-6\" pgmap=\"607\">By a series of questions propounded to some of appellee\u2019s witnesses, they were allowed, against the objection of appellant, to testify that the number of passengers passing Barker City on the Cairo Short Line (really the St. Louis, Alton &amp; Terre Haute Railroad), and appellant\u2019s road were about the same; that two trains on the Short Line stopped for a time at Barker City for dinner, one at 1:15 and the other at 2:15 p. m., and that the number of passengers from the Short Line thus stopping for dinner would average twelve or fourteen per day. One or more of the witnesses were allowed to testify to substantially the same facts, prior to the time appellee had anything to do with the hotel, and all for the purpose, after proving the average cost of preparing a meal and the price it was sold for, of laying a foundation for the- jury to compute the damages appellee was entitled to recover of appellant, for a breach of its covenant in not stopping its trains for breakfast and supper. The two roads cross each other nearly at right angles, and their termini are wide apart, and no presumption can be drawn from the fact that a certain number of persons on the average, traveling on the Short Line road, stopped for dinner at Barker City, that any particular number on the average, traveling on appellant\u2019s road, would stop for either breakfast, dinner or supper at the same place. Greenleaf on Ev., Sec. 52.</p> <p id=\"b608-4\" pgmap=\"608\">Hearly, if not quite all of the evidence offered by appellee to establish the amount of damages suffered, was of this character, and in overruling appellant\u2019s objection to it, the court erred, and it also erred in giving to the jury any of' the plaintiff\u2019s instructions based on such evidence, and for these errors the judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
