Leffingwell, deceased, against the several beneficiaries in said will, for a construction of the will and a determination of the relative proportions of the estate said beneficiaries are to receive by the terms thereof. The controversy argued here relates to the share and proportion Mrs. Harriet Calvin, a sister of the testator, and one of the appellees, is to receive, as between herself and her nephews and nieces, the appellants. The part of the will upon which the rights of said parties depend is as follows: \u201cAfter my debts and necessary funeral expenses are paid, what remains of my real and personal property shall be divided among my heirs as follows : My brother Elisha\u2019s sons, Lawrence and Homer, and Elisha, Jr., and daughter Marion, and my brother Josiah\u2019s son Howard, and brother Levi\u2019s' son Lament, and daughter Indian ola, shall share and share alike; my sister Harriet\u2019s share will be $70 less than the above mentioned heirs.\u201d Appellants claim the meaning of the foregoing provision is that the share of Harriet is to be $70 less than the share of each of said nephews and nieces; in other words, that from the estate to be distributed among all said parties above named, $70 should be paid to each of said seven nephews and nieces, and then the remaining sum to be distributed should b\u00e9 divided into eight equal parts, and that each should receive one such share, and. their aunt, Harriet, should receive one such share. Mrs. Calvin\u2019s contention is that she is to receive $70 less than the entire sum to be paid to said nephews and nieces; that is, that $70 is to be set aside and the balance divided into two equal parts, and that she is to receive one of said parts, and the other part, plus the $70, is to be divided share and share alike among said seven nephews and nieces. The court below entered a decree in favor of Mrs. Calvin.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">Mrs. Calvin introduced oral testimony to aid in the construction of said will, by showing the -acquaintance and intimacy or lack thereof between the said several beneficiaries and the testator. Her chief witness was her husband, John Calvin, called by the executor to prove formal matters, but by whom Mrs. Calvin, on cross-examination, showed that she had performed many sisterly services for the testator, who was a bachelor and an old man, and usually lived alone upon his farm near her. Appellants objected to the competency of the husband to testify in behalf. of his wife, claiming she would not be a competent witness in her own behalf, and therefore he could not testify for her. The court heard the evidence subject to objection. Mrs. Calvin also called the executor, who testified to the value of the estate, and to the fact that the will is in the handwriting of the testator. She also called Lawrence Leffingwell, one of the nephews, who was competent because called against his own interest, and whose testimony showed that most of the nephews and nieces named in said will lived in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana; that most of them never lived in Winnebago county, Illinois, the home of the testator; and that he, Lawrence, had not met the testator since 1876.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\" pgmap=\"292\">Arthur H.

The testator is not supposed to be propounding riddles, but rather to be trying to convey his idea in the simplest manner, so as to be understood correctly at first view. When this impression is confirmed by the application of grammatical rules to the clause as constructed,, it derives great additional support. Bobb\u2019s Succession (La.), 5 So.

Gordon v. Reynolds, 114 Ill. 118; Peabody v. Kendall, 145 Ill. 519. We think the competent oral evidence does not specially assist in the interpretation of this will, and that its meaning is to be determined from the face of the instrument.</p> <p id=\"b295-6\" pgmap=\"295(253) 296(55)\">The testator states that his real and personal property is to be divided among his heirs, as follows: That his nephews and nieces, Lawrence, Homer, Elisha, Jr., Marion, Howard, Lamont and Indianola should share and share alike. Then the will states that his \u201c sister Harriet\u2019s share will be $70' less than the above mentioned heirs.\u201d The word used is plural, and naturally refers to and includes all the heirs he had previously named, and does not naturally refer to any one of said heirs, or to each one of them separately considered. To obtain the meaning claimed by appellants,-we must change the form adopted by the testator from the plural to the singular bv inserting: the word \u201ceach \u201d when he did not use that word or any equivalent thereof; and we must make the will read \u201c sister Harriet\u2019s share will be $70 less than the share of each of the above mentioned heirs.\u201d We think this is not the natural meaning of the words employed by -the testator, and we see no reason for thinking he intended any other than the natural meaning of the words used. A later paragraph of the will provided that, \u201c If any of the heirs should not be living when the estate is settled, their portion may be equally divided among the other heirs.\u201d We are unable to see how this clause aids appellants\u2019 construction of the former provision. It is not claimed their aunt Harriet was to share equally with Any. nephew or niece under the clause here drawn in question, and the fact that if any nephew or niece died, Harriet would share -equally in the distribution- of the part given said deceased heir, does not cast any light upon the meaning of the words employed in the clause here in controversy.</p> <p id=\"b296-5\" pgmap=\"296\">The will contained a provision for placing \u00a7500 in the hands- of a trustee for the benefit of Albert Leffingwell, a brother of the testator. The court below, in its decree, appointed a trustee of said fund, and carried said provision into effect. Error is assigned upon this action, but both parties, in their briefs, assent to that part of the decree, and thereby withdraw it from our consideration.</p> <p id=\"b296-6\" pgmap=\"296\">The decree of the court below is in harmony with the views here expressed, and will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
