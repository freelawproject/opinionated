The plaintiff\u2019s pleadings were an amended first count in which he declared upon the note as indorsee for value before maturity, and the common counts. Defendants pleaded the general issue, with an affidavit denying the assignment, and an amended special plea. Demurrer was sustained to said amended special plea and defendants elected to stand thereby. The parties waived a jury and there was a trial under the general issue. The execution of the assignment was proved, and that plaintiff became assignee of said note before maturity for value. Plaintiff had judgment, and defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\" pgmap=\"300\">The amended special plea averred that plaintiff\u2019s sole cause of action was the note in said amended first count of his declaration described; that Eichard J. Cooney, to whose order it was payable, and who was the assignor thereof, was at the time of the making of said note state\u2019s attorney of Peoria county; that defendant Hopmeyer was indicted and fined for selling intoxicating liquors in said county without a license, in violation of the statute, and an order was made that he stand committed till fine and costs were paid; that said fine and costs were the only consideration for which said note was given, and that said consideration was illegal and said note is null and void.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-5\" pgmap=\"300\">F.

I refer respectfully to 2 Kent\u2019s Commentaries (12th Ed.), Vol. 2, 466, 467, 468 and notes; 1 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (9th Ed.), Sec. 294; 9 Am. and Eng.

Pope v. Hanke, 155 Ill. 625; 1 Daniel on Neg. Inst., Secs. 197, 808; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. Marg. 79; Story on Prom. Notes, Sec. 192; 1 Parsons on Notes and Bills, p. 218; Tiedeman on Com. Paper, Secs. 178, 280; 2 Rand on Com. Paper, Sec. 517.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-4\" pgmap=\"301\">There is no principle of public policy which would justify the punishment of the innocent for the offenses of the guilty, and there is a very important principle of public policy involved in the question whether mercantile transactions should be embarrassed by obstructing the circulation of negotiable instruments. Estate of Long v. Jones, 69 Ill. App. 615.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\" pgmap=\"301\">But unless it has been so expressly declared by the legislature, illegality of consideration will be no defense in an action upon negotiable paper by a bona fide holder without notice, unless he obtained the note or bill after its maturity. Town of Eagle v. Kohn, 84 Ill. 292.</p> <opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b301-6\" pgmap=\"301\">Mr. Justice Dibell</author> <p id=\"A2-\" pgmap=\"301\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b301-7\" pgmap=\"301\">The only question is whether said amended special plea presented a defense to the action. The plea did not deny that plaintiff was an indorsee of said note for value before maturity, and did not allege any notice to plaintiff of the nature of the consideration for which it was given. The rule governing this case is that where a statute has declared that the illegality of the contract shall make the note void, the note will be void in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value before maturity; but that unless so expressly declared by statute, mere illegality of consideration will be no defense to the note in a suit brought by a bona fide holder thereof to whom it was assigned for value before maturity. Conkling v. Underhill, 3 Scam. 388; Town of Eagle v. Kohn, 84 Ill. 292; Pope v. Hanke, 155 Ill. 617; Estate of Long v. Jones, 69 Ill. App. 615. Our attention has not been called to any statute which makes void a note given for the consideration in said plea alleged. Whether therefore said consideration was illegal or not (which we do not decide) the plea was insufficient. The judgment will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
