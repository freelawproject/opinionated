Sessions did, on or about the first day of September one thousand nine hundred and seven, at said Westborough, hit one Samuel Hollander with a stone thrown by said Sessions, and to this the said Herman Hollander did [un]lawfully and corruptly testify and say, in substance and effect, that on the first day of September, one thousand nine hundred and seven, he saw said Sessions throw two stones at Samuel Hollander, one of which hit the boy on the leg and left a mark, and that when she threw the stone said Sessions stood in the highway outside of the town <em>pound; </em>all his said testimony, as above set forth, being false as he well knew.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Wait, </em>J., the government introduced evidence tending to prove all the necessary allegations contained in each count of the indictment; and further introduced evidence that, at the time when, as testified to by the defendant, Sessions threw the stone, she was standing inside the bars of the pound described in the indictment, and was not at any time outside of the pound or on the highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">The defendant and his witnesses testified that Sessions threw three stones at Samuel Hollander, one of which hit him -in the leg; and that she was standing in the highway at the time she threw them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury that it was of no importance for them to consider whether or not Sessions was standing in the highway or in the pound at the time of the alleged throwing of the stone or stones; and that it was not material to the issue presented in either count of the indictment where Sessions was standing at the time of the alleged throwing of the stone or stones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">The judge refused to give the instruction requested.

There is no allegation that they are different descriptions of the same act, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>135 Mass. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">It is not stated in terms in the bill of exceptions now before us that the two offenses stated above were on trial in the District Court when the perjury now in question was committed. But what is stated in the bill of exceptions is tantamount to that. It is stated there that the perjury charged in the first count of the indictment in the case at bar was committed in a proceeding in the course of justice before the District Court of Eastern Worcester \u201con certain issues\u201d then on trial between the Commonwealth and Carrie M. Sessions, where \u201c it became and was material to said issues whether said Sessions did assault Samuel Hollander and throw a stone in a public way of said Westborough \u201d; and that the perjury charged in the second count of the indictment in the case at bar was committed in a proceeding in the cause of justice before the same court \u201c on an issue \u201d then on trial where \u201c it became and was material to said issue whether said Carrie M. Sessions did, on or about the first day of September, one thousand nine hundred and seven, at said Westborough, hit one Samuel Hollander with a stone thrown by said Sessions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It is also stated in the bill of exceptions that the government introduced evidence tending to prove all the necessary allegations contained in either count.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">At the close of the evidence the prisoner asked for the following ruling: \u201c That it was of no importance for them to consider whether or not said Sessions was standing in the highway or in the pound at the time of the alleged throwing of said stone or stones; and that it was not material to the issue presented in either count of said indictment where said Sessions was standing at the time of the alleged throwing of said stone or stones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The first part of this ruling plainly applies to the whole case, that is, to both counts. If the fact that Carrie M. Sessions stood in a public way when she threw the stone was material in either of the two counts of the complaint on trial in the District Court, the ruling asked for could not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">That is also true of the second part of this ruling asked for by the prisoner. The second part of the ruling is not a request for a ruling as to each count that the fact that the aforesaid Carrie stood in the road was of no importance. The ruling asked for was that this fact was not material to the issue presented \u201c in either count.\u201d If that fact was material to one of the two counts the ruling was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The only argument put forward in support of the ruling asked for so far as the first count is concerned is that the ruling asked for deals with the fact \u201c whether or not said Sessions was standing in the highway or in-the pound at the alleged throwing of the stone or stones,\u201d while the allegation of the indictment is that it was material to the issues on trial to determine \u201c whether -said Sessions did . . . throw a stone in a public way.\u201d There is nothing in this bill of exceptions to show that the two did not mean the same thing in the trial of the indictment in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
