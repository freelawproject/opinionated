Stone, Esquire, as master. He made a report in which he found for the defendant and recommended that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed. The plaintiff filed eleven objections to the master\u2019s report and later filed eleven exceptions founded on the objections.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">The case was heard by <em>Stevens, </em>J., who made a final decree that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">It did not appear by the report of the appeal before this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that the judge made any order in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions. In the brief for the defendant before this court there was the following statement, which is referred to in the opinion: \u201cno evidence was offered except the master\u2019s report. The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions were all overruled and the court ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-4\"><em>J. C. Sanborn, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-5\"><em>J. A. O\u2019Mahoney, </em>for the defendant, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-6\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzL\">The record before us does not show that the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report ever were overruled, or that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was from anything except the final decree. Inasmuch, however, as it is stated in the brief of the defendant that the exceptions to the report were overruled, and as the case has been argued by both parties upon the assumption that such is the fact and that the questions arising thereon are saved to the plaintiff, we have considered the case upon that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Although the master at first excluded certain evidence offered by the plaintiff, he finally admitted it in order to avoid a recommittal of the cause if in the opinion of the court his rulings excluding it should be regarded as erroneous. Upon all the evidence he has found in substance that the carbonator \u201c when delivered and set up in the plaintiff\u2019s store corresponded in all respects with the defendant\u2019s representations to the plaintiff \u201d ; that the plaintiff \u201c failed to show any defect in the carbonator to which the bad quality of the soda was traceable \u201d; that \u201c the defendant made no false and fraudulent representations or misrepresentations to the plaintiff \u201d; and that \u201c there was no breach of warranty.\u201d Having made these findings of fact, he found generally for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The evidence before the master has not been reported to the court, and it must be assumed that it warrants the findings. Under these circumstances it becomes unnecessary to consider in detail the exceptions to the report. The findings dispose of the case, and we have no occasion to consider the other grounds of defense. Nor do we see any ground for recommittal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
