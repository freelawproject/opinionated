Writ dated December 9, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">In the Superior Court the case first was tried before <em>Lawton, </em>J., who at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions, which were sustained by this court in a decision reported in 194 Mass. 307. There was a new trial before <em>Crosby, </em>J., who reported the case for determination by this court under the stipulation quoted in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">There was evidence at both trials that the plaintiff at the time of the accident was about nineteen years of age; that he was set-at work at cutting pieces of wood for boxes upon a machine containing a circular saw revolving toward him, against which he-was to push a movable table holding the piece of wood to be cut, while, attached to an adjoining stationary table about two inches back of the revolving saw, was a flat piece of metal called a spreader, intended to enter the slit in the wood as the saw cut it and prevent the wood from closing on the saw; that the screws attaching the spreader to the stationary table were loose, causing the spreader to go one way or the other; and that this defect had existed long enough to have been known to the superintendent of the factory; that the plaintiff was pushing a piece of wood on the movable table against the saw, when, owing to the looseness of the screws, the spreader failed to enter the slit ilithe piece of wood and struck the wood a little to one side of the cut, causing the piece of wood to be stopped with a violent jerk and the plaintiff\u2019s hand to be thrown forward upon the saw and injured. The difference between the evidence at the second trial and that at the first in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s previous experience and his knowledge of the condition and operation of the machine is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-7\"><em>R.

The case has been tried a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>time and it comes before us now upon a report by the presiding judge made pursuant-to a stipulation entered into by the parties at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that the jury should \u201c return a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of two thousand dollars and the case ... be reported to the Supreme Judicial Court for its determination on the question whether upon the evidence presented there was an issue proper for submission to the jury.\u201d If there was, judgment is to be entered on the verdict. If there was not, judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The defendant does not seriously contend that there was not evidence warranting a finding that the machine was defective, and that its condition was due to negligence on the part of the defendant. Neither does it seriously contend that the evidence did not warrant a finding that the accident was due to the defective condition of the machine. Its main contentions are that the risk was an obvious one and that the plaintiff assumed it, and was not in the exercise of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The evidence, especially in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the condition and operation of the machine, is fuller than it was at the former trial, but it is not such, we think, as to warrant us in saying that there was no issue for the jury. The testimony in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s occupations before he entered the defendant\u2019s employment and as to what he did after he entered its employment down to the time of the accident was substantially the same as at the former trial. There was no testimony at this trial as there was at that from the defendant\u2019s superintendent that he instructed the plaintiff in regard to the operation of the machine, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he received no instruction was left uncontradicted. The evidence at this trial tended rather to show that the plaintiff had worked less upon the machine than appeared to have been the case at the previous trial, and that his work upon it had been more intermittent and desultory. But the defendant contends that in view of the plaintiff\u2019s familiarity with the condition and operation of the machine as shown by his testimony at this trial, and in view of the fact that during the time that he worked upon the machine boards hit the spreader and caused his hand to jump \u201c real often,\u201d to quote-his words, he must be deemed to have understood that such an accident as occurred might happen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>and therefore to have assumed the risk, and it farther contends that these facts render the case as now presented distinguishable from the case presented at the other trial. But it does not follow as matter of law that, because the plaintiff knew that the machine was defective and that boards at times hit the spreader and caused his hand to jump, he appreciated and assumed the risk of such an accident as happened. He might well have continued to work upon the machine without understanding or appreciating the fact that his hand was liable to be thrown on to the saw by the tendency which the machine had to make his hand \u201c jump \u201d when a board hit the spreader. His knowledge in regard to the machine and its operation would not necessarily preclude him from recovery. It was for the jury to say, taking all the circumstances into account, whether he appreciated the danger and assumed the risk. It could not be held that as matter of law he assumed the risk. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>188 Mass. 437. <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Winslow Skate Manuf. Co. </em>189 Mass. 580. <em>Urquhart </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Anthony Co. </em>192 Mass. 257. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>193 Mass. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">He testified that he was operating the machine in the usual way when injured and it could not be ruled, therefore, as matter of law that he was not in the exercise of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
