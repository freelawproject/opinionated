His finding was as follows: \u201c I find that said fence stood substantially on the line of the present fence, and I-therefore find for the tenant.\u201d The demandant appealed. The judge filed a report of his decision in compliance with St. 1905, c. 288.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-11\">In the Superior Court the appeal was tried before <em>White, </em>J., upon the issues framed by the judge of the Land Court, which are printed below. The character of the evidence is described in the opinion. On all the evidence the demandant asked the judge to rule that he was entitled to recover the triangular strip of land. The judge refused to make this ruling, and submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ted the issues to the jury to which they returned answers as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">\u201c 1. What was the location of the easterly boundary fence referred to in the deed from Nathan Law to the tenant of July 9, 1875, with reference to the location of the present easterly fence of the lot occupied by the tenant ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">The jury answered: \u201c The location of the easterly boundary fence referred to in the deed from Nathan Law to the tenant, of July 9,1875, coincided with the location of the present easterly fence of the lot occupied by the tenant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">\u201c 2. If the location of the 1875 fence differed from the location of the present fence, has title to the land between the lines of location of said fences been acquired by prescription by either party, and if so by which ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-10\">The jury answered: \u201c No rights by prescription have been acquired by either party.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-11\">The demandant alleged exceptions to the refusal of the judge to make the ruling requested by him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-12\"><em>D. R. </em>Radovsky, for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-13\"><em>C. R.

Whether the demandant or the tenant was entitled to this piece of land depended on where the east line of the tenant\u2019s lot and the west line of the demand-ant\u2019s lot was, the two being coincident. This presented a question of fact to be determined according to the evidence. The judge of the Land Court found that the fine was where the tenant contended that it was and that the demandant was not entitled to the triangular piece or any part of it. The report of the Land Court, which is made <em>prima facie </em>evidence by statute (St. 1905, c. 288) of the facts found so far as they relate to or bear upon any of the questions raised, was introduced by the tenant. There was also other evidence introduced by the tenant tending to show that the line was where he contended that it was, as well as evidence introduced by the demandant tending to show that it was where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>lie contended that it was. The question thus presented was, as already observed, entirely one of fact for the jury. It could not be ruled as matter of law that the demandant was entitled to a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled with double costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
