Children and grandchildren of the first marriage petitioned to have the title of the land registered, and the second wife of the trustee's father contended that the words \u201c their heirs \u201d in the deed should be construed to mean \u201chis or her heirs\u201d and that she was entitled to an equitable interest as the widow of the trustee\u2019s father. The Land Court ruled that the respondent had no equitable interest in the premises. <em>Reid, </em>that the ruling of the Land Court was correct, since the words \u201c their , heirs at law\u201d meant the heirs of both the trustee\u2019s father and mother, and not of the survivor of them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b100-6\">Where the legal title to land is held by a husband in trust for others, it does not descend to his wife as one of his statutory heirs.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">Petition, filed in the Land Court on October 7, 1907, for the registration of certain land in Milford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">There .was a hearing before <em>Davis, </em>J., who found that the land in question was conveyed in 1873 by one Flagg to Michael H. Ahern in trust, as stated in the opinion; that the trustee died in 1874 leaving his father, David Ahern, as his only heir; that no new trustee ever was appointed; that Ellen Ahern, wife of David, died in 1885, and thereafter David married the respondent Margaret, and died in 1907, leaving her surviving him; that at the time of the filing of the petition there were living children and grandchildren of David and Ellen, who were the petitioners, but that there never was any issue of David by his marriage with the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\">The respondent in support of her contention argued that the words \u201c their heirs at law \u201d in the trust deed should be construed to mean \u201c his or her heirs at law \u201d; and that on the death of the trustee the real estate vested in his heir, David, and, on the death of Ellen, merged with the entire equitable estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-10\">The judge ruled that the respondent had no interest in the premises, and the respondent appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-11\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-12\"><em>J.

The words \u201c their heirs at law \u201d mean the heirs at law of both David and Ellen, and not the heirs at law of either alone. The respondent took no equitable interest under this deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It seems to have been conceded by the respondent that she did not take the legal title which came to her husband upon the death of his son, the trustee named in the deed. We are of opinion that where the legal title to land is held by a husband in trust for others it does not descend to his wife as one of his statutory heirs. In such a case R. L. c. 140, \u00a7 3, and the rule acted upon in <em>International Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>183 Mass. 173, do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
