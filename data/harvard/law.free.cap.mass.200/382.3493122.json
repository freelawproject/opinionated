The defendant Stephen R. Jones was an attorney at law in Boston, a business adviser and a social and intimate friend of the defendant Kitchen. Auguste Holland was a man of large means and for ten years previous to his death had lived at the Hotel Thorndike in Boston. In July, 1895, he had sought and secured the companionship and assistance of the plaintiff, and in consideration of the services rendered and to be rendered and the sacrifices made and to be made for him by the plaintiff, Holland \u201c promised and agreed to leave to the plaintiff a sum of money sufficient for her support during life, in money, bonds, securities and stock in a sum not less than $30,000, and to leave to the plaintiff, by will, substantially his entire estate of which he should be seised or the owner of at the time of his decease and to leave to the plaintiff the property aforesaid, for her support and independent maintenance during her life, the same to be paid to her at the time of his death in the event that they were not sooner married, and that she should marry him at any time when the said Holland so desired.\u201d The plaintiff performed the services and made the sacrifices required and during the remainder of Holland\u2019s, life was his close and almost sole companion, but no marriage took place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">In May, 1905, Holland made a will and also wrote some testamentary directions, both of which instruments were in his possession at the time of his death, in which he did as he had promised the plaintiff to do in making provision for her, \u201cand the said Holland further left to this plaintiff stocks, bonds and money to a large amount for her own separate use, benefit and support, all of which belonged to and was the property of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">Learning of the last sickness of Holland, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201c conferred together and then and there combining, confederating and conspiring for their own lucre, benefit and gain to injure and defraud the plaintiff, and so to arrange matters that the plaintiff should be deprived, refused and cut off from all advantages arising to her from a full and complete performance of her contract with the said Holland and to deprive her of any interest or right or gratuity or remuneration for her services rendered or otherwise and from all benefits resulting from the last wishes of the said Holland,\u201d planned that the defendant Jones should take apartments near those of Holland at the hotel and that, immediately on Holland\u2019s death, Jones \u201c was to enter the room where the deceased lay, seize, take and carry away all of the papers, documents, money, bonds, letters, notes and all written instruments and then and thereafter hold, secrete and conceal the same and thereafter to claim and maintain in pursuance of their said acts, conduct and purpose that there were no written instruments or documents as aforesaid, no stock, bonds, or money in said room, no bank account and only a very small estate, if any, and that this plaintiff had no rights as creditor or otherwise, although the said Jones and the said defendant Kitchen knew and had well known for many years up to the time of the said Holland\u2019s decease the duties, relations and friendship and attachment between the said Holland and the plaintiff.\u201d The plan was carried out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">The defendants demurred on grounds both general and specific.

The defendants\u2019 demurrer to the declaration was sustained. Judgment was thereupon entered for the defendants, from which the plaintiff appealed. The allegations of the declaration are voluminous. There are some floating statements, which, it is argued, amount to an averment that one Holland gave to the plaintiff certain stocks, bonds and other securities, which the defendants have taken and secreted. But the pleading falls far short of any sufficient allegation of conversion, and indeed does not appear to be directed to any such end. That form of declaration is familiar, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>material averments are brief and lucid. If that was the kind of action intended, the declaration was plainly open to objection as composed of ambiguous, multifarious and irrelevant matter, and not being a concise and substantially certain statement of the substantive and necessary facts. If, however, from the mass of language employed there is excerpted all that looks toward trover, it is plainly insufficient. There is no description of specific property, but merely a general reference to certain classes of personal property, which is utterly devoid of definiteness. It is also extremely doubtful if there is any averment of ownership, save as an alleged inference from other circumstances, which in themselves are inadequate to show any title vesting in the plaintiff at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The declaration is obviously framed with another purpose. It is not necessary to recite its substance further than to say that it avers that one Eolland executed and left unrevoked at his death a will, in which the plaintiff was named as beneficiary to a large sum, and that the defendants immediately after the decease of said Eolland took possession of-this will, and have concealed or destroyed it, and denied its existence, so that the plaintiff has failed of her legacy. The only question is whether this constitutes a cause of action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Under the law and practice in this Commonwealth, the Probate Court has exclusive original jurisdiction of all matters pertaining to proof of wills. Speaking generally, the Probate Court is established for the purpose of passing upon all probate matters. Hence such proceedings pertaining to wills, in the first instance, belong there, and its decrees touching those subjects are binding upon all other tribunals. The subject has been discussed in <em>Waters </em>v. Stickney, 12 Allen 1, <em>Gale </em>v. Nickerson, 144 Mass. 415, and <em>Crocker </em>v. Crocker, 198 Mass. 401, and it is not necessary now to traverse the ground anew. The Probate Court has. full authority in proper cases to allow the proof of a lost will by any competent evidence of its contents. <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>177 Mass. 238. Express provision is made in detail by E. L. c. 135, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15, requiring any person having the custody of the will of a deceased person to seasonably deliver it to the Probate Court having jurisdiction, with a heavy penalty upon one, who fails in this duty unreasonably, after being duly cited into court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>for this purpose, and conferring full power as to examination under oath of any suspected person. This court has never had occasion to consider what relief apart from statute might be open to persons injured by concealment or destruction of wills. The subject has been regulated by statute at least since Prov. St. 1692-3, c. 14, \u00a7 2; 1 Prov. Laws (State ed.) 45. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>4 Mass. 137. Decisions in other jurisdictions, where a different practice prevails, and where relief in chancery or otherwise has sometimes been afforded, need not be reviewed. It is possible that apart from the statute the Probate Court would be the only tribunal clothed with power in the premises. <em>Stebbins </em>v. Lathrop, 4 Pick. 33. But, however this may be, the subject is one of difficulty, and precisely what relief might be given and in what court is not clear, and has never been settled in this Commonwealth. Under these circumstances the statute has provided a clear, ample and expeditious remedy. By numerous decisions of this court, when the Legislature provides such a remedy, it has been held to be exclusive. Other relief will be refused where plain and adequate statutory redress is available. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>197 Mass. 194, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
