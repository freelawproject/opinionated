At a meeting of its members, a majority of the members present voted 'to enter into union with another society, and at a subsequent meeting, by more than a two thirds vote, voted to transfer the society\u2019s real estate to such other organization. A minority voted against both propositions and brought a bill in equity to enjoin the carrying out of the votes. The case was referred to a master, in whose report there was no finding as to the purpose for which the plaintiff\u2019s society was organized. <em>Held, </em>that, in the absence of any statement as to the purpose for which the society was organized, the by-law above quoted did not authorize the action of the majority of the members objected to by the plaintiffs.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-14\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court for the county of Worcester on February 1,1906, seeking a conveyance by the defendant corporation, Rauhan Aarre, to the plaintiffs or to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>persons as trustees for the Young People\u2019s Society Wainala of a one third interest in certain property the record title to which was held by that corporation under an agreement with the Young People\u2019s Society Wainala to convey to it such one third interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">The case was referred to a master. After a hearing on his report, <em>Sanderson, </em>J., made a final decree directing that the conveyance prayed for be made; and the defendants appealed.

The Wainala was an unincorporated society, and the power of the majority to control the rights'of the minority, or the action of the minority, was determined by the constitution and by-laws. <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>149 Mass. 341. <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>167 Mass. 392. In any case not thus provided for no action could be taken binding all unless assented to by all.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The votes in question provided in substance that the society Wainala should be annexed to the Workingmen\u2019s Society and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the property of the former should be transferred to the latter. The purpose for which the Wainala was organized does not clearly appear in the record, nor are its laws set forth as a whole. So far as appears by the record, the defendants rely upon the following, to wit: \u201c If several motions are made regarding the same question and no unanimous decision can be obtained, said question will be voted on, and the wish of the majority shall prevail, except in the purchase or the sale of real estate, in which case two thirds majority must be the settling vote. Votes can be cast in any way which may seem best for the occasion.\u201d But, in the absence of any statement as to the purpose for which the society was organized, this by-law cannot be held to authorize by a majority vote the transfer of the members of the society bodily to another society, to the extinguishment of the former society, especially when, as in the present case, a considerable minority of the old society seeks to maintain its existence. Much less can the property be transferred by such a proceeding. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The case is settled by the principle laid down in the cases cited above, and the following language of the court in <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>the first of them, is peculiarly appropriate to the present case: \u201c The right to the possession of the property in question was in the original association, and continues in it, unless by its action or the action of its members the right has been transferred to the new association. The property was held under the constitution for the use of the association and its members, and the majority could not transfer it with themselves to another association without violating the trusts upon which it was held and the rights of the minority who remained members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> It would seem from the master\u2019s report that the vote of the Wainala to transfer itself to the Workingmen\u2019s Society was passed by a vote of twenty-two to fourteen; and that the vote to transfer the real estate was passed at a subsequent, meeting by a vote of twenty-three to three.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
