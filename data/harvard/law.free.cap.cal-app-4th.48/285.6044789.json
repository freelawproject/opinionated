The only question for our review is whether a bicycle qualifies as a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d We conclude it does not, and we affirm the judgment in favor of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The facts are undisputed: Plaintiff was walking across Mission Street in San Francisco in a designated crosswalk on a green light when she was struck by a bicycle, which was traveling on Mission Street through the red light. Plaintiff was knocked to the ground and injured. As the bicycle rider was uninsured, plaintiff submitted a claim to her own automobile liability insurance carrier, California State Automobile Association (CSAA). Plaintiff\u2019s policy provides uninsured motorist coverage for injuries sustained in an accident arising from the \u201cownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">CSAA moved for summary judgment on the ground that a bicycle is not a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d The trial court agreed and granted the motion. Judgment was entered in favor of CSAA. Plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\n<em>The Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">We begin our analysis with the \u201cbedrock\u201d rule of insurance policy interpretation: words in an insurance policy are to be interpreted as a layperson would interpret them, in their \u201cordinary and popular sense.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644; <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 867 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263]; <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253]; <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764].)  Here, as already noted, the insurance policy provides coverage for injuries caused by an uninsured \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d The policy defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201ca land motor vehicle or a trailer . . . .\u201d The ordinary and plain meaning of the policy language, then, is that the offending uninsured vehicle must be a <em>motorized </em>vehicle. (See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 657, 663 [128 Cal.Rptr. 514] [under usual meaning of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d motorcycle is a motor vehicle].) A bicycle does not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\n<em>The Insurance Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Plaintiff contends, however, that the rule calling for the \u201cordinary and popular\u201d meaning of policy terms is subject to exception when the parties intend a technical or special meaning. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644.) She argues that the policy must be read in light of the uninsured motorist insurance law, which, she asserts, defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d more broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Legislature has decreed that automobile liability insurance policies must provide coverage for losses the insured would be legally entitled to recover \u201cfrom the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (a).) \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is defined as \u201cany vehicle designed for use principally upon streets and highways and subject to motor vehicle registration under the laws of this state.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.06, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Plaintiff reasons that because \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d means <em>\u201cany </em>vehicle,\u201d a bicycle comes within the statutory definition. Her reasoning is hopelessly flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Plaintiff has ignored the qualifying phrase \u201csubject to motor vehicle registration under the laws of this state.\u201d Bicycles are not subject to state motor vehicle registration laws. Motor vehicle registration is provided for in the Vehicle Code (Veh. Code, \u00a7 4000 et seq.). \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is defined in that code as \u201ca vehicle which is self-propelled.\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 415.) It has long been recognized that a bicycle does not come within the definition of a motor vehicle under the Vehicle Code. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Pedigo </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 300, 307-308 [170 P.2d 999].) A bicycle is defined in that code as a device \u201cpropelled exclusively by human power.\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7231, 39000.) Bicycles are subject to state laws on operations of a bicycle (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21200-21207) and to bicycle licensing only to the extent required by local ordinances (Veh. Code, \u00a7 39001 et seq.). Bicycles are not subject to state laws on <em>motor vehicle </em>registration. Consequently, a bicycle does not come within the definition of motor vehicle under Insurance Code section 11580.06, subdivision (a). (Cf. <em>Siefert </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins. </em>(1981) 289 Pa.Super. 160 [432 A.2d 1101] [dirt bike not required to be registered under Vehicle Code; hence, not a motor vehicle under state\u2019s no fault system].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In summary, we hold that a bicycle is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d either under the terms of the policy or within the meaning of the uninsured motorist insurance law. The motion for summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Stein, Acting P. J., and Swager, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
