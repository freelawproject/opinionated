Sammis and defendant Robert Stafford formed a corporation in 1984. Approximately five years later, Sammis brought two actions against Stafford. First, he brought a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit, alleging Stafford committed misconduct while he was president and majority shareholder. Second, he brought his own individual action, alleging Stafford committed fraud in inducing Sammis to transfer his majority shareholder position to Stafford. The actions were consolidated for trial; the parties waived jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">After trial, the court entered judgment in Stafford\u2019s favor on the fraud action. Sammis does not appeal from this ruling. The court entered judgment against Stafford on the shareholder\u2019s derivative action, awarding Sammis $64,801. Sammis appeals from this ruling, contending the court erred in failing to award additional damages, principally the amount of Stafford\u2019s annual salary and pension benefits from 1990 through 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude Stafford\u2019s conduct was properly ratified under Corporations Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 310, subdivision (a)(3). In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude substantial evidence supported the court\u2019s finding that Stafford proved his salary was fair and reasonable within the meaning of the code section. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">In 1984, Sammis and Stafford formed Fabric and Structure Technology, Inc. (FAST), to design, manufacture, and market fabric structures. Sammis initially contributed $2,500 and Stafford contributed $2,450. Sammis thus owned 51 percent interest and Stafford owned 49 percent interest. Sammis held the majority interest because he was responsible for arranging financing and guaranteeing loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">FAST\u2019s board of directors consisted of Sammis and Stafford. Stafford was the corporate president responsible for all aspects of the business. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1939\">*1939</page-number>Sammis was also an officer, his role was primarily limited to providing financing. Stafford received a salary. Sammis did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">From 1984 through 1986, FAST developed patents related to fabric building structures. FAST then began manufacturing the product. By 1988, FAST owed Sammis approximately $272,500. In addition, Sammis had arranged and personally guaranteed a $300,000 line of credit for FAST.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">In 1988, FAST discontinued its manufacturing operation and focused on developing patents and licensing the patents. Stafford thereafter began negotiating licensing agreements with two entities. During the negotiations with one of the entities (Canvas Specialties), Canvas\u2019s manager, Irwin Sack, told Stafford that Canvas would not enter into a license agreement unless Stafford was either the sole owner or the majority shareholder of FAST.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">In response to Sack\u2019s concerns, on June 22, 1989, Sammis and Stafford executed a written agreement (entitled \u201cShareholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d), in which Sammis sold 2 percent of his FAST stock to Stafford.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After that time, Stafford owned 51 percent of the corporation. As part of this Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, the parties agreed that if any employee was paid more than $30,000, FAST would enter into an employment contract with the employee and board approval would be required for the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">FAST thereafter entered into licensing agreements with Canvas and another entity. As a result of these agreements, FAST received approximately $725,000. FAST used these funds to retire corporate debt and to repay obligations owing to Sammis.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">In approximately May 1990, Sammis failed to return Stafford\u2019s telephone calls and refused to countersign checks. Concerned by Sammis\u2019s refusal to cooperate, Stafford consulted FAST\u2019s attorney, Michael Shea. Shea suggested that Stafford call a shareholders\u2019 meeting. Shea said that if Sammis failed to attend the meeting, Stafford could reduce the board of directors to one, elect himself to that position, and then eliminate the requirement that Sammis approve FAST\u2019s expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Relying on this advice, Stafford noticed a shareholders\u2019 meeting for June 27, 1990. Sammis received the notice, but did not attend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the June 27 meeting, Stafford created a board of one and elected himself as the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1940\">*1940</page-number>board member. Stafford then took action on several matters, including signing an employment agreement authorizing a salary of up to $150,000 for himself, establishing a pension for himself, and hiring his wife and paying her both salary and a pension. Before 1989, Stafford was paid less than $50,000 annually. In 1989, he was paid approximately $86,000. After Stafford elected himself sole director, he paid himself approximately $118,000 in 1990, $146,000 in 1991, and $127,000 in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">In June 1991, Sammis learned of Stafford\u2019s actions. After protracted negotiations, the parties agreed to reconstitute the board to five directors. Stafford elected himself, his wife, and his sister. Sammis elected himself and his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Six months later, on January 27,1992, a board meeting was held, at which a majority of the board (Stafford, his wife, and his sister) voted to ratify all of Stafford\u2019s actions while he was the sole director.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">In December 1992, Sammis bought all of Stafford\u2019s shares in FAST for $156,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Sammis filed two actions arising from the foregoing events. First, Sammis, on behalf of the corporation, brought a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit alleging Stafford committed misconduct while he was majority shareholder in that he (a) paid himself excessive salary and benefits and (b) diverted corporate funds for personal uses. Second, Sammis filed an action against Stafford, alleging that in 1989 Stafford fraudulently induced Sammis to transfer 2 percent of FAST stock to Stafford and falsely promised he would limit his salary to $30,000. The two cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">After a 10-day trial, the court issued a written statement of decision. The court explained it was ruling in Sammis\u2019s favor on the shareholder\u2019s derivative suit because Stafford improperly diverted $64,801 of corporate funds for his personal use. The court determined, however, that Stafford\u2019s salary and pension benefits were \u201cneither excessive nor inappropriate\u201d and thus did not award Sammis any damages in connection with Stafford\u2019s salary. The court additionally ruled in Stafford\u2019s favor on Sammis\u2019s fraud action, finding Sammis failed to prove he was fraudulently induced to transfer his majority interest to Stafford or that Stafford had agreed to limit his salary to $30,000. The court thus entered a $64,801 judgment against Stafford on the shareholder\u2019s derivative suit and entered judgment in Stafford\u2019s favor on the fraud suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1941\">*1941</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ARkP\">I. <em>Section 310(a)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Sammis challenges the court\u2019s ruling that Stafford\u2019s salary and pension benefits were not a misappropriation of corporate funds. Relying on section 310(a), Sammis contends Stafford\u2019s conduct after 1989 was not properly authorized and therefore the court erred in failing to determine Stafford must return his salary and benefits received from the corporation during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Section 310 governs situations where a matter before a board of directors is one in which a director has an interest. Section 310(a) provides that a vote on the matter is not void or voidable because the interested director is present at the board meeting if one of three alternatives are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-7\">\u201c(1) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director\u2019s interest are fully disclosed or known to the shareholders and such contract or transaction is approved by the shareholders (Section 153) in good faith, with the shares owned by the interested director or directors not being entitled to vote thereon, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">\u201c(2) The material facts as to the transaction and as to such director\u2019s interest are fully disclosed or known to the board or committee, and the board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by a vote sufficient without counting the vote of the interested director or directors and the contract or transaction is just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-9\"><em>\u201c(3) As to contracts or transactions not approved as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, the person asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of proving that the contract or transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved or ratified.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 310 (a)(l)-(3), italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">At trial, Stafford acknowledged that a one-person board is not proper under California law (see \u00a7 212) and therefore his actions from June 1990 through January 1992 were not initially authorized. Stafford, however, relied on the January 27, 1992, ratification vote (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1940) to argue that his 1990-1992 conduct as director was nonetheless valid because the conduct was later ratified by a majority of a five-person board. Stafford recognized such board approval did not fall within the first two statutory alternatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1942\">*1942</page-number>(\u00a7 310(a)(1) or \u00a7 310(a)(2)) because his vote was necessary to obtain a majority to approve the resolution. Stafford maintained, however, that the approval was proper as to section 310(a)(3), italicized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">In its statement of decision, the trial court stated it did \u201cnot find that [Stafford] misapplied any funds of the corporation with regard to the salary paid to himself.\u201d Although the court did not specifically identify section 310(a), Sammis did not raise any objections to the statement of decision. We therefore are required to presume the trial court made all findings necessary to support the judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 634; <em>In re Marriage of Arceneaux </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1130, 1133-1134 [275 Cal.Rptr. 797, 800 P.2d 1227]; see also <em>Sperber </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 744-745 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 659].) Accordingly, we interpret the court\u2019s statement to mean the court found Stafford proved his salary was \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d within the meaning of section 310(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Sammis contends section 310(a) is inapplicable because Stafford\u2019s salary was not an \u201cinterested director\u201d transaction, but rather it was an \u201cultra vires\u201d act.  \u201c\u2018[U]ltra vires\u2019 refers to an act which is beyond the powers conferred upon a corporation by its charter or by the laws of the state of incorporation . . . .\u201d <em>(Marsili </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 313, 322 [124 Cal.Rptr. 313, 79 A.L.R.3d 477].) A corporation may recover damages when a director engages in ultra vires activities, and the director may not defend such action by alleging ratification. (See \u00a7 208, subd. (a); <em>Michaels </em>v. <em>Pacific Soft Water Laundry </em>(1930) 104 Cal.App. 349, 363 [286 P. 165], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Mary Pickford Co. </em>v. <em>Bayly Bros., Inc. </em>(1939) 12 Cal.2d 501, 521-522 [86 P.2d 102].) If, however, the director\u2019s act was within the corporate powers, but was performed without authority or in an unauthorized manner, the act is not ultra vires. (See <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Bear Film Co. </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 607, 610-611 [33 Cal.Rptr. 486]; <em>Michaels </em>v. <em>Pacific Soft Water Laundry, supra, </em>104 Cal.App. at p. 363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">There is no evidence in the record that Stafford acted beyond the purpose or power of the corporation. Rather, Stafford\u2019s acts were within the scope of FAST\u2019s corporate powers, but were not validly authorized by a properly constituted board of directors. Thus, Stafford\u2019s acts were not ultra vires and therefore were subject to later ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Sammis alternatively argues Stafford\u2019s conduct was not properly ratified because as a matter of law section 310(a)(3) applies only where the board \u201cauthorized, approved or ratified\u201d the action, <em>without </em>the vote of the interested director.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1943\">*1943</page-number>We are required to interpret a statute according to its plain meaning. (See <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) In so doing, we must consider the language in context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Applying these principles, we conclude the January 27, 1992, ratification vote could qualify as a ratification within the meaning of section 310(a)(3). Section 310(a)(3) applies \u201cto contracts or transactions <em>not </em>approved as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 310(a)(3), italics added; see <em>Gaillard </em>v. <em>Natomas </em>Co. (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1250, 1272-1273 [256 Cal.Rptr. 702]; <em>Pece </em>v. <em>Tama Trading Co. </em>(1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 219, 223 [70 P.2d 652] [interpreting a substantially similar predecessor statute].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, section 310(a)(3) addresses the situation where the approval was based on a vote by the interested director.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Considering section 310(a) as a whole, this interpretation makes sense. If section 310(a)(3)\u2019s phrase \u201cauthorized, approved or ratified\u201d was construed to mean only those approvals made without the interested director\u2019s vote, then section 310(a)(3) would be unnecessary. Section 310(a)(2) and section 310(a)(3) both permit interested director transactions where the board of directors approves the transaction. The sections differ, however, depending on whether the approval was obtained with or without the interested director\u2019s vote and whether there was full disclosure. Where a \u00ab\u00bf\u00abinterested majority approves the transactions and there was full disclosure, section 310(a)(2) applies, and the burden of proof is on the person challenging the transaction. (See 1 Ballantine &amp; Sterling, Cal. Corporation Laws (4th ed. 1995) \u00a7 103.01, p. 6-25.) Where, however, the approval was not obtained from a disinterested board vote, section 310(a)(3) applies and requires the person seeking to uphold the transaction to prove it was \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d to the corporation. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Section 310\u2019s legislative committee comment, which discusses each of the three \u201cindependent procedures for the validation of \u2018interested\u2019 transactions,\u201d supports our view. (See legis. committee com., 23E West\u2019s Ann. Corp. Code (1990 ed.) \u00a7 310, p. 155.) In referring to sections 310(a)(1) and 310(a)(2), the comment makes clear that the specified \u201capproval\u201d refers to the requirement that the vote be without the vote of the interested director. By contrast, with respect to section 310(a)(3), the comment does not mention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1944\">*1944</page-number>the disinterested vote requirement and instead states, \u201ca transaction may be validated if the person asserting its validity sustains the burden of proving that the transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it was approved.\u201d (Legis. committee com., <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Our conclusion is further supported by a respected authority on corporations law. (Friedman, Cal. Practice Guide: Corporations 2 (The Rutter Group 1996) \u00b6 6:223.2, p. 6-43 (Friedman).) Citing section 310(a)(3), Friedman states <em>\u201c[fjailure to obtain disinterested board or shareholder approval does not necessarily render an interested director contract void. </em>However, in such cases, the burden rests on the party seeking to <em>uphold </em>the contract ... to prove that it was \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 to the corporation at the time it was authorized or entered into. . . .\u201d (Friedman, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00b6 6:297, p. 6-55, first italics added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">To support his argument, Sammis relies exclusively on a section of the equally well-regarded treatise, Marsh\u2019s California Corporation Law. (2 Marsh, Marsh\u2019s Cal. Corp. Law (3d ed. 1996 supp.) \u00a7 11.8, pp. 836-840 (Marsh).) In discussing the interested director voting issue, Marsh opines that the Legislature did not intend section 310(a)(3) to apply to transactions involving a \u201c \u2018secret profit\u2019 made by a director or officer\u201d such as when the \u201cdirector . . . concealed his interest in a transaction in order to secure approval. . . .\u201d (Marsh, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 837.) Marsh relies on a line of older cases, holding that a director cannot assert a reasonableness defense when the director recovered \u201csecret profits\u201d (see <em>Western States Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lockwood </em>(1916) 173 Cal. 734, 739 [161 P. 498]) or when the transaction \u201camounted to a wilful and deliberate misappropriation of the funds ... in effect... an embezzlement . . . .\u201d (See <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Shingle </em>(1926) 198 Cal. 652, 658 [246 P. 1049, 46 A.L.R. 1156]; see also <em>Angelus Securities Corp. </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(1937) 20 Cal.App.2d 436, 440 [67 P.2d 158] [\u201c[t]he director must make a full disclosure of all pertinent facts or the transaction is voidable\u201d]; <em>Tevis </em>v. <em>Beigel </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 90, 98 [344 P.2d 360].)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Marsh\u2019s comments are inapplicable here. The case before us is not a \u201csecret profit\u201d or \u201cembezzlement\u201d type of case. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Stafford, the evidence did not show Stafford concealed his salary or that the salary amounted to a willful and deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1945\">*1945</page-number>misappropriation of corporate funds. The trial court\u2019s findings support a conclusion that Stafford, who was not experienced in corporate matters, reasonably relied on his attorney that a one-person board was appropriate, and that Stafford made no effort to conceal his salary from Sammis or from the board when the ratification occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Moreover, in the section relied upon by Sammis, Marsh observes: \u201cThe intent of [section 310(a)(3)] is that where the approval of the board cannot be obtained because a majority of the directors are interested or the vote of a majority of a quorum cannot be obtained because the interested director\u2019s vote is not counted, and the matter is not submitted to the shareholders, nevertheless the director is entitled to a defense on the basis that the transaction was just and reasonable as to the corporation, although he has the burden of proving that contention.\u201d (Marsh, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 837.) Here, when the ratification occurred, a majority of the board consisted of interested directors\u2014Stafford, his wife, and his sister. Accordingly, even under Marsh\u2019s view, this case falls within section 310(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Finally, we reject Sammis\u2019s reliance on his expert\u2019s opinion that the January 27, 1992, ratification was ineffective because \u201cit was done in a blanket fashion, not a separate consideration of each item of conduct. . . .\u201d Sammis fails to direct us to any statutory or decisional law prohibiting a general ratification as occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">II. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Kremer, P.
