J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acx\">Defendant raises various claims of error with respect to his sentencing under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1170.12). We hold defendant was properly sentenced under the Three Strikes law for his petty theft conviction and that his prior conviction qualifies as a strike. However, because the record is unclear as to whether the court understood it had the authority to strike defendant\u2019s prior conviction allegation and the authority to sentence his petty theft conviction as a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b), we reverse the judgment and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Defendant was charged with committing petty theft on October 27, 1994,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and having a prior theft-related conviction. (\u00a7 666.) Additionally, his 1989 felony conviction for assault with a deadly weapon was alleged as a prior conviction under section 1170.12. After a waiver of jury, defendant was found guilty under section 666, and his prior conviction was found true.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Defendant asked the court to sentence his petty theft conviction as a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b) or, in the alternative, to dismiss his strike under section 1385, subdivision (a). The court denied both requests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then selected the low term of 16 months for the violation of section 666 and doubled that term to 32 months under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">I. <em>Sentencing of Section 666 Under the Three Strikes Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Defendant argues that his petty theft conviction is a misdemeanor and thus he cannot be sentenced under the Three Strikes law, which pertains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>only to felonies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is important at the outset to clarify what defendant is <em>not </em>arguing. He does not contend that the same prior conviction cannot be used to elevate his petty theft conviction to a felony and to bring him within the Three Strikes sentencing scheme. Nor does he argue he has been subjected to multiple enhancements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, he contends that petty theft is always a misdemeanor and that section 666 merely provides for the <em>punishment </em>of petty theft as a felony when the defendant has a prior theft-related conviction that resulted in incarceration. He contends the Three Strikes scheme pertains only to offenses that are actually felonies, not those merely punished as felonies. Finally, he contends, section 666 is the exclusive means of punishing petty theft as a felony. We reject these arguments for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">First, defendant\u2019s position is based on an analysis no longer viable under California law. He relies principally upon <em>In re Boatwright </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 677 [15 P.2d 755] (Boatwright). There, the defendant was convicted of petty theft with prior convictions for which he had been incarcerated. He contended he could not be punished with a life sentence under the state\u2019s habitual offender statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for which his prior convictions otherwise qualified him. Instead, he argued, he was subject to a maximum penalty of five years under a sentencing statute specifically designed for those who commit petty theft and who have previously been convicted of a felony for which they served a term in a penal institution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (216 Cal. at p. 680.) The Supreme Court agreed: \u201cPetit larceny, or petit theft, is not of itself a felony, and becomes such only when it is superadded to some other offense of which the party charged has suffered conviction, and this is done, not to enlarge the scope of the crime, but to add to the punishment of the person who commits it, for his many prior violations of the law. [*]]] The language of our statute is so clear and unequivocal as to compel this court to hold that the legislature intended, by the enactment of said subdivision 2 of section 667 of the Penal Code, under which petitioner was convicted, that on a conviction of petit theft, no greater penalty is to be imposed than imprisonment for a period of five years, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had suffered other convictions and served time thereunder on more serious charges than the petit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>charge, of which he was lastly convicted. The section of the code deals <em>ex </em>industria[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] with a specific subject and leaves nothing open for construction.\u201d <em>(.Boatwright, supra, </em>at p. 683.) However, defendant\u2019s argument ignores the various statutory changes since <em>Boatwright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">At the time of Boatwright\u2019s offense, section 666 provided for the enhanced punishment of individuals who committed a new offense, having previously been convicted of petty theft.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the new offense was also a petty theft, the maximum sentence was five years in prison. (Former \u00a7 666, subd. 3; see Historical Note, 49 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code (1988 ed.) \u00a7 666, p. 651.) At the same time, former section 667 provided for the enhanced punishment of individuals who committed a new offense, having previously been convicted of a felony for which they served a term in a penal institution. As noted above, subdivision 2 of that section pertained specifically to those whose new offense was petty theft. (Stats. 1909, ch. 236, \u00a7 1, p. 364.) In 1931, the Legislature amended section 667 to refer solely to those who commit petty theft, having committed a felony for which they served a term in custody.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Stats. 1931, ch. 481, \u00a73, pp. 1051-1052.) The maximum punishment under section 667 remained five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In 1976, the Legislature passed the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act. (\u00a7 1170 et seq.; Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 273, p. 5140 et seq., operative July 1, 1977.) As part of that legislation, section 667 was repealed. Section 666 was refashioned to read much as it does today.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7\u00a7 266, 267, p. 5137.) Additionally, section 667.5 was enacted. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 268, pp. 5137-5138.) Section 667.5, subdivision (b) provides for the enhancement of any prison sentence by one year for each prior felony conviction resulting in a prison term. The holding in <em>Boatwright </em>was dictated by the indeterminate sentencing scheme operative at the time and the language of the particular statute in question. Consequently, it is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>The distinction between a misdemeanor and a felony is based upon the punishment prescribed. (\u00a7 17.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, section 666 does not describe a substantive offense but is, instead, a sentencing statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bouzas </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 467, 479 [279 Cal.Rptr. 847, 807 P.2d 1076].) Petty theft is ordinarily a misdemeanor because of the manner in which it is usually punished: by probation and/or time in the county jail. However, when a defendant has suffered any of the enumerated theft-related prior convictions, a subsequent petty theft can be a felony. (\u00a7 666.) If a felony punishment is selected by the court, the subsequent petty theft is not merely <em>punished as </em>a felony: it <em>is </em>a felony. Consequently, defendant was properly sentenced under section 1170.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for resentencing consistent with the opinions expressed in the nonpublished portions of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Parrilli, J., and Walker, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The voters passed section 1170.12 by initiative on November 8, 1994. The Legislature enacted the earlier version of the Three Strikes law on March 7,1994. (\u00a7 667, subds. (b) - (i).) Defendant was charged under section 1170.12, even though his new offense predated passage of the initiative. He properly should have been charged under the legislative version of the law. However, defendant has not raised that objection. Moreover, the result here would be the same had he been properly charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b402-13\">The court ruled as follows: \u201cAt this point then the Defendant\u2019s motion requesting the court to deem the matter a misdemeanor at this point would be denied.
