J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">The \u201ctiering\u201d provisions (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21068.5, 21093, 21094\u2014see fn. 5, <em>post) </em>of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq., or CEQA) enable a public agency to avoid, under some circumstances, having to undertake a repetitious analysis of significant environmental effects of a project when those effects have previously been addressed in an earlier environmental impact report (EIR). In the case before us a public agency approved an environmental impact report for a project calling for the creation of a 29,500-acre, 5,000-residen-tial-unit destination resort and residential community without an on-site water source, but deferred any analysis of significant environmental effects of supplying that water with the understanding that any such effects would be addressed in a later EIR to be prepared after the project was approved. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that the tiering provisions of CEQA do not exempt a public agency from the Public Resources Code section 21100, subdivision (b)(1) requirement that an EIR shall include a detailed statement setting forth \u201c[a]ll significant effects on the environment of the proposed project,\u201d and that under the facts of the present case the superior court erred in upholding the approval of an EIR which deferred any consideration of any significant environmental effects of supplying water to the new community.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">In 1993 respondent County of Stanislaus (County) certified an EIR for a proposed specific plan (the Diablo Grande Specific Plan, or plan) submitted by respondent Diablo Grande Limited Partnership (Diablo Grande) and calling for the creation of a 29,500-acre destination resort and residential community in southwest Stanislaus County. The resort community (the project) was to include scenic open spaces, a wilderness conservation area, six golf courses, swim and tennis facilities, a hotel and executive conference center, a winery, vineyards, a research campus, municipal facilities, a \u201ctown center,\u201d shops and offices, and five \u201cvillages\u201d containing a total of 5,000 residential units.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Certain portions of the project area had been restricted to agricultural use in accordance with so-called \u201cWilliamson Act contracts\u201d (see Gov. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00a7 51200 et seq.) between the property owners and the County. Under certain circumstances, such a contract can be canceled by a county at the request of a property owner. In this case the County canceled a portion of a Williamson Act contract so that the project could be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">After the County certified the EIR and canceled the Williamson Act contract, appellants brought a petition for writ of mandate asking the superior court to set aside the County\u2019s certification of the EIR and the County\u2019s cancellation of the Williamson Act contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied the petition and entered judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Appellants\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Appellants\u2019 primary contention on this appeal is that the EIR is legally inadequate because it does not \u201caddress the procurement and impacts of a permanent water supply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Second, appellants argue that the County\u2019s cancellation of the Williamson Act contract violated that act in several respects, including a violation of a purported requirement that such contracts may be canceled only in \u201cemergency\u201d situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">Third, appellants raise several conclusory arguments that the superior court erred in failing to find other violations of CEQA and of the California Endangered Species Act (CESA). With regard to CEQA, appellants contend that the EIR is inadequate because it fails to adequately address impacts on wildlife, vegetation and air quality. Appellants further contend that the court erred in failing to find that the EIR should have been recirculated for further public review as a result of comments submitted during the public comment period. With regard to CESA, appellants appear to argue that the County\u2019s adoption of the Diablo Grande Specific Plan constituted the \u201ctake\u201d of an endangered and threatened species, the San Joaquin kit fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">In part I of this opinion we will address appellants\u2019 primary argument, namely that the EIR is legally deficient because it fails to \u201caddress the procurement and impacts of a permanent water supply.\u201d In an unpublished portion of this opinion we will address appellants\u2019 contention that the County\u2019s violation of the Williamson Act contract was unlawful. In another unpublished portion we will turn to appellants\u2019 remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">A. <em>The Proposed Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On January 3,1991, respondent Diablo Grande submitted a formal application to the County for adoption of a specific plan for a 29,500-acre destination resort community. Diablo Grande also submitted applications for approvals of a general plan amendment and a rezoning consistent with the plan and a completed environmental questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The draft specific plan was \u201cprepared to meet the requirements contained in section 65450 et seq. of the Government Code.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The draft specific plan called for over 18,700 acres of open space, 5,000 residential units of various sizes and types clustered in 5 villages, a hotel and conference center, 6 golf courses, a swim and tennis club, a winery and vineyard, a research campus and certain supporting facilities. It envisioned that development would occur in four overlapping phases over twenty-five years. Phase 1 was to be completed in year 15. Phase 2 would begin in year five and end in year fifteen. Phase 3 would begin in year 10 and end in year 20. Phase 4 would begin in year 15 and end in year 25. Each phase was to cover a different area of the overall plan area and required approval of a \u201cPreliminary Development Plan\u201d (PDP), which would establish the general regulations for development within the PDP area.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The draft specific plan included a PDP for the first 15-year phase of development covering roughly 2,000 acres and the construction of the primary access road. The phase 1 PDP encompassed most of the first village, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>2,000 residential units, the hotel and conference center, the swim and tennis club, 2 golf courses and the access roads. A \u201cmini-phase 1\" development for the first five years of phase 1 (also referred to as the Five Year Plan) included one golf course and clubhouse, the winery and vineyard, the hotel, a maintenance center, the first phase of the swim and tennis club and two hundred residential units.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The general plan amendment was requested by Diablo Grande to change the land-use designation of the project area in the County\u2019s general plan from \u201cagriculture\u201d to designations consistent with the project. Similarly, the rezoning was requested to change the project area zoning to zoning consistent with the project. Diablo Grande also requested that the County cancel a contract which restricted the property within the phase 1 area to agricultural use for property tax purposes pursuant to the Williamson Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">B. <em>The Environmental Setting of the Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The 29,500-acre project area, all of which is owned by Diablo Grande, is located in the foothills of the Diablo Range. The Diablo Range forms the western rim of the San Joaquin Valley and is in the southwestern area of the County. The area consists of gently sloping to steep ridges, vegetated primarily with nonnative grasses, native trees (dominated by blue oak) and brush. There are many animal and plant species present or potentially present in the project area, including some of \u201cspecial status.\u201d Portions of the area have been identified as potential habitat for the San Joaquin kit fox (considered an endangered species) but no kit fox have been observed in the area. The access roads, however, traverse kit fox habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The project area is generally dry although there are some riparian habitats, stemming from intermittent creeks, stock ponds and springs. The area does not contain enough on-site sources of water to support the project and, as the draft specific plan stated, \u201coff-site water must be obtained for both residential and commercial purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The project area is now being and has been used for years as rangeland for livestock. Less than 1 percent of the area (approximately 200 acres, located in the phase 4 and 5 areas) is considered \u201cprime\u201d agricultural land. Given the nature of the soil and the slope and the limited on-site water, the rest of the area is considered \u201climited base\u201d agricultural land, suited for activities such as grazing. Parts of the area have \u201clittle grazing value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The surrounding region, from the Altamont Pass in Alameda County to the southern tip of the Temblor Range in Kern County, is little different in terms of use and biology. There are no cities of any appreciable size. The immediately adjacent properties (51 parcels with 28 owners) were also used for rangeland and also are not considered to be prime agricultural land.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We will present other facts pertinent to this appeal in conjunction with our discussions of the issues to which those facts pertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Adequacy of the EIR re Water Supply</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In order to place into a meaningful context appellants\u2019 contention of inadequacy of the EIR, we begin with an overview of the CEQA review process and of CEQA\u2019s requirement that an EIR address the significant impacts of a proposed project. We then restate the law pertaining to the standard by which this court undertakes judicial review of the superior court\u2019s determination of CEQA compliance. We then turn to the core issue before us\u2014whether the superior court erred in determining that the EIR\u2019s treatment of significant environmental effects of supplying water to the proposed project was legally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">A. <em>The CEQA Review Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">In <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 231, 864 P.2d 502] (also known as <em>Laurel Heights II </em>so as to distinguish it from <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376 [253 Cal.Rptr. 426, 764 P.2d 278], or <em>Laurel Heights I), </em>the California Supreme Court provided the following overview of the CEQA review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u201cWe have repeatedly recognized that the EIR is the \u2018heart of CEQA.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions <em>before </em>they are made. Thus, the EIR \u201cprotects not only the environment but also informed self-government.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] To this end, public participation is an \u2018essential part of the CEQA process.\u2019 [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">\u201cWith certain limited exceptions, a public agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a proposed project \u2018may have a significant effect on the environment.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018 \u201cSignificant effect on the environment\u201d means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201cWhen an EIR is required, the lead agency initially prepares a draft EIR. Once the draft EIR is completed, a comment period is provided for the public and interested agencies. [Citations.] Public hearings to discuss the draft EIR are encouraged, but not required. [Citation.] The comment period is generally no shorter than 30 days and no longer than 90 days. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u201cIn the course of preparing a final EIR, the lead agency must evaluate and respond to comments relating to significant environmental issues. [Citations.] In particular, the lead agency must explain in detail its reasons for rejecting suggestions and proceeding with the project despite its environmental effects. [Citation.] \u2018There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in response [to the comments received]. Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, it is plain that the final EIR will almost always contain information not included in the draft EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u201cThe final substantive step in the EIR review process is certification of the final EIR. The lead agency is required to certify that the final EIR has been completed in compliance with CEQA, and that it reviewed and considered the information in the final EIR prior to approving the project. [Citation.] CEQA also requires that, before approving a project, the lead agency \u2018find either that the project\u2019s significant environmental effects identified in the [final] EIR have been avoided or mitigated or that the unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project\u2019s benefits. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u201cIf the lead agency adds \u2018significant new information\u2019 to the EIR subsequent to the close of the public comment period but <em>prior </em>to certification of the final EIR, CEQA requires that the lead agency provide a new public comment period. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u201cThe statutory scheme also provides for an additional public comment period <em>after </em>the certification of a final EIR if: (1) \u2018substantial changes in the project\u2019 are made; (2) \u2018substantial changes\u2019 occur regarding the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken; or (3) \u2018new information, which was not known and could not have been known,\u2019 when the EIR was certified, becomes available. [Citations.] The Guidelines in turn generally define \u2018new information\u2019 as information which shows that the project will have new or more severe \u2018significant effects\u2019 on the environment not disclosed in the prior EIR. [Citation.] A \u2018significant effect\u2019 is further defined in the Guidelines as a \u2018substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 1123-1126, fns. omitted.) An EIR must address a proposed project\u2019s \u201csignificant effect on the environment.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21100, subd. (b).) See also Guidelines (Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq.) section 15126, subdivision (a) (the EIR \u201cshall identify and focus on the significant environmental effects of the proposed project\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">B. <em>Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>City of Murrieta </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 170], the court summarized the law pertaining to judicial <em>review </em>of agency determinations under CEQA. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201c \u2018In an action to set aside an agency\u2019s determination under [CEQA], the appropriate standard of review is determined by the nature of the proceeding below. . . . [S]ection 21168 \u201cestablishes the standard of review in administrative mandamus proceedings\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, while section 21168.5 \u201cgoverns traditional mandamus actions\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. [Citation.] The former section applies to proceedings normally termed \u201cquasi-adjudicative,\u201d \u201cin which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in a public agency . . . .\u201d [Citations.] The latter section applies to all other actions taken pursuant to CEQA and generally encompasses \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d decisions made by a public agency. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">\u201cThe distinction, however, is rarely significant. In either case, the issue before the trial court is whether the agency abused its discretion. Abuse of discretion is shown if (1) the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or (2) the determination is not supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">\u2018\u201c[I]n undertaking judicial review pursuant to Sections 21168 and 21168.5, courts shall continue to follow the established principle that there is no presumption that error is prejudicial.\u2019 [Citation.] However, \u2018non-compliance with the information disclosure provisions of [CEQA] which precludes relevant information from being presented to the public agency, or noncompliance with substantive requirements of [CEQA], may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of Sections 21168 and 21168.5, regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied with those provisions.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">\u201cOn appeal, the appellate court\u2019s \u2018task ... is the same as that of the trial court: that is, to review the agency\u2019s actions to determine whether the agency complied with procedures required by law.\u2019 [Citation.] The appellate court reviews the administrative record independently; the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>court\u2019s conclusions are not binding on it. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Gentry </em>v. <em>City of Murrieta, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1374-1376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The standard by which an EIR\u2019s analysis of a significant environmental impact is tested is set forth in Guidelines section 15151, which states: \u201cAn EIR should be prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences. An evaluation of the environmental effects of a proposed project need not be exhaustive, but the sufficiency of an EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is reasonably feasible. Disagreement among experts does not make an EIR inadequate, but the EIR should summarize the main points of disagreement among the experts. The courts have looked not for perfection but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full disclosure.\u201d (See also <em>San Francisco Ecology Center </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 584 [122 Cal.Rptr. 100]; <em>Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. </em>v. <em>32nd Dist.

Chino Basin Mun. Water Dist. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1609, 1617 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 688]; <em>County of Inyo </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 189 [139 Cal.Rptr. 396]; <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 346, 350 [194 Cal.Rptr. 203]; <em>Christward Ministry </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 31, 40 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 435].) <em>Laurel Heights I </em>further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cThis standard of review is consistent with the requirement that the agency\u2019s approval of an EIR \u2018shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u2019 [Citation.] In applying the substantial evidence standard, \u2018the reviewing court must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative finding and decision.\u2019 [Citations.] The Guidelines define \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 as \u2018enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\u201cA court may not set aside an agency\u2019s approval of an EIR on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable. [Citation.] A court\u2019s task is not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument when the dispute is whether adverse effects have been mitigated or could be better mitigated. We have neither the resources nor scientific expertise to engage in such analysis, even if the statutorily prescribed standard of review permitted us to do so. Our limited function is consistent with the principle that \u2018The purpose of CEQA is not to generate paper, but to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind. CEQA does not, indeed cannot, guarantee that these decisions will always be those which favor environmental considerations.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights I, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at pp. 392-393; in accord, see <em>Western States Petroleum Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 573-574 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 139, 888 P.2d 1268]; see also Kostka &amp; Zischke, Practice Under the Cal. Environmental Quality Act (Cont.Ed.Bar 1996) \u00a7\u00a7 12.3 through 12.8, pp. 459 to 468.1.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">C. <em>The EIR Was Inadequate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The EIR in the present case stated in part: \u201cThe project\u2019s water supply system will involve any one or a number of the following: offsite groundwater, water purchases and exchanges, participation in water conservation projects with other water districts in exchange for water saved; utilization of wastewater effluent, both onsite and acquired offsite; development of groundwater storage facilities in Madera County; utilization of the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal for exchange deliveries; and playing an active role in the existing trading network among California water districts south of the Delta.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The EIR also pointed out that the completed project would require approximately 13,000 acre-feet per year of water, or approximately 11,500,000 gallons per day. Phase 1, which would include the golf course and clubhouse, the winery, 40 acres of vineyards, 200 single-family residential units, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and the swim and tennis center, would itself require 5,000 acre-feet of water per year. The first five years of phase 1 (the so-called mini-phase 1) would itself require one thousand two hundred acre-feet per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Among the \u201csignificant unavoidable impacts\u201d listed in the EIR was the following: \u201cThe project would require the provision of approximately 12,880 acre-feet of water per year at buildout from an off-site source for domestic, irrigation, and for light industrial uses. A firm water supply has not yet been established beyond the first five years of development, although the applicant is pursuing several sources, and a water district has been created. <em>Until such a source is established, this is considered a significant impact. </em>Upon establishment of such a source, off-site unmitigated impacts may occur from the transfer and use of the water.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The EIR attempted to deal with this \u201csignificant unavoidable impact\u201d by including the following so-called \u201cmitigation measure\u201d: \u201cBecause long-term water supplies beyond the five-year buildout have not been assured, development requiring over 1,200 acre-feet per year of water shall not be permitted unless the applicant can show to the County\u2019s satisfaction that adequate water supplies have been made available, and that environmental impacts of those sources have been studied and mitigated per CEQA requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The EIR also stated that \u201cbecause adequate water supplies for the project at full buildout have not been secured, provision of those supplies could result in potentially significant impacts\u201d and that \u201c[ajdditional environmental review of further water acquisition projects will be required as part of the water acquisition process or as part of further detailed project-level review for future phases of development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The County in essence approved an EIR for a 25-year project when water for the project had not been assured beyond the first 5 years of the 15-year first phase of the project. The County knew neither the source of the water the project would use beyond the first five years, nor what significant environmental effects might be expected when the as yet unknown water source (or sources) is ultimately used.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">In our view, the County\u2019s approval of the project under these circumstances defeated a fundamental purpose of CEQA: to \u201cinform the public and responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made.\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights II, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1123; <em>Citizens of Goleta Valley </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 564.) The CEQA EIR process \u201cprotects not only the environment but also informed self-government.\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights II, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1123; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 564; <em>Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d at p. 392.) See also Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15002, subdivision (a)(1), which points out that one of the \u201cbasic purposes\u201d of CEQA is to \u201c[i]nform governmental decision-makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Similarly, numerous cases have stated that a purpose of CEQA is \u201cto compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind.\u201d <em>(Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283 [118 Cal.Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017]; <em>Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d at p. 393; <em>Kings County Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>City of Hanford </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 711 [270 Cal.Rptr. 650].) This informational purpose of CEQA is crucial to informed decisionmaking. CEQA \u201cdoes not, indeed cannot, guarantee that these decisions will always be those which favor environmental considerations.\u201d <em>(Bozung, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 283; <em>Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d at p. 393; <em>Kings County, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 711; A <em>Local &amp; Regional Monitor </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1773, 1809 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 358].) CEQA does, however, guarantee or at least attempt to assure that the environmental consequences of a government decision on whether to approve a project will be considered before, not after, that decision is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The case of <em>Santiago County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818 [173 Cal.Rptr. 602] is remarkably similar to the present case. In <em>Santiago </em>the County of Orange approved an EIR which had been prepared in order to examine the consequences of permitting a mining company to operate a sand and gravel mining operation. The EIR contained no information demonstrating that any water supplier had agreed to provide water to the project and no information about what the environmental effects would be even if the local water district (or any other supplier) could and would supply water for the project. The County of Orange found that the EIR was complete and adequate, and approved a site permit for the sand and gravel project. The approval of the site permit was made subject to certain conditions. One of the conditions was that \u201c \u2018[p]rior to commencement of mining operations or the issuance of a sand and gravel extraction permit, the operator shall establish an adequate water supply and appurtenant system to supply the water needs of the mining operation, processing plant and reclamation irrigation.\u2019 \u201d (118 Cal.App.3d at p. 828.) The superior court denied a petition for writ of mandate challenging the approval of the EIR. The Court of Appeal reversed and pointed out that an EIR \u201c \u2018should be prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision makers with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of environmental consequences.\u2019 \u201d (118 Cal.App.3d at p. 831; see also Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The EIR in <em>Santiago </em>failed to include \u201cfacts from which to evaluate the pros and cons of supplying the amount of water that the mine will need.\u201d (118 Cal.App.3d at p. 829.) In <em>San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center </em>v. <em>County of Stanislaus </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 704], this court relied in part on <em>Santiago </em>to conclude that an EIR for a 900-home residential development was inadequate because it failed to contain any analysis of the environmental effects of the sewer expansion which was part of the project but which had simply been omitted from the project description. We stated that the sewer expansion was a crucial element of the development project, but that \u201c[h]ere, as in <em>Santiago, </em>the EIR ignored the environmental effects of the excluded element, thereby frustrating a \u2018core goal[] of CEQA.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Respondent Diablo Grande candidly concedes that \u201cthere is no analysis of the potential impacts of the eventual long-term supply\u201d of water. Respondents attempt to justify this omission by relying on the \u201ctiering\u201d provisions of CEQA. As we shall explain, however, a decision to \u201ctier\u201d environmental review does not excuse a governmental entity from complying with CEQA\u2019s mandate to prepare, or cause to be prepared, an environmental impact report on any project that may have a significant effect on the environment, with that report to include a detailed statement setting forth \u201c[a]ll significant effects on the environment of the proposed project.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Public Resources Code sections 21068.5, 21093 and 21094 govern the use of \u201ctiered\u201d EIR\u2019s.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those statutes appear to evidence a legislative intent to free a lead agency from having to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, each time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>an EIR is prepared on one of a series of projects when some of the significant environmental effects of those projects could be analyzed once at the outset. The authors of Practice Under the California Environmental Quality Act (Cont.Ed.Bar 1995) state at section 11.4 on page 432 that \u201c[t]he tiering of EIRs allows agencies to evaluate broad environmental issues, to respond to those issues in an EIR prepared at the planning stage, and to provide detailed examination of specific issues in EIRs on later development projects that are consistent with or implement the approved plan.\u201d Consider, for example, a series of five new downtown office building construction projects. Each might be expected to generate significant additional automobile traffic. Rather than present a new traffic impact analysis in each of five EIR\u2019s, a \u201cfirst tier\u201d EIR might be used to analyze traffic impacts and other common environmental impacts expected to result from the five projects. The later EIR\u2019s on the individual projects would then \u201crefer to\u201d the first-tier EIR for analysis of traffic impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21094, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Respondents argue that because they intend to undertake site-specific environmental review of each of the four \u201cphases\u201d of development, they can properly defer analysis of the environmental impacts of supplying water to the project until the actual source of that supply is selected sometime in the future. But \u201ctiering\u201d is not a device for deferring the identification of significant environmental impacts that the adoption of a specific plan can be expected to cause. The County in this case could not make an informed decision on whether to adopt the Diablo Grande Specific Plan without being informed, to some reasonable degree, of the environmental consequences of supplying water to a 5,000-residential-unit development which has no on-site water source.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, the environmental consequences of supplying water to this project would appear to be one of the most fundamental and general \u201cgeneral matters\u201d to be addressed in a first-tier EIR. (See Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21068.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Respondents rely on <em>Al Larson Boat Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Harbor Commissioners </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 729 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 618] to attempt to justify their deferral of an identification of environmental impacts to be caused by providing water to the project. In our view <em>Al Larson </em>is distinguishable. In that case the Board of Commissioners of the City of Long Beach prepared a first-tier EIR in connection with approval of an amendment to a \u201cport master plan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 736.) The amendment was described in the opinion as a \u201cfive-year plan of the Board to increase Port cargo handling capacity in the short-term through the means of six \u2018anticipated\u2019 projects . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 743.) Each of the six \u201canticipated\u201d projects was to itself undergo CEQA review. The <em>Al Larson </em>court rejected a contention that the first-tier EIR was legally inadequate for failing to discuss alternative sites for each of the six \u201canticipated\u201d projects. The court stated that the project which was the subject of the first-tier EIR was not \u201cthe \u2018approval\u2019 of any of the \u2018anticipated\u2019 projects or their locations\u201d but rather was instead the aforementioned \u201cfive-year plan of the Board to increase Port cargo handling capacity in the short-term through the means of the six \u2018anticipated\u2019 projects . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court stated: \u201cWithout question, alternatives to each of the six \u2018anticipated\u2019 projects had to be considered at some point. The real issue is when. The \u2018determination of the earliest feasible time to [prepare an EIR] is to be made initially by the agency itself, which decision must be respected in the absence of manifest abuse.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (18 Cal.App.4th at p. 743.) In the present case, however, the specific plan calls for the construction of 5,000 residential units and other water-using improvements (e.g., golf courses). No matter what subsequent environmental review might take place, and no matter what additional mitigation measures might be adopted to ameliorate adverse environmental impacts on each of the four \u201cphases\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>planned development, the project was going to need water from some source or sources. To defer any analysis whatsoever of the impacts of supplying water to this project until after the adoption of the specific plan calling for the project to be built would appear to be putting the cart before the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Some of the difficulty in applying the tiering concept appears to result from the fact that an EIR is prepared for a \u201cproject\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21100, 21065) and that when tiering is used, there appear to be two or more \u201cprojects.\u201d Public Resources Code sections 21068.5 and 21093 refer to a \u201cpolicy, plan, program, or ordinance\u201d for which an EIR has been prepared. (See also Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21094 [program, plan, policy, or ordinance] and Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 15385 [program, plan, or policy] and \u00a7 15168 [program].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A first-tier EIR or \u201cprogram EIR\u201d (see Guidelines, \u00a7 15168) is then utilized in connection with an EIR on a \u201clater project\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21094, subd. (d)). Although Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Resources Code sections 21068.5, 21093 and 21094 do not appear to expressly say so, the \u201cprogram, plan, policy or ordinance\u201d is itself a \u201cproject.\u201d Section 15168 of the Guidelines appears to acknowledge at least indirectly that a \u201cprogram\u201d is a \u201cproject\u201d by stating that a \u201cprogram EIR is an EIR which may be prepared on a series of actions that can be characterized as one large project. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">It is crucial, however, for a government decision maker to know what the \u201cproject\u201d is that the decision maker is approving. Numerous cases have stated that \u201c[ojnly through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal\u2019s benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal . . . and weigh other alternatives in the balance\u201d and that \u201c[a]n accurate, stable and finite project description is the <em>sine qua non </em>of an informative and legally sufficient EIR.\u201d <em>(County of Inyo </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.3d at pp. 192-193; <em>Santiago County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>County of Orange, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 830; <em>San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center </em>v. <em>County of Stanislaus, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 713, 732; <em>Sacramento Old City Assn. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1023 [280 Cal.Rptr. 478].) Respondents assert that the EIR in the present case is both a \u201cprogram EIR\u201d for the County\u2019s adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Diablo Grande Specific Plan and a \u201cproject-level\u201d EIR for phase 1 of that specific plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The amendment of a general plan is a \u201cproject\u201d within the meaning of CEQA\u2019s definition of that term. <em>(City of Santa Ana </em>v. <em>City of Garden Grove </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 521, 529-533 [160 Cal.Rptr. 907]; <em>Black Property Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 985; see also Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21065 and Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15378, subd. (a)(1).) The County\u2019s amendment of its general plan to include the Diablo Grande Specific Plan was therefore itself a \u201cproject.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Calling it a \u201cprogram\u201d does not relieve the County from having to address the significant environmental effects of that project. Respondents are therefore incorrect in asserting that the County may (1) deem the environmental effects of adopting the specific plan, whatever those effects may be, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>be significant, then (2) approve the specific plan, and then (3) at some later time determine what the significant environmental effects are of the specific plan that has already been approved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The County did not here simply adopt or amend a general plan so as to permit the building of homes and golf courses. The County adopted a specific plan calling for the construction of those facilities and of other particularly described facets of the Diablo Grande Specific Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At oral argument before this court, respondent Diablo Grande emphasized four cases which it contends bolster its view that the EIR in the present case was adequate and that all analysis of any significant environmental effects of supplying water to the proposed project may be deferred to a later time. These are <em>Village Laguna of Laguna Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 1022 [185 Cal.Rptr. 41], <em>Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center </em>v. <em>County of Solano, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 351, <em>Sacramento Old City Assn. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1011, and <em>Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Tuolumne </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 664 [188 Cal.Rptr. 233]. In our view, none of these four cases is comparable to the present case and none of them support the view that all analysis of significant environmental effects of supplying water to a 5,000-residential-unit development may properly be deferred until after an EIR for the specific plan for such a development has been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In <em>Village Laguna, supra, </em>the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved an EIR for a general plan amendment calling for development of a \u201cnew city\u201d in southwest Orange County near Laguna Beach. The EIR discussed various alternatives for the new city, including \u201cplans for the development of 0, 7,500, 10,000, 20,000, and 25,000 dwelling units\u201d in the proposed new city. <em>(Village Laguna of Laguna Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 1028.) The appellant argued that the EIR was deficient because of a \u201cfailure of the EIR to consider as an alternative the development of \u2018some number\u2019 of dwelling units between . . . 10,000 . . . and . . . 20,000 . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court rejected this argument. It noted that there were \u201cliterally thousands of \u2018reasonable alternatives\u2019 to the proposed project.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It stated that \u201cthe building of 1,000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>16,000, 22,500, and 20,001 homes are reasonable alternatives\u201d but that \u201cno one would argue that the EIR is insufficient for failure to describe the 20,001 home alternative.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court then stated: \u201c \u2018Absolute protection is not required; what is required is the production of information sufficient to permit a reasonable choice of alternatives so far as environmental aspects are concerned.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1029.) We fail to see how <em>Village Laguna </em>helps respondents\u2019 position at all. <em>Village Laguna </em>is about whether an EIR\u2019s discussion of alternatives was adequate. The issue in the present case is not whether there was an adequate discussion of alternatives, but whether the EIR in this case was somehow excused from the statutory mandate that an EIR \u201cshall include a detailed statement setting forth . . . [a] 11 significant effects on the environment of the proposed project.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21100, subd. (b)(1); see also Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15126, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In <em>Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center </em>v. <em>County of Solano, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 351, the County of Solano certified an EIR for a \u201chazardous waste management plan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 362.) \u201cThe stated purpose of this Plan was to review and analyze existing hazardous waste disposal facilities, . . . and identify \u2018site selection criteria for new or expanded . . . facilities, to accommodate projected needs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 363.) The appellant argued that the EIR was deficient because of the \u201comission of any description of specific potential future facilities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 371.) The court rejected this argument and stated: \u201cThe flaw in appellant\u2019s argument is that the Plan makes no commitment to future facilities other than furnishing siting criteria and designating generally acceptable locations. While the Plan suggests that new facilities may be needed by the County, no siting decisions are made; the Plan does not even determine that future facilities will ever be built. Both the Plan and the FEIR consistently state that no actual future sites have been recommended or proposed.\u201d (5 Cal.App.4th at p. 371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The present project, in contrast, does identify the specific location of each of the five proposed villages, and the timing of the construction of those villages in four separate phases. The project here is not merely a general policy document, but an actual specific plan. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 65451 &amp; fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>The <em>Rio Vista </em>court noted that \u201c[t]he Plan does not select or recommend any specific sites for hazardous waste disposal facilities.\u201d (5 Cal.App.4th at p. 364.) The project in the present case does designate the specific sites for future development, and describes what structures the future development will consist of. <em>Rio Vista </em>also points out, just as we do in this case, that CEQA \u201crequires . . . that an EIR discuss \u2018[t]he significant environmental effects of the proposed project.\u2019 \u201d (5 Cal.App.4th at p. 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\"><em>Sacramento Old City Assn. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1011, involved the adequacy of an EIR for a project \u201cto expand the downtown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Sacramento Convention Center complex (the center) and to construct an office tower at 1325 J Street (the office tower).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1015.) The issue was whether the EIR adequately analyzed \u201cthe potential environmental effects of the parking necessitated by the project.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1019.) The EIR in that case did analyze the project\u2019s effect on parking. It included detailed proposals on how to handle the additional parking spaces that would be needed. (See 229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1019-1023.) The appellants contended that the EIR was inadequate because the EIR did not specify which of the seven different parking mitigation measures discussed in the EIR would actually be adopted. The court rejected this argument and concluded that the EIR sufficiently addressed the project\u2019s impacts on parking. By contrast, respondents in the present case flatly contend that they may simply defer any analysis whatsoever of any significant environmental effects which might result from the supplying of water to the project. <em>Sacramento Old City Assn. </em>thus does not help respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Tuolumne, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.3d 664, the challenge was to the adequacy of the EIR for a general plan adopted by the County of Tuolumne. The appellant\u2019s arguments in <em>Twain Harte </em>did not include any contention that the county had failed to address any significant environmental impacts of the plan, but rather that the EIR\u2019s analysis of those impacts was not sufficiently detailed. The court rejected that contention. It concluded that the EIR \u201cmay not have been exhaustive but it was an adequate, complete, reasoned analysis, and a good faith effort at full disclosure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.) <em>Twain Harte </em>does not persuade us that an EIR may simply defer any statement setting forth a significant environmental effect of a proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Respondents\u2019 contention that the EIR is legally sufficient as a \u201cproject level\u201d or second-tier EIR for phase 1 of the Diablo Grande Specific Plan is similarly unpersuasive. Phase 1 will last 15 years, but only the water source for the first 5 years (the so-called \u201cmini-phase 1\u201d) has been identified and examined. The source of water, and any significant environmental effects of supplying that water, for years six through fifteen of phase 1 were not disclosed in the EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">We are not concluding respondent must first find a source of water for the \u201cproject\u201d before an EIR will be adequate. We are concluding that an EIR for this project must address the impact of supplying water for the project. It is not mitigation of a significant environmental impact on a project to say that if the impact is not addressed then the project will not be built. The decision not to build may well rest upon the absence of a suitable or adequate water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>source. However, the decision to approve the EIR of this project does require recognition that water must be supplied, that it will come from a specific source or one of several possible sources, of what the impact will be if supplied from a particular source or possible sources and if that impact is adverse how it will be addressed. While it might be argued that not building a portion of the project is the ultimate mitigation, it must be borne in mind that the EIR must address the project and assumes the project will be built.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We do not by this opinion place any new burdens on preparers of EIR\u2019s. Our opinion today is merely an affirmation of already existing law. \u201cDrafting an EIR . . . necessarily involves some degree of forecasting. While forecasting the unforeseeable is not possible, an agency must use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can.\u201d (Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15144.) Because the specific plan here (and also phase 1 of the development) unquestionably and admittedly contemplate the supplying of water to a large development, respondent County must \u201cattempt in good faith to fulfill its obligation under CEQA to provide sufficient meaningful information regarding the types of activity and environmental effects that are reasonably foreseeable\u201d from that supplying of water. <em>(Laurel Heights I, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 399.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">For the reasons stated in part I of this opinion, the judgment is reversed.

In addition, all property within the site is proposed to have underlying or combining General Plan designations contained in the Stanislaus County General Plan (Table III.D-A). The site is currently designated Agriculture in the County\u2019s General Plan. Zoning on the site is proposed to be changed from A-2-160, General Agriculture District, with two dwellings allowed for every 160 acres, to S-P, \u2018Specific Plan,\u2019 pursuant to Chapter 21.38 of the Stanislaus County Zoning Ordinance.

[']\u25a1 Under the General Plan amendment and rezoning, development of five \u2018villages\u2019 is proposed including recreational, residential, open space, resort, office, commercial, agricultural, and other land uses.

The program-level analysis enables government decision makers and the public to examine the overall effects of the proposed project and to avoid or reduce adverse environmental impacts. Upon preparation of detailed proposed preliminary development plans within the Specific Plan, future project-specific environmental studies will be provided. The project-level environmental analysis of Phase 1 is to determine the extent of potential impacts associated with the specific proposed land uses and to recommend mitigation measures to offset impacts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">See also Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15165, which states: \u201cWhere individual projects are, or a phased project is, to be undertaken and where the total undertaking comprises a project with significant environmental effect, the lead agency shall prepare a single program EIR for the ultimate project as described in Section 15168.
