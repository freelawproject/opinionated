J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2u\">The Family Code authorizes the obligee of a family support order to obtain an \u201cearnings assignment order for support\u201d (hereafter assignment order) which may be served on the holder of \u201cearnings,\u201d e.g., wages or other payments due the obligor as a result of an enforceable obligation. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 5200 et seq.) Some payments that might otherwise count as \u201cearnings\u201d are shielded from assignment by incorporation of the exemptions from execution in the Code of Civil Procedure. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 5206.) By this measure the benefits from a disability insurance policy are exempt from enforcement by an assignment order. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 703.070, subd. (b), 704.130, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">If the obligee improvidently serves the assignment order on an exempt source of income the Family Code provides no remedy for the obligor whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>income is wrongly levied. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5270, 5271.) However, the superior court, in the exercise of its equitable powers, may quash the service of an assignment order which has been improvidently served.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In this case the assignment order was served on an exempt source of income, the obligor\u2019s disability insurer. There being no equitable defense to the motion to quash service on the disability insurer, we will direct the trial court to quash the service of the assignment order on the disability insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Craig A. Wilkes (Husband) and petitioner Jeanine I. Johnson-Wilkes (Wife) were married in March 1986. They have two minor children, Tawni Irene, bom in September 1986, and Craig Allan, bom in May 1988. The couple separated in August 1988 and their marriage was dissolved in November 1989. Wife assumed primary physical custody of the minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">A judgment of dissolution of marriage ordered Husband to support his minor children. In June 1993, the Tehama County District Attorney obtained an assignment order (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5208, 5252, subd. (a)), to enforce a monthly obligation of $2,196 and an arrearage of $47,011.94. In August 1994 he served the order on Husband\u2019s disability insurer, Paul Revere Insurance Company, which he avers provides his only source of income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In July 1995 Husband filed a motion to quash the assignment order \u201cplaced on [his] Disability Benefits with Paul Revere Insurance Company\u201d on the ground they are exempt from the enforcement of a child support obligation. (\u00a7\u00a7 703.070, 704.130; Fam. Code, \u00a7 5206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">On appeal, Husband renews his claim that the service of the assignment order on Paul Revere Insurance Company should have been quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">We will grant him the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>Benefits From a Disability Insurance Policy Are Exempt From an Assignment Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The Family Code provides for the enforcement of a family support order by an \u201cearnings assignment order\u201d that directs an \u201cemployer\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of an obligor to pay to the obligee some portion of the amount ordered in support. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 5200 et seq.) The income subject to the assignment order is defined by the interrelated provisions of two codes. The Family Code sets forth the income subject to the order. The Code of Civil Procedure sets forth the income which is exempt from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Put briefly, Family Code section 5206 broadly defines the \u201cearnings\u201d subject to an assignment order but subjects them, by incorporation of provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, to the exemptions applicable to an order of execution. By this measure, the benefits made subject to the assignment order in this case are exempt as \u201cbenefits from a disability . . . insurance policy . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 704.130; see also \u00a7 703.070.) This exemption is not preempted by section 704.115, as claimed by Wife, since that section applies to the wholly different category of benefits, including disability payments, from a \u201cprivate retirement plan . . . .\u201d We explain in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">An \u201c \u2018[ejamings assignment order for support\u2019 \u201d is \u201can order that assigns to an obligee a portion of the <em>earnings </em>of a support obligor due or to become due in the future.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 5208, italics added.) Family Code section 5206 broadly defines the \u201cearnings\u201d subject to an assignment order to include \u201c[a]ny . . . payments or credits due or becoming due as a result of an enforceable obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201c \u2018earnings\u2019 that may be reached under an earnings assignment order are broader than those that may be garnished under an earnings withholding order for support,\u201d which are limited to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>subject to wage garnishment. (4 Cal. Family Law, Practice &amp; Procedure (2d ed. 1996) \u00a7 141.02[3]; compare Fam. Code, \u00a7 5206 with \u00a7 706.011, subds. (a), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">However, Family Code section 5206 limits the \u201cearnings\u201d subject to an assignment order <em>\u201cto the extent that they are subject to an earnings assignment order for support under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 703.010) of Division 2 of Title 9 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure </em>[hereafter chapter 4].\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 5206, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Chapter 4 sets forth the kinds of income and property which are exempt from a writ of execution. The italicized language sensibly means that the exemptions applicable to an order of execution also apply to an assignment order unless an exception applicable to an assignment order applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (4 Cal. Family Law, Practice &amp; Procedure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 141.31.) This reading dovetails with the provisions of section 703.070, subdivision (a) that: \u201cThe exemptions provided by this chapter [chapter 4] or by any other statute apply to a judgment for child, family, or spousal support.\u201d This provision is generally implemented by subdivision (b), which provides that: \u201cIf property is exempt without making a claim, the property is not subject to being applied to the satisfaction of a judgment for child, family or spousal support.\u201d Both these provisions and the provision which historically preceded Family Code section 5206, Civil Code section 4701, subdivision (1), were enacted in the same 1982 legislative session and made operative on the same date, July 1, 1983. (Cf. Stats. 1982, ch. 1364, \u00a7 2, p. 5148, and Stats. 1982, ch. 497, \u00a7 17, p. 2141, operative July 1, 1983.) The Law Revision Commission Comment to the 1982 addition to section 703.070 explains: \u201cSubdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 703.070 codify the case law rule that exemptions [to an order of execution] apply to the enforcement of support unless there is a specific exception.\u201d (17 West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 703.070 (1987 ed.) p. 295; see also legis. committee com. - Senate 1982 addition to Civ. Code, \u00a7 4701, 12A West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1983 ed.) p. 517.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>By this measure we are directed to determine whether the disability insurance benefits in this case are subject to an exemption from execution in chapter 4. We conclude they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">As noted, chapter 4 provides that \u201c[i]f property is exempt without making a claim, the property is not subject to being applied to the satisfaction of a judgment for child, family or spousal support.\u201d (\u00a7 703.070, subd. (b).) The significance of this language is revealed in section 704.130. It provides: \u201c(a) Before payment, benefits from a disability or health insurance policy or program are <em>exempt without making a claim. </em>After payment, the benefits are exempt.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The trial court impliedly found that the disability benefits from the Paul Revere Insurance Company are \u201cbenefits from a disability . . . insurance policy . . . .\u201d It said: \u201cAssuming CCP \u00a7 704.130 even applies to an assignment order (e.g., see CCP \u00a7 706.031), the benefits being paid [Husband] do not appear to be exempt. CCP \u00a7 704.115(c)(2) specifically makes such payments non-exempt when paid pursuant to a Family Code assignment order, even though they may be exempt for other purposes, including a withholding order under CCP \u00a7 706.030.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The clear implication of this passage is that, but for the reasons cited, Husband\u2019s disability benefits are benefits from a disability insurance policy. The trial court offered two reasons for denying Husband the exemption provided by section 704.130. Neither has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">It first suggested that section 704.130 does not apply by virtue of section 706.031. Subdivision (a) of that section provides that \u201c[n]othing in this chapter affects an earnings assignment order for support.\u201d The suggestion is incorrect. There is no inconsistency between this provision and the exemption provided by section 704.130 since they are within different chapters. The chapter (Chapter 5), of which section 706.031 is a part, concerns wage garnishments, which as to child or spousal support, is accomplished by a \u201c \u2018withholding order for support\u2019 . . . issued on a writ of execution to collect delinquent amounts payable under a judgment for the support of a child, or spouse or former spouse . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 706.030.) As noted, the exemptions of the chapter of which section 704.130 is a part, chapter 4, are incorporated by reference in the definition of \u201cearnings\u201d in Family Code section 5206, subject to any exception applicable to assignment orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>The second reason advanced by the trial court, and also by Wife, is that section 704.130 is superseded (or preempted) by section 704.115. This too is incorrect. Section 704.115 concerns the wholly different category of disability payments from \u201cprivate retirement plans,\u201d not benefits from a disability insurance policy. It applies inter alia to disability payments \u201cheld, controlled, or in process of distribution\u201d by \u201cprivate retirement plan[s],\u201d \u201c[profit-sharing plans designed and used for retirement purposes,\u201d and \u201c[s]elf-employed retirement plans and individual retirement annuities or accounts . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 704.115, subds. (a), (b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record which suggests that Husband\u2019s disability benefits are \u201cheld, controlled, or in process of distribution by\u201d such a plan. (\u00a7 704.115, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Thus, the disability policy issued by the Paul Revere Insurance Company to Husband is a disability insurance policy within the exemption provided by section 704.130 and the proceeds before payment are categorically exempt from an assignment order. That being the case, Husband is entitled to an available remedy to quash the service of the assignment order on the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\n<em>The Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Our conclusion that benefits in the possession of Husband\u2019s disability insurer are exempt from enforcement of his child support obligation does not mean he is entitled to an order quashing the assignment order under Family Code section 5270.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Whether or not the assignment order was served on an exempt source of income it remains valid and may be used for any appropriate purpose. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>challenge to the service of an assignment order upon exempt income is not a ground under Family Code section 5270 upon which the service may be quashed<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and accordingly is not subject to the procedural limitations of Family Code section 5271.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor was Husband given notice by the Judicial Council Form served upon him that an assignment order is subject to exemptions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">This does not mean that Husband has no remedy. Although no remedy is provided by statute, the courts are authorized to fashion an appropriate remedy through the exercise of their inherent equitable and supervisory powers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201c[Cjourts have inherent equity, supervisory and administrative powers <em>(Bauguess </em>v. <em>Paine </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 626, 635. . .) as well as inherent power to control litigation before them. <em>(Western Steel &amp; Ship Repair, Inc. </em>v. <em>RMI, Inc. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108, 1116-1117. . . .) Inherent powers of the court are derived from the state Constitution and are not confined by or dependent on statute. <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 267 . . . .) [\u00b6] California courts have fashioned new forms of procedures when required to deal with the rights of the parties and to manage the caseload of the court. For example, in <em>James H. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 169, 175 . . . , the Court of Appeal held that the juvenile court had the inherent power to hold a required competency hearing even though the juvenile court law failed to provide for such a proceeding. The court based its holding on the principle that: \u2018Courts have the inherent power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>to create new forms of procedure in particular pending cases. \u201cThe . . . power arises from necessity where, in the absence of any previously established procedural rule, rights would be lost or the court would be unable to function.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>(See also, <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Roshei Corp. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 642, 648-649 . . . [\u2018A trial court is empowered to exercise its supervisory power in such a manner as to provide for the orderly conduct of the court\u2019s business and to \u201cguard against inept procedures and unnecessary indulgences which would tend to hinder, hamper or delay the conduct and dispatch of its proceedings.\u2019\u201d]; <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 505, 509 . . .

[\u2018A court has inherent power to exercise reasonable control over all proceedings connected with the litigation before it.\u2019].)\u201d <em>(Cottle </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1377-1378 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 882], parallel citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 186 [124 P.2d 820] the court held the building and loan commissioner\u2019s act of taking possession of the property and assets of a savings and loan society was part of the \u201cprocess of liquidation\u201d within the meaning of a statute which prohibited levy of execution pending the process of liquidation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 187-191.) The commissioner was entitled to a writ of mandate directing the respondent superior court to recall a writ of execution which had been levied against the society by one of its creditors after the commissioner had taken possession of the society\u2019s assets. The court explained the \u201crespondent court had the power and it was its duty to recall the writ of execution if it was improvidently issued. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s power to control its proceedings includes the power to control its own assignment order and, where necessary, to quash its improvident service on an entity providing income which is exempt from enforcement of a child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Husband sought only to quash the \u201cplacement\u201d of the assignment order on his disability insurer, the Paul Revere Insurance Company. We will treat this as a motion to quash service on the insurer. Since Husband is entitled to a mandatory exemption from the assignment order for benefits from a disability insurance policy there is no equitable defense in this case to the quashing of service except for a claim of laches as to the money already paid Wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>However, since the motion to quash service on the insurer affects only the prospective payment of disability benefits to Husband, there can be no defense predicated upon the timeliness of the motion. (See, e.g., <em>Estate of Hume </em>(1918) 179 Cal. 338, 342-343 [176 P. 681].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">There being no equitable defense to the motion to quash service on the ground the insurance proceeds are exempt, the order denying the motion to quash the service of the assignment order is reversed. The trial court is directed to issue an order quashing the service of the assignment order upon Paul Revere Insurance Company. Husband is awarded his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Davis, J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 20, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-11\">A reference to a section is a reference to a section of the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Husband, a podiatrist, was diagnosed as suffering from atrial fibrillation and, in March 1994, his physician placed him on total disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\">\u201cEmployer,\u201d as used here, does not mean an employer in the ordinary sense.

However, the Family Code does not incorporate the Enforcement of Judgments Law\u2019s procedure for releasing an improvident levy on property that is exempt without making a claim. (See \u00a7 703.510, subd. (b): \u201cIf property that is exempt without making a claim is levied upon, it may be released pursuant to the exemption procedure provided in this article.\u201d) Thus, Husband cannot be faulted for failing to utilize that procedure in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
