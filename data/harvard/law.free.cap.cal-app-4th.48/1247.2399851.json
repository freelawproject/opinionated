Booth was convicted by a jury of one count of presenting a false and fraudulent insurance claim (former Ins. Code, \u00a7 1871.1, subd. (a)(1)) and one count of preparing a writing in support of a fraudulent insurance claim. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1871.1, subd. (a)(5)). He was given a two-year suspended sentence, ordered to pay a restitution fine and placed on supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">On appeal Booth claims error in the refusal of two defense-proffered modifications to standard jury instructions defining the elements of the crimes charged. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">On May 22,1992 Booth was involved in a rear-end collision in which his 1991 Mercedes was struck from behind by another vehicle. Booth was driving and his girlfriend, Wendy Govan, was in the passenger seat. Neither Booth nor Govan asked for an ambulance or complained of being injured at the time, nor did either receive medical treatment for injuries resulting from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Booth filed a claim for personal injuries with his own insurance company, Liberty Mutual, which was eventually settled for S1.OOO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The driver responsible for the accident was insured with Farmers Insurance Group (Farmers) which paid for the property damage sustained by Booth. By way of letter dated June 25, 1992 (all further unspecified calendar references are to that year), Farmers\u2019s claims agent Dana Kruger inquired about the accident. In July, while Kruger met with Govan to settle her personal injury claim, Govan mentioned that Booth might have been injured as well. Kruger then contacted Booth, who confirmed that he was injured, and set up a meeting to discuss his personal injury claim. Booth was not home at the time Kruger arrived for the scheduled visit, so she left two forms at his doorstep\u2014an authorization to obtain medical information and a medical history form. The medical history was returned to Farmers on September 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">On October 2, Kruger spoke to Booth on the telephone. He said his treatment was complete, that he missed two and a half weeks from work and that Farmers had all the medical bills. Kruger told Booth the wage loss needed to be verified by his employer; Booth told her to send the form to Govan.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The wage loss verification was sent to Govan on October 12 and returned to Kruger on October 23. It was purportedly signed by Charlie Plummer, the Sheriff of Alameda County, which was Booth\u2019s employer. Kruger became suspicious about the authenticity of the verification, since she thought it very unlikely Plummer would personally sign such a form. Consequently, she contacted the sheriff\u2019s office and learned that the signature on the form was a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Kruger then contacted the Danville Immediate Care Center, from whom she had received Booth\u2019s medical bills, including notes signed by a Dr. Bennett excusing him from work. As a result of those conversations, she discovered that all of the medical paperwork submitted on behalf of Booth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>was bogus. It was stipulated at trial that Dr. Bennett never saw or treated Booth at any time before, during or after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On November 16 and 19 Kruger had phone conversations with Booth which were recorded with his permission. Booth again confirmed that he had been injured in the accident, and that he had been treated by a doctor whose \u201cname starts with a B, I\u2019m not sure.\" He told Kruger that the bills she had received from the Danville Immediate Care Center were for his medical treatment, and, in response to her inquiry, confirmed that he had been treated by Dr. Bennett. In response to her inquiries, Booth also confirmed that he had missed between two and two and a half weeks from work, and that the doctor bills and wage loss verification forms submitted to Kruger were done with his permission. However, he indicated that he did not remember actually sending any of the forms to Kruger, suggesting that Govan must have prepared the forms for him to sign and then sent them out herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Booth testified that Govan had initiated and engineered the fraudulent claim without his knowledge, and when he found out about it, he played along to protect her. He also believed he was entitled to recover money from Farmers for a \u201cnuisance\u201d claim, without submitting documentation, and understood this as the claim he was pursuing. Govan testified and admitted she had (1) faked the medical records and submitted them to Farmers on Booth\u2019s behalf; (2) forged Booth\u2019s signature on the medical authorization; and (3) forged the sheriff\u2019s signature on the wage loss verification. Govan claimed she intended to intercept the settlement checks before they got to Booth and use them for herself. In May 1994, Govan pleaded guilty to insurance fraud and forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">A. <em>Modification of CAUIC Nos. 15.40 and 15.41</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Booth was convicted of violating former Insurance Code section 1871.1, subdivision (a)(1), which made it unlawful to <em>\u201cKnowingly </em>present or cause to be presented any false or fraudulent claim for the payment of a loss . . . under a contract of insurance\u201d and former Insurance Code section 1871.1, subdivision (a)(5), which made it a crime to <em>\u201cKnowingly </em>prepare, make, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>subscribe any writing, with the intent to present or use it, or allow it to be presented in support of any false or fraudulent claim.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The jury was instructed on the elements of these sections in accord with CALJIC Nos. 15.40 and 15.41. CALJIC No. 15.40 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cDefendant is accused in Counts one and three of the information of having violated Section 1871.1(a)(1) of the Insurance Code, a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cEvery person who, with the specific intent to defraud presents or causes to be presented any false or fraudulent claim for the payment of a loss, including payment for a loss under a contract of insurance is guilty of a violation of Section 1871.1(a)(1) of the Insurance Code, a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cIn order to prove such crime, each of the following elements must be proved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">\u201c1. That a person presented or caused to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment of a loss, including payment of a loss under a contract of insurance, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">\u201c2. Such person acted with specific intent to defraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">With respect to the charge of fraudulently supporting an insurance claim (\u00a7 1871.1, subd. (a)(5)), the jury was given CALJIC No. 15.41, whose elements are described for the jury as follows: \u201cLA person [prepared] [made] [signed] a writing with the specific intent to present, use or allow to be presented or used in support of a false or fraudulent claim for payment of a loss covered by insurance, and 2. Such person acted with the specific intent to defraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">In chambers, Booth requested the trial court modify each of these instructions to insert the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d With the modifications, the jury would be instructed that a finding of guilt would require the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d presented a false or fraudulent claim and \u201cknowingly\u201d prepared or signed a writing with the specific intent to present it in support of a false claim. The court refused to modify the standard instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">On appeal, Booth claims that by refusing his request to insert the word \u201cknowingly\u201d into CALJIC Nos. 15.40 and 15.41, the trial court failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>to instruct on an essential element of the offense. Booth further argues that the error deprived him of his due process right to have every element of the crime determined by the jury and is therefore reversible per se. (See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 275, 278-281 [124 L.Ed.2d 182, 188-190, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081-2082].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We reject Booth\u2019s contention that the CALJIC instructions are constitutionally deficient due to omission of the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d Both of the subject instructions require the jury to make the dual finding that (1) the defendant present or prepare or sign a writing in support of a false claim <em>and </em>(2) do so with <em>specific intent </em>to defraud. The element of \u201cknowledge,\u201d which Booth claims is missing from the instruction, is inherent in the concept of specific intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The word \u201cknowingly\u201d merely implies the person know of facts which bring the act or omission within the scope of the statute. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 7, subd. 5.) Thus, \u201c \u2018 \u201cCalifornia case law has long held that the requirement of \u2018knowingly\u2019 is satisfied where the person involved has knowledge of the facts, though not of the law. [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 677, 692 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 227].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\u201c \u2018Intent to defraud is an intent to commit a fraud.\u2019 [Citation.] \u201c \u2018Fraud\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdishonesty\u201d are closely synonymous. Fraud is defined as \u201ca dishonest stratagem.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1961) p. 904.) It \u201cmay consist in the misrepresentation or the concealment of material facts\u201d [citation], or a statement of fact made with \u201cconscious[ness] of [its] falsity.\u201d [Citation.] \u2019 [Citation.] <em>Defendant could not have submitted a claim with the intent to defraud unless he was conscious of its falsity </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 665, 676-677 [266 Cal.Rptr. 527], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Thus, the element of \u201cspecific intent to defraud,\u201d a required finding under the CALJIC instructions, is more rigorous than the concept of \u201cknowingly\u201d and includes the latter. As the jury was told through CALJIC No. 15.26, \u201c[a]n intent to defraud is an intent to <em>deceive another person </em>or to induce that person to part with property or to alter that person\u2019s position to [its] injury or risk, and to accomplish that purpose by some false statement, false representation of fact, wrongful concealment or suppression of truth, or by any other artifice or act <em>designed to deceive.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Since specific intent to defraud requires both knowledge of the true facts and an intent to deceive, it was impossible for Booth to have intended to defraud Farmers by presenting a false claim, and to have done so <em>unknowingly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Citing his testimony that he believed he was entitled to submit a \u201cnuisance\u201d claim for his pain and suffering to Farmers without proper documentation, Booth suggests the CALJIC instructions allowed the jury to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>him of violating the statute even if they believed he filed the claim without \u201cknowing\u201d it to be false. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">While it is undoubtedly true that one can \u201cknowingly\u201d present a false claim without specific intent to defraud, for example by presenting false data to support a claim in the good faith belief that the information is correct (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnham </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 836, 842 [15 Cal.Rptr. 596]), the opposite is not true. One simply cannot <em>intend to defraud </em>another by submitting false information \u201cunknowingly.\u201d (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Scofield </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1018, 1026 [95 Cal.Rptr. 405] [\u201cOne who wilfully submits a claim, knowing it to be false, necessarily does so with intent to defraud\u201d]; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1418 [249 Cal.Rptr. 568] [\u201c. . . [T]he intent to defraud the insurer is necessarily implied when the misrepresentation is material and the insured wilfully makes it with the knowledge of its falsity.\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We conclude the trial court had no duty to modify CALJIC Nos. 15.40 and 15.41 by inserting the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">B. <em>Modification of Aiding and Abetting Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The trial court gave CALJIC No. 3.01, which defines the concept of aiding and abetting, refusing Booth\u2019s request to augment the instruction by adding the phrase italicized and bracketed below: \u201cA person aids and abets the commission or attempted commission of a crime when he or she, [cm (1) with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator and [^ (2) with the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of the crime, by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates [, <em>and actually aids or assists, the commission of the crime].\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Booth contends the court\u2019s refusal to accept his modification to the instruction was prejudicial error, because it permitted the jury to find accomplice liability if he simply \u201cencouraged\u201d or \u201cadvised\u201d Govan to commit insurance fraud without having actually \u201cassisted\u201d in its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">The underlying premise of Booth\u2019s argument is that to be found guilty of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d an accused must satisfy two separate tests\u2014\u201cabetting\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>which requires advice and encouragement with specific intent to facilitate the crime, and \u201caiding\u201d which requires that one physically assist in the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">This argument was squarely addressed and rejected in a thoughtful opinion by Justice Wunderlich in <em>People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 402 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 525] (Campbell), who states, in pertinent part: \u201c[D]espite the simple logic of Smith\u2019s claim, he cites, and our research has revealed, no case holding, or even suggesting, that \u2018aid and abet\u2019 requires separate findings concerning two distinct types of <em>acts </em>(assisting and encouraging) before a jury may properly convict a defendant as an aider and abettor. On the contrary, according to our Supreme Court, \u2018\u201c[t]o be an abettor the accused must have <em>instigated or advised </em>the commission of the crime <em>or been present for the purpose of assisting in its </em>commission.\u201d \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Durham </em>[1969] 70 Cal.2d [171,] 181 [74 Cal.Rptr. 262, 449 P.2d 198], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Villa </em>(1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 128, 133 [318 P.2d 828], italics in Durham; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Francis </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 66, 72 [75 Cal.Rptr. 199, 450 P.2d 591].) \u2018 \u201c[T]he test is whether the accused in any way, directly or indirectly, aided the perpetrator by acts <em>or </em>encouraged him by words or gestures.\" \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Campbell, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 411, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Like the defendant in <em>Campbell, </em>Booth relies heavily on <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1633 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 426] where the court observed that a defendant who only encouraged felons to run away and hide after the commission of the crime but had not actually harbored, concealed, or aided them did not fit within the definition of an <em>accessory after the fact </em>as set forth in Penal Code section 32. (14 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1641-1642.) However, such reliance is misplaced. <em>Campbell </em>clearly points out that, while <em>Elliott </em>drew from case law discussing aiding and abetting, it \u201cdid not purport to construe section 31 or the phrase \u2018aid and abet.\u2019 Moreover, although <em>Elliott </em>and the cases cited therein recognize a distinction between the terms \u2018aid\u2019 and \u2018abet,\u2019 they do not suggest that the phrase \u2018aid and abet\u2019 in section 32 [szc] requires separate findings that one assisted and encouraged the perpetrator of a crime.\" (25 Cal.App.4th at p. 412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\"><em>Campbell </em>explains that the reason our courts have been careful to draw the distinction between \u201caiding\u201d and \u201cabetting\u201d is not because there is a two-pronged test, but to emphasize that one cannot be convicted of being an accomplice by conduct alone, but must also share the principal\u2019s purpose or goal to commit the crime, i.e., there must be a union between act and intent. For that reason, the term \u201cabet,\u201d which requires a guilty state of mind, has been recognized as an indispensable element of accomplice liability. <em>(Campbell, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>While accomplice liability cannot be predicated on conduct absent the required mental state, one <em>can </em>be guilty as an accomplice (if he shares the goal of the perpetrator) without having actually assisted the commission of the offense, e.g., by \u201cinstigating,\u201d or \u201cadvising\u201d the perpetrator to commit it or by having been \u201cpresent for the purpose of its commission.\u201d (See <em>Campbell, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 411, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Like the court in <em>Campbell, </em>we note that the instruction attacked here as insufficient was modeled after the one proposed by the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 561 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318]. Review in <em>Campbell </em>was denied on August 17, 1994. (25 Cal.App.4th at p. 414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We adopt the reasoning of <em>Campbell </em>to conclude that CALJIC No. 3.01 adequately instructs the jury on the concept of aiding and abetting. Booth\u2019s improvisation on the instruction was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Kline, P. J., and Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 23, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Judge of the San Francisco Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\">At trial, Booth faced two additional charges of insurance fraud in connection with the Liberty Mutual claim. He was acquitted on both counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-13\">In 1992, Insurance Code section 1871.1 was repealed and reenacted without change as Penal Code section 550. (Stats. 1992, ch. 675, \u00a7 8, No. 5 Deering\u2019s Adv. Legis. Service, p. 2464.) For convenience, all further unspecified statutory references are to the former section of the Insurance Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Booth argues that it was possible he could have \u201cunknowingly\u201d presented or supported a false claim if he supplied false information to Farmers \u201cto protect his girlfriend and to settle his pain and suffering claim.\u201d Booth confuses the <em>motive </em>for committing fraud with the fraud itself. By presenting information he knew to be false with the intent that Farmers rely upon it to settle his claim, Booth acted with specific intent to defraud. This is all the \u201cknowledge\u201d the statute requires. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 7, subd. 5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
