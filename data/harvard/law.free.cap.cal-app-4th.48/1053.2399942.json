Code, \u00a7 470) and admitted an allegation that he had suffered a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) pursuant to a plea bargain under which he agreed to accept a 32-month state prison sentence. Although the court imposed the agreed sentence, defendant filed an appeal asserting that the court \u201ccommitted sentencing error.\u201d He claims that (1) the court erred in sentencing him under Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) because his prior conviction was incurred prior to the enactment of this statute, (2) the court had and failed to exercise discretion to strike the prior conviction allegation, (3) Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) was not in effect at the time of his offense because it was improperly enacted as urgency legislation, and (4) Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) violates equal protection because it restricts conduct credits for those sentenced under its provisions. Defendant also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he asserted that his trial counsel was prejudicially ineffective because she (1) failed to advise him that the prosecution would not be able to prove the prior conviction allegation at trial, and (2) incorrectly advised him that he could admit the allegation and challenge its propriety on appeal. We affirm the judgment, but we issue an order to show cause on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">The facts of defendant\u2019s criminal conduct are not material to his appellate contentions. Defendant was charged by information with forgery (Pen. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>\u00a7 470) and petty theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 484, 488), and it was alleged that he had suffered a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i). Defendant agreed to enter a plea of no contest to the forgery count, admit the prior conviction allegation and accept a 32-month state prison term in return for dismissal of the petty theft count and the court\u2019s agreement to impose no additional state prison time for unrelated narcotics counts for which defendant had been on probation at the time of the forgery and theft offenses. Before defendant entered his plea, the court elicited defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial. \u201cQ [by the court]. All right. Mr. Couch, I\u2019m going to advise you of your basic constitutional rights and ask you if you want to waive or give up those rights to plead no contest to count one and to admit this prior serious felony conviction. [f] The first right you give up, sir, is your right to a jury trial. Do you understand that? [^ A [by defendant]. Yes. [f| Q. Do you at this time give up that right? <em>[% </em>A. Yes.\u201d The court also obtained specific waivers of defendant\u2019s other constitutional rights. Defendant thereafter pled no contest to the forgery count and admitted the prior serious felony conviction allegation. The court accepted defendant\u2019s plea and admission, dismissed the petty theft count and imposed the agreed 32-month state prison sentence. Defendant did not obtain a certificate of probable cause. He filed a timely notice of appeal asserting that the court \u201ccommitted sentencing error.\u201d Defendant also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he alleged that his trial counsel had been prejudicially ineffective. In the interest of judicial economy, we consider the appeal and petition together.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">A. <em>Plea Agreement for Specific Sentence Precludes Appellate Claims Alleging \u201cSentencing Error\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Defendant did not obtain a certificate of probable cause, and his notice of appeal states that his appeal is limited to claims that the court \u201ccommitted sentencing error.\u201d The Attorney General argues that defendant should not be permitted to challenge his sentence because he agreed to accept it as a part of the plea bargain. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u201cWhere defendants have pleaded guilty in return for a <em>specified sentence, </em>appellate courts are not inclined to find error even though the trial court acts in excess of jurisdiction in reaching that figure, as long as the court does not lack <em>fundamental jurisdiction. . . . </em>The rationale behind this policy is that defendants who have received the benefit of their bargain should not be allowed to \u2018trifle with the courts\u2019 by attempting to better the bargain through the appellate process.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1993) 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>Cal.App.4th 114, 122-123 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 490], citations omitted, italics added.) \u201cWhere a court is merely acting in excess of its jurisdiction, the defendant who agrees to such actions may be estopped later from challenging the court\u2019s actions on jurisdictional grounds.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 124, 136 [258 Cal.Rptr. 294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Defendant does not claim that the trial court lacked \u201cfundamental jurisdiction\u201d to impose the 32-month state prison term. Instead, he claims that he was not estopped from challenging the court\u2019s sentencing decision because the issues raised on appeal \u201cconcern a matter of importance\u201d and the alleged \u201csentencing\" errors do not involve \u201ca statute which was enacted for the benefit of criminal defendants.\u201d We do not believe that the alleged \u201cimportance\u201d of the issues raised by defendant on appeal is relevant to a determination as to whether defendant is estopped from making such contentions. The alleged \u201cimportance\u201d of defendant\u2019s appellate claims will not prevent the imposition of an estoppel if one is justified. In both <em>Jones </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Otterstein </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1548 [235 Cal.Rptr. 108], the appellate courts concluded that the defendants were estopped from challenging their sentences on appeal after entering into plea bargains for specified sentences below. Those courts noted that the defendants\u2019 plea agreements had necessarily included waivers of their rights under rules designed to benefit \u201cdefendants as a class.\u201d <em>(Otterstein, supra, </em>at p. 1551.) Defendant claims that he should not be estopped from challenging his sentence because his contentions <em>do not </em>rest on rules designed to benefit criminal defendants and therefore the rationale of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Otterstein </em>is inapplicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We can see no reason to restrict the above stated policy to alleged trial court violations of <em>statutes designed to benefit criminal defendants. </em>The fact that a defendant has received a benefit in return for agreeing to accept a specified sentence is itself sufficient to estop that defendant from later seeking to unfairly supplement this benefit by mounting an appellate attack on the trial court\u2019s imposition of the specific sentence which the defendant agreed to accept. In the absence of a certificate of probable cause, such a defendant will usually not be able to make <em>any </em>appellate challenge to the judgment. The nature of the alleged error is important only in determining whether it supports the implication that the defendant waived the alleged error by accepting the plea bargain. When a defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s sentence violates rules which would have required the imposition of a more lenient sentence, yet the defendant avoided a potentially harsher sentence by entering into the plea bargain, it may be implied that the defendant waived any rights under such rules by choosing to accept the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In this case, each of defendant\u2019s appellate contentions essentially involves a claim that the trial court erred by failing to sentence him under Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>section 1170 rather than Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i). Defendant claims that his prior conviction did not qualify for treatment under Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) because it was incurred prior to the enactment of these provisions. Essentially, this is a claim that he should have been sentenced under Penal Code section 1170. Defendant asserts that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion to strike the prior conviction allegation or finding. The benefit of striking the allegation or finding would be that defendant would have been sentenced under Penal Code section 1170. He argues that Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) was not in effect at the time of his offense. Again, this is a claim that he should have been sentenced under Penal Code section 1170. Finally, he claims that equal protection bars any limitation on his eligibility to earn worktime credit against his term. This claim is basically that he was entitled to be treated the same as those prisoners sentenced under Penal Code section 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Thus, each of defendant\u2019s appellate contentions comes down to a claim that he was entitled to the benefit of being sentenced under Penal Code section 1170. By accepting a plea bargain for a specific term which included an admission of a prior conviction allegation which would necessarily result in defendant being sentenced under Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) rather than Penal Code section 1170, defendant obtained the benefit of limiting his sentence to 32 months. Even if his contentions were correct and he was required to be sentenced under Penal Code section 1170, the trial court could have imposed a sentence greater than 32 months. The court was authorized to impose as much as a 36-month term for the forgery count alone, and a consecutive sentence could have been imposed for the narcotics counts after revocation of defendant\u2019s probation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 18.) Furthermore, when viewed in this context, Penal Code section 1170 is a statute designed to benefit criminal defendants by limiting the sentence which may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Accordingly, defendant must be estopped from challenging his sentence because he agreed to accept it and thereby waived the alleged errors which he now claims occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">B. <em>Petition for Writ of Habeas </em>Corpus<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The judgment is affirmed. However, because defendant has made a prima facie showing that his trial counsel was prejudicially deficient, we hereby issue an order to show cause, returnable before the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, directing the superior court to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Cottle, P. J., and Bamattre-Manoukian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Although defendant claims that it is unfair to estop him from challenging the sentence because \u201crespondent did not bargain fairly with appellant,\u201d there is no evidence in the appellate record to support this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1053.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
