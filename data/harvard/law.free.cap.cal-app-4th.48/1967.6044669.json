J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG4\">Luis Martin Robles (appellant) appeals from his conviction for obstructing an officer in the discharge of his duties in violation of Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a). Appellant first challenges his conviction on the ground the evidence failed to establish that in interacting with the suspect, Officer Huizar was discharging or attempting to discharge his duties. Appellant further contends his conduct constituted protected speech under the federal and California Constitutions. We disagree with appellant\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Appellant was charged with violating Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a), which prohibits willful resistance, delay or obstruction of an officer in the discharge or attempted discharge of his or her duties. Appellant was tried by a jury. At the conclusion of the People\u2019s case, appellant moved for an acquittal pursuant to Penal Code section 1118.1. The motion was denied. Appellant was found guilty and placed on summary probation. Thereafter, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">The evidence presented in the People\u2019s case was as follows: Officer Samuel Huizar testified that he is a police officer for the City of Los Angeles, assigned to West Bureau narcotics. On March 17, 1995, at approximately 5:30 p.m., he was working undercover, attempting to buy narcotics in the area of Braddock and Slauson, an area with heavy narcotic and gang activity. The undercover investigation involved approximately four uniformed officers, eight to ten detectives, six undercover officers and three supervisors. Officer Huizar was dressed in civilian clothing and was wearing a \u201cwire\u201d on his body in order to communicate with his supervisors. He was driving a white Beretta with no lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Officer Huizar observed a male Hispanic about 17 years old (the suspect) on a bicycle in the middle of the street. Officer Huizar stopped his vehicle next to the suspect and asked him if he had \u201crock,\u201d the street term for rock cocaine. The suspect asked Officer Huizar how much he wanted, and Officer Huizar told him he wanted a \u201cdime,\u201d the street term for $10 worth of narcotics.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The suspect then asked the officer, \u201cYou only want a dime?\u201d The officer responded, \u201cYes,\u201d and reached into his right front pants pocket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>removed two precoded $5 bills. Then Officer Huizar heard someone yell, \u201cGet away from that guy! The guy\u2019s a cop!\u201d The suspect looked at Officer Huizar and asked, \u201cAre you a cop?\u201d Officer Huizar responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Appellant then walked up to the suspect and said, \u201cI told you to get away from that guy. The guy\u2019s a cop.\u201d The suspect told Officer Huizar he was not going to sell him anything because he was a cop and rode away on his bicycle. Officer Huizar then contacted his supervisors, who detained appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Officer Huizar testified that getting \u201cburned,\u201d i.e., being identified as a police officer, compromises an officer\u2019s safety and prevents him from doing his duty. Since a suspect will not deal with an individual who has been identified as a police officer, once an officer has been so identified, the officer must be replaced by another undercover officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Appellant first challenges his conviction on the ground the evidence did not establish that in interacting with the suspect, Officer Huizar was discharging or attempting to discharge a duty of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">\u201c[P]olice involvement in criminal activity for the purpose of investigating possible violations is permissible even if technical violations of law occur.\u201d <em>(Provigo Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 561, 568 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 638, 869 P.2d 1163].) \u201c[T]he rule is clear that \u2018ruses, stings and decoys are permissible stratagems in the enforcement of criminal law, . . .\u2019[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 569.) \u201cAs a general rule, the use of decoys to expose illicit activity does not constitute entrapment, so long as no pressure or overbearing conduct is employed by the decoy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 568; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Barraza </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 675, 690 [153 Cal.Rptr. 459, 591 P.2d 947].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">The evidence established Officer Huizar was assigned to work undercover as part of a decoy program to enforce drug laws. His assignment required him to attempt to purchase narcotics in the area in question. Nothing in the record suggests Officer Huizar attempted to entrap the suspect by pressuring him or engaging in overbearing conduct. The use of undercover vice officers to expose illicit activity is a long used and permissible part of law enforcement duties. <em>(Provigo Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 568-569.) In view of the foregoing, we conclude that in interacting with the suspect, Officer Huizar was discharging a duty of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Appellant next contends his conviction violated his right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 2 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">\u201c[C]ertain forms of speech, or speech in certain contexts has been considered outside the scope of constitutional protection.\u201d <em>(Konigsberg </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 36, 50 [6 L.Ed.2d 105, 116, 81 S.Ct. 997]; see also <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1965) 379 U.S. 536, 563 [13 L.Ed.2d 471, 491-492, 85 S.Ct. 453].) For example, an individual may be punished for encouraging the commission of a crime or for uttering \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>(Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>379 U.S. at p. 563 [13 L.Ed.2d at p. 491]; see also <em>Long </em>v. <em>Valentino </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1296 [265 Cal.Rptr. 96].) \u201c \u2018[I]t has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>379 U.S. at p. 563 [13 L.Ed.2d at pp. 491-492].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Penal Code section 148 does not apply solely to nonverbal conduct involving flight or forcible interference with an officer\u2019s activities. \u201cNo decision has interpreted the statute to apply only to physical acts, and the statutory language does not suggest such a limitation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quiroga </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 961, 968 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 446].) Nevertheless, we recognize that \u201cthe First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.\u201d <em>(Houston </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 451, 461 [96 L.Ed.2d 398, 412, 107 S.Ct. 2502].) We further recognize that Penal Code section 148 must be applied with great caution to speech. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quiroga, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 968.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Appellant claims his conduct was constitutionally protected because he did not utter \u201cfighting words,\u201d breach the peace or engage in disorderly conduct. He argues he should not be punished merely for discouraging the suspect from committing a crime. However, the record contains substantial evidence that appellant willfully obstructed the officer in the performance of his undercover duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Appellant does not dispute the fact that he knew Officer Huizar was a police officer. It may be inferred from the content of appellant\u2019s warning and the nature of the area in question that appellant knew the officer was conducting an undercover investigation. Appellant not only alerted the suspect to the officer\u2019s identity but directed the suspect to \u201cget away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>[the officer].\u201d When the suspect failed to heed appellant\u2019s initial warning, appellant approached the suspect and stated, \u201cI told you to get away from that guy. That guy\u2019s a cop.\u201d As a result of appellant\u2019s warning the suspect fled, preventing the officer from obtaining evidence of a crime he might otherwise have obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">\u201c[S]peech is generally protected by the First Amendment, even if it is intended to interfere with the performance of an officer\u2019s duty, <em>provided no physical interference </em>results.\u201d <em>(Long </em>v. <em>Valentino, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 1296, italics added.) In this case, appellant\u2019s speech did not constitute mere verbal criticism and challenge directed at the officer. Appellant\u2019s speech accomplished a physical event, i.e., the flight of the suspect, which interfered with the officer\u2019s ability to complete his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">As the Court of Appeal explained in <em>Long </em>v. <em>Valentino, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at page 1297: \u201c[W]e do not literally punish a bandit for mere use of the words, \u2018Stick \u2019em up, you moron.\u2019 We punish him for the <em>act </em>of attempting to take the property of another by force and fear. It is of no moment that language was the vehicle to the goal in this . . . hypothetical case. Physical force alone could have been employed . . . and the words, while they may have contained a kernel of expression . . . (e.g., \u2018you moron\u2019), amount to conduct designed to accomplish a direct violation of the law and not primarily a means of conveying an idea or point of view.\u201d Based on the reasoning in <em>Long, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at page 1297, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s speech was not constitutionally protected under the federal and state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Kakita, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">Officer Huizar testified he knew he had a \u201cbuy\u201d because the suspect asked him how much he wanted and did not walk away.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1021-9\">TODD, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"ALj\">I concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that Officer Huizar was discharging a duty of his office in conducting the undercover operation. I am of the view, however, that appellant\u2019s verbal warning to a third party before any obvious illegal activity had taken place was protected speech and therefore cannot constitute a violation of Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">The cases on which respondent relies, <em>People </em>v. <em>Quiroga </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 961 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 446] and <em>In re Andre P. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1164 [277 Cal.Rptr. 363], are not on point. In <em>Quiroga, </em>the court specifically stated that no constitutionally protected speech was involved in determining that the defendant\u2019s refusal to give his name at his booking after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>a valid arrest constituted a violation of Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a). (16 Cal.App.4th at p. 972.) As for <em>Andre P., </em>there was no issue whether Penal Code section 148, subdivision (a) applied to speech which allegedly interfered with an officer\u2019s duty. The court held that the above section was not facially overbroad and was constitutional as applied to Andre P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">As there appears to be no California case directly on point, a review of decisions from other jurisdictions may be helpful in determining whether one can obstruct an undercover officer by giving a verbal warning to a third party. In <em>State </em>v. <em>CLR </em>(1985) 40 Wn.App. 839 [700 P.2d 1195], CLR was convicted by a juvenile court of obstructing a police officer. In that case, a police officer on undercover duty approached a woman standing on the street. After talking to the officer through the open window of the officer\u2019s truck, the woman agreed to engage in an act of prostitution. CLR, who recognized the officer as a member of the vice squad, observed but could not hear the exchange. The woman walked around the truck and opened the passenger door, at which point CLR yelled, \u201c \u2018he\u2019s vice.\u2019 \u201d At that point the woman closed the door and started to walk away from the truck. <em>(Id., </em>700 P.2d at p. 1196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The reviewing court held there was insufficient evidence that the defendant knew \u201cthat a public servant [was] engaged in a discharge of official duties . . . .\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>CLR, supra, </em>700 P.2d at p. 1197.) The officer was working undercover, and the defendant \u201ccould not have known that a crime had been committed and that the officer would be proceeding to make an arrest . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The reviewing court also held there was insufficient evidence of \u201chindering, delaying, or obstructing . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, the court there noted: \u201cCourts have found that similar obstruction statutes do not apply where there was no obvious, contemporaneous, illegal activity when the warning was given.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jelliffe </em>(1982) 5 Ohio Misc.2d 20 [449 N.E.2d 810], the defendant was attending a rock concert and recognized an individual in plainclothes as a police officer. \u201cDefendant then told at least one other individual, evidently in the hearing of the officer, that the large person was a \u2018cop.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court found the defendant not guilty, based in part on the following reasoning: \u201c[T]here is no allegation that defendant\u2019s conduct actually prevented the arrest of any persons who were then violating the law. While it may have made detection of violations more difficult, it is equally possible that it may have inhibited the commission of crimes in the first place. Surely that is one goal of law enforcement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 811.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tages </em>(1969) 10 Ariz.App. 127 [457 P.2d 289], two officers were advised there was a felony warrant outstanding for the arrest of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>Tages. The officers, dressed in plainclothes, saw Mr. Tages at a bar sitting next to his wife, the defendant. The defense witnesses testified that the defendant told her husband not to go with the officers until they produced a warrant for his arrest. The reviewing court stated: \u201c[W]e think that speech which is non-threatening, and which is not accompanied by physical force, is punishable only when it is substantially equivalent to force, that is, when it is intended to and does incite an unlawful resistance by another to the discharge of official duty or when the speech itself by its very volume and intensity interferes substantially with the carrying out of an official duty. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>457 P.2d at p. 292, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1978) 97 Misc.2d 124 [410 N.Y.S.2d 787], the defendant was charged with obstructing governmental administration. \u201cOn June 15, 1978, at 9:35 p.m., at the Kingsbridge Road (IND) subway platform southbound, the complaining officer, while in plainclothes and on anti-crime patrol, was recognized by the defendant. He promptly and repeatedly shouted his observation to the world by announcing the fact that the complainant was a police officer and warning those within hearing to refrain from doing anything wrong.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>410 N.Y.S.2d at p. 788.) The officer claimed \u201che then had a youth suspected of a graffiti offense under surveillance . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In dismissing the charge, the court stated: \u201cIn the case at bar the effect of the defendant\u2019s disclosure did, perhaps, make it more difficult to perform plainclothes duty. The fact, alone, is a risk inherent in many other similar situations. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">In the present case, the warning occurred before any obvious illegal activity had taken place. In addition, as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jelliffe, supra, </em>449 N.E.2d 810, appellant\u2019s warning may have prevented a crime from being committed. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s speech was nonthreatening, was not accompanied by physical force, was not so loud or intense that it interfered with Officer Huizar\u2019s duty, and did not incite an <em>unlawful </em>resistance by the suspect. As appellant notes, the suspect had no duty to continue to talk to the undercover officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Although appellant\u2019s disclosure of the officer\u2019s identity might make it more difficult for Officer Huizar to continue to perform plainclothes duty in that area, it is clear that at least one person in the area, appellant, already knew or suspected that Huizar was a police officer. An officer working undercover places himself in danger, and an inherent risk of this kind of duty is that the officer\u2019s identity may be known or may become known.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">The majority relies on <em>Long </em>v. <em>Valentino </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1287 [265 Cal.Rptr. 96], and concludes that appellant\u2019s statements were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>merely speech but rather speech that resulted in physical interference with the officer\u2019s ability to complete his investigation. This reasoning runs afoul of the First Amendment protection recognized in <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 451, 461-463 [96 L.Ed.2d 398, 412-413, 107 S.Ct. 2502]: \u201c[Contrary to the city\u2019s contention, the First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers. \u2018Speech is often provocative and challenging. . . . [But it] is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.\u2019 [Citation.] In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130 [39 L.Ed.2d 214, 94 S.Ct. 970] (1974), for example, the appellant was found to have yelled obscenities and threats at an officer who had asked appellant\u2019s husband to produce his driver\u2019s license. Appellant was convicted under a municipal ordinance that made it a crime \u2018 \u201cfor any person wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to any member of the city police while in the actual performance of his duty.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 132 .... We vacated the conviction and invalidated the ordinance as facially overbroad. Critical to our decision was the fact that the ordinance \u2018punishe[d] only spoken words\u2019 and was not limited in scope to fighting words that \u2018 \u201cby their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u201d \u2019...[']\u25a1 The Houston ordinance is much more sweeping than the municipal ordinance struck down in <em>Lewis. </em>It is not limited to fighting words nor even to obscene or opprobrious language, but prohibits speech that \u2018in any manner . . . interrupt[s]\u2019 an officer. The Constitution does not allow such speech to be made a crime. The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">I am persuaded by the reasoning set forth above that the imposition of criminal sanctions for the words spoken here would violate appellant\u2019s constitutional rights under the First Amendment of the federal Constitution as well as article I, section 2, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution. I would therefore reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
