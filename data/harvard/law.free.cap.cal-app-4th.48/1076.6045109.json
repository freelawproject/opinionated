Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Judith O\u2019Connor, administrator of the estate of Gerald O\u2019Connor, appeals from a judgment rendered in favor of Old Republic Surety Company (Old Republic) which absolves Old Republic of liability for damage caused to the conservatorship estate of Gerald O\u2019Connor by Richard Bronson (Bronson), a San Francisco attorney appointed to act as \u201csuccessor conservator\u201d for Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment declares to be void both an April 9, 1992, order appointing Bronson successor conservator for Gerald O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s estate, and letters of conservatorship issued to Bronson pursuant to that order. The judgment also rescinds a bond issued by Old Republic guaranteeing the faithful performance of Bronson\u2019s duties as successor conservator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">We conclude that the order appointing Bronson successor conservator and letters of conservatorship issued to him are not void and that Old Republic is precluded from challenging their validity. We also find that Old Republic is not entitled to rescission. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">A. <em>The Conservatorship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On August 30, 1984, Kathleen Porter and Grace Coyne were appointed conservators for the estate of their brother, Gerald O\u2019Connor. Bronson was the attorney of record for Porter and Coyne. Gerald O\u2019Connor died on December 7, 1989. Porter died several days later, on December 26, 1989, and Judith O\u2019Connor was appointed administrator of Porter\u2019s estate. Then, in August 1990, Coyne became incapacitated and Judith O\u2019Connor was appointed as Coyne\u2019s conservator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judith O\u2019Connor did not, in her capacity as conservator for Coyne, prepare a final account and report to close Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s conservatorship estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, that estate was not formally closed until almost three years after Gerald O\u2019Connor died.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">B. <em>Bronson\u2019s Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">On April 9, 1992, Bronson filed an ex parte petition in the San Francisco probate court seeking appointment as successor conservator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate (the Petition). Among other things, the Petition stated that Gerald O\u2019Connor was deceased and that appointment of a successor conservator was necessary to prepare a final accounting and distribute the assets of the estate. The Petition also indicated that Bronson had filed a separate petition in San Mateo County to be appointed administrator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">There is no evidence Bronson gave notice of the Petition to anyone, that a court investigation was conducted, or that a hearing on the Petition was held.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the same day the Petition was filed, the court issued an ex parte order appointing Bronson successor conservator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate (the April 9 Order). The April 9 Order stated that Bronson was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>to give notice of his appointment and fixed a bond at $400,000. Letters of successor conservatorship (the Letters) were also issued to Bronson on April 9, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">C. <em>The Old Republic Bond</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Old Republic issued a bond dated April 9, 1992, in the matter of the conservatorship of Gerald O\u2019Connor (the Bond). The Bond named Bronson as principal and recited that he had been appointed \u201cSuccessor Conservator.\u201d The Bond was signed by Old Republic\u2019s attorney-in-fact, identified Gerald O\u2019Connor as the obligee, and obligated Old Republic to pay $400,000, which obligation was to continue until Bronson \u201cfaithfully execute[d] the duties of the trust according to law . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties dispute whether the Bond was filed in the probate court. Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual determination that the Bond was never filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The Bond is not in the court file for this case and there is no record in the registry of actions that it was ever filed. Carolyn Moran, the deputy clerk who issued the Letters to Bronson on April 9, 1992, testified that, if a bond was required, it was her \u201cstandard practice\u201d to request that the bond be presented before she would issue letters. Indeed, Moran claimed that she would not issue letters unless a bond was presented to her. However, Moran could not recall whether, in the present case, Bronson actually presented the Bond to her before she issued the April 9 Letters. Julita De Chavez, Moran\u2019s supervisor, testified unequivocally that if the Bond had been filed it would be recorded in the registry of actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">On April 30, 1992, the original Bond, which should have been filed with the probate court when the April 9 Letters were issued, was returned to Old Republic\u2019s agent, Dave Carter, in some manner not disclosed by the evidence. Carter testified at trial that he knew the Bond had not been filed with the court because it was not file-endorsed. Carter also testified that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>aware this original document was supposed to have been filed when the Letters were issued. Indeed, Carter stated that, in other cases, it was his practice to request file-endorsed copies of documents that needed to be filed with the court. This confirmed prior testimony by an Old Republic executive that Old Republic regularly received copies of filed bonds \u201cthe next day through the mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">When the original Bond was returned to Carter, his assistant wrote \u201cvoid\u201d across the face of the Bond and, under the word \u201cvoid,\u201d \u201csee corrected bond.\u201d Carter then forwarded the original Bond to Old Republic which put it in a file. Old Republic subsequently issued a \u201cduplicate original\u201d Bond in the matter of the conservatorship of Gerald O\u2019Connor, which identified Bronson as the Principal, stated he was appointed successor conservator, and had the same effective date of April 9,1992, as the original Bond. According to the San Francisco Branch Manager for Old Republic, the duplicate original Bond was prepared because the original was \u201cnot correctly issued\u201d in that it improperly identified Bronson as a \u201ctemporary successor conservator\u201d instead of simply the \u201csuccessor conservator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Carter gave the executed original of the duplicate original Bond to Bronson and kept a copy for his files. The duplicate original Bond is not in the court file for this matter, and there is no evidence it was ever filed. Indeed, the copy of it in the surety\u2019s files was not file-stamped nor did it even show Bronson\u2019s signature as Principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">D. <em>Bronson\u2019s Embezzlement and Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s Efforts to Enforce the Bond</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In early November 1992, the probate court settled Bronson\u2019s account as successor conservator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate, approved his request for attorneys fees, terminated the conservatorship, and ordered Bronson to deliver the assets of the conservatorship to Judith O\u2019Connor who had been appointed administrator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate. The order calculated estate assets to be $413,441.38, authorized Bronson to credit himself $9,945.00 for legal fees, and provided that, upon delivery of the balance of the assets to Judith O\u2019Connor, Bronson and the surety that posted his bond would be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">On December 3, 1992, Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s attorney made a claim with Old Republic for payment of the Bond. According to this claim, Bronson had delivered to Judith O\u2019Connor only $95,057.84 from Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate. On May 20, 1993, Old Republic denied Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim for payment on the Bond and attempted to refund the Bond premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>On June 8, 1993, Judith O\u2019Connor filed a motion for judgment on the Bond in the probate court. The probate court denied Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion as untimely because a motion to surcharge Bronson needed to be heard first. On October 6, 1993, the probate court issued its order surcharging Bronson as conservator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate on the grounds that he embezzled and converted estate property. Bronson was ordered to pay Judith O\u2019Connor, as administrator of Gerald\u2019s estate, $300,412.85 as the amount that had been wrongfully converted, $24,076.32 in interest, and $15,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">E. <em>Old Republic\u2019s Action and the Consolidated Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On December 24,1992, a few weeks after Judith O\u2019Connor first made her claim against the Bond, Old Republic sued Bronson to recover losses it incurred by reason of issuing bonds to Bronson in this and other estate matters. On May 27,1993, after it denied Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim, Old Republic amended its complaint against Bronson and named Judith O\u2019Con-nor as a defendant. In the amended complaint, Old Republic sought a declaration that the April 9, 1992, Order and Letters were null and void, and also sought to rescind the Bond on various grounds including fraud, mistake, and the alleged fact that the Bond never became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On December 3, 1993, the superior court consolidated Old Republic\u2019s civil action with the probate proceeding. Issues pertaining to the dispute between Judith O\u2019Connor and Old Republic were bifurcated and tried first to the court. On March 14, 1994, the trial court filed a tentative decision in favor of Old Republic declaring the April 9 Order and Letters void and also ordering the Bond rescinded. On May 12, 1994, the trial court adopted Old Republic\u2019s proposed statement of decision without change and entered judgment in favor of Old Republic.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The lower court exonerated Old Republic of liability for Bronson\u2019s actions on two alternative legal grounds: (1) The April 9 Order and Letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>appointing Bronson successor conservator are void; and (2) Old Republic was entitled to rescind the Bond. We conclude, in contrast, that the April 9 Order and Letters are not void and that Old Republic is precluded from challenging their validity. Further, we find that Old Republic may not rescind the Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">A. <em>The Probate Court\u2019s April 9 Order and the Letters Issued in Reliance Thereon Are Not Void</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">1. <em>The trial court failed to distinguish action in excess of a court\u2019s jurisdiction from action by a court which lacks subject matter jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The trial court ruled that the April 9 Order and Letters are void because the probate court acted \u201cin excess of its jurisdiction and/or without jurisdiction\u201d when it appointed Bronson as the successor conservator for Gerald O\u2019Connor. Specifically, the trial court found that (1) the April 9 Order appointing Bronson successor conservator is void because it was issued ex parte without notice, hearing or investigation in violation of Probate Code sections 1820 et seq. and 2680 et seq., (2) the Letters are void because they were issued ex parte without the filing of a bond, and (3) Bronson\u2019s appointment was invalid because the probate court did not have the authority under the code to appoint a successor conservator for a deceased person. Urging us to affirm the trial court\u2019s findings, Old Republic characterizes the probate court\u2019s appointment of Bronson as outside the \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Both the trial court and Old Republic mischaracterize the jurisdictional problem at issue in this case; both fail to distinguish between conduct by a court that has no jurisdiction over the subject matter on the one hand and action which is in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction on the other hand. The distinction between these two concepts has been explained in some detail in a number of published decisions including our recent decision in <em>Law Offices of Stanley J. Bell </em>v. <em>Shine, Brown &amp; Diamond </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1011 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 717] <em>(Bell). </em>(See also <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McConnell </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 715, 727 [285 P.2d 636] <em>(Pacific Mutual); </em>2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 266, 270-272, pp. 663-665, 669-675.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> The principle of \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d relates to the inherent authority of the court involved to deal with the case or matter before it. (See <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].) In contrast, a court acts in excess of jurisdiction \u201c \u2018where, though the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>parties in the fundamental sense, it has no \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (or power) to act except in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bell, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1022, quoting <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at p. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The statement of decision is inaccurate to the extent it provides that action in excess of jurisdiction is null and void. Action \u201cin excess of jurisdiction\u201d by a court that has jurisdiction in the \u201cfundamental sense\u201d (i.e., jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties) is not void, <em>but only voidable. </em>(See <em>Pacific Mutual, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at pp. 725-726; <em>Bell, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1021-1026; <em>In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1, 431 P.2d 625]; 2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 266-271, 287, pp. 663-673, 693-694.) In contrast to cases involving other types of jurisdictional defects, a party may be precluded from challenging action in excess of a court\u2019s jurisdiction when the circumstances warrant applying principles of estoppel, disfavor of collateral attack or res judicata.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Bell, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1021-1023.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">2. <em>The probate court was not without jurisdiction to issue the April 9 Order and Letters</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The statement of decision sets forth two grounds to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the probate court was \u201cwithout jurisdiction\u201d to issue the April 9 Order and Letters: (1) The probate court does not retain jurisdiction to appoint a successor conservator for a deceased person; and (2) failure to follow \u201cmandatory\u201d statutory procedures rendered the appointment void. We disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">a. <em>Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s death did not terminate the probate court's jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u201cThe superior court has jurisdiction of guardianship and conservatorship proceedings.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a72200.) Death of the conservatee does not terminate the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction over the conservatorship estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>The court retains jurisdiction over the estate \u201cfor the purpose of settling the accounts of the guardian or conservator <em>or for any other purpose incident to </em>the enforcement of the judgments and orders of the court upon such accounts . . . (Prob. Code, \u00a7 2630, italics added.) Relevant case law illustrates that the scope of the court\u2019s jurisdiction should be construed broadly to accomplish these goals. (Cf. <em>Conservatorship of Starr </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1390 [264 Cal.Rptr. 80]; see also <em>Estate of Mims </em>(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 332 [20 Cal.Rptr. 667].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Further, although the trial court correctly observed that death of a conservatee terminates the conservatorship, the conservator has a continuing \u201cduty of custody and conservation of the estate\u201d after the conservatee\u2019s death \u201cpending the delivery thereof to the personal representative of the . . . conservatee\u2019s estate or other disposition according to law.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 2467, subd. (a).) The Probate Code also expressly recognizes that, notwithstanding termination of the conservatorship, the conservator nevertheless retains those powers that are necessary to perform this duty. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 2467, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Thus, in the present case, Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s death did not terminate the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction over his estate. When the April 9 Order was issued, the conservatorship account for Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate had not been settled and the court retained jurisdiction to settle it. Further, Coyne\u2019s duty of custody and conservation was continuing pending some disposition by the court. The Petition makes clear that the alleged purpose of Bronson\u2019s appointment as successor conservator was to settle the accounts of his clients, Coyne and Porter. Thus, although the probate court\u2019s method, i.e., appointing Bronson successor conservator, may not have been proper under the Probate Code (a question we do not answer), the court clearly had jurisdiction over Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s conservatorship estate when it issued the April 9 Order and Letters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Apparently, the trial court was influenced by the fact that the Probate Code does not expressly authorize the court to appoint a successor conservator for a deceased person. Thus, the Statement of Decision characterizes the probate court as a court of limited jurisdiction whose powers are \u201cwholly statutory\u201d and which \u201cmust look to express statutes for its jurisdiction and procedure.\u201d (Quoting 12 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1990) Wills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>and Probate, \u00a7 333, p. 366.) As Witkin explains, this view was expressed in \u201cformer case law.\u201d Section 7050 of the Probate Code, operative July 1,1991, now clearly provides that the probate court is a court of general jurisdiction. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 7050, subd. (b); see also Prob. Code, \u00a7 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The trial court also relied on authority which provides that \u201c[a] conservatorship may be established only for adults and minors who are married or whose marriage has been dissolved.\u201d This authority is beside the point since, in the present case, there is no dispute that the conservatorship was \u201cestablished\u201d when Gerald O\u2019Connor was alive, and there is no question on appeal as to the propriety of the initial establishment of that conservatorship. The question is whether Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s death terminated the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the conservatorship estate. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">b. <em>Failure to comply with statutory procedure did not deprive the probate court of jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The trial court concluded that mandatory statutory procedure was not followed by the probate court because the April 9 Order was issued without notice of the Petition, a hearing or an investigation, and because the Letters of Conservatorship were issued without the filing of a bond. Even if we accept these findings, the trial court erred by concluding that failure to comply with statutory procedures automatically rendered Bronson\u2019s appointment void. Apparently, this erroneous conclusion was precipitated by the trial court\u2019s misconception of the probate court as a court of limited jurisdiction and by its mistaken reliance on several cases involving markedly different provisions of the Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">None of the cases cited in the statement of decision, and relied on again by Old Republic on appeal, involve the statutory provisions at issue in the present case, nor do they allude to or establish a per se rule that failure to comply with statutory procedure automatically renders void the orders of a probate court. Indeed, <em>Estate of Buckley </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 434 [183 Cal.Rptr. 281] <em>(Buckley), </em>cited with approval in the statement of decision, recognizes that failure to comply with a statutory requirement renders a judgment \u201cvoid\u201d only when the statute \u201crelates to jurisdiction in the \u2018fundamental\u2019 sense, that is to authority over the subject matter or the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 446.) None of the authority relied on by the trial court or cited to us by Old Republic supports the conclusion that the procedural irregularities in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>the present case deprived the probate court of subject matter jurisdiction over Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The trial court particularly relied on <em>Estate of Joslyn </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 671 [64 Cal.Rptr. 386] <em>(Joslyn). </em>The <em>Joslyn </em>court found ineffective a probate court order appointing a testamentary trustee when no petition had been filed and no notice of the proposed appointment had been posted by the court. The <em>Joslyn </em>court reasoned that individuals entitled to notice of the proposed appointment effectively waived their right to personal notice, but held that the stipulation did not and could not waive the statutory requirements that a petition be filed and that the court post notice of the prospective appointment. Reasoning that \u201cjurisdiction may not be acquired by stipulation,\u201d the <em>Joslyn </em>court implicitly found that failure to comply with the statutory provisions at issue in that case deprived the probate court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Joslyn </em>is inapposite for several reasons. First, the violations of statutory requirements in that case are not remotely similar to the alleged procedural irregularities in the present case. Here, Bronson <em>did </em>file a petition and the probate court was not required to post notice of that petition. Second, <em>Joslyn </em>does not establish that failure to comply with statutory procedure automatically and inevitably deprives the probate court of subject matter jurisdiction. Indeed, the <em>Joslyn </em>court held that parties statutorily entitled to personal notice of the trustee\u2019s petition effectively waived their right to such notice. By holding that the personal notice requirement was waived, the <em>Joslyn </em>court acknowledged that personal notice is not jurisdictional since \u201cjurisdiction may not be acquired by stipulation.\u201d <em>(Joslyn, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at p. 676.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The only Supreme Court case cited to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the April 9 Order and Letters are void was <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 280.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But <em>Abelleira </em>holds that \u201c. . . a probate court, with jurisdiction of an estate, and therefore over the appointment of an administrator, nevertheless acts in excess of jurisdiction if it fails to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>the statutory provisions governing such appointment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 288; see also <em>Pacific Mutual, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at pp. 725-727.) As discussed above, action in excess of a court\u2019s jurisdiction is not void, but merely voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Because the trial court mischaracterized the jurisdictional issue presented by these facts, it never decided whether Old Republic could legitimately challenge the April 9 Order and Letters appointing Bronson successor conservator. We conclude that, for the reasons that follow, such a challenge is not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">B. <em>Old Republic Is Precluded From Challenging the Validity of the April 9 Order and Letters</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cUnlike some other jurisdictional defects, a party may, by its conduct, be estopped from contesting an action in excess of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Bell, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1022-1023.) When \u201c \u2018the court has jurisdiction of the subject, a party who seeks or consents to action beyond the court\u2019s power as defined by statute or decisional rule may be estopped to complain of the ensuing action in excess of jurisdiction. [Citations.] Whether he shall be estopped depends on the importance of the irregularity not only to the parties but to the functioning of the courts and in some instances on other considerations of public policy. A litigant who has stipulated to a procedure in excess of jurisdiction may be estopped to question it when \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would permit the parties to trifle with the courts.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Be<em>ll, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1023-1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We conclude that this record evidences a course of conduct by Old Republic whereby it manifested its consent to the procedure by which Bronson was appointed successor conservator of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate and that such conduct estops Old Republic from challenging the validity of Bronson\u2019s appointment. This course of conduct included (1) issuing the Bond without reviewing Bronson\u2019s Petition, (2) placing the original unfiled Bond in its file, keeping the premium, and issuing a duplicate original Bond to Bronson, all the while never securing (contrary to its usual policy) file-stamped copies of <em>either </em>edition of the Bond, and (3) declining to participate in the surcharge proceeding pursuant to which Bronson\u2019s liability was conclusively established.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>1. <em>Old Republic did not review Bronson\u2019s Petition which disclosed the alleged procedural irregularities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Old Republic made the decision to issue the Bond knowing very little about the terms or circumstances of Bronson\u2019s appointment; it issued the Bond without reviewing the Petition or the April 9 Order. Had Old Republic looked at these documents, it would have learned, among other things, that (1) Bronson sought and obtained an ex parte appointment as successor conservator, (2) Gerald O\u2019Connor was deceased and thus, for obvious reasons, was not interviewed by the court investigator, and (3) notice of the Petition was not provided to family members or interested persons. In <em>Mason </em>v. <em>U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 587 [141 P.2d 475] <em>(Mason), </em>a surety attempted to avoid liability under a bond which was used by the principal to obtain a temporary restraining order. The <em>Mason </em>court found that the surety was estopped from arguing that the temporary restraining order was issued in violation of applicable statutes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 590.) The <em>Mason </em>court noted, among other things, that if the surety had reviewed the papers submitted to the court to secure the order before issuing its bond, the error about which it now complained might never have occurred. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 591.) This court approved and adopted the <em>Mason </em>court\u2019s reasoning in <em>First </em>v. <em>Armes </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 633, 638 [194 Cal.Rptr. 171]. The undertaking at issue in that case had (as was also the case in <em>Mason) </em>been issued by the surety before its principal\u2019s moving papers had even been prepared. We held that the surety was estopped to attempt to limit its liability on the undertaking by relying upon ambiguities in the order the surety\u2019s principal obtained by posting the undertaking. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 637-638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In the present case, it is not clear from the record whether Bronson had already obtained the April 9 Order when Old Republic\u2019s agent issued the Bond to him. What is clear, though, is that if either Old Republic or its agent had read Bronson\u2019s Petition or the April 9 Order, they would have discovered <em>all </em>of the alleged procedural irregularities about which Old Republic now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">2. <em>Old Republic put the original Bond in its file, never secured a file-stamped copy, and all the while retained the premium</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Old Republic accepted, from some unknown source, the original Bond that it knew should have been filed with the clerk of the probate court. Old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>Republic\u2019s agent testified that he knew this original bond was not file-endorsed and that it should have been filed with the court when the Letters were issued to Bronson. Nevertheless, Old Republic kept the original unfiled Bond and made no effort to declare the Bond ineffective or return the premium.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, Old Republic issued a duplicate original Bond to Bronson. There is no evidence Old Republic made any effort to determine whether the duplicate original Bond was ever filed with the court notwithstanding its practice of requiring court-endorsed copies of such documents and its knowledge that the original Bond had never been filed. Indeed, Old Republic\u2019s copy of the duplicate original Bond does not even contain Bronson\u2019s signature. Old Republic was content to keep the Bond premium and to remain silent about information which it now claims should relieve it from liability under the Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">We find it particularly appropriate to apply the estoppel principle articulated in <em>Mason, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 587, to preclude Old Republic from arguing Bronson\u2019s appointment was not effective because the Bond was never filed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, Old Republic\u2019s conduct in this matter is more egregious since it not only failed to review pertinent court documents, it ignored the consequences of the fact that the original Bond was returned to it <em>unfiled, </em>and then went on to issue yet another duplicate original to Bronson and, again, failed to secure a file-endorsed copy of that Bond as was its general practice. Important policy concerns are served by discouraging the very conduct Old Republic engaged in here, i.e., placing the original Bond it its files, keeping the Bond premium, and remaining silent until after a claim was made against the Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>3. <em>Old Republic did not participate in the surcharge action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The probate court\u2019s final order surcharging Bronson for violating his duties as successor conservator was entered on October 6, 1993. In the present action, Old Republic has ignored that surcharge order and carefully limited its objections to the April 9 Order and Letters. However, its substantive challenge is much more far-reaching. Indeed, Old Republic\u2019s action amounts to a collateral attack on the probate court\u2019s surcharge order which conclusively established that Bronson \u201cwhile acting as Successor Conservator duly appointed by order of this court ... in bad faith wrongfully concealed and disposed of property belonging to the estate of Gerald O\u2019Con-nor . . . .\u201d For at least two reasons, Old Republic should be precluded from launching such a collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"> First, an order establishing the principal\u2019s liability is binding on the surety. The surety cannot go behind the decree and inquire into its validity. <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Backus </em>(1864) 25 Cal. 214, 223-224; <em>Crumrine </em>v. <em>Dizdar </em>(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 783, 787-790 [140 P.2d 101]; see also <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Mass. Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 1, 6 [123 P.2d 449]; <em>Estate of Davis </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 663, 669 [268 Cal.Rptr. 384].) \u201cIf a surety has signed an administrator\u2019s bond, and has undertaken thereby to pay any balance which shall be adjudged to be due by the administrator to the estate, he is bound by the judgment unless he can show the judgment was obtained by fraud.\u201d <em>(Crumrine </em>v. <em>Dizdar, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.2d at p. 789.) \u201c[T]he defenses available to a surety in an action upon the bond are: that the bond was not made; or that the decree ordering the administrator to deliver property for which he was accountable, was obeyed; or that the decree was not made; or that the decree, if made, was obtained by fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 787.) Old Republic cannot circumvent this long-standing rule by ignoring the surcharge order establishing Bronson\u2019s liability and attacking instead the earlier order pursuant to which Bronson was appointed successor conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Second, \u201c[t]he \u2018estoppel\u2019 principle is particularly compelling where, as here, what is involved is a collateral attack.\u201d <em>(Bell, supra, 36 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1024.) \u201c \u2018[A]cts merely in excess of jurisdiction, by a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter and parties, should not be subject to collateral attack unless exceptional circumstances precluded an earlier and more appropriate attack.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting 2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Jurisdiction, \u00a7 266, p. 664; see also <em>Pacific Mutual, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 727.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Old Republic had notice of the surcharge proceeding and could have participated. <em>(Estate of Davis, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 663 [a surety is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>interested person under Probate Code section 48, and is thus entitled to participate in a proceeding to surcharge its principal].) Though Old Republic questioned both the validity of Bronson\u2019s appointment and the effectiveness of the Bond, it chose not to participate in the surcharge proceeding.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to justify Old Republic\u2019s backdoor, collateral attack on the surcharge order.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In sum, we conclude that Old Republic is precluded by principles of estoppel and disfavor of collateral attacks from challenging the validity of the April 9 Order and Letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">C. <em>Old Republic Is Not Entitled to Rescission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The trial court found that Old Republic was entitled to rescind the Bond because (1) the Bond was written pursuant to a mistake of fact and (2) Gerald O\u2019Connor did not have an insurable interest in the property insured. On appeal Old Republic contends the rescission was also proper because there was a failure of consideration. We reject each of these alleged justifications for rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">1. <em>Mistake of fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> Mistake of fact is the primary justification identified by the trial court as warranting rescission of the Bond. \u201c \u2018Rescission may be had for mistake of fact if the mistake is material to the contract and is not the result of neglect of a legal duty, if enforcement of the contract as made would be unconscionable, if the other party can be placed in status quo, if the party seeking relief gives prompt notice of his election to rescind, and if he restores or offers to restore to the other party everything of value which he has received under the contract.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>Berrenda Mesa Water Dist. </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 894, 900-901 [87 Cal.Rptr. 338]; see also <em>Brunzell Const. Co. </em>v. <em>G.J. Weisbrod, Inc. </em>(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 278, 284 [285 P.2d 989].)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Ignoring this basic rule, the statement of decision contains the following irrelevant proposition: \u201cEquity will permit a rescission of a contract for mistake of both parties as to a material collateral matter, vital to and forming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>an essential part of the contract.\u201d (Citing <em>Tetenman </em>v. <em>Epstein </em>(1924) 66 Cal.App. 745 [226 P. 966].) The proposition is irrelevant because the trial court did not find that there was a mutual mistake in the present case. Indeed, the record could support no such finding. All of the trial court\u2019s findings in this regard pertain exclusively to Old Republic\u2019s unilateral mistaken beliefs\u2014that Bronson\u2019s appointment was valid and effective, that proper procedure was followed, and that Gerald O\u2019Connor was alive. Thus, we cannot approve the rescission on the ground of mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Section 1689 of the Civil Code, which sets forth the grounds for rescission, does not require that a mistake of fact be mutual in order to justify rescission. However, case law limits the circumstances under which a unilateral mistake renders a contract voidable. We conclude that those limitations, ignored by the trial court, apply in the present case and prohibit Old Republic from rescinding the Bond on the ground of unilateral mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Many courts have held that a unilateral mistake is ground for rescission only if the mistake is known to the other contracting party and is encouraged or fostered by that party. (See <em>Bunnett </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 843, 854-855 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 567]; <em>Merced County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 765, 772 [284 Cal.Rptr. 680]; <em>Architects &amp; Contractors Estimating Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1001, 1007-1008 [211 Cal.Rptr. 45]; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Benko </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 937, 944 [127 Cal.Rptr. 846].) A much relaxed version of this rule provides that, if the proponent of the contract had reason to know of the mistake, the mistaken party can avoid the contract. (See <em>In re First Capital Life Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1288 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 816].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In the present case, the trial court made no finding, nor is there any evidence, that the other contracting party (Bronson) was aware of Old Republic\u2019s factual mistakes or unfairly used those mistakes to his own advantage. Indeed, and as noted above, had Old Republic followed a more prudent course and read Bronson\u2019s Petition before issuing the Bond, all of the mistakes it made could have been avoided. Nor is there any finding or evidence that Judith O\u2019Connor, the proponent of the contract in this case, knew or had reason to know of Old Republic\u2019s mistakes. In fact, it was Old Republic which learned that proper procedure was not followed when it received back the original, unfiled Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Division Five of this court has held that, notwithstanding the rules stated above, a trial court has the power to rescind a contract for purely unilateral mistake not induced or contributed to by the other party. <em>(Schultz </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 242 [203 Cal.Rptr. 760] <em>(Schultz), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>disagreed with on another ground in <em>Van Petten </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 43, 50 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 816].) The <em>Schultz </em>court based this conclusion on section 153 of the Restatement Second of Contracts, which provides: \u201c \u2018Where a mistake of one party at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which he made the contract has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to him, the contract is voidable by him if he does not bear the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in \u00a7 154, and [*][] (a) the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, or [^Q (b) the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake.\u2019 \u201d (Schultz, <em>supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d. at p. 249, fn. omitted, quoting Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 153, p. 394.) The <em>Schultz </em>court found that California law recognizes both alternative grounds for rescission which are set forth in section 153 of the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><em>Schultz </em>does not alter our conclusion that rescission is inappropriate in the present case for two reasons. First, enforcing the Bond would not be unconscionable under these facts. Second, as the <em>Schultz </em>court also recognized, a contract is not voidable under section 153 of the Restatement <em>if the party seeking rescission bore the risk of mistake pursuant to section 154 of the Restatement. (Schultz, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 249, fn. 1.) \u201cA party [to a contract] bears the risk of a mistake when [^Q . . . he is aware, at the time the contract is made, that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats his limited knowledge as sufficient.\u201d (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 154, subd. (b), pp. 402-403; <em>In re Marriage of Hahn </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1236, 1241 [273 Cal.Rptr. 516].) In the present case, Old Republic cannot reasonably dispute the fact that it made the decision to issue the Bond without first obtaining and reviewing available information about Bronson\u2019s appointment. It treated its limited information as sufficient and thus bore the risk that it was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Our conclusion that rescissionary relief should be denied is further supported by the rule that \u201c[a] contract is voidable for mistake only if enforcement would be materially harmful or more onerous to the party seeking avoidance than it would have been had the law or the facts been as believed.\u201d (See <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co. </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 879, 886 [124 Cal.Rptr. 577]; Rest., Contracts, \u00a7 502, pp. 961-962.) In the present case, the trial court found that Old Republic would not have written the Bond had it not been mistaken about certain facts. However, the court did not find that any of those mistakes made the risk Old Republic knowingly assumed any more onerous or substantial; indeed, the mistakes did not relate to the conditions or degree of Old Republic\u2019s liability under the Bond. If the facts had been as Old Republic believed they were, Bronson would still have been able to abscond with estate funds and Old Republic\u2019s liability would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>A final factor weighing against rescission, a factor ignored by the trial court, is that permitting rescission would adversely and unfairly injure the beneficiaries of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate. \u201cIt is, of course, fundamental that where the rights of others have intervened and circumstances have so far changed that rescission may not be decreed without injury to those parties and their rights, rescission will be denied and the complaining party left to his other remedies.\u201d <em>(Beckwith </em>v. <em>Sheldon </em>(1913) 165 Cal. 319, 324 [131 P. 1049].) Old Republic was on notice that proper procedure was not followed when it first received the original unfiled Bond in the mail. Nevertheless, Old Republic did not attempt to rescind the Bond until Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s estate and those interested in that estate had been severely injured by Bronson.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In sum, Old Republic\u2019s mistakes are attributable to nobody other than itself; it assumed the risk of acting with limited information, and it did not act promptly to rescind (or even to make inquiry) when it received back the original unfiled Bond and, at the same time, <em>did not </em>receive back a file-stamped copy. Further, if rescission is permitted, the parties cannot be returned to the status quo and, more importantly, the interests of third parties would be substantially injured. For all of these reasons, Old Republic is not entitled to rescind the Bond on the ground of unilateral mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">2. <em>Lack of an insurable interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The trial court found that Old Republic was entitled to rescission pursuant to \u201cvarious provisions of the Insurance Code.\u201d Specifically, the trial court relied on section 280 of the Insurance Code which provides: \u201cIf the insured has no insurable interest, the contract is void.\u201d The court reasoned that Gerald O\u2019Connor was the beneficiary of the bond and that, since he was deceased, he did not have an insurable interest when the Bond was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We have found no authority which identifies section 280 of the Insurance Code as a basis for affirming rescission of a surety bond. The only authority identified by the trial court is Insurance Code section 100, which, according to the trial court, \u201cexpressly makes its provisions applicable to Sureties.\u201d Section 100 of the Insurance Code does identify \u201cSurety\u201d as one of several \u201cclasses\u201d of Insurance. However, as Old Republic concedes, a surety contract is not an insurance policy, but a third party beneficiary undertaking to indemnify a person against losses resulting from the acts of the principal. (See <em>Schmitt </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 245 [281 Cal.Rptr. 261]; <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc. </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 764, 769 [180 Cal.Rptr. 546].) Apparently, Old Republic convinced the trial court that the beneficiary of a surety bond is sufficiently analogous to an \u201cinsured\u201d to justify applying section 280 of the Insurance Code in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Even if we accept Old Republic\u2019s analogy, section 280 of the Insurance Code does not authorize Old Republic\u2019s attempted rescission of the Bond. The trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary is error because it is based on the faulty premise that Gerald O\u2019Connor was the only possible beneficiary under the Bond. Section 2320 of the Probate Code, which sets forth the general requirement of a bond in conservatorship and guardianship proceedings, specifically provides that \u201c[t]he bond shall be for the benefit of the ward or conservatee <em>and all persons interested in the guardianship or conservatorship estate </em>. . . .\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 2320, subd. (b), italics added.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, Gerald O\u2019Connor was not the only beneficiary of the Bond. For example, Grace Coyne, Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s incapacitated conservator and a named beneficiary in his will, was an interested person in the conservatorship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Coyne, who was alive when the Bond was issued, had an insurable interest in Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s conservatorship estate. \u201cEvery interest in property, or any relation thereto, or liability in respect thereof, of such a nature that a contemplated peril might directly damnify the insured, is an insurable interest.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 281.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The \u201ccontemplated peril\u201d in this case was Bronson, and Bronson\u2019s conduct directly \u201cdamnified\" the interests of Coyne and her successors in the estate of Gerald O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">3. <em>Failure of consideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Although the trial court did not find there was a failure of consideration, Old Republic argues that a material consideration for the Bond failed because \u201call of the conditions essential to the effective giving of a bond failed.\u201d The allegedly failed conditions were that (1) Bronson\u2019s appointment never became effective, (2) the intended beneficiary on the Bond was deceased, and (3) the Bond never became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">a. <em>Bronson\u2019s appointment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We have already explained that Old Republic is estopped from challenging the effectiveness of Bronson\u2019s appointment. Our conclusion is not affected by <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Exnicious </em>(1925) 197 Cal. 443 [241 P. 397] <em>(Taylor), </em>which Old Republic mischaracterizes as \u201cexactly on the point.\" In <em>Taylor, </em>a bankruptcy trustee brought an action against a receiver of the bankrupt company and the surety who posted the receiver\u2019s bond to recover estate money the receiver failed to turn over to the trustee. The complaint alleged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>among other things, that the order appointing the receiver was in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 444-445.) The <em>Taylor </em>court affirmed an order granting the surety\u2019s demurrer, stating: \u201cWe take it ... to be the well-settled law of this state that a surety upon a bond given pursuant to an order of court or pursuant to a statute becomes such in contemplation of a valid order or valid statute, and not otherwise. If the order appointing the receiver be void, a material consideration for the execution of the bond has failed, and the surety cannot be held upon it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 446.) We decline to extend the rule stated in <em>Taylor </em>to the present facts. Since <em>Taylor </em>was decided, our Supreme Court has clarified that action in excess of jurisdiction is not void, but only voidable. (See, e.g., <em>Pacific Mutual, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at pp. 725-726; <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at pp. 287-291.) In the present case, principles of estoppel and the disfavor of collateral attack, principles apparently not implicated in <em>Taylor, </em>preclude Old Republic from challenging the validity of the April 9 Order. Since that order is not \u201cvoid,\u201d the <em>Taylor </em>rule does not apply.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">In <em>Bookasta </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 237 [120 Cal.Rptr. 229] <em>(Bookasta), </em>Bookasta sued on an undertaking that had been issued by the defendant surety in a prior action. The undertaking was issued in the prior action to secure a prejudgment attachment of Bookasta\u2019s assets. Bookasta prevailed in that action and alleged substantial damages as a result of the attachment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 239.) After Bookasta filed the second action, the statute pursuant to which the prejudgment attachment had been ordered in the prior action was declared unconstitutional. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Bookasta </em>court rejected the contention that there was a failure of consideration for the bond because the statute pursuant to which it was issued was subsequently found to be void. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 240-241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The <em>Bookasta </em>court recognized that a statute is not considered void but \u201cmerely voidable until such time as it is determined to be unconstitutional and that \u2018The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bookasta, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d at p. 242.) The court then applied a form of estoppel to preclude the surety from denying the validity of the undertaking which had been used to secure the attachment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 241-242.) Although for different reasons, we have also found that the facts of the present case warrant applying estoppel to preclude Old Republic from challenging the April 9 Order in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>b. <em>The beneficiary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Old Republic\u2019s contention that there was never a third party beneficiary on the Bond is a reformulation of its argument there was no insurable interest in this case. Essentially, Old Republic contends that there was no beneficiary of the Bond because Gerald O\u2019Connor was dead when the Bond was issued. As Old Republic concedes, the beneficiary is \u201cthe person for whose benefit the bond was given, whether executed to, in favor of, in the name of, or payable to the person as obligee.\u201d The persons for whose benefit the conservatorship bond is issued are identified in Probate Code section 2320, subdivision (b), and include not only the conservatee, but \u201call persons interested\u201d in the conservatorship estate. In other words, the bond is issued to protect the conservatorship <em>estate </em>and is not, as Old Republic contends, for the sole protection of the conservatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">c. <em>The Bond</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Old Republic argues that the Bond never became effective because it was never filed or approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Section 995.420, subdivision (a), of the Code of Civil Procedure states: \u201cUnless the statute providing for a bond provides that the bond becomes effective at a different time, a bond is effective at the time it is given or, <em>if the statute requires that the bond be approved, at the time it is </em>approved.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 2320, subdivision (a), of the Probate Code provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, every person appointed as guardian or conservator shall, before letters are issued, give a bond <em>approved by the court.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Old Republic argues that these statutory provisions establish that, since the Bond was never filed, it was not approved by the court and never became effective. Even if we accept this literal interpretation of the statutory provisions,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we cannot accept Old Republic\u2019s contention that Bronson\u2019s filing and obtaining approval of the Bond was material consideration for Old Republic\u2019s issuance of the Bond to Bronson. Consideration is a benefit conferred or agreed to be conferred upon the promisor or prejudice suffered or agreed to be suffered \u201cas an inducement\u201d to the promisor. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1605.) In this case, the requirements that the Bond be filed and approved by the court were not negotiated by Bronson and Old Republic; they were not benefits conferred by Bronson on Old Republic or inducements for Old Republic to issue the Bond. These requirements were imposed by a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>which strongly suggests, by its own terms, that it was not enacted to benefit sureties. Section 995.380 of th\u00e9 Code of Civil Procedure provides that defects in the giving or filing of a bond <em>do not release the surety from liability </em>and that a beneficiary may <em>enforce </em>the liability on the bond against \u201cthe persons who intended to become and were included as sureties on the bond.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 995.380, italics added.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In sum, we conclude that Old Republic did not establish a failure of consideration entitling it to rescind the Bond. This record indicates rather clearly that the only real consideration for issuing the Bond in this case was the payment of the premium. In this regard, we find this case analogous to <em>Mason, </em>in which the surety was estopped from denying liability under a surety bond used to secure a temporary restraining order. <em>(Mason, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 587.) The <em>Mason </em>court rejected as unsound the surety\u2019s argument that there was a failure of consideration because the order pursuant to which its bond was posted did not comply with applicable statutory requirements. According to it, \u201c[t]he issuance of a proper restraining order was not the consideration for the issuance of the bond. The bonding company did not bargain to issue a bond in consideration of [its principal] securing a proper restraining order under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 527. It issued the bond for a premium, which was apparently paid. Whatever rights it may have against [the principal] because he secured an improper order are not involved in this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 593.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">This principle is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">D. <em>Judith O\u2019Connor Is Not Estopped by Her Negligence From Making a Claim Under the Bond</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The trial court found that Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s negligence estopped her from seeking relief against Old Republic. This conclusion was based on section 3543 of the Civil Code which provides that \u201c[w]here one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened, must be the sufferer.\u201d The conclusion that Judith O\u2019Connor is more to blame for Bronson\u2019s conduct than Old Republic is simply not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>The trial court reasoned that Judith O\u2019Connor was the negligent party because she failed to file an accounting in the conservatorship proceeding in her capacity as administrator of the estate of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s deceased conservator. If Judith O\u2019Connor had filed an accounting and initiated a closure of Gerald O\u2019Connor\u2019s conservatorship estate, possibly Bronson would not have embezzled from the estate. But we disagree that Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s conduct in her capacity as someone else\u2019s personal representative justifies penalizing this conservatorship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In ruling that the conservatorship estate should suffer the consequences of Bronson\u2019s actions, the trial court did not acknowledge the role that others played in creating the predicament presented to it and now us. For example, the probate court did not follow proper procedure and issued the Letters without filing the Bond. More importantly for present purposes, Old Republic\u2019s conduct is even more culpable. We refer specifically to the several matters already noted: its issuance of the Bond with limited (if any) background information, its conduct of standing by silently with the original unfiled Bond and premium in hand (but no file-stamped copies of <em>either </em>edition of the Bond) until a claim was made, and its decision not to participate in the surcharge proceeding notwithstanding its intention to use alleged defects in Bronson\u2019s appointment to deny its own liability under the Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In short, Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s conduct was markedly less culpable than Old Republic\u2019s in this matter. In any event, it does not justify releasing Old Republic from liability on the Bond it issued\u2014for consideration\u2014to guarantee the faithful performance of Bronson\u2019s obligations to the conservator-ship estate of Gerald O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">IV.

She contends the stay order is appealable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (b). Section 904.1, subdivision (b), relates to the appealability of sanction orders. An order staying a motion for judgment on a bond is not an appealable order under the Probate Code. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 2750.) The appeal from that order is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Although not expressly cited for the proposition, one case cited in the statement of decision contains dicta that action in excess of jurisdiction by a court that has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the estate is \u201cvoid.\u201d <em>(Estate of Strobeck </em>(1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 853, 860 [245 P.2d 317] <em>(Strobeck).) </em>Because the facts of <em>Strobeck </em>do not implicate any of the principles which could prevent a party from challenging court action in excess of jurisdiction, we view the <em>Strobeck </em>court\u2019s failure to distinguish between void and voidable actions as merely an oversight.

(Evid. Code, \u00a7 623.) The trial court found that Judith O\u2019Connor failed to establish her defense under that section. The court\u2019s findings are confusing because they do not articulate what statement or conduct by Old Republic it was referring to, or what \u201cparticular thing\u201d Judith O\u2019Connor was allegedly led to believe. In fact, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>no evidence in the record that Judith O\u2019Connor ever asserted section 623 of the Evidence Code as an affirmative defense in the first place. In any event, the issue we address and find dispositive in this case is not whether Old Republic misled Judith O\u2019Connor, but whether Old Republic can challenge the validity of the April 9 Order and Letters. For the reasons we discuss, we conclude that such a challenge is not permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Old Republic should have been concerned not only because the Bond was not filed but because the original instrument was returned to it. \u201cA bond given in an action or proceeding may be withdrawn from the file and returned to the principal on order of the court only if one of the following conditions is satisfied: [|Q (a) The beneficiary so stipulates. [JQ (b) The bond is no longer in force and effect and the time during which the liability on the bond may be enforced has expired.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 995.360.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Ironically, Old Republic contends that the fact the Bond was not filed distinguishes cases like <em>Mason </em>which estop sureties from denying the liability of their principals. Old Republic argues that, since the Bond was never filed, it was not used by Bronson to obtain the April 9 Order and, therefore, did not enable Bronson to embezzle funds from the conservatorship estate. Actually, the record is silent as to how, when, or if Bronson used the Bond to further his criminal purpose. It seems quite plausible, though, that Bronson may have obtained the Letters from Deputy Clerk Moran by showing her the Bond even though the Bond was never filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In any event, the fact that the Bond was never filed has little bearing on our estoppel analysis which properly focuses on <em>Old Republic\u2019s conduct </em>in this matter. Old Republic issued the Bond with limited background information and kept the Bond premium after learning the original Bond had not been filed. It was also content to keep its knowledge about the unfiled Bond to itself until it needed a justification for denying Judith O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim for payment under it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b514-10\">At oral argument before this court, Old Republic\u2019s counsel argued that <em>Estate of Davis, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 663 and section 996.440 of the Code of Civil Procedure give a surety the option to \u201celect\u201d not to participate in a surcharge proceeding and to thereby avoid being bound by the outcome of the surcharge action. This is simply not correct. Section 996.440 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not even address the preclusive effect of a surcharge order but, rather, gives the beneficiary the option to enforce liability on a bond by motion without the necessity of an independent action. And <em>Estate of Davis </em>holds that a surety may participate in a surcharge proceeding as an interested party <em>because, </em>among other things, <em>it is bound by the court\u2019s order.
