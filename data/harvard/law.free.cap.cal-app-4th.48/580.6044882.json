Her car is rear-ended. Although her seat belt remains fastened and does not break, her head strikes the steering wheel and she later mentions to a doctor that \u201cthe seat belt didn\u2019t hold [her].\u201d Within one year, she sues the driver of the other car and 20 Doe defendants. More than two years after the accident, she substitutes the manufacturer of her car for a Doe defendant and adds allegations that the seat belt was defective. The manufacturer cries foul, claiming the driver knew there was a problem with the seat belt and knew the identity of the manufacturer of her car, and thus was not \u201cignorant\u201d of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>identity within the meaning of section 474 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The driver disagrees, claiming the mere fact that the seat belt did not secure her tightly to the seat did not make her suspect that the belt\u2019s \u201ccomfort feature\u201d (which permits it to spool out when the driver leans forward) was defective in that it allowed \u201cthe inadvertent introduction of slack.\u201d The trial court agreed with the driver and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On November 5, 1992, Susanna Jeffrey\u2019s 1986 Chevrolet Blazer was rear-ended by a car driven by David Katsuro Akazawa. Jeffrey\u2019s face hit the steering wheel and she suffered facial injuries, including \u201ctraumatic brain injury,\u201d a broken nose and broken teeth. Jeffrey hired a lawyer (Philip Dunn) and he sent Jeffrey to Charles Furst, Ph.D. (a clinical neuropsychologist), for an evaluation. On April 27, 1993, Dr. Furst interviewed and examined Jeffrey, who told him that she had struck her nose and abdomen on the steering wheel because \u201cthe seat belt didn\u2019t hold [her]\u201d or because the \u201cseat belt failed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 6, Dr. Furst forwarded a report to Dunn, reciting Jeffrey\u2019s history and expressing his opinion of her condition. Included in Dr. Furst\u2019s description of the accident is this statement: \u201cShe was stopped on the freeway in traffic when she was rear-ended. She experienced whiplash and she struck her nose on the steering wheel, after her seat belt failed, and additionally she struck her abdomen on the wheel also.\u201d On October 7, Jeffrey sued Akazawa and Does 1 through 20, claiming damages for personal injuries and property damage caused by Akazawa\u2019s negligent driving.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In March 1995, following a non-binding arbitration award against Akazawa for more than $500,000, Dunn associated \u201cmore experienced\u201d counsel, John D. Rowell and his firm, Rowell &amp; Tessier. In April, Jeffrey filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>standard-form \u201cAmendment to Complaint\u201d adding General Motors Corporation as Doe 1. On May 19 (two and one-half years after the accident), Jeffrey filed a first amended complaint adding a products liability claim against GM, alleging that the Blazer\u2019s seat belt restraint system was defectively designed, and that GM knew it was defective but did nothing about it. A claim for punitive damages was also added.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In August, GM (then unaware of Dr. Burst\u2019s notes) moved to quash service of Jeffrey\u2019s first amended complaint on the ground that Jeffrey must have known she had a potential claim against GM when the original complaint was filed because \u201ca seat belt either restrains a person or it does not and this fact is known immediately after\u201d an automobile accident. Jeffrey opposed the motion, explaining in her declaration that although she obviously knew the name of the manufacturer of her car at the time she filed her original complaint, she \u201chad no knowledge of any defect in the vehicle or the seat belt system of the vehicle.\u201d Since that time, however, she \u201clearned that the injury [she] suffered was an injury which was most likely suffered as a result of a defect in the design of the seat belt.\u201d She learned of this defect when Rowell (her new attorney) explained it to her and identified a \u201cso-called \u2018comfort feature\u2019 in the seat belt\u201d which allows \u201cthe belt to remain in a spooled out position whenever a driver leans forward, for example, to adjust the radio or to turn on the ignition. Once the driver leans forward the belt will not retract into a snug position when the driver leans back.\u201d She had \u201cnever noticed this condition prior to discussing this matter\u201d with Rowell but, since that time, had become aware of it when she drove the Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Jeffrey\u2019s opposition was also supported by a declaration from Dunn explaining that he had examined the Blazer when he was first consulted by Jeffrey and that, to him, \u201cthere did not appear to be anything wrong with the passenger restraint system. Up until the time [he] discussed this matter with Mr. Rowell[, Dunn] was unaware of GM\u2019s \u2018comfort feature\u2019 and was completely unaware that this particular design could cause injuries such as occurred to Mrs. Jeffrey.\u201d A declaration by Rowell explained that he was involved in an unrelated matter involving \u201ca claim that the identical \u2018comfort feature\u2019 \u201d on a GM vehicle caused \u201chead injuries in a similar manner to the allegations in this case.\u201d He had conducted substantial discovery in the other case and had learned of eight additional \u201ccomfort feature\u201d cases pending against GM, all of which were subject to protective orders prohibiting disclosure of information about the alleged defects in GM\u2019s seat belt system. As a result, it \u201cwould be quite unusual for someone such as Mr. Dunn, who does not specialize in the products liability area, to have become aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the problems associated with the use of the \u2018comfort feature\u2019 design\u201d in Jeffrey\u2019s vehicle. Implicit in Rowell\u2019s declaration is the conclusion that the average driver would be totally unaware of this problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">GM\u2019s motion to quash was denied, the court finding that Jeffrey was \u201cnot aware of any defect, design or otherwise, in the . . . occupant restraint system.\u201d GM then answered and conducted discovery, at which time it learned of Dr. Furst\u2019s examination of Jeffrey and the note in Dr. Furst\u2019s file about the seat belt \u201cfailure.\u201d GM asked Rowell to dismiss Jeffrey\u2019s case against GM in exchange for a waiver of costs and a release of GM\u2019s malicious prosecution claims. When Rowell refused, GM moved for summary judgment, contending Jeffrey\u2019s claims were barred because, at the time she filed her original complaint, Jeffrey and Dunn knew there was a problem with the seat belt and knew the identity of the car\u2019s manufacturer, and thus Jeffrey was not ignorant of GM\u2019s identity within the meaning of section 474. GM supported its motion with Dr. Furst\u2019s deposition testimony, his handwritten notes, and his report to Dunn. Jeffrey opposed the motion, relying on the declarations she had filed in opposition to GM\u2019s motion to quash and contending, again, that she was ignorant within the meaning of section 474 because she did not know the seat belt system was defective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Jeffrey explained to the trial court, her claims against GM are not based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>allegation of a mechanical failure but rather on the allegedly defective design of the restraint system. The trial court denied GM\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">GM then filed a petition for a writ of mandate, asking us to compel the trial court to grant summary judgment and framing the issues as (1) whether a plaintiff may rely upon the subsequent association of more experienced counsel to bring in a new defendant under section 474 notwithstanding that \u201cthere has been no discovery of new facts\u201d as required by section 474; (2) whether \u201cthe inexperience and malpractice\u201d of Jeffrey\u2019s first lawyer, \u201cwho effectively violate[d] [his] ethical obligation to not take cases [he was] unqualified to handle,\u201d is a legally justifiable excuse to avoid the requirements of section 474;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) whether a Doe amendment can relate back to the date of the original complaint when it is \u201cadmittedly based upon the same basic facts (i.e. seat belt failure) which were admittedly known when the original complaint was filed.\u201d We issued an order to show cause, received opposition from Jeffrey, and heard argument (at which time we invited and later received further briefing). We now deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">When a lawsuit is first initiated after the applicable period of limitations has expired and the plaintiff is entitled to claim the benefit of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>delayed discovery rule (that is, when for one reason or another the plaintiff is granted an extended period within which to file suit), the relevant inquiry is what the plaintiff <em>knew or, through the exercise of due diligence, reasonably could have discovered </em>at an earlier date. (See part I, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">But where, as here, a lawsuit is initiated within the applicable period of limitations against someone (that is, almost anyone at all) and the plaintiff has complied with section 474 by alleging the existence of unknown additional defendants, the relevant inquiry when the plaintiff seeks to substitute a real defendant for one sued fictitiously is <em>what facts the plaintiff actually knew </em>at the time the original complaint was filed. (See part II, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In the trial court and here, GM talks in terms of what Jeffrey <em>should have known </em>at the time she filed her original complaint. As we will explain, that question is immaterial in this context and the only relevant inquiry is whether Jeffrey had actual knowledge of the basic facts giving rise to her claim against GM.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">I. <em>The Delayed Discovery Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We begin by stating the delayed discovery rule GM asks us to apply in this case. Where no one related to the same injury has been sued within the applicable period of limitations (for example, where the plaintiff knows she has a medical problem but does not know her condition was caused by a defective drug), the statute of limitations begins to run \u201cwhen the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to her.\u201d <em>(Jolly </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110 [751 P.2d 923, 245 Cal.Rptr. 658].) Stated otherwise, the limitations period begins once the plaintiff has notice or information of circumstances about her injury and its negligent cause such as would put a reasonable person on inquiry. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1109; <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Mofid, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at pp. 896-897; <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>South Hoover Hospital </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 93, 101 [132 Cal.Rptr. 657, 553 P.2d 1129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In the delayed discovery context, a \u201cplaintiff need not be aware of the specific \u2018facts\u2019 necessary to establish the claim; that is a process contemplated by pretrial discovery. <em>Once the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing, and therefore an incentive to sue, she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights. So long as a suspicion exists, it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts; she cannot wait for the facts to find her.\u201d (Jolly </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 1111, italics added; see also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bechtel Corp., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 875; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Hansen </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 972-973 [180 Cal.Rptr. 604] [if a plaintiff believes because of injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>she has suffered that someone has done something wrong, the statutory period begins].)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The problem with GM\u2019s reliance on these cases is that they have nothing to do with section 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II. <em>The Section 474 Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_-\">A. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Section 474 was enacted in 1872 to replace a virtually identical provision enacted in 1851 as section 69 of the Practice Act (Hogan, <em>California\u2019s Unique Doe Defendant Practice: A Fiction Stranger Than Truth </em>(1977) 30 Stan.L.Rev. 51, 57, fn. 18, henceforth cited as <em>Doe Defendant </em>Practice). As enacted, section 474 provided: \u201c \u2018When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of the defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint, and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Doe Defendant Practice, supra, </em>at p. 57, fn. 18; see also <em>Rosencrantz </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1871) 40 Cal. 489, 490-491, quoting section 69 of the Practice Act.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1953, an amendment added special notice requirements relevant only to default judgments (Stats. 1953, ch. 1244, \u00a7 1, p. 2807), and a 1955 amendment made the statute applicable to proceedings commenced by affidavit as well as those commenced by a complaint (Stats. 1955, ch. 886, \u00a7 1, p. 1516). There have been no other amendments, which means that, for our purposes, the statute is the same now as it was in 1851.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Today, it is generally understood that when a complaint sets forth a cause of action against a defendant designated by a fictitious name because the plaintiff is genuinely ignorant of his name or identity, and his true name thereafter is discovered and substituted by amendment, he is considered a party to the action from its commencement so that the statute of limitations stops running as of the date the original complaint was filed. <em>(Optical Surplus, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 776, 783 [279 Cal.Rptr. 194].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>B. <em>The Supreme Court\u2019s Early Views</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In 1871, the Supreme Court decided <em>Rosencrantz </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>40 Cal. 489. In <em>Rosencrantz, </em>four plaintiffs filed suit in 1868 for ejectment and for the recovery of a tract of land. They named several real defendants and also listed several others by fictitious names, including \u201cJames Blue.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 491.) At some later point (we are not told when), the plaintiffs served Arnold Fuller, the administrator of the estate of William Olds, as \u201cJames Blue\u201d but they did not \u201coffer\u201d to insert Fuller\u2019s name in the complaint as the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 492.) Fuller moved to set aside the summons and to have the case dismissed as to him, and the trial court granted his motion. The plaintiffs appealed but lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Supreme Court quoted section 69 of the Practice Act, then added: <em>\u201cThis ignorance of the name must, of course, be real, and not feigned; it must not be willful ignorance, or such as might be removed by mere inquiry or a resort to means of information easily accessible. </em>FJQ By Section 39 [of the Practice Act] it is provided that the complaint shall contain \u2018the name of the parties to the action, plaintiff and defendant,\u2019 and this is the general rule. By Section 69 a plaintiff who is unable to comply with this general rule in this respect, and therefore exposed to possible loss by the mere misfortune of <em>not knowing or being able to learn </em>the name of his intended adversary, is permitted to designate him for the time being by some fictitious name, upon condition, however, that as soon as he learns his true name he will conform to the general rule laid down in Section 39, by inserting it in the pleading. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cWe see no error in the action of the [trial court] in the respect complained of. <em>The premises had been so long, notoriously and uninterruptedly occupied by the Olds family, father, mother and children in succession, and their </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>tenants, that the plaintiffs must be held to have known who were the occupants, for it was easy for them to have done so. They were much less difficult of ascertainment than were the exterior lines of the tract sued for, and which are given in the complaint by calls and </em>distances.\u201d <em>(Rosencrantz </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>40 Cal. at pp. 492-493, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Fifteen years later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Carpentier </em>(1886) 70 Cal. 23 [11 P. 391], a quiet title action. In <em>Irving, </em>the plaintiff filed suit in February 1882 against several named defendants and others whose names he did not know, one of whom he designated as \u201cTom Jones.\u201d In February 1883, the plaintiff served the Pacific Improvement Company as the party originally identified as \u201cTom Jones.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 23.) Pacific moved to dismiss \u201con the ground that the plaintiff had notice at the time of the commencement of the action that [Pacific] claimed an interest in the premises in controversy . . .\u201d and submitted evidence that in February 1881, a deed transferring an \u201cundivided two-thirds part of the lands\u201d from one of the originally named defendants to Pacific \u201cwas recorded in the office of the county recorder\u201d where the land was located. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 24.) Thus, claimed Pacific, had the plaintiff \u201cexercised any care and diligence whatsoever in examining or searching the records of said county, he could and would have seen that the company claimed and held in fee-simple an undivided interest in said lands.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In opposition, the plaintiff swore that, at the time the original complaint was filed, he did not know that Pacific \u201cwas the name of the defendant that claimed an interest in the property; that he knew some one did, but did not know the name, and therefore sued by a fictitious name;\u201d that it was not until January 1883 that he learned that Pacific claimed an interest in the property; and that no person was in possession of the property when the action was brought. <em>(Irving </em>v. <em>Carpentier, supra, </em>70 Cal. at p. 24.) The trial court granted Pacific\u2019s motion, set aside the service of summons, and dismissed Pacific from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Supreme Court reversed. After noting that section 474 permits a plaintiff to sue a defendant by a fictitious name \u201c \u2018when the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant,\u2019 \u201d and that the plaintiff \u201cdid make the averment\u201d required by the statute, the court suggested the evidence of recordation merely showed that the plaintiff \u201cfailed to examine a certain book, which if he had examined would have afforded him some information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>His failure to examine tends to establish the fact of ignorance.\u201d <em>(Irving </em>v. <em>Carpentier, supra, </em>70 Cal. at p. 25.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cWe know of no law which makes it the duty of a plaintiff to examine the records of a county recorder\u2019s office to find out names of parties defendant, the neglect of which will subject him to have the service of his summons set aside and the cause dismissed as to a person sued by a fictitious name, whose real name he might have found out by examining the record of deeds of the county in which the land embraced in the action is situated, when he has made the averment in the complaint required by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\"><em>\u201cThe statute above referred to is an enabling one, and should be so construed as to cure the evil it was designed to correct and advance the remedy. Persons are sometimes compelled to bring suits in haste. They have not time to ascertain the true names of parties to be made defendants. </em>The statute of limitations may, in a day from the time the preparation of the complaint is commenced, effect a bar. Sometimes there is no means readily accessible of ascertaining the true names. The statute above referred to was enacted to afford a remedy in such cases. <em>Should a plaintiff lose his right to have his case tried because of ignorance of the names of parties whom he has a right to sue, and as to whom he may have a good cause of action? How is the party sued by a name not his own injured? He loses no right by allowing a plaintiff to proceed as provided by the statute. He has every opportunity accorded to any other defendant to make his defense. He can demur or file his answer, and set up every defense which he is advised he can rely on.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201c[Pacific] likens this case to that of a party allowed to bring an action for relief on the ground of fraud, in which case the cause of action is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the party aggrieved of the facts constituting the fraud. <em>In construing this rule, it has always been held that a party discovers the fraud when by the use of reasonable diligence he might have ascertained the facts constituting the fraud. But the rule prescribed by the statute in this case is entirely different. It is when he is actually ignorant of a certain fact, not when he might by the use of reasonable diligence have discovered it. Whether his ignorance is from misfortune or negligence, he is alike ignorant, and this is all the statute requires. This is the true meaning of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>the statute. We adopt it the more readily because the party thus brought in as a defendant loses no rights by it.\u201d (Irving </em>v. <em>Carpentier, supra, </em>70 Cal. at pp. 25-27, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Rosencrantz </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>40 Cal. 489, is summarily distinguished by the Supreme Court in <em>Irving, </em>on the ground that the <em>Rosencrantz </em>complaint did not contain the averment of ignorance required by the statute and on the additional ground that, in <em>Rosencrantz, </em>there was actual and continued occupancy by the persons claiming the land. <em>(Irving </em>v. <em>Carpentier, supra, </em>70 Cal. at p. 27.) Whatever the pleading problem might have been in <em>Rosencrantz, </em>it is clear that, by the time <em>Irving </em>was decided, the Supreme Court no longer cared for the language it had used in Rosencrantz\u2014that the \u201cignorance\u201d must not only be real and not feigned but must also not \u201cbe willful ignorance, or such as might be removed by mere inquiry or a resort to means of information easily accessible.\u201d <em>(Rosencrantz </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>40 Cal. at p. 491.) In our view, <em>Rosencrantz </em>suggests a duty of inquiry that is flatly rejected by <em>Irving. (Irving </em>v. <em>Carpentier, supra, </em>70 Cal. at pp. 25-26 [\u201c[wjhether his ignorance is from misfortune or negligence, he is alike ignorant, and this is all the statute requires\u201d].)

The former is one reason attorneys include general charging allegations against fictitiously named defendants; the latter requires substitution of the defendant\u2019s true name.

Two years and ten months later, the plaintiff amended his complaint to add the manufacturer of the door opener and allegations that the opener was defectively designed. Although the plaintiff knew the door had opened and knew it was radio-controlled, his amendment was proper because he \u201cdid not know at [the time he filed his original complaint] any facts which would indicate the possibility that the door openers were defectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>designed as <em>such flaw in design was not externally visible.\" (Id. </em>at p. 883, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In short, section 474 does not impose upon the plaintiff a duty to go in search of facts she does not actually have at the time she files her original pleading.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>(Munoz </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>supra, 91 Cal.App.3d at pp. 947-948 [\u201cthe interjection of a discovery standard into section 474 would lead to the harmful practice in all litigation of requiring that all persons who might conceivably have some connection with the lawsuit be specifically named in order to avoid the sanctions of the failure to comply with the inquiry requirements of section 474\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Construed in GM\u2019s favor, the evidence is that Jeffrey \u201cknew\u201d the seat belt \u201cfailed\u201d and \u201cknew\u201d she hit her head on the steering wheel. Construed in Jeffrey\u2019s favor, the evidence is that she gave no thought at all to the seat belt (except for her knowledge that she was wearing it at the time of the collision and that it did not break or come undone) but she did \u201cknow\u201d that her head hit the steering wheel. As noted above (fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>the focus on whether she knew the belt \u201cfailed\u201d is a red herring.

(BAJI No. 9.00.5; <em>Soule </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 560 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 882 P.2d 298].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\"><em>Third, </em>we consider the means by which Jeffrey would prove her products liability claim against GM. In this regard, the essence of GM\u2019s position is that \u201ca seat belt either restrains a person or it does not and this fact is known immediately after\u201d an automobile accident, an argument we understand to mean that the seat belt\u2019s alleged failure is a matter so \u201ccommonly understood\u201d by those who use it that a jury could decide this case without benefit of expert testimony. (Cf. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 413 [143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1]; <em>Soule </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 567.) We flatly reject GM\u2019s \u201ccommonly understood\u201d argument. Whatever merit there might be to GM\u2019s position in a case where a passenger is not wearing a seat belt <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 116, 118-119 [147 Cal.Rptr. 733]; <em>Twohig </em>v. <em>Briner </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1102, 1107 [214 Cal.Rptr. 729]), we cannot agree that it is \u201ccommonly understood\u201d that a driver wearing a seat belt will hit her head on the steering wheel when her car is rear-ended only if there was something wrong with the seat belt. To the contrary, we believe that where, as here, the alleged defect \u201cwas not externally visible\u201d <em>(Streicher </em>v. <em>Tommy\u2019s Electric Co., supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at p. 883), it cannot be said that Jeffrey had actual knowledge of any fact or circumstance suggesting a defect in the manner in which the belt was designed. (Cf. <em>Endicott </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 917, 926 [141 Cal.Rptr. 95, 9 A.L.R.4th 481]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Campbell </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 112, 124-125 [184 Cal.Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224] [suggesting the determination whether \u201ca seatbelt is helpful when a person is in a vehicle, which is moving at 40 miles per hour, and is involved in a serious collision\u201d requires expert testimony]; <em>Truman </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 976, 982 [80 Cal.Rptr. 373].) Whatever merit there may be to a claim that someone who is <em>not wearing </em>a seat belt knows, as a matter of \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d that her conduct contributed to her injuries, that is not what happened here. (See <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at pp. 118-119.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>GM\u2019s own expert has testified that a properly operating seat belt (one with \u201cno slack\u201d) would <em>not </em>have prevented Jeffrey from striking her head on the steering wheel. The way we understand the evidence in the record now before us, the purpose of a seat belt is to reduce (not eliminate) the number of accidents in which a driver\u2019s or passenger\u2019s head strikes the interior of the vehicle by reducing the speed of head travel and the corresponding severity of head impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Based upon the testimony of GM\u2019s expert and on our conclusion that such matters are not within the average driver\u2019s \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d we hold that a driver who is injured in an automobile accident when she is wearing a seat belt which appears to the naked eye to have operated in its intended fashion does not know the basic facts she needs to plead a products liability claim against the manufacturer of the seat belt. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (g) [judicial notice may be taken only of those \u201c[f]acts and propositions that are of such common knowledge within the territorial jurisdiction of the court that they cannot reasonably be the subject of dispute\u201d]; <em>Dieckmann </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d at p. 362 [plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of (a) the identity of a truck\u2019s manufacturer and (b) the fact that, for no apparent reason, the truck\u2019s driveshaft dislodged while the truck was moving does not constitute sufficient cause to require plaintiff to sue the truck\u2019s manufacturer in his original complaint].) It follows that when she subsequently learns that the seat belt may have been defectively designed, she is entitled to claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>benefits of section 474. <em>(Breceda </em>v. <em>Gamsby, supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d at p. 179.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The orders to show cause are discharged and the petitions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">Spencer, P.

As he explained, he uses quotation marks when he is quoting a patient verbatim, and the comment in his notes about the seat belt is not in quotes. As he also explained, there is a possibility that Ron Jeffrey (Mrs. Jeffrey\u2019s husband, who was also interviewed by Dr. Furst but was not in the examining room when he interviewed Mrs. Jeffrey) was the one who mentioned the seat belt (although he probably would have noted it in his file if the information came from someone other than Jeffrey).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Ron Jeffrey was also named as a plaintiff and he alleged a separate loss of consortium claim.

[GM] has never publicized this design problem with this system, nor did it ever recall the vehicle or request that owners, such as [Jeffrey], modify or change the belt. However, the comfort feature was removed from the design of subsequent models.\u201d Another time, Rowell described it this way: \u201cGM manufactured a vehicle which contained a passenger restraint system which allowed the inadvertent introduction of slack into the shoulder harness, and which, as a result of the design of the seat (which, during the course of the rear-end impact first loaded and then unloaded, causing a \u2018diving board\u2019 effect, propelling the torso and head forward and around the restrained lap area), allowed the acceleration and rotation of [Jeffrey\u2019s] head to levels which can and do result in brain damage and cognitive deficits.\u201d It appears to us that the (alleged) problem is this: When the driver gets into the car, slack is present in the shoulder belt due to the absence of an automatic cancellation feature (the purpose of which is to automatically cancel whatever slack was in the belt before the driver entered the car). When the driver buckles herself into her seat, her movement causes the \u201cwindowshade\u201d (comfort feature) to inadvertently set excess slack. Upon impact, the driver\u2019s upper torso is flung forward and the shoulder belt retractor fails to timely lock up, causing additional seat belt webbing to extend and cause more forward movement to the driver\u2019s head. We emphasize that these are allegations, not established facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Jeffrey did not file a supplemental declaration denying that she said anything to Dr. Furst about the seat belt. Previously, however, she had (under oath) denied GM\u2019s request for an admission that she told Dr. Furst that the seat belt had not held her, and that denial was included in GM\u2019s moving papers. The bottom line is that Jeffrey flatly denies saying anything at all to Dr. Furst about the seat belt. For purposes of this opinion, however, we are assuming that she <em>did </em>say something to the effect that the shoulder strap did not hold her as tight as she would have thought it would. Otherwise, as Jeffrey pointed out in the trial court, the dispute about that foundational fact would by itself mean GM was not entitled to summary judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(\u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) Given the facts of this case (a low to medium speed rear-end impact and a seat belt that did not break or come undone), we do not believe much is added by Jeffrey\u2019s alleged statement to Dr. Furst. In our view, the issue is whether a driver who is dutifully wearing a seat belt and nevertheless strikes her head against the steering wheel is to be charged with actual knowledge of the basic facts of a products liability claim based on a latent defect in the design of the restraint system. Whether she stated her subjective belief is immaterial, as is the fact that she might have been suspicious. (Ft. II.D., <em>post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b347-13\">GM contends Jeffrey\u2019s declaration denying any knowledge of a problem with the seat belt contradicted her prior admission (the reference is to her statements to Dr. Furst) and thus should be ignored. GM is mistaken. All the cases GM relies on deal with a subsequent declaration attempting to contradict prior <em>testimony or a prior statement under oath, </em>and they have nothing to do with a declaration contradicting a doctor\u2019s vague memory about where he got information contained in his notes. (E.g., <em>Preach </em>v. <em>Monter Rainbow </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1451 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 320].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\">This pejorative attack on Dunn is uncalled for. We find nothing in the record contradicting Rowell\u2019s assertion that the alleged defects in GM\u2019s seat belt system are known to only a few lawyers. It is one thing to state the well established rule that an attorney\u2019s mistake about the statute of limitations will not save his client\u2019s case <em>(Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Mofid </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 892, 898 [218 Cal.Rptr. 313, 705 P.2d 886]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bechtel Corp. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 868, 875 [191 Cal.Rptr. 619, 663 P.2d 177]), quite another to launch an ad hominem attack accusing an attorney of malpractice or unethical conduct by not knowing that which is unknowable by reason of protective orders obtained by GM. In a duty to discover case, there might be an argument that, upon receipt of Dr. Furst\u2019s report and its mention of the seat belt, Dunn should have retained an expert to examine the seat belt. Since this is <em>not </em>such a case, we will have no more to say about this purported issue. As we view this case, the only issue is whether, at the time she filed her original complaint, Jeffrey was ignorant of the facts giving her a cause of action against GM.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Section 69 of the Practice Act provided: \u201c \u2018When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name; and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Doe Defendant Practice, supra, </em>p. 57, fn. 18.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Although it may appear at first blush that section 474 gives a plaintiff greater rights than she would have if, in the first instance, she had failed to sue anyone, that is not necessarily so. A plaintiff who defers suit altogether may (under certain circumstances and subject to various outside limitations imposed by statute) wait years after the causative event to initiate her litigation. (See e.g., <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Fife </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 760, 768 [255 Cal.Rptr. 440].) In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>section 474 context, however, once <em>one </em>defendant is sued, <em>all </em>fictitiously named defendants must be brought in within a maximum period of three years\u2014because summons must be returned within three years of its issuance. (\u00a7 583.210.) Moreover, as a result of various trial delay reduction programs and their enabling rules (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68600 et seq.; Super. Ct. Los Angeles County Rules, rule 7.0 et seq. [Court Rules Service (Daily J. Co.)]), the traditional three-year period of section 583.210 is little more than a fading memory\u2014under current rules of practice, the plaintiff must return summons and dismiss all fictitiously served defendants within six months to one year (or at least show good cause why a little more time ought to be allowed to locate another defendant). As a practical matter, therefore, section 474 gives the plaintiff about one extra year, not the unlimited open-ended period of time GM (and the defendants in the reported cases) seem to think is an eternity or longer.

This is so, according to GM, because a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action may be charged with knowledge for section 474 purposes notwithstanding the need for expert testimony to prove professional negligence. <em>(Dover </em>v. <em>Sadowinski, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d 113; <em>Hazel </em>v. <em>Hewlett, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d 1458; <em>Scherer </em>v. <em>Mark, supra, 64 </em>Cal.App.3d 834.) The medical malpractice cases in which a plaintiff has been charged with knowledge of facts sufficient to defeat reliance on section 474 all involve facts akin to the no-seat-belt cases (a patent problem), not this case (a latent problem).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">While this writ petition was pending (and no stay was in effect), GM moved for summary judgment on a different ground\u2014that section 474 does not apply because the claim against it involves a different instrumentality (Jeffrey\u2019s car) than the original complaint (the car that hit her). That motion was denied and GM filed another petition for a writ of mandate. To avoid confusion, we issued an order to show cause and consolidated GM\u2019s petitions. We do not reach the merits of the second petition and dismiss the order to show cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
