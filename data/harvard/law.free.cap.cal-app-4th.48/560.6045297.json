Boctor, appeals from the judgment of the superior court denying his petition for writ of mandate to compel the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to vacate his decision demoting Boctor from his position as a manager of vehicle operations to bus operator. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Boctor\u2019s contentions the MTA\u2019s CEO lacked the authority to reject the hearing officer\u2019s findings and recommendations, and the CEO\u2019s final opinion failed to meet jurisdictional procedural requirements, are without merit. Also without merit is his assertion the trial court committed prejudicial error by applying an improper standard when reviewing the MTA\u2019s decision. Our review of the record indicates the trial court properly and independently judged the evidence and found the MTA\u2019s findings to be supported by the weight of the evidence. Finally, we conclude the MTA\u2019s CEO properly exercised his discretion when he imposed a penalty more serious than that recommended by the hearing officer. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">On September 6, 1991, Boctor was employed as a vehicle operations manager for the Southern California Rapid Transit District.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During a meeting held that day, Louise Bumes, one of Boctor\u2019s subordinate employees, alleged Boctor had engaged in improper behavior by using profanity in the presence of bus drivers, subordinates and other employees, and by sexually harassing her. In particular, Bumes stated that on one occasion, in the presence of other employees, Boctor entered the room, greeted Bumes by kissing her on the hand, then told her, \u201cYou know, I woke up at 1:00 this morning wondering what you were doing.\u201d Boctor\u2019s comment made Bumes and the other employees very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On another occasion, Boctor, Bumes and another employee, Fausto Brito, were out in the field at the comer of Pico Boulevard and Flower Street. When Bumes informed Boctor she was applying for a \u201csenior position,\u201d Boctor replied, \u201cMaybe Brito will be senior, but not you. . . .You have to go to lunch with me if you want to be a senior.\u201d When Bumes told Boctor she did not go out with persons she worked with, Boctor replied, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m too ugly? . . . What if I told you you\u2019d be fired if you didn\u2019t go out with me?\u201d A short time later, Boctor told Bumes the \u201cmeasurements he liked,\u201d then asked Bumes to ask a blonde woman if she would go out with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">At other times, Boctor had interfered with Bumes\u2019s work in the field and acted in an unprofessional manner to members of the public and bus patrons. During one incident, Boctor, addressing a member of the public, said, \u201cThe next time you see a Godamn [MTA] bus, you\u2019re not going to try to ma[ke] a right in front of it, huh?\u201d On another occasion, when a bus patron approached Boctor with a complaint about the irregularity of service, he replied, \u201cSo what.... Why don\u2019t you catch the train?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">After listening to Bumes\u2019s allegations, Boctor rose to his feet, loudly interrupted her and stated, \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here listening to this shit without saying a word! It\u2019s all bullshit! \u201cWhen the acting assistant director of transportation, Daniel Ibarra, told Boctor to sit down, Boctor replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry man, but I just can\u2019t sit here listening to this bullshit any longer! She\u2019s a damn liar! It\u2019s all bullshit!\u201d When Bumes then became upset, rose to her feet and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that,\u201d Boctor told her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u201cShut up,\u201d took a step toward her and, while making a gesture toward her said, \u201cMy ass.\u201d Boctor then left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In view of Bumes\u2019s allegations, Ibarra conducted further investigation. Ibarra interviewed Fausto Brito, who both Boctor and Bumes stated had witnessed the incident during which Boctor allegedly told Bumes she would not be promoted. Brito corroborated Bumes\u2019s statements and indicated Boctor had \u201csaid those things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Ibarra also interviewed an employee, Willem Siedenburg, who Bumes stated witnessed Boctor kissing her on the hand. Siedenburg, however, denied any knowledge of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">When Ibarra interviewed Clayton Flournoy, a supervisor who Boctor had indicated witnessed the incident during which he allegedly used vulgar language while speaking with a bus patron, Flournoy stated he had no knowledge of the incident and denied being present. Flournoy, however, indicated he had heard mmors of Boctor\u2019s \u201cadvances toward two other supervisors in the work group: Veray Smith and Cynthia Garrett.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Smith told Ibarra, although Boctor had not made sexual advances toward her, she had witnessed him using vulgar language on several occasions. On one such occasion, Boctor arrived at the scene of a traffic accident involving a bus and yelled out to several bystanders, \u201cGet your motherfucking asses out of the street!\u201d Smith indicated such conduct was \u201ccommonplace\u201d for Boctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Cynthia Garrett, who had been recently appointed a supervisor, stated Boctor had, for a period of years, repeatedly harassed her sexually. Garrett indicated Boctor had repeatedly asked her out on \u201cdates,\u201d and had invited her to his house to \u201cgo swimming\u201d after indicating he and his wife had an \u201cunderstanding.\u201d During another incident, Boctor offered Garrett a banana and, in a lewd manner, said, \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you. I want you to have this big, long banana.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When her polite refusals of Boctor\u2019s advances proved ineffective, Garrett decided to have nothing to do with Boctor and told him that she thought his \u201cmouth [was] filthy.\u201d Garrett indicated that at times Boctor\u2019s conduct was so offensive she \u201cdreaded coming to work.\u201d In addition, Garrett was convinced that when she applied for a senior position, Boctor, who helped grade the written portion of the relevant examinations, intentionally failed her in retaliation for her refusal of his advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Ibarra also interviewed employee Frances Williams. Williams stated that on July 15, 1990, Boctor, while on assignment at the Pico passenger station, approached her and asked her to meet him at the Biltmore Hotel for a drink. Williams initially refused the invitation, but decided to accept when Boctor told her that he wished to discuss company business. At the bar, Boctor told Williams, \u201cI want you to go to bed with me.\u201d At a later date, when Williams was considering applying for a senior position, Boctor told her, \u201cI could probably help you with that.\u201d Williams declined Boctor\u2019s offer of help and he asked her to \u201creconsider.\u201d After Williams declined Boctor\u2019s repeated offers of assistance, he told her, \u201cDon\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t get it.\u201d Williams stated she believed Boctor\u2019s offers of help were actually offers to trade sexual favors for special consideration in the selection process, and that her failure to pass the written test could be attributed to Boctor\u2019s retaliation for her refusal of his advances. Although Williams had previously passed a written test of a \u201chigher grade,\u201d she chose not to apply for a promotion during a later recruitment period because she feared Boctor\u2019s influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In a letter dated October 9, 1991, Ibarra informed Boctor of his findings and indicated a formal review of his conduct would be held on October 17, 1991. Ibarra stated the charges against Boctor were: \u201c1. Conduct unbecoming a manager, and [&lt;30 2. Violation of the District\u2019s Sexual Harassment Policy.\u201d Finally, Ibarra informed Boctor the formal review procedure could result in \u201cdisciplinary action in the form of suspension, demotion, or discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In a letter dated November 12, 1991, Ibarra informed Boctor that as a result of the hearings held on October 17 and 22, 1991, he was being demoted from his position as a vehicle operations manager to the position of bus operator. Ibarra indicated the action was being taken because Boctor had committed conduct unbecoming a manager and violated the MTA\u2019s sexual harassment policy. In support of this decision, Ibarra cited the evidence already reviewed, as well as some additional evidence. Ibarra noted testimony regarding an incident during which Boctor had invited a female employee, Hope Powell, to get into an elevator with him. When Powell refused, Boctor had called her a \u201cchicken shit.\u201d On a different occasion, two male employees witnessed Boctor make what they considered to be an offensive comment to a female employee. After observing that the female employee was wearing a knee brace, Boctor addressed her and made a comment about \u201cgetting down on her knees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Ibarra also referred to incidents he himself had witnessed. On one occasion, Ibarra saw Boctor approach a female employee from behind, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>give her a \u201cbear hug\u201d as she attempted to leave. When Doctor released the employee, she looked startled and embarrassed, then quickly left the room. Ibarra confronted Doctor about the impropriety of his behavior and Doctor replied, \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t have any sex appeal.\u201d On another occasion, Ibarra entered Doctor\u2019s office to find Doctor with another employee, Regina Sells. Doctor held up a sign with geometric letters on it and asked Ibarra to read them. After a moment, Ibarra realized the sign said, \u201cEat More Pussy.\u201d Defore leaving the office, Sells shook her head and told Ibarra, \u201cSee what I have to put up with.\u201d When Ibarra told Doctor his behavior was not appropriate, Doctor simply stated Sells knew he was joking.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Ibarra noted Doctor had called a total of 29 character witnesses, 9 of whom testified. However Ibarra also noted that none of the witnesses called were familiar with the charges alleged or had been present at any of the alleged incidents. Under these circumstances, Ibarra concluded the witnesses\u2019 testimony \u201crelating to [Doctor\u2019s] general character and deportment had no relevance [to] the specific charges . . . .\u201d In addition, Ibarra recognized that at least one witness called by Doctor had objected to testifying. Employee Joan McCormack, who worked in the customer relations department, had contacted Ibarra to ensure that she would not be listed as a witness to testify in Doctor\u2019s favor. McCormack told Ibarra that Doctor had made repeated \u201cadvances\u201d toward her, and that he \u201croutinely made unwelcomed and improperly \u2018flirtatious and suggestive\u2019 comments.\u201d McCormack stated that on numerous occasions Doctor had asked her out for dates, and that on one occasion he asked her to accompany him on a trip to San Felipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Finally, Ibarra noted Doctor\u2019s own testimony was incredible. Ibarra found both Doctor\u2019s denials and his explanations of events implausible. Ibarra concluded Doctor had repeatedly engaged in conduct unbecoming a manager and in violation of the district\u2019s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Doctor, pursuant to MTA policy, appealed Ibarra\u2019s decision by filing a formal \u201cgrievance.\u201d Evidentiary hearings, during which Doctor was represented by an attorney, were held on May 11, 17 and 21, and July 7, 1993, before hearing officer Sara Adler. After hearing the testimony of numerous witnesses, Adler, in a report dated December 13, 1993, addressed many of the specific instances alleged against Doctor. With regard to the September 6, 1991, meeting with Louise Dumes, Adler concluded Doctor\u2019s actions, although unprofessional, had not been \u201cthreatening.\u201d As to Doctor\u2019s use of vulgar language with employees and private citizens, Adler found the evidence of many of the incidents had not been specific as to place and time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>and that such evidence was not \u201cworthy of any weight to support the charge[s].\u201d Adler also concluded Boctor\u2019s use of vulgar language was mitigated in that it appeared he used it only in response to \u201cconditions of personal and situational stress.\u201d Finally, Adler noted the MTA had no \u201cpolicy\u201d prohibiting the use of such language and, in the absence of such a policy, the use of profane or objectionable language did not constitute a disciplinable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As to the charges of sexual harassment, Adler addressed Williams\u2019s allegation Boctor asked her to meet him for a drink at the Biltmore. Recognizing Williams testified she had met Boctor at the bar at approximately 9:45 in the evening, Adler noted a witness called by Boctor, Armando Caceres, testified that on the same evening he saw Boctor driving on the 60 Freeway \u201csometime\u201d after 8:30 p.m. In addition, Ibarra testified that, on the same evening, Boctor had \u201csigned out\u201d from his work station at 10 p.m. Adler concluded that, in view of the conflicting evidence, Boctor \u201ccould not have been at the Biltmore bar [at the time] Williams [said] she was there with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In conclusion, Adler indicated the sexual harassment charges, which were the more serious allegations, were not supported by the evidence. Accordingly, Adler made the following recommendation: \u201cThe reduction of Alfred F. Boctor was without cause and ... the discipline imposed should instead be a 30-day suspension combined with a requirement that Mr. Boctor attend appropriate workplace training classes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">On April 25, 1994, Franklin E. White, the CEO of the MTA, issued the MTA\u2019s final opinion and decision in Boctor\u2019s grievance proceeding. After reviewing the appropriate records, White rejected Adler\u2019s recommendation. White indicated he \u201cassigned] different weight to the evidence presented at the hearing since [he] believe[d] that there were credibility problems with certain testimony due to [Boctor\u2019s] close relationship with or influential position over witnesses, that the hearing officer relied on the testimony of a witness who contradicted his previous testimony[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and that [Boctor had shown] a continuous and uncorrected pattern in the workplace of not only sexual harassment, but also harassment based on sex discrimination.\u201d In addition, White indicated he was rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s opinion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>recommendation because . . they fail[ed] to sufficiently recognize: (1) that there are serious legal consequences for an employer if sexual harassment is allowed to continue in the workplace ... (2) that sexual harassment is viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person of the same sex as the harassed employee . . . and (3) that the impact of separate incidents can satisfy the legal definition of an abusive working environment even if no single episode crosses the Title VII threshold . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">On July 5, 1994, Boctor filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court pursuant to Code of Civil procedure section 1094.5, requesting the court to direct White and the MTA to set aside the April 25, 1994, decision, to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations, and to reinstate Boctor to his position of manager of vehicle operations. In a decision entered April 24, 1995, the trial court denied Boctor\u2019s petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Boctor contends: (1) the MTA\u2019s CEO lacked the authority to reject the hearing officer\u2019s findings and recommendations; (2) the CEO\u2019s final opinion is not binding because it failed to meet jurisdictional procedural requirements; (3) the trial court committed prejudicial error by applying the wrong standard when reviewing the MTA\u2019s decision; and, (4) the MTA\u2019s CEO abused his discretion when he imposed a penalty considerably more serious than that recommended by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">1. <em>The MTA\u2019s CEO acted within his proper authority when he rejected the hearing officer\u2019s jindings and recommendations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Boctor contends White lacked the authority to reject the hearing officer\u2019s findings and decision. He urges MTA procedures regarding non-contract employees, governed by its human resources policy manual, are improper since the manual was unilaterally instituted by MTA (it does not embody a \u201cbargained for\u201d policy), and its provision allowing the CEO to reject the decision of its hearing officer allows the MTA to, in effect, appeal unfavorable rulings to itself. In support of his contention, Boctor cites <em>Cohan </em>v. <em>City of Thousand Oaks </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 547 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 782].</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">In <em>Cohan, supra, </em>after a city planning commission approved a developer\u2019s proposed subdivision and development plan, the city council, acting as an entity, appealed the approval to itself. After a public hearing, which failed to meet requirements of procedural due process, the city council overruled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>planning commission\u2019s decision. The court determined the city council\u2019s decision was improper since the city council, acting as a body, acted in an \u201carbitrary and high-handed\u201d manner when it appealed to itself to make sure the planning commission\u2019s decision did not go unchallenged. (30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Here, the MTA was not appealing the ruling of a subordinate agency to itself. Instead, the MTA simply followed the formal hearing procedures articulated in its human resources policy manual, which, with regard to the final disposition of a grievance proceeding, specifically states that \u201c[t]he report of the . . . hearing officer is advisory only. After returning the report and recommendations, the General Manager [or chief executive officer] shall decide the case and shall notify the grievant in writing of his decision and the basis thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In the present case, after the hearing officer made her findings and recommendations, her report was forwarded to the CEO for final disposition. The CEO was not required to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s findings. Moreover, as we explain more fully below, since the CEO\u2019s opinion is supported by the evidence, we cannot conclude he acted in an arbitrary or high-handed manner when he rejected the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">2. <em>The CEO\u2019s final opinion properly met jurisdictional and procedural requirements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Boctor contends the CEO\u2019s final opinion is not binding because it fails to meet jurisdictional procedural requirements set forth in Government Code section 11517. Boctor urges that, in filing his opinion the CEO failed to meet required time limits, and that the CEO failed to provide him the required opportunity to present additional oral or written argument before rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Government Code section 11517, subdivision (d) provides that \u201c[a] proposed decision shall be deemed adopted by [an] agency 100 days after delivery to the agency . . . unless within that time ... the agency . . . commences proceedings to decide the case upon the record, . . . or . . . the agency refers the case to the administrative law judge to take additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>evidence.\u201d Boctor urges, under the provisions of this section, the hearing officer\u2019s findings and recommendation, filed December 13, 1993, became final and binding since the CEO\u2019s final opinion was not filed until more than 100 days later, on April 25, 1994. In addition, Boctor urges the CEO\u2019s opinion is improper and not binding since the CEO failed to provide Boctor with the opportunity to present additional argument before rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation as required by Government Code section 11517, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Boctor\u2019s contentions fail. Government Code section 11500, subdivision (a) states the term \u201cagency,\u201d as used in section 11517, \u201cincludes the state boards, commissions, and officers ... to which this chapter is made applicable by law . . . .\u201d Section 11501 lists numerous state agencies, but fails to list the MTA or any other municipal or local entity. In addition, nothing in the legislation enabling the MTA to operate indicates it is bound by Government Code section 11500 and its related provisions. (See Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 130051.11, subd. (a), 130051.12, subd. (a), 130051.13, 130051.15; see also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Humboldt County Board of Supervisors </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 877, 883 [34 Cal.Rptr. 232] [In general, the Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11500 et seq.) does not apply to local agencies.].) Under these circumstances, the provisions of section 11517 do not apply to Boctor\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In addition, we cannot conclude the MTA\u2019s procedures, which allow the CEO to reject the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation without providing the employee an additional opportunity to present oral or written argument, violate fundamental notions of due process. \u201c \u2018 \u201cDue process requires a fair trial before an impartial tribunal and that requires that the person or body who decides the case must know the evidence [and the arguments], but due process is not interested in mere technical formalism. It is the substance that is determinative of whether\u201d \u2019 an administrative procedure affords due process. [Citation.] Accordingly, \u2018. . . participation in a decision by a [CEO] who has read and considered the evidence, or a transcript thereof, even though he was not physically present when the evidence was produced, does not violate the requirements of due process.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bockover </em>v. <em>Perko </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 479, 487-488 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Nor does the alleged \u201c \u2018advisory\u2019 nature of the hearing body\u2019s decision render the grievance procedure inadequate.\u201d (28 Cal.App.4th at p. 487.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>fact that the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation regarding Boctor was only advisory merely emphasizes the point that the CEO was not bound by the decision. In so holding, however, we must emphasize that while the CEO may properly reject the advisory decision of the hearing officer, this action must not be arbitrary or capricious. It may only be done after the grievant has been afforded adequate due process at the administrative hearing and then only if the decisionmaking tribunal, the CEO in this case, bases the rejection on a proper review of an appropriate record of the proceedings before the lower administrative tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In the present case, the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation was advisory only. Our review of the record indicates the CEO rejected the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation only after reviewing the appropriate record, which included both the evidence and arguments presented during the four days of evidentiary hearings and prior proceedings. Under these circumstances, we conclude the procedures provided were fair, and the MTA\u2019s refusal to afford Boctor the opportunity to present additional argument before the CEO did not deny him due process of law. (See <em>Bockover </em>v. Perko, <em>supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at pp. 487-488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">3. <em>Review of the record indicates the trial court applied the proper standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>Court applied the weight of the evidence test.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Boctor contends the trial court committed prejudicial error by reviewing the MTA\u2019s findings under the wrong standard. He urges the trial court improperly reviewed the MTA\u2019s findings under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test, when it should have considered whether they were supported by the \u201cweight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">\u201cIf [an] order or decision of [an] agency substantially affects a fundamental vested right, the trial court, in determining under section 1094.5 whether there has been an abuse of discretion because the findings are not supported by the evidence, must exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and find an abuse of discretion if the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence. If, on the other hand, the order or decision does not substantially affect a fundamental vested right, the trial court\u2019s inquiry will be limited to a determination of whether or not the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.\u201d <em>(Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29].) It has been previously held that \u201c[discipline imposed on [public] employees affects their fundamental vested right in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>employment.\u201d <em>(McMillen </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 125, 129 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 548]; <em>Schmitt </em>v. <em>City of Rialto </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 494, 500 [210 Cal.Rptr. 788].) Accordingly, the superior court was required to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and find an abuse of discretion if the MTA\u2019s findings of Doctor\u2019s misconduct were not supported by the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In its statement of decision, the trial court indicated \u201c[a] principle controverted issue at the hearing on the petition was whether the court should apply the independent judgment test or the substantial evidence test. [\u2018jQ The court has determined that the proper standard of review in this case is the substantial evidence test. The record shows substantial evidence to uphold the administrative decision in this case.\u201d However, the court also stated that \u201c[a] principal controverted issue at the hearing on the petition was whether [MTA\u2019s] decision of April 25, 1994 was supported by the weight of the evidence. The court has determined that findings made by respondent are supported by the weight of the evidence. The court has determined the following: <em>[% </em>a. Respondent\u2019s Finding No. 1 that petitioner conducted himself [in a manner] unbecoming to a manager is supported by the following evidence: [*}[] On more than several occasions, petitioner, a senior manager, conducted himself in an unprofessional and inexcusable manner. These occasions included petitioner\u2019s using foul language, sexual banter and sexual innuendoes inappropriate to the workplace. [H b. Respondent\u2019s Finding No. 2 that petitioner sexually harassed subordinate employees is supported by the following evidence^] [f] Complaints of sexual harassment against petitioner were substantiated. There are specific instances where petitioner clearly created a hostile environment. Petitioner\u2019s demotion resulted after repeated warnings to conduct himself appropriately. [*][] Petitioner was aware of the MTA Sexual Harassment Policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Although there appears to have been some confusion on the part of the trial court, on this record we can conclude that in determining the MTA properly exercised its discretion in finding Doctor committed misconduct, the trial court independently judged the evidence and specifically found the MTA\u2019s findings to be supported by the weight of the evidence. The trial court\u2019s findings in this regard are specific and clear. Thus, the trial court\u2019s error in <em>stating </em>that the standard of review was that of substantial evidence was harmless. It is clear the trial court, for the purpose of these findings, <em>applied </em>the \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>4. <em>The MTA\u2019s CEO properly exercised his discretion in imposing a penalty more severe than that proposed by the hearing officer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Boctor asserts the MTA\u2019s CEO abused his discretion when he imposed punishment considerably more serious than that recommended by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he penalty imposed by an administrative body will not be disturbed in mandamus proceedings unless an abuse of discretion is demonstrated.

He asserts other employees charged with unprofessional conduct and sexual harassment have been suspended for 30-day periods and ordered to attend counseling. However, Boctor has failed to provide evidence of the facts of these cases, other than to state that one of them involved \u201cdirect\u201d physical contact. It is Boctor\u2019s burden to show that he received disparate, excessive punishment and, on the record presented, we cannot conclude he was treated more harshly than other, similarly situated, employees. (See <em>Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 17, 25 [190 Cal.Rptr. 744].)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Boctor asserts the CEO, in rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation that he be suspended for 30 days, inappropriately considered the \u201cserious legal consequences for an employer if sexual harassment is allowed to continue in the workplace.\u201d The assertion is without merit. The MTA \u201c. . . did not act improperly in considering the potential legal liability of the [agency] for [Boctor\u2019s] acts or . . . possible future acts .... In determining whether a penalty imposed on a [public] employee is appropriate, the overriding consideration is the actual or potential harm to the public service.

With regard to the finding Doctor sexually harassed subordinate employees the evidence substantially supports the trial court\u2019s finding Doctor\u2019s conduct amounted to, not mere occasional isolated incidents, but improper harassment of particular employees and the creation of a hostile work environment.
